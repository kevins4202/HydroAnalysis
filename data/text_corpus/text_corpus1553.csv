7765,the study investigated potential sites for the development of small hydropower systems shp to augment the existing energy supply in the udrb remote sensing and the soil and water assessment tool swat were employed to generate and simulate basin parameters for the hydropower analysis the energy potential of suitable sites was evaluated using flow duration curves fdc and power duration curves pdc results indicate that the upper drb has potential for small hydropower development with nine sites along the river having an estimated combined firm power of 7 89 mw the highest hydropower potential sites were located at hp1 hp7 and hp4 with corresponding firm energies of 13 39 gwh 7 94 gwh and 6 83 gwh and estimated annual energy production of 28 68 gwh 14 36 gwh and 12 68 gwh respectively given the adequate spacing distance between sites hp1 and hp4 11 38 km and hp4 and hp7 11 31 km with a combined annual energy production of 55 72 gwh a cascade hydropower arrangement of sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 is recommended along the upper section of the densu river however based on the analysis these hydropower sites could be developed as a cascade storage hydropower with a 50 or 75 dependability with an installed francis turbine graphical abstract ga1 keywords densu river basin energy flow duration curve hydropower power duration curve swat data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an essential resource in energy production agriculture manufacturing residential recreational and environmental activities winter et al 1998 all civilizations require energy services for basic human requirements such as lighting cooking and communication as well as to serve as generative processes owusu et al 2016 over 1 4 billion people throughout the world lack access to electricity with 85 of them living in rural areas kaygusuz 2012 according to kaygusuz 2012 the number of the rural population using biomass for energy is expected to increase from 2 7 billion in 2011 2 8 billion by 2030 an increase in biomass consumption will contribute to deforestation inhibition of the efforts of carbon sinks and sequestration and devastations in ecosystem functions and services gorte 2009 in view of this there is a need to further explore viable alternatives for sustainable rural energy sources hydropower generation remains one of the oldest and most reliable sources of renewable energy generation patil et al 2013 that can support the energy demands in scattered settlements hydropower remains the backbone of the energy economy in many nations including china india and brazil because of its cheapest energy generation option despite the many competing renewable energy sources hydropower contributed the most to the world s electricity output in 2014 16 6 as compared to other renewable energies 22 8 with 1055 gw of global producing capacity galán et al 2015 hydropower projects are characterized in a variety of ways their size big medium small and mini scale function single or multi use and how receiving river flows are regulated to produce electricity the impact of small hydropower potential shp development on global electricity capacity is comparable to other sources of energy 1 2 of total capacity with around 47 gw 53 of this potential being in developing nations yüksel 2007 shp systems are primarily run of the river with no or little reservoir impoundment and rely on the natural flow of the river because large scale hydropower projects require a significant amount of capital the development of shps has risen to prominence because of their simplicity of implementation ohunakin 2011 in ghana shp is defined as up to 1 megawatt mw irena 2013 presently in ghana investment in shps is on the low side owning to limited hydrological data that raises potential and investment risk concerns in the midst of these challenges geographic information systems and hydrologic modeling tools have proven to be resourceful tools in providing the needed information to predict potential sites and to boost investor confidence to support shp investments das and paul 2006 feizizadeh and haslauer 2012 and setiawan 2015 focused on shp development in the himalayan region of india the tabriz basin of iran and kalimantan indonesia respectively using gis and manual soil conservation service curve number scs cn kusre et al 2010 patil et al 2013 and goyal et al 2015 used an approach similar to swat to estimate shp in four river catchment areas within the kopili bennihalla and mahanadi basins in india according to arthur et al 2020 river sections in ghana have the prospect for minor hydroelectric generation however few studies have been conducted to ascertain the potential site in the densu river basin drb the energy demand is increasing due to industrialization and urbanization implying that some type of electrical generation should be available to supplement what is already available this is particularly the case because due to transmission losses connecting to the main electricity grid is extremely costly as a result of this developing small hydropower in the drb is crucial for socio economic activities and development in the basin from the foregoing the study sought to utilize remote sensing and the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate and simulate basin parameters for the hydropower analysis in order to identify optimal sites for the consideration of shp development flow duration curves fdc power duration curves pdc and available energy estimates have been determined for potential sites however the fundamental to considering a cascade development is to ensure that the water produced by a site downstream does not affect the power generation of an upstream site 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is the densu river basin drb the river travels from atiwa atwiredu mountain range which is located between longitudes 0º 19 0 w and latitudes 5º 31 0 n the densu river stretches over 116 kilometers with a drainage area of 2490 km2 asante et al 2008 the densu river flows through the areas of eastern central and greater accra regions before reaching the sea near bortianor in the ga west municipal district wrc 2017 with an average annual rainfall of 846 mm the basin has two rainfall seasons the major from may to july and the minor from september to november the average annual temperature from 1991 to 2020 is around 27 4 c with 12 h of sunshine per day the hottest months are november to april with temperatures around 32 degrees celsius wrc 2017 and august is the coolest month 23 degrees celsius the drb s semi deciduous forest has altered during the last 20 years with two different forms of land cover semi forest and settlements with settlements growing at a rapid rate wrc 2017 approximately 600 000 people live in the densu river basin which is surrounded by over 200 separate communities wrc 2017 these communities have a population density of 240 people per km2 which is greater than the national average of 100 wrc 2017 the densu river supplies a total of 76 96 million m3 of water per year it serves as the primary source of water for several nearby villages a portion of the accra metropolitan authority relies on water from the river to irrigate its crops and livestock 2 2 data sources and processes a 30 m digital elevation model dem table 1 and fig 1c was obtained from the usgs earth explorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov with the publication date of 23rd september 2020 arcgis version 10 3 1 was used for pre processing of dem and the area of interest masked from the image downloaded with the hydrology toolset in the spatial analyst toolbox the dem was filled to eliminate sinks in the dataset in generating the river networks the cumulative flows with values greater than or equal to 10 000 cells were considered to ensure that only cells with adequate accumulated flows were used in setting the stream order because of its simplicity the strahler method was employed for the stream ordering the procedure produced four unique stream orders with four representing the highest stream order for the land use land cover lulc fig 2a classification the unsupervised classification results obtained using the iso cluster unsupervised classification the true and false color composite images and a google earth image of the densu basin were utilized as guidelines in picking the training samples and eventually constructing the signature file the training sample management window was used to establish training sites for the supervised categorization the study used a digitized soil map fig 2b of the world from the food and agriculture organization fao with a scale of 1 5 000 000 fao 2003 by using an attribute query the ghana shapefile soil map was found and exported the shapefile s geographic and projection coordinates system were defined by wgs 1984 utm zone 30 n installing map window 4 8 8 and mwswat a map window extension provides access to the fao soil database which was utilized to extract the fao names for this study the rainfall and temperature data were acquired from the ghana meteorological agency and nasa power data access viewer which uses the global model called the merra 2 modern era retrospective analysis for research and application version 2 gmao 2015 for a period of thirty years which includes daily rainfall minimum and maximum air temperature 1990 2019 for koforidua kibi and aburi weather stations a 30 year 1990 2019 monthly time series discharge data was acquired from the hydrological services department hsd for the gauged station at nsawam 2 3 head and reach determination the head and the flow are the two most important parameters in hydropower the head is the difference between the upstream and the downstream elevations however the available head was determined beginning from the main outlet of the river towards the upstream using the contour map the number of contour lines that pass through a particular reach of the river multiplied by the contour interval 2 m determines the head while river reach is the distance between maximum and minimum elevation the shuttle radar topography mission srtm generated a contour map of the densu basin which was used as the method to calculate the head maximum elevation minimum elevation while the river reach determination was considered to eliminate the case of overcrowded sites within the basin the approach used was the distance between maximum elevation and minimum elevation of a selected site stream ordering was used to identify stream networks of the densu river basin where the higher the order of stream shows or depicts the appreciable flow for siting hydropower with sufficient flow for hydropower prospect 2 4 hydropower siting locations for hydropower potential along the densu river fig 3 were selected using criteria proposed by arthur et al 2020 the methodology employed by arthur et al 2020 was chosen because it required minimal data and was simple to implement yet produced strong and dependable results three criteria were examined in the initial assessment adequate flow head and a stream reach up to 3 km the final evaluation requirements are head and minimum site spacing yüksel 2007 to eliminate crowded probable sites found during the initial evaluation the final appropriate locations were chosen based on minimum head and site spacing criteria of 10 m and 500 m respectively the head criterion was designed to ensure that sufficient head was available for hydropower generation while also ensuring that undesirable locations were eliminated to avoid crowding of final sites the minimal separation would ensure that the upstream site s tailrace is unaffected by the downstream site s backwater ponding 2 5 swat process and flow simulation swat is a basin scale continuous time hydrological model with daily time steps its objective is to predict how water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in watersheds will be affected by management gassman et al 2007 the model is built on some hydro biophysical parameters and includes an arcgis qgis interface gassman et al 2007 swat fig 4 separates watersheds into subbasins which are then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus with different land use management slope and soil attributes the hrus represent portions of the sub basin region in a swat simulation and are not physically visible dividing a watershed into sub basins has the advantage of dissipating dominating land use soil type and management throughout the watershed the swat model calculates evapotranspiration by analyzing a wide range of meteorological and climatological data the model uses data on daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity to work out how much water is evaporated each day gassman et al 2007 the water balance of the river basin was determined in swat as shown neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where swt final soil water content mm h2o sw0 initial soil water content on day mm h2o t time

flow on day i mm to ensure compatibility with the swat model the dem and lulc were converted into raster layer formats while the soil map in vector shapefile is also transformed to raster format swat model simulation is based on the land use land cover and the soil distribution the watershed is first separated into subbasins and then into various hrus the dem was used to characterize the stream network during flow accumulation a total of 30 089 cells were determined and a threshold area ranging from 719 to 143 890 ha was calculated the stream link was then created using a threshold area of 2878 ha this threshold was chosen to ensure adequate details of the stream the selected final hydropower points were used as the inlet source with the first point being the outlet for delineating the basin during the watershed delineation procedure under the hru thresholds tab the hru definition was set as multiple hrus whereas the land use soil and slope classes were set at 2 1 and 2 respectively arthur et al 2020 the hrus were created using these threshold values to ensure that all dominating classes in slope soil and land use definition were considered 2 6 calibration validation and sensitivity analysis using swat cup the model was calibrated and validated on a monthly timestep for the periods spanning 01 10 1992 31 12 2011 and 01 01 2012 31 12 2019 respectively calibration and validation were done in swat cup employing the sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 algorithm prior to calibration sensitive parameters were determined using global sensitivity analysis the p value and t stat were used to determine the responsiveness of parameters to sensitivity with higher t stats and lower p value indicating highly sensitive parameter in all a total of 40 iterations were performed with 300 simulations each after every iteration the parameters ranges for the various parameters were changed to finally obtain a better output result the parameters were adjusted by the method of absolute change a and replacement v the parameters chosen for the automatic calibration were cn2 alpha bf revapmn gwqmn sol k esco sol awc gw revap epco rchg dp sol k ch l2 ch n2 canmx ch w2 ch d hru slp ch s2 and slsubbsn these parameters were selected according to the responsive analysis and literature review of diverse basins around the world particularly those with features similar to the densu river basin table 2 shows all the initial fitted values for the parameters considered for the simulation the model s performance was evaluated using r2 nse pbais and rsr dile and srinivasan 2014 dekongmen et al 2022 also uncertainties in model performance were assessed by the p factor and r factor the following equations for the indicators are 2 nse 1 ʃ i 1 n o i p i 2 ʃ i 1 n o i o 2 3 pbias ʃ i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 4 rsr ʃ i 1 n o i p i 2 ʃ i 1 n o i p 2 5 r 2 ʃ i 1 n o i o p i p ʃ i 1 n o i o 2 ʃ i 1 n p i p 2 2 6 p factor no of observations within 95 ppu total no of

duration curves were constructed considering all the hydropower sites flows were sorted into class sizes with a class interval the frequency for each class was then calculated using excel s frequency command based on the class interval given for the set of discharge values the frequency command sorts out and calculates the total number for each interval given the percentage of time dependability was calculated using the following formula 8 dependability cumulative frequency of flows n number of data set n 100 the flow duration curve fdc at individual hydropower stations is plotted in excel once the dependability was calculated with discharge m3 s as the ordinate and dependability percent as abscissa the firm flow for power generation was considered to correspond to 90 dependability which was calculated from the fdc of each hydropower plant in calculating the power for the hydropower sites the equation below was used for the computation 9 power kw ρ g he q η 1000 10 where he ht hl 11 η ηturbine ηgenerator ηplant where ρ is water density 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 q is discharge m3 s η is overall efficiency he is effective head m ht is total head m hl is head loss m the power duration curve pdc is plotted in excel using the calculated power kw on the ordinates and percent of the time on the abscissa the firm power for hydropower generation is 90 dependability which was obtained using the pdc for the annual energy production aep the area under the curve of the pdc is calculated by taking the integral of the equation of the curve the final answer from the integration is multiplied by the total number of hours in the entire year 2 8 storage in hydropower systems storage at feasible hydropower sites were considered at 50 and 75 dependability levels small volumes of water in a new head pond or an existing lake upstream of an existing dam are typically the only storage options at a small hydro plant if any are present at all small amounts of water storage are referred to as pondages pondage can help small hydro plants by increasing their energy production thus the above percentages chosen yields small volumes of water storage which in turn prevent negative environmental impacts the amount of storage required to enhance the dependable flow has been estimated approximately using the flow duration curves in fig 5 the required storage at 50 and 75 is obtained by calculating the area under abc and efc respectively 2 9 selection of turbine one of the major components of small hydropower development is the hydraulic turbine which converts the energy of falling water to mechanical energy that drives the electric generator the type of turbine is chosen based on how well it meets the head and flow characteristics that are present the system s overall performance will be improved by selecting the proper type of turbine otuagoma 2016 in this study the rule of thumb method given the head and flow was used for the turbine selection from fig 6 the point of intersection between the head and flow indicates the type of turbine suitable for use with its corresponding minimum and maximum installed capacities provided for by the diagonal lines 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary and final hydropower sites three criteria were examined in the initial assessment adequate flow head and a stream reach up to 3 km arthur et al 2020 in the initial assessment a third 3rd order and above streams were selected with a head of 8 m and above to ensure appreciable flow and head for hydropower generation thirty six 36 hydropower sites in total were discovered using the criteria outlined above there were thirty three 33 and three 3 preliminary hydropower sites found on the third 3rd and fourth 4th order streams respectively see supplementary table 1 for the final assessment the aim was to establish sufficient available power generation by ensuring adequate head and flow whiles also ensuring that undesirable locations were eliminated to avoid crowding of final sites nine 9 hydropower sites were identified in the final assessment considering a head of above 8 m and at least a site spacing of 500 m as indicated in fig 7 after the final selection there was one 1 site located on a fourth order stream with the remaining eight 8 sites located on a third order stream see supplementary table 2 for details of the nine sites 3 2 sensitive parameters and fitted values tables 3 and 4 show respectively the identified sensitive parameters and their fitted values given the 5 significant measure the order of sensitive parameters was slsubbsn t stat 50 2 p 0 05 hru slp t stat 4 5 p 0 05 and canmx t stat 3 7 p 0 05 table 3 slsubbsn refers to the average slope length of the channel this is measured to the point where flow begins to concentrate arnold et al 2012 from table 4 the initial value was 91 5 m allowing more runoff from the basin to the outfall point the fitted value from the model calibration was 85 2 m and this reduced the rate at which water leaves the basin thus there is a decrease in the runoff with lower values of slope length hru slp is the average slope steepness arnold et al 2012 with an initial value of 0 29 and a final fitted value of 0 23 after calibration table 4 the largest volume of water that can be intercepted in a canopy when it is completely formed is known as canmx arnold et al 2012 before the model calibration the simulated flows were overestimating the observed however the value for canmx was zero which was subsequently modified to 3 22 mmh2o to account for interception and thus reducing runoff volumes 3 3 swat model performance the model s performance was determined using r2 nse pbias rsr p factor and r factor the model was calibrated and validated for the periods spanning 01 10 1992 31 12 2011 and 01 01 2012 31 12 2019 respectively fig 8 in the model calibration and validation the r2 values were 0 75 and 0 73 respectively as part of the regression analysis the p value was also evaluated where values for both calibration and validation were all less than 0 05 p value 0 05 showing a strong correlation from table 5 a good performance is indicated by an r2 value of 0 70 0 75 it also implies that the observed data was able to explain 75 and 73 of the variation in the model data for both calibration and validation the nse value for both the calibration and validation periods were also 0 73 and 0 62 respectively this can identify how the observed and model data fit into the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 a model with an nse value of 0 5 0 70 is considered to be good yilmaz et al 2020 a model with a pbias value of less than 10 shows a very good performance while a pbias value of 10 15 in absolute values also suggests good performance as a result the model s pbias values of 4 5 and 5 9 during calibration and validation respectively are inferred to suggest good model performance and since the values obtained were all positive it indicates a model underestimation performance furthermore a model with an rsr value of 0 3 0 6 is considered good and 0 6 0 7 is considered satisfactory as a result rsr of 0 52 and 0 62 for calibration and validation are considered good and satisfactory respectively hydrologic modeling is fraught with uncertainty because of the myriad processes that take place within a watershed as a result the p factor and r factor were employed to gauge the level of uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 these measurements evaluate the goodness of fit and the extent to which the calibrated model takes uncertainties into account the theoretical values for the p and r factors are 0 1 and 0 to infinity respectively a simulation that completely matches the measured data has a p factor of 1 and an r factor of 0 simulation results indicate a p factor of 0 50 and 0 44 during calibration and validation respectively table 5 a p factor range of 0 5 0 6 is deemed satisfactory and hence this model is satisfactory again a model with an r factor range of less than 0 5 is good therefore the r factor values of 0 17 and 0 24 also for both calibration and validation periods show a good prediction table 5 3 4 flow power and energy determination after calibration and validation the swat simulated flows at the selected hydropower sites were extracted to generate the fdc and pdc for the various hydropower locations the fdc and pdc of the prospective locations were developed to help determine firm power and annual energy production aep for each location to calculate the effective head an assumed 10 head loss was used as well as an overall system efficiency of 90 clarke et al 2008 from the analysis done hydropower sites hp1 hp4 hp7 and hp9 with high flow and firm power at 90 dependability are sites located onhigher order streams flow and firm power curves of these hydropower sites are depicted in fig 9 a 90 dependability is frequently the preferred option for establishing steady power in hydropower development and thus same was considered in this study as a result the firm power for each selected location was set at 90 dependability indicated in blue dotted lines in fig 9 the flow and firm power for hp1 hp4 hp7 and hp9 are 13 4 m3 s and 1698 7 kw 9 1 m3 s and 866 64 kw 7 9 m3 s and 1007 1 kw 6 0 m3 s and 570 37 kw respectively as shown in the graphs below while the highest firm energy and annual energy production aep at 13 39 gwh and 28 68 gwh were again recorded at hp1 followed by hp7 which was ranked 2nd with firm energy of 7 94 gwh and annual energy production aep of 14 36 gwh and hp9 had the lowest firm energy and annual energy production aep with 4 50 gwh and 7 43 gwh respectively the highest firm power was generated at hydropower site one hp1 with 1698 7 kw of power it was the highest because the site was located at the 4th order stream with high flows as compared to the other hydropower sites the aep corresponds to the area under the curve of the pdc as shown also in fig 9 while fig 10 shows the graphical representation the firm energy is the annual least energy that must be utilized 90 of the time while the annual energy production aep is the annual energy that must be generated over the entire year therefore the annual energy production aep will always be higher than the firm energy table 6 below shows the entire summary for the flow firm power firm energy and annual energy production aep at each hydropower site 3 5 proposed cascade arrangement along the upper densu river the fundamental goal of cascade development is to ensure that the water produced because of one site downstream does not interfere with the power generation of another site upstream as a result kusre et al 2010 proposed a 0 5 km minimum spacing between subsequent sites for cascade the distance between hp1 and hp4 in the proposed cascade is 11 38 km whereas the distance between hp4 and hp7 is 11 31 km with these spacings a cascade arrangement is appropriate without causing any issues and because of their significant annual firm energy and annual energy production projected at these three sites it is proposed that they be constructed as a cascade hydropower project as a result hydropower sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 along the densu river can be developed as a cascade project without hindrance fig 11 3 6 storage flow and turbine determination for the proposed cascade arrangement storage volumes at 50 and 75 dependability for each site with their corresponding flows are estimated for the proposed cascade system table 7 for 50 dependability the storage and flow for hp1 hp4 and hp7 were 17 400 m3 21 m3 s 8600 m3 12 8 m3 s and 9080 m3 10 8 m3 s respectively that for 75 dependability were 7750 m3 17 3 m3 s 3200 m3 10 7 m3 s and 3840 m3 7 3 m3 s respectively for hp1 hp4 and hp7 flows with a 90 dependability do not require storage because they are almost always available even at very low flow rates however with 50 and 75 dependability flows are extremely high requiring the need for storage to accommodate such flows for the turbine selection for the various hydropower sites in the cascade arrangement the rule of thumb method considering the head and flow was used together with the turbine application range chart fig 6 in table 8 each hydropower at 50 and 75 dependability is indicated with their corresponding installed capacity which was obtained from the pdc of specified sites consequently francis turbine was identified as the most suitable turbine type alongside its minimum and maximum capacities from table 8 it is evident that hp1 at 50 dependability had the highest installed capacity of 286 34 kw followed by hp1 at 75 dependability with an installed capacity of 2203 18 kw the least installed capacity of 1024 02 kw was obtained at hp 4 at 75 dependability 4 conclusion hydropower is an important source of electricity in the ghanaian energy sector however the persistent power cuts in the country require an increase in the current energy supply through the development of new energy sources in this study the potential of the upper stream of the densu river for hydropower development has been assessed using remote sensing and hydrological modeling methods nine potential hydropower locations were identified for swat simulation the model performance against nse r2 rsr and pbias in the calibration and validation phases were good with corresponding statistics of 0 73 and 0 62 0 75 and 0 73 0 52 and 0 62 and 4 5 and 5 9 the highest hydropower potential site was located at hp1 with the firm flow firm power firm energy and aep of 13 4 m3 s 1 70 mw 13 4 gwh and 28 8 gwh respectively conversely the least hydropower potential site was sited at hp9 with the firm flow firm power firm energy and aep of 6 0 m3 s 0 57 mw 4 5 gwh and 7 3 gwh respectively the hydropower potentials at sites hp7 and hp4 were also good with firm power firm energy and aep of 1 00 mw 7 94 gwh and 14 36 gwh and 0 86 mw 6 83 gwh and12 68 gwh respectively the combined aep of sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 is 55 72 gwh based on the current findings hydropower sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 could be developed as a cascade hydropower project on the upper densu river the distance between hp1 and hp4 in the proposed cascade is 11 43 km whereas that between hp4 and hp7 is 11 77 km consequently from the analysis these hydropower sites can be developed as a storage hydropower considering a 50 or 75 dependability in addition the analysis led to the francis turbine being selected as the turbine type for this storage

7765,the study investigated potential sites for the development of small hydropower systems shp to augment the existing energy supply in the udrb remote sensing and the soil and water assessment tool swat were employed to generate and simulate basin parameters for the hydropower analysis the energy potential of suitable sites was evaluated using flow duration curves fdc and power duration curves pdc results indicate that the upper drb has potential for small hydropower development with nine sites along the river having an estimated combined firm power of 7 89 mw the highest hydropower potential sites were located at hp1 hp7 and hp4 with corresponding firm energies of 13 39 gwh 7 94 gwh and 6 83 gwh and estimated annual energy production of 28 68 gwh 14 36 gwh and 12 68 gwh respectively given the adequate spacing distance between sites hp1 and hp4 11 38 km and hp4 and hp7 11 31 km with a combined annual energy production of 55 72 gwh a cascade hydropower arrangement of sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 is recommended along the upper section of the densu river however based on the analysis these hydropower sites could be developed as a cascade storage hydropower with a 50 or 75

devastations in ecosystem functions and services gorte 2009 in view of this there is a need to further explore viable alternatives for sustainable rural energy sources hydropower generation remains one of the oldest and most reliable sources of renewable energy generation patil et al 2013 that can support the energy demands in scattered settlements hydropower remains the backbone of the energy economy in many nations including china india and brazil because of its cheapest energy generation option despite the many competing renewable energy sources hydropower contributed the most to the world s electricity output in 2014 16 6 as compared to other renewable energies 22 8 with 1055 gw of global producing capacity galán et al 2015 hydropower projects are characterized in a variety of

be resourceful tools in providing the needed information to predict potential sites and to boost investor confidence to support shp investments das and paul 2006 feizizadeh and haslauer 2012 and setiawan 2015 focused on shp development in the himalayan region of india the tabriz basin of iran and kalimantan indonesia respectively using gis and manual soil conservation service curve number scs cn kusre et al 2010 patil et al 2013 and goyal et al 2015 used an approach similar to swat to estimate shp in four river catchment areas within the kopili bennihalla and mahanadi basins in india according to arthur et al 2020 river sections in ghana have the prospect for minor hydroelectric generation however few studies have been conducted to ascertain the potential site in the densu river basin drb the energy demand is increasing due to industrialization and urbanization implying that some type of electrical generation should be available to supplement what is already available this is particularly the case because due to transmission losses connecting to the main electricity grid is extremely costly as a result of this developing small hydropower in the drb is crucial for socio economic activities and development in the basin from the foregoing the study sought to utilize remote sensing and the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate and simulate basin parameters for the hydropower analysis in order to identify optimal sites for the consideration of shp development flow duration curves fdc power duration curves pdc and available energy estimates have been determined for potential sites however the fundamental to considering a cascade development is to ensure that the water produced by a site downstream does not affect the power generation of an upstream site 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is the densu river basin drb the river travels from atiwa atwiredu mountain range which is located between longitudes 0º 19 0 w and latitudes 5º 31 0 n the densu river stretches over 116 kilometers with a drainage area of 2490 km2 asante et al 2008 the densu river flows through the areas of eastern central and greater accra regions before reaching the sea near bortianor in the ga west municipal district wrc 2017 with an average annual rainfall of 846 mm the basin has two rainfall seasons the major from may to july and the minor from september to november the average annual temperature from 1991 to 2020 is around 27 4 c with 12 h of sunshine per day the hottest months are november to april with temperatures around 32 degrees celsius wrc 2017 and august is the coolest month 23 degrees celsius the drb s semi deciduous forest has altered during the last 20 years with two different forms of land cover semi forest and settlements with settlements growing at a rapid rate wrc 2017 approximately 600 000 people live in the densu river basin which is surrounded by over 200 separate communities wrc 2017 these communities have a population density of 240 people per km2 which is greater than the national average of 100 wrc 2017 the densu river supplies a total of 76 96 million m3 of water per year it serves as the primary source of water for several nearby villages a portion of the accra metropolitan authority relies on water from the river to irrigate its crops and livestock 2 2 data sources and processes a 30 m digital elevation model dem table 1 and fig 1c was obtained from the usgs earth explorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov with the publication date of 23rd september 2020 arcgis version 10 3 1 was used for pre processing of dem and the area of interest masked from the image downloaded with the hydrology toolset in the spatial analyst toolbox the dem was filled to eliminate sinks in the dataset in generating the river networks the cumulative flows with values greater than or equal to 10 000 cells were considered to ensure that only cells with adequate accumulated flows were used in setting the stream order because of its simplicity the strahler method was employed for the stream ordering the procedure produced four unique stream orders with four representing the highest stream order for the land use land cover lulc fig 2a classification the unsupervised classification results obtained using the iso cluster unsupervised classification the true and false color composite images and a google earth image of the densu basin were utilized as guidelines in picking the training samples and eventually constructing the signature file the training sample management window was used to establish training sites for the supervised categorization the study used a digitized soil map fig 2b of the world from the food and agriculture organization fao with a scale of 1 5 000 000 fao 2003 by using an attribute query the ghana shapefile soil map was found and exported the shapefile s geographic and projection coordinates system were defined by wgs 1984 utm zone 30 n installing map window 4 8 8 and mwswat a map window extension provides access to the fao soil database which was utilized to extract the fao names for this study the rainfall and temperature data were acquired from the ghana meteorological agency and nasa power data access viewer which uses the global model called the merra 2 modern era retrospective analysis for research and application version 2 gmao 2015 for a period of thirty years which includes daily rainfall minimum and maximum air temperature 1990 2019 for koforidua kibi and aburi weather stations a 30 year 1990 2019 monthly time series discharge data was acquired from the hydrological services department hsd for the gauged station at nsawam 2 3 head and reach determination the head and the flow are the two most important parameters in hydropower the head is the difference between the upstream and the downstream elevations however the available head was determined beginning from the main outlet of the river towards the upstream using the contour map the number of contour lines that pass through a particular reach of the river multiplied by the contour interval 2 m determines the head while river reach is the distance between maximum and minimum elevation the shuttle radar topography mission srtm generated a contour map of the densu basin which was used as the method to calculate the head maximum elevation minimum elevation while the river reach determination was considered to eliminate the case of overcrowded sites within the basin the approach used was the distance between maximum elevation and minimum elevation of a selected site stream ordering was used to identify stream networks of the densu river basin where the higher the order of stream shows or depicts the appreciable flow for siting hydropower with sufficient flow for hydropower prospect 2 4 hydropower siting locations for hydropower potential along the densu river fig 3 were selected using criteria proposed by arthur et al 2020 the methodology employed by arthur et al 2020 was chosen because it required minimal data and was simple to implement yet produced strong and dependable results three criteria were examined in the initial assessment adequate flow head and a stream reach up to 3 km the final evaluation requirements are head and minimum site spacing yüksel 2007 to eliminate crowded probable sites found during the initial evaluation the final appropriate locations were chosen based on minimum head and site spacing criteria of 10 m and 500 m respectively the head criterion was designed to ensure that sufficient head was available for hydropower generation while also ensuring that undesirable locations were eliminated to avoid crowding of final sites the minimal separation would ensure that the upstream site s tailrace is unaffected by the downstream site s backwater ponding 2 5 swat process and flow simulation swat is a basin scale continuous time hydrological model with daily time steps its objective is to predict how water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in watersheds will be affected by management gassman et al 2007 the model is built on some hydro biophysical parameters and includes an arcgis qgis interface gassman et al 2007 swat fig 4 separates watersheds into subbasins which are then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus with different land use management slope and soil attributes the hrus represent portions of the sub basin region in a swat simulation and are not physically visible dividing a watershed into sub basins has the advantage of dissipating dominating land use soil type and management throughout the watershed the swat model calculates evapotranspiration by analyzing a wide range of meteorological and climatological data the model uses data on daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity to work out how much water is evaporated each day gassman et al 2007 the water balance of the river basin was determined in swat as shown neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where swt final soil water content mm h2o sw0 initial soil water content on day mm h2o t time

flow on day i mm to ensure compatibility with the swat model the dem and lulc were converted into raster layer formats while the soil map in vector shapefile is also transformed to raster format swat model simulation is based on the land use land cover and the soil distribution the watershed is first separated into subbasins and then into various hrus the dem was used to characterize the stream network during flow accumulation a total of 30 089 cells were determined and a threshold area ranging from 719 to 143 890 ha was calculated the stream link was then created using a threshold area of 2878 ha this threshold was chosen to ensure adequate details of the stream the selected final hydropower points were used as the inlet source with the first point being the outlet for delineating the basin during the watershed delineation procedure under the hru thresholds tab the hru definition was set as multiple hrus whereas the land use soil and slope classes were set at 2 1 and 2 respectively arthur et al 2020 the hrus were created using these threshold values to ensure that all dominating classes in slope soil and land use definition were considered 2 6 calibration validation and sensitivity analysis using swat cup the model was calibrated and validated on a monthly timestep for the periods spanning 01 10 1992 31 12 2011 and 01 01 2012 31 12 2019 respectively calibration and validation were done in swat cup employing the sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 algorithm prior to calibration sensitive parameters were determined using global sensitivity analysis the p value and t stat were used to determine the responsiveness of parameters to sensitivity with higher t stats and lower p value indicating highly sensitive parameter in all a total of 40 iterations were performed with 300 simulations each after every iteration the parameters ranges for the various parameters were changed to finally obtain a better output result the parameters were adjusted by the method of absolute change a and replacement v the parameters chosen for the automatic calibration were cn2 alpha bf revapmn gwqmn sol k esco sol awc gw revap epco rchg dp sol k ch l2 ch n2 canmx ch w2 ch d hru slp ch s2 and slsubbsn these parameters were selected according to the responsive analysis and literature review of diverse basins around the world particularly those with features similar to the densu river basin table 2 shows all the initial fitted values for the parameters considered for the simulation the model s performance was evaluated using r2 nse pbais and rsr dile and srinivasan 2014 dekongmen et al 2022 also uncertainties in model performance were assessed by the p factor and r factor the following equations for the indicators are 2 nse 1 ʃ i 1 n o i p i 2 ʃ i 1 n o i o 2 3

duration curves were constructed considering all the hydropower sites flows were sorted into class sizes with a class interval the frequency for each class was then calculated using excel s frequency command based on the class interval given for the set of discharge values the frequency command sorts out and calculates the total number for each interval given the percentage of time dependability was calculated using the following formula 8 dependability cumulative frequency of flows n number of data set n 100 the flow duration curve fdc at individual hydropower stations is plotted in excel once the dependability was calculated with discharge m3 s as the ordinate and dependability percent as abscissa the firm flow for power generation was considered to correspond to 90 dependability which was calculated from the fdc of each hydropower plant in calculating the power for the hydropower sites the equation below was used for the computation 9 power kw ρ g he q η 1000 10 where he ht hl 11 η ηturbine ηgenerator ηplant where ρ is water density 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 q is discharge m3 s η is overall efficiency he is effective head m ht is total head m hl is head loss m the power duration curve pdc is plotted in excel using the calculated power kw on the ordinates and percent of the time on the abscissa the firm power for hydropower generation is 90 dependability which was obtained using the pdc for the annual energy production aep the area under the curve of the pdc is calculated by taking the integral of the equation of the curve the final answer from the integration is multiplied by the total number of hours in the entire year 2 8 storage in hydropower systems storage at feasible hydropower sites were considered at 50 and 75 dependability levels small volumes of water in a new head pond or an existing lake upstream of an existing dam are typically the only storage options at a small hydro plant if any are present at all small amounts of water storage are referred to as pondages pondage can help small hydro plants by increasing their energy production thus the above percentages chosen yields small volumes of water storage which in turn prevent negative environmental impacts the amount of storage required to enhance the dependable flow has been estimated approximately using the flow duration curves in fig 5 the required storage at 50 and 75 is obtained by calculating the area under abc and efc respectively 2 9 selection of turbine one of the major components of small hydropower development is the hydraulic turbine which converts the energy of falling water to mechanical energy that drives the electric generator the type of turbine is chosen based on how well it meets the head and flow characteristics that are present the system s overall performance will be improved by selecting the proper type of turbine otuagoma 2016 in this study the rule of thumb method given the head and flow was used for the turbine selection from fig 6 the point of intersection between the head and flow indicates the type of turbine suitable for use with its corresponding minimum and maximum installed capacities provided for by the diagonal lines 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary and final hydropower sites three criteria were examined in the initial assessment adequate flow head and a stream reach up to 3 km arthur et al 2020 in the initial assessment a third 3rd order and above streams were selected with a head of 8 m and above to ensure appreciable flow and head for hydropower generation thirty six 36 hydropower sites in total were discovered using the criteria outlined above there were thirty three 33 and three 3 preliminary hydropower sites found on the third 3rd and fourth 4th order streams respectively see supplementary table 1 for the final assessment the aim was to establish sufficient available power generation by ensuring adequate head and flow whiles also ensuring that undesirable locations were eliminated to avoid crowding of final sites nine 9 hydropower sites were identified in the final assessment considering a head of above 8 m and at least a site spacing of 500 m as indicated in fig 7 after the final selection there was one 1 site located on a fourth order stream with the remaining eight 8 sites located on a third order stream see supplementary table 2 for details of the nine sites 3 2 sensitive parameters and fitted values tables 3 and 4 show respectively the identified sensitive parameters and their fitted values given the 5 significant measure the order of sensitive parameters was slsubbsn t stat 50 2 p 0 05 hru slp t stat 4 5 p 0 05 and canmx t stat 3 7 p 0 05 table 3 slsubbsn refers to the average slope length of the channel this is measured to the point where flow begins to concentrate arnold et al 2012 from table 4 the initial value was 91 5 m allowing more runoff from the basin to the outfall point the fitted value from the model calibration was 85 2 m and this reduced the rate at which water leaves the basin thus there is a decrease in the runoff with lower values of slope length hru slp is the average slope steepness arnold et al 2012 with an initial value of 0 29 and a final fitted value of 0 23 after calibration table 4 the largest volume of water that can be intercepted in a canopy when it is completely formed is known as canmx arnold et al 2012 before the model calibration the simulated flows were overestimating the observed however the value for canmx was zero which was subsequently modified to 3 22 mmh2o to account for interception and thus reducing runoff volumes 3 3 swat model performance the model s performance was determined using r2 nse pbias rsr p factor and r factor the model was calibrated and validated for the periods spanning 01 10 1992 31 12 2011 and 01 01 2012 31 12 2019 respectively fig 8 in the model calibration and validation the r2 values were 0 75 and 0 73 respectively as part of the regression analysis the p value was also evaluated where values for both calibration and validation were all less than 0 05 p value 0 05 showing a strong correlation from table 5 a good performance is indicated by an r2 value of 0 70 0 75 it also implies that the observed data was able to explain 75 and 73 of the variation in the model data for both calibration and validation the nse value for both the calibration and validation periods were also 0 73 and 0 62 respectively this can identify how the observed and model data fit into the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 a model with an nse value of 0 5 0 70 is considered to be good yilmaz et al 2020 a model with a pbias value of less than 10 shows a very good performance while a pbias value of 10 15 in absolute values also suggests good performance as a result the model s pbias values of 4 5 and 5 9 during calibration and validation respectively are inferred to suggest good model performance and since the values obtained were all positive it indicates a model underestimation performance furthermore a model with an rsr value of 0 3 0 6 is considered good and 0 6 0 7 is considered satisfactory as a result rsr of 0 52 and 0 62 for calibration and validation are considered good and satisfactory respectively hydrologic modeling is fraught with uncertainty because of the myriad processes that take place within a watershed as a result the p factor and r factor were employed to gauge the level of uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 these measurements evaluate the goodness of fit and the extent to which the calibrated model takes uncertainties into account the theoretical values for the p and r factors are 0 1 and 0 to infinity respectively a simulation that completely matches the measured data has a p factor of 1 and an r factor of 0 simulation results indicate a p factor of 0 50 and 0 44 during calibration and validation respectively table 5 a p factor range of 0 5 0 6 is deemed satisfactory and hence this model is satisfactory again a model with an r factor range of less than 0 5 is good therefore the r factor values of 0 17 and 0 24 also for both calibration and validation periods show a good prediction table 5 3 4 flow power and energy determination after calibration and validation the swat simulated flows at the selected hydropower sites were extracted to generate the fdc and pdc for the various hydropower locations the fdc and pdc of the prospective locations were developed to help determine firm power and annual energy production aep for each location to calculate the effective head an assumed 10 head loss was used as well as an overall system efficiency of 90 clarke et al 2008 from the analysis done hydropower sites hp1 hp4 hp7 and hp9 with high flow and firm power at 90 dependability are sites located onhigher order streams flow and firm power curves of these hydropower sites are depicted in fig 9 a 90 dependability is frequently the preferred option for establishing steady power in hydropower development and thus same was considered in this study as a result the firm power for each selected location was set at 90 dependability indicated in blue dotted lines in fig 9 the flow and firm power for hp1 hp4 hp7 and hp9 are 13 4 m3 s and 1698 7 kw 9 1 m3 s and 866 64 kw 7 9 m3 s and 1007 1 kw 6 0 m3 s and 570 37 kw respectively as shown in the graphs below while the highest firm energy and annual energy production aep at 13 39 gwh and 28 68 gwh were again recorded at hp1 followed by hp7 which was ranked 2nd with firm energy of 7 94 gwh and annual energy production aep of 14 36 gwh and hp9 had the lowest firm energy and annual energy production aep with 4 50 gwh and 7 43 gwh respectively the highest firm power was generated at hydropower site one hp1 with 1698 7 kw of power it was the highest because the site was located at the 4th order stream with high flows as compared to the other hydropower sites the aep corresponds to the area under the curve of the pdc as shown also in fig 9 while fig 10 shows the graphical representation the firm energy is the annual least energy that must be utilized 90 of the time while the annual energy production aep is the annual energy that must be generated over the entire year therefore the annual energy production aep will always be higher than the firm energy table 6 below shows the entire summary for the flow firm power firm energy and annual energy production aep at each hydropower site 3 5 proposed cascade arrangement along the upper densu river the fundamental goal of cascade development is to ensure that the water produced because of one site downstream does not interfere with the power generation of another site upstream as a result kusre et al 2010 proposed a 0 5 km minimum spacing between subsequent sites for cascade the distance between hp1 and hp4 in the proposed cascade is 11 38 km whereas the distance between hp4 and hp7 is 11 31 km with these spacings a cascade arrangement is appropriate without causing any issues and because of their significant annual firm energy and annual energy production projected at these three sites it is proposed that they be constructed as a cascade hydropower project as a result hydropower sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 along the densu river can be developed as a cascade project without hindrance fig 11 3 6 storage flow and turbine determination for the proposed cascade arrangement storage volumes at 50 and 75 dependability for each site with their corresponding flows are estimated for the proposed cascade system table 7 for 50 dependability the storage and flow for hp1 hp4 and hp7 were 17 400 m3 21 m3 s 8600 m3 12 8 m3 s and 9080 m3 10 8 m3 s respectively that for 75 dependability were 7750 m3 17 3 m3 s 3200 m3 10 7 m3 s and 3840 m3 7 3 m3 s respectively for hp1 hp4 and hp7 flows with a 90 dependability do not require storage because they are almost always available even at very low flow rates however with 50 and 75 dependability flows are extremely high requiring the need for storage to accommodate such flows for the turbine selection for the various hydropower sites in the cascade arrangement the rule of thumb method considering the head and flow was used together with the turbine application range chart fig 6 in table 8 each hydropower at 50 and 75 dependability is indicated with their corresponding installed capacity which was obtained from the pdc of specified sites consequently francis turbine was identified as the most suitable turbine type alongside its minimum and maximum capacities from table 8 it is evident that hp1 at 50 dependability had the highest installed capacity of 286 34 kw followed by hp1 at 75 dependability with an installed capacity of 2203 18 kw the least installed capacity of 1024 02 kw was obtained at hp 4 at 75 dependability 4 conclusion hydropower is an important source of electricity in the ghanaian energy sector however the persistent power cuts in the country require an increase in the current energy supply through the development of new energy sources in this study the potential of the upper stream of the densu river for hydropower development has been assessed using remote sensing and hydrological modeling methods nine potential hydropower locations were identified for swat simulation the model performance against nse r2 rsr and pbias in the calibration and validation phases were good with corresponding statistics of 0 73 and 0 62 0 75 and 0 73 0 52 and 0 62 and 4 5 and 5 9 the highest hydropower potential site was located at hp1 with the firm flow firm power firm energy and aep of 13 4 m3 s 1 70 mw 13 4 gwh and 28 8 gwh respectively conversely the least hydropower potential site was sited at hp9 with the firm flow firm power firm energy and aep of 6 0 m3 s 0 57 mw 4 5 gwh and 7 3 gwh respectively the hydropower potentials at sites hp7 and hp4 were also good with firm power firm energy and aep of 1 00 mw 7 94 gwh and 14 36 gwh and 0 86 mw 6 83 gwh and12 68 gwh respectively the combined aep of sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 is 55 72 gwh based on the current findings hydropower sites hp1 hp4 and hp7 could be developed as a cascade hydropower project on the upper densu river the distance between hp1 and hp4 in the proposed cascade is 11 43 km whereas that between hp4 and hp7 is 11 77 km consequently from the analysis these hydropower sites can be developed as a storage hydropower considering a 50 or 75 dependability in addition the analysis led to the francis turbine being selected as the turbine type for this storage

7766,study region three watersheds in the lake champlain basin of vermont usa study focus watershed models are essential for evaluating the impact of watershed management however they contain many parameters that are not directly measurable these parameters are commonly estimated by calibration against observed data often streamflow unfortunately many areas lack long term streamflow records making parameter estimation in low data environments lde challenging a new calibration technique simultaneous multi basin calibration mbc was developed to estimate model parameters in lde three soil and water assessment tool swat model initializations for usgs gages with 2 year records in the lake champlain basin of vermont usa were evaluated by comparing mbc and the commonly used similarity based regionalization sbr approach where calibrated parameters from a watershed with an extended data record are transferred to the lde receptor watersheds in mbc each watershed is initialized and observed flows from each initialization are aggregated to generate a combined streamflow record of sufficient length to calibrate using a differential evolution algorithm new hydrological insights for the region using this new mbc method we demonstrate improved model performance and more realistic model parameter values this study demonstrates that short periods of hydrological measurement from multiple locations in a basin can represent a system similarly to long term measurements and that even short records taken at multiple locations significantly improve our hydrologic knowledge of a system as compared to relying on the similarity of a basin with a long record of flow in addition this study revealed that the hydrologic response is mediated by the interplay of very low soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and cracking soils as a result even if ksat is very low cracking clays have a large impact on runoff production garna et al 2022 graphical abstract ga1 keywords calibration low data environments regionalization swat model data availability source code garna et al 2022 https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6609237 1 introduction watershed scale hydrological models are often used to quantify and predict diverse and complicated hydrologic system behavior and are often used to manage environmental and water resources a process based hydrological model consists of equations and parameters that describe watershed processes such as snow accumulation groundwater flow runoff generation and evapotranspiration devia et al 2015 sorooshian et al 2008 since hydrological models represent simplified versions of natural processes they are inherently uncertain moges et al 2020 orth et al 2015 renard et al 2010 wagena et al 2019 the primary sources of uncertainty are model structure simplified process representation input data limited measurements and parameter estimation difficulties in specifying exact parameter values ehlers et al 2018 gupta and govindaraju 2019 jin et al 2010 moges et al 2020 setegn et al 2009 many parameters in watershed scale models cannot be measured directly due to process complexity limitations in measurement methods and spatiotemporal heterogeneity therefore it is necessary to estimate the parameter value through model calibration gupta and govindaraju 2019 model calibration adjusts the model parameters within feasible parameter ranges veith et al 2010 so that model responses such as streamflow show good agreement with the observed values singh and frevert 2002 hydrologic systems are characterized by complex processes and many interactions and are driven by exogenous forcing making model parameter estimation critical and often difficult this is especially apparent in watersheds without long term data or in regions characterized by rapid environmental change mirza 2011 schiermeier 2011 trenberth 2009 2005 wagena et al 2016 in addition insufficient information about model parameter values makes it difficult to model hydrological systems in their full complexity and heterogeneity natural variability is thus aggregated to a great extent by models leading to the potential of equifinality the situation when there is more than one possible model parameter set that results in suitable simulation results beven 1993 seibert et al 2019 equifinality is intensified by over parameterization her and chaubey 2015 and is one of the most common issues that hydrologists encounter while using hydrological models van griensven et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to constrain the calibration processes to only those most influential parameters using sensitivity analysis veith et al 2010 streamflow is one of the primary observed measurements used to calibrate watershed models because it is a good integrator of the hydrological mass balance for a basin and various processes occurring in the watershed such as atmospheric exchange soil moisture redistribution runoff generation and evapotranspiration hui et al 2020 wambura et al 2018 successful calibration often requires a suitable record of observed streamflow daggupati et al 2015 however in many watersheds observed streamflow data are unavailable or only exist for short durations sivapalan et al 2003 making calibration a challenging process to deal with this problem and to estimate streamflow in low data environments lde two different regionalization techniques are commonly used blöschl and sivapalan 1995 statistically based sivapalan et al 2003 yadav et al 2007 and similarity based farsadnia et al 2014 mengistu et al 2019 rafiei emam et al 2017 vandewiele and elias 1995 statistical based approaches identify relationships between calibrated model parameters in watersheds with adequate available data and watershed attributes in lde such as soil type topography or drainage area lee et al 2006 parajka et al 2005 previous studies often report statistical methods unable to suitably simulate streamflow merz and blöschl 2004 peel et al 2000 the similarity based approach similarity based regionalization sbr estimates lde watershed model parameters by transferring parameter values from a donor often nearby watershed with a suitable calibration masih et al 2010 samuel et al 2011 vandewiele and elias 1995 while sbr is the most commonly used techniques for parameter estimation in lde it is challenging to obtain representative parameter estimates sivapalan et al 2003 because the uncertainty embedded in the parameters of the donor watershed directly impact and often increase the uncertainty of parameters in the lde sellami et al 2014 comparisons of the statistically based and regionalization methods show that the regionalization methods result in better model simulations with studies from bao et al 2012 merz et al 2011 and oudin et al 2008 investigating 55 watersheds in china 308 watersheds in australia and 913 watersheds in france respectively all showing better performance of sbr under multiple hydroclimate conditions this study demonstrates a new simultaneous multi basin calibration mbc method that can be used to calibrate basins with short streamflow records in lde to test the new method we use three newly instrumented united states department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs conservation effects assessment project ceap watersheds usda nrcs 2019 with short streamflow duration records 2 years and a donor watershed with 31 years of daily streamflow data we select twelve years of streamflow data of the donor watershed from 2010 to the present because more than 10 years of recorded streamflow data is a common length for calibration and needed to adequately represent hydroclimatic variability feyereisen et al 2007 oeurng et al 2011 shi et al 2011 the three newly instrumented watersheds are located at distances 1 23 and 25 km from the watershed with a longer record distances often cited as appropriate for parameter regionalization lebecherel et al 2016 the results of the new mbc methodology are compared to the sbr regionalization technique of using a neighboring basin with a longer streamflow duration record donor watershed and by comparing calibrated parameters and simulated streamflow obtained by the sbr and mbc in the three low data watersheds to demonstrate the extent to which the methods capture physical processes within the basin we compare calibrated parameters against measured soil data collected in the watersheds including soil depth saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water capacity all calibrated parameters in the model as well the objective of this work is to develop a new calibration method that improves model performance and increases the information content of watershed models in low data environments and to improve model parameter estimation to enhance process understanding 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located within the lake champlain basin lcb of vermont vt usa lake champlain is a 193 kilometer long freshwater lake on the western border of vt that provides drinking water to approximately 200 000 people in the us and québec the lake is a large economic generator for the region approx 3 8 billion generated over 1998 1999 lcbp 2016 lake champlain has been subject to periodic harmful algal blooms habs which most commonly occur in a number of shallow bays spread throughout the vermont shoreline elevated phosphorus p delivery to freshwater systems has been documented to contribute to hab formation davis et al

of the total p reaching the lake is estimated to be from nonpoint agricultural sources troy et al 2007 the little otter creek locb and the dead creek dcb basins are both located in the southern portion of the basin within 10 km of one another and have recently 2019 been instrumented as usda nrcs ceap watersheds to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs to guide usda conservation policy and program development under agreements between usgs and usda the locb with an area of 158 square kilometers km2 above the usgs gage 04282650 loc ferrisburg u s geological survey 2021a and the dcb with an area of 96 km2 above the intersection of vermont route 17 vt 17 and dead creek are located in addison county vermont within the champlain valley physiographic province stewart and macclintock 1969 which drain into lake champlain at hawkins bay and fields bay respectively fig 1 weather data from closest global historical climate network ghcn weather stations menne et al 2012 fig 1 show that precipitation in the area averages 1058 millimeters per year the mean annual maximum temperature is 13 2 c while the mean minimum temperature is 1 9 c the physiography of dcb watersheds are relatively uniform with a mean slope of 2 7 and a maximum of 53 4 the locb watersheds have a mean of 5 7 and maximum of 57 9 fig 1 the soil data obtained from the usda s websoilsurvey web soil survey 2019 show that the area is dominated by vergennes clay 2 6 slope 40 6 12 slope 7 2 and 12 25 slope 16 3 covington and panton silty clays 21 and silt loams 11 fig 1 the minimum and maximum elevation of the study area are 45 m and 185 m respectively fifty soil samples were collected across locb and dcb watersheds from the depth of 6 in in the fall of 2020 by the vermont association of conservative districts usda nrcs 2019 these soil samples were analyzed using the cornell soil health protocol moebius clune et al 2016 for soil texture and available water capacity awc soil depth and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were estimated based upon field measurements using a constant head permeameter and observations within the watershed area the region is also characterized by swelling cracking clay soils with very low ksat 1 mm h in many areas ruggiero et al 2022 the watersheds loc ferrisburg and usgs 04282629 little otter creek monkton loc monkton

located in dcb were calibrated using daily streamflow records from the u s geological survey usgs gaging stations u s geological survey 2022 loc monkton wbdc and ebdc are three newly instrumented watersheds with short measured streamflow data from september 2019 to november 2021 26 months that were considered as receptor watersheds in the sbr calibration method loc ferrisburg with a longer streamflow record 31 years daily streamflow was the donor watershed in sbr methodology the primary land cover classes within all watersheds are pasture hay 43 forest 21 and row crop agriculture 5 based on an analysis from the multi resolution land characteristics mrlc national land cover nlcd 2016 dataset dewitz 2021 2 2 hydrologic model initialization the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed process based watershed scale hydrologic model developed by the usda arnold et al 1998 was selected because it has been widely used for watershed assessment and management with over 5000 peer reviewed articles gassman et al 2014 2010 swat simulates the land phase and routing phase of the hydrologic cycle to predict the impact of different management actions on crop production and environmental quality modeled using representations of the watershed divided first into sub basins then each sub basin divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on similar landcover soil type slope class and management arnold et al 2013 for this study we used an adaptation of the swat model rev 681 in the r modeling language the swatmodel package fuka et al 2014b which provides a linear model like r interface to the swat modeling system including an optimization process using the deoptim r package ardia 2009 fuka et al 2014a 2012 collick et al 2015 esmali et al 2020 an r based function with simple objective function creation around a differential evolution algorithm a type of genetic algorithms that uses the operations of crossover mutation and selection on population with successive generations for global optimization especially useful in hydrological modeling where the objective function is noisy and difficult to differentiate mullen et al 2011 deoptim was used to perform both sensitivity analysis and calibration processes to handle the uncertainties in input parameters the parameter ranges were selected and constrained based on prior knowledge about the study area see table 1 we used the build swat basic function in swatmodel to extract a simplified three basins 9 hrus quasi lumped model of the watershed above the usgs gages the basic data required to run swatmodel are the usgs gage information including the size of drainage area elevation of the gage latitude and longitude of the gage and meteorological forcing data the meteorological data including daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature were obtained automatically by the fillmisswx function from the r ecohydrology package which uses the inverse distance weighting idw method hubbard 1994 to estimate missing data from the ghcn weather stations within 30 km of the usgs gages fig 1 shows all the ghcn stations within 30 km of the outlet of the watersheds together these comprise the allowable stations from which weather data are obtained for the sbr donor watershed loc ferrisburg was initialized identically to the other basins though the idw weather assimilation was completed for both the seven years 2015 2021 period and the more common calibration duration of twelve years 2010 2021 2 3 sensitivity analysis to constrain the calibration to only those parameters most influential a sensitivity analysis was conducted saltelli 2004 vemuri et al 1969 based on a review of published swat literature 18 parameters that affect modeled flow were selected for sensitivity analysis table 1 cibin et al 2010 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 leta et al 2015 nossent and bauwens 2012 to conduct the sensitivity analysis we used deoptim function within the r deoptim package to generate five datasets of 300 evolutionary optimization iteration parameter table 1 sets aligned with the progressively increasing nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients nses for each of the periods 2015 2021 and 2010 2021 10 datasets in total each output is therefore a 300 19 data frame the first 18 columns of which are the swatmodel parameter values table 1 and the last column is the nse value between simulated and observed streamflow at loc ferrisburg for that parameter set in the optimization the nse was used as the objective function the number of attempts between evolutions of the parameter vector np was set to 16 in the next step a 299 19 data frame was generated using the changes of individual steps for the optimized parameter values and the corresponding nse between two successive iterations considering the amount of change in each parameter and the nse we removed the parameter that resulted in no change in the nse on any of the 300 successive iterations the remaining parameters are sensitive or influential parameters and therefore retained for calibration table 1 2 4 similarity based regionalization sbr similarity based regionalization sbr model calibration is based on the assumption of similarity between the donor loc ferrisburg and receptor loc monkton wbdc and ebdc watersheds attributes most often used to asses suitability of donor and receptor watersheds in the sbr calibration approaches include watershed drainage area landcover slope soil type mean annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperature elevation and proximity tegegne and kim 2018 as shown in section 2 1 all watersheds have approximately similar physical characteristics weather data for all four watersheds showed adequate similarity based on pearson correlation coefficients r for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature r 0 99 and average absolute error for average temperature and precipitation 0 11 mm for precipitation and 0 20 c for temperature as suggested by deshmukh et al 2022 model calibration was performed on the sensitivity index determined parameters in table 1 for the loc ferrisburg donor watershed using the deoptim package for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the optimized parameter set from calibration was then transferred to three neighboring receptor watersheds loc monkton ebdc and wbdc model performance was assessed using the nse a good statistic for peak flow evaluation ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr a good indicator for average flow conditions and percent bias pbias an indicator of over under prediction of simulated flows for each watershed as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2 5 simultaneous calibration of multiple watershed models mbc the multi basin calibration mbc approach consists of two primary steps first streamflow data from each of three lde watersheds loc monkton ebdc and wbdc are aggregated and second these data are then calibrated as a single dataset fig 2 shows the mbc method framework observed streamflow data obtained from the usgs gages discussed previously are aggregated to create a data frame of combined observed streamflow the combined observed streamflow data frame includes the individual site number the date and streamflow mm for each watershed therefore instead of having only 2 yrs of observed data to calibrate the model the combined observed streamflow data frame now contains 6 years of observed of daily streamflow data 3 watersheds 2 yrs data each this serves to increase the information content improving both the estimates of model parameters and the simulated streamflow after creating combined the observed streamflow data frame swat models of each lde watershed are initialized individually then the modeled streamflow is generated by execution of the models with an initial default parameter set with default values from the input data following model execution the simulated streamflow mm date and corresponding site number from each modeled watershed are aggregated as described above to build a combined simulated although uncalibrated streamflow data frame fig 2 then the combined observed and simulated streamflow data frames are merged by date and site number resulting in a new data frame with the observed and simulated flow for the three watersheds merged by date and site number merged combined observed and simulated streamflow data frame in fig 2 this data frame is the one that is subjected to calibration fig 2 over each iteration of the calibration a new parameter set is generated by the deoptim algorithm is used by swat for the model execution step finally the nse is evaluated fig 2 the calibration process will stop when the maximum number of iterations is reached the simulated streamflow using mbc was assessed for the goodness of fit against observations using nse rsr and pbias for each watershed as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2 6 model evaluation and corroboration due to the short period of recorded streamflow data in each of the watersheds 2 yrs and because hydrological simulations are often subject to non stationary conditions the use of the typical split sampling approach does not capture the variability in the watershed and using full time series calibration is more robust singh and bárdossy 2012 arsenault et al 2018 therefore we calibrated the model for daily streamflow simulation for the entire 6 yr time series to evaluate the model performance we used bootstrapping resampling to obtain the probability distribution of the performance indicators nse rsr and pbias over the entire available 6 yr time period efron 1992 canty 2002 the bootstrap test was performed using 1000 samples of observed and simulated streamflow datasets from each of the sbr and mbc methods for each watershed we also evaluated several model parameters against measurements made in the watersheds and against estimates from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database from natural resources conservation service nrcs http websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov web soil survey 2019 using the soildb package in r beaudette et al 2021 among all the parameters listed in table 1 soil ksat soil awc and soil depth were collected from 50 locations across locb and dcb and compared to model estimated values in addition to streamflow the swat model also estimates the major water balance components including evapotranspiration et surface flow lateral flow groundwater flow and percolation following model calibration the average annual water balance components of three watersheds obtained from each calibration method were assessed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows the nse values solid line shows average shading shows range of 10 datasets consisting of five datasets of 300 iterations for 2015 2021 and five datasets of 300 iterations for 2010 2021 generated by the deoptim algorithm for each iteration of the optimization 300 iterations were selected for sensitivity because we have found it to adequately represent moderate dimension problems and 300 iterations consumed most of the computational time allocated as seen in fig 3 the rate of nse changes decreases significantly after iteration 200 compared to the first 200 iterations for each dataset showing that the setting of maximum iteration number to 300 was sufficient for optimization in addition the ranges of the maximum nse values after 300 iterations for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 are 0 55 0 62 and 0 66 0 70 respectively the potential reason for the difference between nse values for these two time periods is that the latter simulates the shorter simulation period with less variability mohammed et al 2021 and that 93 of the weather data for 2015 2021 are obtained from the closest station 3 2 calibration among the most sensitive parameters shown in table 1 the average condition cn2 value was calibrated independently for each hru based on previous studies in the lcb which indicated it is characterized by variable source area hydrological response buchanan et al 2018 twombly et al 2021 in swat the cn2 is adjusted in the hru management input files mgt since we have three hrus in each subbasin in our study the cn2 was adjusted in the first 1 mgt second 2 mgt and third 3 mgt hru management files representing downslope midslope and upslope hrus for estimation of the range of cn2 in each hru an initial estimate of the cn2 for the entire watershed was calculated by the method described in lyon et al 2004 as applied by easton et al 2011 and was equal to 84 in order to account for the effect of hillslope position and terrain on runoff generation as estimated by the curve number the cn2 for downslope hrus cn2 1 mgt midslope hrus cn2 2 mgt and upslope hrus cn2 3 mgt calibrated with the range of 65 75 75 85 and 85 95 respectively so that the area weighted cn2 equaled 84 also the range of awc multiplier in table 1 was 2 2 5 with the initial value of 2 25 to constrain awc in the same range as measured field awc 3 2 1 calibration of the loc ferrisburg donor watershed for sbr the loc ferrisburg donor watershed was calibrated to maximize the nse and minimize the rsr and pbias between observed and simulated streamflow on a daily time step for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the calibration result showed good agreement between the daily simulated and observed streamflow with nse rsr and pbias of 0 51 0 69 and 22 respectively for 2010 2021 and 0 61 0 60 and 24 respectively for 2015 2021 the optimized parameters from the calibrated watershed for each period are given in table 2 3 2 2 sbr receptor watershed model performance for the similarity based approach the parameter sets 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 calibrated parameters obtained from the calibration of the loc ferrisburg donor watershed table 2 were transferred to three receptor watersheds loc monkton wbdc and ebdc to simulate daily streamflow the sbr calibration in loc monkton resulted in moderately well simulated streamflow nse 0 57 for 2010 2021 0 60 for 2015 2021 rsr 0 65 for 2010 2021 0 63 for 2015 2021 pbias 24 for 2010 2021 23 for 2015 2021 but did not result in adequate streamflow simulation for wbdc and ebdc and there were some differnces in the water balance as well figs 4 5 the adequate performance at loc monkton is likely a result of the loc monkton drainage area representing approximately one half of the total area of locb that is the flows that are generated in loc monkton significantly affect the flows of loc ferrisburg while flows of wbdc and ebdc are independent of loc ferrisburg fig 1 while loc monkton drains into loc ferrisburg station and in practice the loc monkton sub watershed is already calibrated while calibrating the model to the loc ferrisburg s data this study used the short period loc monkton records as the third lde to determine the potential benefits of using multiple short records from a region 3 2 3 simultaneous calibration of multiple basins mbc in this new calibration technique three watersheds loc monkton wbdc and ebdc with short durations of measured data were calibrated simultaneously the optimized parameter set obtained by mbc is listed in table 2 then the parameters obtained from mbc were used to simulate streamflow in individual watersheds the nses between simulated and observed streamflow were 0 52 0 50 and 0 60 for loc monkton wbdc and ebdc watersheds respectively the rsr values were 0 68 for loc monkton 0 69 for wbdc and 0 63 for ebdc the pbias values were 25 for loc monkton 20 for wbdc and 1 for ebdc 3 3 comparison between sbr and mbc considering the widespread use of watershed models to analyze or predict environmental and hydrological processes calibration of watershed models in lde is one of the most challenging and fundamental issues in computational hydrology regionalization is one of the most common approaches used to calibrate watershed models in lde several studies have shown good performance of regionalization methods merz and blöschl 2004 vandewiele and elias 1995 but adequate performance is often contingent on the proximity of watersheds with long term high quality data for instance randrianasolo et al 2011 showed that the optimum distance between donor and receptor watersheds is less than 18 km to achieve the highest model performance indeed as indicated by the poor model performance for the wbdc and ebdc watersheds using sbr where the donor watershed is 23 25 km away the distance between the donor and receptor watersheds is of considerable importance 3 3 1 comparison of parameter estimates and water balance components between sbr and mbc several of the parameters listed table 2 show notable differences between the methods while others are remarkably similar for instance table 2 shows that the cn2 values in the upslope midslope and downslope hrus are similar for all methods indicating consistency among methods with respect to runoff generation this is further corroborated by fig 4 which shows the contribution of et surface runoff lateral flow percolation and baseflow to the overall water balance from each calibration method for the study area the values of surface runoff were similar among methods and ranged from 155 mm mbc to 165 mm sbr 2015 2021 about 15 of the water balance these are also similar to previous studies in the region such as wagena and easton 2018 who estimated annual average surface runoff of 108 mm also approximately 15 of the water balance for the susquehanna river basin in ny and pa easton et al 2008 also estiamted simialr surface runoff losses of 150 mm in the catskill region of ny table 2 also shows that soil depth multiplier and awc multiplier have greater values for mbc than both sbr realizations and ksat multiplier has a lower value the greater depth and awc values for mbc result in greater soil moisture storage reducing lateral flow and percolation and making more moisture available for et which is also confirmed in the water balance fig 4 the lower ksat for mbc may also contribute to lower lateral flows and percolation the surface runoff lag coefficient surlag differs substantially between mbc 0 57 and sbr 0 16 0 22 with surlag 2 3 times greater using the mbc method table 2 surlag controls the timing of the surface runoff contribution to the total flow as surlag increases the surface runoff that is stored in the catchment decrease previous studies tetratech 2013 using swat in the lake champlain basin estimated surlag to be 0 5 similar to the mbc method snow parameters also differed among methods table 2 with mbc calibrations resulting in higher snowpack temperature timp snowfall temperature sftmp and melt factor smfmx and smfmn parameters and lower snowmelt base temperature smtmp parameters all of which leads to less snow accumulation and faster melt rates than in sbr calibrations as the snow melts faster more water is available for evaporation in the soil layer mcnamara and chandler 2005 woelber et al 2018 this might also explain the greater et values for mbc than sbr there are also some differences between et parameter values between the two methods table 2 in mbc the epco parameter which controls the partitioning of the evaporative demand between the upper soil layer near 0 and deeper soil layer near 1 was lower 0 78 indicating that more plant water extraction occurs from the upper soil layer than in the sbr calibration 0 90 the esco value which controls the evaporative demand from deeper soil layers is slightly lower in mbc than the sbr approaches allowing the mbc model extracts moisture from deeper soil layers allowing more et indeed et using the mbc method was greater than the either sbr method 594 mm for mbc 571 mm for sbr 2015 2021 and 585 mm for sbr 2010 2021 fig 4 these values are in line with those of church et al 1995 and shanley and denner 1999 which showed the et in the regions ranges between 500 and 600 mm or roughly 50 of the water balance for parameters that influence groundwater table 2 the groundwater lag time gw delay obtained from mbc 25 84 is greater than sbr 3 35 6 25 suggesting longer residence times for the mbc methods the gw delay is the time lag between the exit of water from the soil profile and its entry into the shallow aquifer as the gw delay increases the shallow aquifer take longer to recharge the greater gw delay for the mbc method better represents the geomorphological characteristics of the watershed with the low permeability of clay soils and is remarkably similar to the gw delay of 25 days reported in tetratech 2013 for the little otter creek watershed the parameter that describes the threshold depth for return flow in shallow aquifers gwqmn is substantially greater for mbc 188 than for sbr 7 58 9 31 indicating considerably more water must be in the groundwater system for baseflow generation in mbc finally the baseflow recession constant alpha bf is higher for mbc 0 94 than sbr 0 52 0 91 indicating a more rapid response to recharge with very shallow groundwater levels combined the groundwater parameters resulted that greater groundwater contributions for mbc 263 mm than for sbr 205 mm for 2010 2021 and 225 mm for 2015 2021 deslandes et al 2007 reported similar groundwater 271 mm contributions using swat in the region 3 3 2 comparison of flow generation between sbr and mbc the hydrographs and scatter plots of simulated and observed streamflow using calibrated parameters obtained from sbr 2010 2021 and sbr 2015 2021 and mbc are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 for the loc monkton watershed using sbr for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 peak flows dry period and water balance as indicated by the proximity to the 1 1 line of the simulation approximately matched the observation fig 5a and fig 6a for the mbc method the hydrograph of loc monkton shows that although the magnitudes of some of the simulated storm events are moderately overestimated fig 5a the simulated results track the 1 1 line reasonably well fig 6a in both dcb watersheds using sbr for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the peak flows were significantly underestimated figs 5b and 5c for both wbdc and ebdc using mbc the hydrographs show the models capture the timing relatively well but they tend to underpredict storm events figs 5b and 5c the scatter plots figs 6a 6b and 6c show that in all three watersheds mbc results in tighter data points falling along the 1 1 line showing that this approach predicts hydrological mass balance better also the results show that nse using mbc for both dcb watersheds was substantially higher than those obtained using the sbr method fig 6 also shows cumulative observed and simulated flow for sbr and mbc for loc monkton fig 6e wbdc fig 6f and ebdc fig 6g for loc monkton and ebdc all methods have similar cumulative flows that are also similar to the cumulative observed flow although for loc monkton slightly underestimated for the wbdc watershed the streamflow simulated using both methods followed similar patterns although there was a tendency to overestimate flows 3 4 model evaluation and corroboration the confidence intervals of the performance indicators nse rsr and pbias with 95 confidence level for sbr 2010 2021 sbr 2015 2021 and mbc methods and for each watershed are shown in table 3 and indicate that the mbc method resulted in satisfactory model performance ratings for all nse rsr and pbias in all three watersheds moriasi et al 2007 sbr resulted in satisfactory model performance in loc monkton but similar to model calibration resulted in unsatisfactory model performance in wbdc and ebdc watersheds table 4 shows soil parameter values including average depth mm awc mm mm and ksat mm hr obtained from sbr and mbc calibrations corresponding values from the ssurgo database and field measurements as can be seen in table 4 the mbc method provided parameter estimates that were more closely aligned with field measurements whereas the average soil depth obtained from sbr is more closely aligned with ssurgo for awc all estimated values obtained from calibration sbr and mbc are within the range of the field measurements calibrated ksat values from mbc tended to most closely align with field measurements while sbr ksat values were better aligned with ssurgo estimates although both approaches rely on the assumption of similarity between watersheds the mbc method results in more reasonable estimates of parameter values and can be employed in areas without long term measurements indeed the mbc method assumes the basins all have the same equations describing parameters a very similar assumption to the similarity based approach however the mbc approach ultimately provides the mean value for the basins included rather than propagating one basin through the rest as in sbr this not only allows the mbc to calibrate multiple basins with a much fewer observations or shorter record but also allows mbc to consider in the calibration a greater diversity of the regions characteristics operationally sbr also requires a neighboring donor watershed with a long period of recorded data which is difficult to find in a real world application uereyen and kuenzer 2019 4 conclusions this study introduced a new calibration method mbc for the calibration of watersheds with limited observed data the mbc approach to parameter estimation of lde is applicable in multiple neighboring basins with similar attributes including land cover soil type mean annual precipitation and temperature the calibrated parameters and model performance were compared to the traditional sbr calibration method to evaluate model parameters we compared the soil storage parameters including depth awc and ksat of mbc and sbr with the field measurements that showed the mbc methodology estimated the soil parameters with the closest values to the field measurements the nse values revealed that mbc outperformed sbr 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 for wbdc and ebdc streamflow simulations of both wbdc and ebdc models resulted in poor model performance for sbr 2010 2021 0 25 and 0 29 respectively and 2015 2021 0 04 and 0 01 respectively the mbc method enhanced the nse of wbdc and ebdc to a satisfactory range 0 50 and 0 60 respectively sbr methodology calibrates a donor watershed while calibration of the mbc method extends over all locb and dcb watersheds leading to better capture of watershed characteristics and estimation of model parameters in addition as previously mentioned sbr and regionalization methods require at least one donor watershed however the vast majority of watersheds globally are unmonitored without any donor watersheds in their immediate vicinity thus the mbc technique provides a framework for watershed modelers and hydrologists to quickly install streamflow gages in several neighboring watersheds and use a short duration of measured streamflow data for their hydrological models and subsequent watershed management purposes this study demonstrates that short periods of hydrological measurement from multiple locations in a basin can represent a system similarly to long term measurements and that even short records taken at multiple locations significantly improve our hydrologic knowledge of a system as compared to relying on the similarity of nearby basins this study used only three lde watersheds including more watersheds may improve the performance of the model because the information available to inform the model increases the mbc technique improves the performance of hydrological models by incorporating more information using multiple basins during the calibration process future work could focus on assessing model uncertainty for both the sbr and mbc methods to determine whether incorporating more information as in the mbc method reduces model uncertainty finally we should also note that the methodology has not been tested in other regions or under more diverse conditions therefore future work should focus on evaluating the method under new conditions

7766,study region three watersheds in the lake champlain basin of vermont usa study focus watershed models are essential for evaluating the impact of watershed management however they contain many parameters that are not directly measurable these parameters are commonly estimated by calibration against observed data often streamflow unfortunately many areas lack long term streamflow records making parameter estimation in low data environments lde challenging a new calibration technique simultaneous multi basin calibration mbc was developed to estimate model parameters in lde three soil and water assessment tool swat model initializations for usgs gages with 2 year records in the lake champlain basin of vermont usa were evaluated by comparing mbc and the commonly used similarity based regionalization sbr approach where calibrated parameters from a watershed with an extended data record are transferred to the lde receptor watersheds in mbc each watershed is initialized and observed flows from each initialization are aggregated to generate a combined streamflow record of sufficient length to calibrate using a differential evolution algorithm new hydrological insights for the region using this new mbc method we demonstrate improved model performance and more realistic model parameter values this study demonstrates that short periods of hydrological measurement from multiple locations in a basin can represent a system similarly to long term measurements and that even short records taken at multiple locations significantly improve our hydrologic knowledge of a system as compared to relying on the similarity of a basin with a long record of flow in addition this study revealed that the hydrologic response is mediated by the interplay of very low soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and cracking soils as a result even if ksat is very low cracking clays have a large impact on runoff production garna et al 2022 graphical abstract ga1 keywords

often used to quantify and predict diverse and complicated hydrologic system behavior and are often used to manage environmental and water resources a process based hydrological model consists of equations and parameters that describe watershed processes such as snow accumulation groundwater flow runoff generation and evapotranspiration devia et al 2015 sorooshian et al 2008 since hydrological models represent simplified versions of natural processes they are inherently uncertain moges et al 2020 orth et al 2015 renard et al 2010 wagena et al 2019 the primary sources of uncertainty are model structure simplified process representation input data limited measurements and parameter estimation difficulties in specifying exact parameter values ehlers et al 2018 gupta and govindaraju 2019 jin et al 2010 moges et al 2020 setegn et al 2009 many parameters in watershed scale models cannot be measured directly due to process complexity limitations in measurement methods and spatiotemporal heterogeneity therefore it is necessary to estimate the parameter value through model calibration gupta and govindaraju 2019 model calibration adjusts the model parameters within feasible parameter ranges veith et al 2010 so that model responses such as streamflow show good agreement with the observed values singh and frevert 2002 hydrologic systems are characterized by complex processes and many interactions and are driven by exogenous forcing making model parameter estimation critical and often difficult this is especially apparent in watersheds without long term data or in regions characterized by rapid environmental change mirza 2011 schiermeier 2011 trenberth 2009 2005 wagena et al 2016 in addition insufficient information about model parameter values makes it difficult to model hydrological systems in their full complexity and heterogeneity natural variability is thus aggregated to a great extent by models leading to the potential of equifinality the situation when there is more than one possible model parameter set that results in suitable simulation results beven 1993 seibert et al 2019 equifinality is intensified by over parameterization her and chaubey 2015 and is one of the most common issues that hydrologists encounter while using hydrological models van griensven et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to constrain the calibration processes to only those most influential parameters using sensitivity analysis veith et al 2010 streamflow is one of the primary observed measurements used to calibrate watershed models because it is a good integrator of the hydrological mass balance for a basin and various processes occurring in the watershed such as atmospheric exchange soil moisture redistribution runoff generation and evapotranspiration hui et al 2020 wambura et al 2018 successful calibration often requires a suitable record of observed streamflow daggupati et al 2015 however in many watersheds observed streamflow data are unavailable or only exist for short durations sivapalan et al 2003 making calibration a challenging process to deal with this problem and to estimate streamflow in low data environments lde two different regionalization techniques are commonly used blöschl and sivapalan 1995 statistically based sivapalan et al 2003 yadav et al 2007 and similarity based farsadnia et al 2014 mengistu et al 2019 rafiei emam et al 2017 vandewiele and elias 1995 statistical based approaches identify relationships between calibrated model parameters in watersheds with adequate available data and watershed attributes in lde such as soil type topography or drainage area lee et al 2006 parajka et al 2005 previous studies often report statistical methods unable to suitably simulate streamflow merz and blöschl 2004 peel et al 2000 the similarity based approach similarity based regionalization sbr estimates lde watershed model parameters by transferring parameter values from a donor often nearby watershed with a suitable calibration masih et al 2010 samuel et al 2011 vandewiele and elias 1995 while sbr is the most commonly used techniques for parameter estimation in lde it is challenging to obtain representative parameter estimates sivapalan et al 2003 because the uncertainty embedded in the parameters of the donor watershed directly impact and often increase the uncertainty of parameters in the lde sellami et al 2014 comparisons of the statistically based and regionalization methods show that the regionalization methods result in better model simulations with studies from bao et al 2012 merz et al 2011 and oudin et al 2008 investigating 55 watersheds in china 308 watersheds in australia and 913 watersheds in france respectively all showing better performance of sbr under multiple hydroclimate conditions this study demonstrates a new simultaneous multi basin calibration mbc method that can be used to calibrate basins with short streamflow records in lde to test the new method we use three newly instrumented united states department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs conservation effects assessment project ceap watersheds usda nrcs 2019 with short streamflow duration records 2 years and a donor watershed with 31 years of daily streamflow data we select twelve years of streamflow data of the donor watershed from 2010 to the present because more than 10 years of recorded streamflow data is a common length for calibration and needed to adequately represent hydroclimatic variability feyereisen et al 2007 oeurng et al 2011 shi et al 2011 the three newly instrumented watersheds are located at distances 1 23 and 25 km from the watershed with a longer record distances often cited as appropriate for parameter regionalization lebecherel et al 2016 the results of the new mbc methodology are compared to the sbr regionalization technique of using a neighboring basin with a longer streamflow duration record donor watershed and by comparing calibrated parameters and simulated streamflow obtained by the sbr and mbc in the three low data watersheds to demonstrate the extent to which the methods capture physical processes within the basin we compare calibrated parameters against measured soil data collected in the watersheds including soil depth saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water capacity all calibrated parameters in the model as well the objective of this work is to develop a new calibration method that improves model performance and increases the information content of watershed models in low data environments and to improve model parameter estimation to enhance process understanding 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located within the lake champlain basin lcb of vermont vt usa lake champlain is a 193 kilometer long freshwater lake on the western border of vt that provides drinking water to approximately 200 000 people in the us and québec the lake is a large economic generator for the region approx 3 8 billion generated over 1998 1999 lcbp 2016 lake champlain has been subject to periodic harmful algal blooms habs which most commonly occur in a number of shallow bays spread throughout the vermont shoreline elevated phosphorus p delivery to freshwater systems has been documented to contribute to hab formation davis et al 2010 huang et al 2020 and is generally considered a key factor driving occurrence in lake champlain dairy farming is the primary agricultural sector in the vt portion of the basin and approximately 38 of the total p reaching the lake is estimated to be from nonpoint agricultural sources troy et al 2007 the little otter creek locb and the dead creek dcb basins are both located in the southern portion of the basin within 10 km of one another and have recently 2019 been instrumented as usda nrcs ceap watersheds to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs to guide usda conservation policy and program development under agreements between usgs and usda the locb with an area of 158 square kilometers km2 above the usgs gage 04282650 loc ferrisburg u s geological survey 2021a and the dcb with an area of 96 km2 above the intersection of vermont route 17 vt 17 and dead creek are located in addison county vermont within the champlain valley physiographic province stewart and macclintock 1969 which drain into lake champlain at hawkins bay and fields bay respectively fig 1 weather data from closest global historical climate network ghcn weather stations menne et al 2012 fig 1 show that precipitation in the area averages 1058 millimeters per year the mean annual maximum temperature is 13 2 c while the mean minimum temperature is 1 9 c the physiography of dcb watersheds are relatively uniform with a mean slope of 2 7 and a maximum of 53 4 the locb watersheds have a mean of 5 7 and maximum of 57 9 fig 1 the soil data obtained from the usda s websoilsurvey web soil survey 2019 show that the area is dominated by vergennes clay 2 6 slope 40 6 12 slope 7 2 and 12 25 slope 16 3 covington and panton silty clays 21 and silt loams 11 fig 1 the minimum and maximum elevation of the study area are 45 m and 185 m respectively fifty soil samples were collected across locb and dcb watersheds from the depth of 6 in in the fall of 2020 by the vermont association of conservative districts usda nrcs 2019 these soil samples were analyzed using the cornell soil health protocol moebius clune et al 2016 for soil texture and available water capacity awc soil depth and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were estimated based upon field measurements using a constant head permeameter and observations within the watershed area the region is also characterized by swelling cracking clay soils with very low ksat 1 mm h in many areas ruggiero et al 2022 the watersheds loc ferrisburg and usgs 04282629 little otter creek monkton loc monkton

located in dcb were calibrated using daily streamflow records from the u s geological survey usgs gaging stations u s geological survey 2022 loc monkton wbdc and ebdc are three newly instrumented watersheds with short measured streamflow data from september 2019 to november 2021 26 months that were considered as receptor watersheds in the sbr calibration method loc ferrisburg with a longer streamflow record 31 years daily streamflow was the donor watershed in sbr methodology the primary land cover classes within all watersheds are pasture hay 43 forest 21 and row crop agriculture 5 based on an analysis from the multi resolution land characteristics mrlc national land cover nlcd 2016 dataset dewitz 2021 2 2 hydrologic model initialization the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed process based watershed scale hydrologic model developed by the usda arnold et al 1998 was selected because it has been widely used for watershed assessment and management with over 5000 peer reviewed articles gassman et al 2014 2010 swat simulates the land phase and routing phase of the hydrologic cycle to predict the impact of different management actions on crop production and environmental quality modeled using representations of the watershed divided first into sub basins then each sub basin divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on similar landcover soil type slope class and management arnold et al 2013 for this study we used an adaptation of the swat model rev 681 in the r modeling language the swatmodel package fuka et al 2014b which provides a linear model like r interface to the swat modeling system including an optimization process using the deoptim r package ardia 2009 fuka et al 2014a 2012 collick et al 2015 esmali et al 2020 an r based function with simple objective function creation around a differential evolution algorithm a type of genetic algorithms that uses the operations of crossover mutation and selection on population with successive generations for global optimization especially useful in hydrological modeling where the objective function is noisy and difficult to differentiate mullen et al 2011 deoptim was used to perform both sensitivity analysis and calibration processes to handle the uncertainties in input parameters the parameter ranges were selected and constrained based on prior knowledge about the study area see table 1 we used the build swat basic function in swatmodel to extract a simplified three basins 9 hrus quasi lumped model of the watershed above the usgs gages the basic data required to run swatmodel are the usgs gage information including the size of drainage area elevation of the gage latitude and longitude of the gage and meteorological forcing data the meteorological data including daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature were obtained automatically by the fillmisswx function from the r ecohydrology package which uses the inverse distance weighting idw method hubbard 1994 to estimate missing data from the ghcn weather stations within 30 km of the usgs gages fig 1 shows all the ghcn stations within 30 km of the outlet of the watersheds together these comprise the allowable stations from which weather data are obtained for the sbr donor watershed loc ferrisburg was initialized identically to the other basins though the idw weather assimilation was completed for both the seven years 2015 2021 period and the more common calibration duration of twelve years 2010 2021 2 3 sensitivity analysis to constrain the calibration to only those parameters most influential a sensitivity analysis was conducted saltelli 2004 vemuri et al 1969 based on a review of published swat literature 18 parameters that affect modeled flow were selected for sensitivity analysis table 1 cibin et al 2010 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 leta et al 2015 nossent and bauwens 2012 to conduct the sensitivity analysis we used deoptim function within the r deoptim package to generate five datasets of 300 evolutionary optimization iteration parameter table 1 sets aligned with the progressively increasing nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients nses for each of the periods 2015 2021 and 2010 2021 10 datasets in total each output is therefore a 300 19 data frame the first 18 columns of which are the swatmodel parameter values table 1 and the last column is the nse value between simulated and observed streamflow at loc ferrisburg for that parameter set in the optimization the nse was used as the objective function the number of attempts between evolutions of the parameter vector np was set to 16 in the next step a 299 19 data frame was generated using the changes of individual steps for the optimized parameter values and the corresponding nse between two successive iterations considering the amount of change in each parameter and the nse we removed the parameter that resulted in no change in the nse on any of the 300 successive iterations the remaining parameters are sensitive or influential parameters and therefore retained for calibration table 1 2 4 similarity based regionalization sbr similarity based regionalization sbr model calibration is based on the assumption of similarity between the donor loc ferrisburg and receptor loc monkton wbdc and ebdc watersheds attributes most often used to asses suitability of donor and receptor watersheds in the sbr calibration approaches include watershed drainage area landcover slope soil type mean annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperature elevation and proximity tegegne and kim 2018 as shown in section 2 1 all watersheds have approximately similar physical characteristics weather data for all four watersheds showed adequate similarity based on pearson correlation coefficients r for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature r 0 99 and average absolute error for average temperature and precipitation 0 11 mm for precipitation and 0 20 c for temperature as suggested by deshmukh et al 2022 model calibration was performed on the sensitivity index determined parameters in table 1 for the loc ferrisburg donor watershed using the deoptim package for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the optimized parameter set from calibration was then transferred to three neighboring receptor watersheds loc monkton ebdc and wbdc model performance was assessed using the nse a good statistic for peak flow evaluation ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr a good indicator for average flow conditions and percent bias pbias an indicator of over under prediction of simulated flows for each watershed as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2 5 simultaneous calibration of multiple watershed models mbc the multi basin calibration mbc approach consists of two primary steps first streamflow data from each of three lde watersheds loc monkton ebdc and wbdc are aggregated and second these data are then calibrated as a single dataset fig 2 shows the mbc method framework observed streamflow data obtained from the usgs gages discussed previously are aggregated to create a data frame of combined observed streamflow the combined observed streamflow data frame includes the individual site number the date and streamflow mm for each watershed therefore instead of having only 2 yrs of observed data to calibrate the model the combined observed streamflow data frame now contains 6 years of observed of daily streamflow data 3 watersheds 2 yrs data each this serves to increase the information content improving both the estimates of model parameters and the simulated streamflow after creating combined the observed streamflow data frame swat models of each lde watershed are initialized individually then the modeled streamflow is generated by execution of the models with an initial default parameter set with default values from the input data following model execution the simulated streamflow mm date and corresponding site number from each modeled watershed are aggregated as described above to build a combined simulated although uncalibrated streamflow data frame fig 2 then the combined observed and simulated streamflow data frames are merged by date and site number resulting in a new data frame with the observed and simulated flow for the three watersheds merged by date and site number merged combined observed and simulated streamflow data frame in fig 2 this data frame is the one that is subjected to calibration fig 2 over each iteration of the calibration a new parameter set is generated by the deoptim algorithm is used by swat for the model execution step finally the nse is evaluated fig 2 the calibration process will stop when the maximum number of iterations is reached the simulated streamflow using mbc was assessed for the goodness of fit against observations using nse rsr and pbias for each watershed as recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2 6 model evaluation and corroboration due to the short period of recorded streamflow data in each of the watersheds 2 yrs and because hydrological simulations are often subject to non stationary conditions the use of the typical split sampling approach does not capture the variability in the watershed and using full time series calibration is more robust singh and bárdossy 2012 arsenault et al 2018 therefore we calibrated the model for daily streamflow simulation for the entire 6 yr time series to evaluate the model performance we used bootstrapping resampling to obtain the probability distribution of the performance indicators nse rsr and pbias over the entire available 6 yr time period efron 1992 canty 2002 the bootstrap test was performed using 1000 samples of observed and simulated streamflow datasets from each of the sbr and mbc methods for each watershed we also evaluated several model parameters against measurements made in the watersheds and against estimates from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database from natural resources conservation service nrcs http websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov web soil survey 2019 using the soildb package in r beaudette et al 2021 among all the parameters listed in table 1 soil ksat soil awc and soil depth were collected from 50 locations across locb and dcb and compared to model estimated values in addition to streamflow the swat model also estimates the major water balance components including evapotranspiration et surface flow lateral flow groundwater flow and percolation following model calibration the average annual water balance components of three watersheds obtained from each calibration method were assessed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows the nse values solid line shows average shading shows range of 10 datasets consisting of five datasets of 300 iterations for 2015 2021 and five datasets of 300 iterations for 2010 2021 generated by the deoptim algorithm for each iteration of the optimization 300 iterations were selected for sensitivity because we have found it to adequately represent moderate dimension problems and 300 iterations consumed most of the computational time allocated as seen in fig 3 the rate of nse changes decreases significantly after iteration 200 compared to the first 200 iterations for each dataset showing that the setting of maximum iteration number to 300 was sufficient for optimization in addition the ranges of the maximum nse values after 300 iterations for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 are 0 55 0 62 and 0 66 0 70 respectively the potential reason for the difference between nse values for these two time periods is that the latter simulates the shorter simulation period with less variability mohammed et al 2021 and that 93 of the weather data for 2015 2021 are obtained from the closest station 3 2 calibration among the most sensitive parameters shown in table 1 the average condition cn2 value was calibrated independently for each hru based on previous studies in the lcb which indicated it is characterized by variable source area hydrological response buchanan et al 2018 twombly et al 2021 in swat the cn2 is adjusted in the hru management input files mgt since we have three hrus in each subbasin in our study the cn2 was adjusted in the first 1 mgt second 2 mgt and third 3 mgt hru management files representing downslope midslope and upslope hrus for estimation of the range of cn2 in each hru an initial estimate of the cn2 for the entire watershed was calculated by the method described in lyon et al 2004 as applied by easton et al 2011 and was equal to 84 in order to account for the effect of hillslope position and terrain on runoff generation as estimated by the curve number the cn2 for downslope hrus cn2 1 mgt midslope hrus cn2 2 mgt and upslope hrus cn2 3 mgt calibrated with the range of 65 75 75 85 and 85 95 respectively so that the area weighted cn2 equaled 84 also the range of awc multiplier in table 1 was 2 2 5 with the initial value of 2 25 to constrain awc in the same range as measured field awc 3 2 1 calibration of the loc ferrisburg donor watershed for sbr the loc ferrisburg donor watershed was calibrated to maximize the nse and minimize the rsr and pbias between observed and simulated streamflow on a daily time step for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the calibration result showed good agreement between the daily simulated and observed streamflow with nse rsr and pbias of 0 51 0 69 and 22 respectively for 2010 2021 and 0 61 0 60 and 24 respectively for 2015 2021 the optimized parameters from the calibrated watershed for each period are given in table 2 3 2 2 sbr receptor watershed model performance for the similarity based approach the parameter sets 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 calibrated parameters obtained from the calibration of the loc ferrisburg donor watershed table 2 were transferred to three receptor watersheds loc monkton wbdc and ebdc to simulate daily streamflow the sbr calibration in loc monkton resulted in moderately well simulated streamflow nse 0 57 for 2010 2021 0 60 for 2015 2021 rsr 0 65 for 2010 2021 0 63 for 2015 2021 pbias 24 for 2010 2021 23 for 2015 2021 but did not result in adequate streamflow simulation for wbdc and ebdc and there were some differnces in the water balance as well figs 4 5 the adequate performance at loc monkton is likely a result of the loc monkton drainage area representing approximately one half of the total area of locb that is the flows that are generated in loc monkton significantly affect the flows of loc ferrisburg while flows of wbdc and ebdc are independent of loc ferrisburg fig 1 while loc monkton drains into loc ferrisburg station and in practice the loc monkton sub watershed is already calibrated while calibrating the model to the loc ferrisburg s data this study used the short period loc monkton records as the third lde to determine the potential benefits of using multiple short records from a region 3 2 3 simultaneous calibration of multiple basins mbc in this new calibration technique three watersheds loc monkton wbdc and ebdc with short durations of measured data were calibrated simultaneously the optimized parameter set obtained by mbc is listed in table 2 then the parameters obtained from mbc were used to simulate streamflow in individual watersheds the nses between simulated and observed streamflow were 0 52 0 50 and 0 60 for loc monkton wbdc and ebdc watersheds respectively the rsr values were 0 68 for loc monkton 0 69 for wbdc and 0 63 for ebdc the pbias values were 25 for loc monkton 20 for wbdc and 1 for ebdc 3 3 comparison between sbr and mbc considering the widespread use of watershed models to analyze or predict environmental and hydrological processes calibration of watershed models in lde is one of the most challenging and fundamental issues in computational hydrology regionalization is one of the most common approaches used to calibrate watershed models in lde several studies have shown good performance of regionalization methods merz and blöschl 2004 vandewiele and elias 1995 but adequate performance is often contingent on the proximity of watersheds with long term high quality data for instance randrianasolo et al 2011 showed that the optimum distance between donor and receptor watersheds is less than 18 km to achieve the highest model performance indeed as indicated by the poor model performance for the wbdc and ebdc watersheds using sbr where the donor watershed is 23 25 km away the distance between the donor and receptor watersheds is of considerable importance 3 3 1 comparison of parameter estimates and water balance components between sbr and mbc several of the parameters listed table 2 show notable differences between the methods while others are remarkably similar for instance table 2 shows that the cn2 values in the upslope midslope and downslope hrus are similar for all methods indicating consistency among methods with respect to runoff generation this is further corroborated by fig 4 which shows the contribution of et surface runoff lateral flow percolation and baseflow to the overall water balance from each calibration method for the study area the values of surface runoff were similar among methods and ranged from 155 mm mbc to 165 mm sbr 2015 2021 about 15 of the water balance these are also similar to previous studies in the region such as wagena and easton 2018 who estimated annual average surface runoff of 108 mm also approximately 15 of the water balance for the susquehanna river basin in ny and pa easton et al 2008 also estiamted simialr surface runoff losses of 150 mm in the catskill region of ny table 2 also shows that soil depth multiplier and awc multiplier have greater values for mbc than both sbr realizations and ksat multiplier has a lower value the greater depth and awc values for mbc result in greater soil moisture storage reducing lateral flow and percolation and making more moisture available for et which is also confirmed in the water balance fig 4 the lower ksat for mbc may also contribute to lower lateral flows and percolation the surface runoff lag coefficient surlag differs substantially between mbc 0 57 and sbr 0 16 0 22 with surlag 2 3 times greater using the mbc method table 2 surlag controls the timing of the surface runoff contribution to the total flow as surlag increases the surface runoff that is stored in the catchment decrease previous studies tetratech 2013 using swat in the lake champlain basin estimated surlag to be 0 5 similar to the mbc method snow parameters also differed among methods table 2 with mbc calibrations resulting in higher snowpack temperature timp snowfall temperature sftmp and melt factor smfmx and smfmn parameters and lower snowmelt base temperature smtmp parameters all of which leads to less snow accumulation and faster melt rates than in sbr calibrations as the snow melts faster more water is available for evaporation in the soil layer mcnamara and chandler 2005 woelber et al 2018 this might also explain the greater et values for mbc than sbr there are also some differences between et parameter values between the two methods table 2 in mbc the epco parameter which controls the partitioning of the evaporative demand between the upper soil layer near 0 and deeper soil layer near 1 was lower 0 78 indicating that more plant water extraction occurs from the upper soil layer than in the sbr calibration 0 90 the esco value which controls the evaporative demand from deeper soil layers is slightly lower in mbc than the sbr approaches allowing the mbc model extracts moisture from deeper soil layers allowing more et indeed et using the mbc method was greater than the either sbr method 594 mm for mbc 571 mm for sbr 2015 2021 and 585 mm for sbr 2010 2021 fig 4 these values are in line with those of church et al 1995 and shanley and denner 1999 which showed the et in the regions ranges between 500 and 600 mm or roughly 50 of the water balance for parameters that influence groundwater table 2 the groundwater lag time gw delay obtained from mbc 25 84 is greater than sbr 3 35 6 25 suggesting longer residence times for the mbc methods the gw delay is the time lag between the exit of water from the soil profile and its entry into the shallow aquifer as the gw delay increases the shallow aquifer take longer to recharge the greater gw delay for the mbc method better represents the geomorphological characteristics of the watershed with the low permeability of clay soils and is remarkably similar to the gw delay of 25 days reported in tetratech 2013 for the little otter creek watershed the parameter that describes the threshold depth for return flow in shallow aquifers gwqmn is substantially greater for mbc 188 than for sbr 7 58 9 31 indicating considerably more water must be in the groundwater system for baseflow generation in mbc finally the baseflow recession constant alpha bf is higher for mbc 0 94 than sbr 0 52 0 91 indicating a more rapid response to recharge with very shallow groundwater levels combined the groundwater parameters resulted that greater groundwater contributions for mbc 263 mm than for sbr 205 mm for 2010 2021 and 225 mm for 2015 2021 deslandes et al 2007 reported similar groundwater 271 mm contributions using swat in the region 3 3 2 comparison of flow generation between sbr and mbc the hydrographs and scatter plots of simulated and observed streamflow using calibrated parameters obtained from sbr 2010 2021 and sbr 2015 2021 and mbc are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 for the loc monkton watershed using sbr for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 peak flows dry period and water balance as indicated by the proximity to the 1 1 line of the simulation approximately matched the observation fig 5a and fig 6a for the mbc method the hydrograph of loc monkton shows that although the magnitudes of some of the simulated storm events are moderately overestimated fig 5a the simulated results track the 1 1 line reasonably well fig 6a in both dcb watersheds using sbr for 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 the peak flows were significantly underestimated figs 5b and 5c for both wbdc and ebdc using mbc the hydrographs show the models capture the timing relatively well but they tend to underpredict storm events figs 5b and 5c the scatter plots figs 6a 6b and 6c show that in all three watersheds mbc results in tighter data points falling along the 1 1 line showing that this approach predicts hydrological mass balance better also the results show that nse using mbc for both dcb watersheds was substantially higher than those obtained using the sbr method fig 6 also shows cumulative observed and simulated flow for sbr and mbc for loc monkton fig 6e wbdc fig 6f and ebdc fig 6g for loc monkton and ebdc all methods have similar cumulative flows that are also similar to the cumulative observed flow although for loc monkton slightly underestimated for the wbdc watershed the streamflow simulated using both methods followed similar patterns although there was a tendency to overestimate flows 3 4 model evaluation and corroboration the confidence intervals of the performance indicators nse rsr and pbias with 95 confidence level for sbr 2010 2021 sbr 2015 2021 and mbc methods and for each watershed are shown in table 3 and indicate that the mbc method resulted in satisfactory model performance ratings for all nse rsr and pbias in all three watersheds moriasi et al 2007 sbr resulted in satisfactory model performance in loc monkton but similar to model calibration resulted in unsatisfactory model performance in wbdc and ebdc watersheds table 4 shows soil parameter values including average depth mm awc mm mm and ksat mm hr obtained from sbr and mbc calibrations corresponding values from the ssurgo database and field measurements as can be seen in table 4 the mbc method provided parameter estimates that were more closely aligned with field measurements whereas the average soil depth obtained from sbr is more closely aligned with ssurgo for awc all estimated values obtained from calibration sbr and mbc are within the range of the field measurements calibrated ksat values from mbc tended to most closely align with field measurements while sbr ksat values were better aligned with ssurgo estimates although both approaches rely on the assumption of similarity between watersheds the mbc method results in more reasonable estimates of parameter values and can be employed in areas without long term measurements indeed the mbc method assumes the basins all have the same equations describing parameters a very similar assumption to the similarity based approach however the mbc approach ultimately provides the mean value for the basins included rather than propagating one basin through the rest as in sbr this not only allows the mbc to calibrate multiple basins with a much fewer observations or shorter record but also allows mbc to consider in the calibration a greater diversity of the regions characteristics operationally sbr also requires a neighboring donor watershed with a long period of recorded data which is difficult to find in a real world application uereyen and kuenzer 2019 4 conclusions this study introduced a new calibration method mbc for the calibration of watersheds with limited observed data the mbc approach to parameter estimation of lde is applicable in multiple neighboring basins with similar attributes including land cover soil type mean annual precipitation and temperature the calibrated parameters and model performance were compared to the traditional sbr calibration method to evaluate model parameters we compared the soil storage parameters including depth awc and ksat of mbc and sbr with the field measurements that showed the mbc methodology estimated the soil parameters with the closest values to the field measurements the nse values revealed that mbc outperformed sbr 2010 2021 and 2015 2021 for wbdc and ebdc streamflow simulations of both wbdc and ebdc models resulted in poor model performance for sbr 2010 2021 0 25 and 0 29 respectively and 2015 2021 0 04 and 0 01 respectively the mbc method enhanced the nse of wbdc and ebdc to a satisfactory range 0 50 and 0 60 respectively sbr methodology calibrates a donor watershed while calibration of the mbc method extends over all locb and dcb watersheds leading to better capture of watershed characteristics and estimation of model parameters in addition as previously mentioned sbr and regionalization methods require at least one donor watershed however the vast majority of watersheds globally are unmonitored without any donor watersheds in their immediate vicinity thus the mbc technique provides a framework for watershed modelers and hydrologists to quickly install streamflow gages in several neighboring watersheds and use a short duration of measured streamflow data for their hydrological models and subsequent watershed management purposes this study demonstrates that short periods of hydrological measurement from multiple locations in a basin can represent a system similarly to long term measurements and that even short records taken at multiple locations significantly improve our hydrologic knowledge of a system as compared to relying on the similarity of nearby basins this study used only three lde watersheds including more watersheds may improve the performance of the model because the information available to inform the model increases the mbc technique improves the performance of hydrological models by incorporating more information using multiple basins during the calibration process future work could focus on assessing model uncertainty for both the sbr and mbc methods to determine whether incorporating more information as in the mbc method reduces model uncertainty finally we should also note that the methodology has not been tested in other regions or under more diverse conditions therefore future work should focus on evaluating the method under new conditions

7767,study region river basins with glacier ratios ranging from 1 8 to 20 7 in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau study focus the response of runoff processes in basins with different glacier ratios under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c was explored based on sphy spatial processes in hydrology model and gcms general circulation models new hydrological insights for the region more prominent temperature and precipitation changes were observed in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau compared with the global averages with increasing temperature and precipitation the total runoff and glacier runoff of these basins showed increasing trends under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c compared with the baseline period 1985 2014 increases were observed in the total runoff 1 7 20 6 base flow 2 8 8 3 glacier runoff 8 1 35 9 and rainfall runoff 6 0 36 0 of these basins in contrast snowmelt runoff decreased 28 3 4 3 therefore relevant management and allocation of water resources may be required the hydrological regulation function of glaciers was found to be strongly correlated with glacier ratio in general the hydrological regulation function of glaciers would decrease in the future along with warming induced glacier retreat these findings would help deepen the understanding of runoff processes on the tibetan plateau and other alpine regions thus providing a scientific basis for water resources management under climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords tibetan plateau monsoon region glacier ratio runoff process 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings widely acknowledged as the asian water tower provides substantial water resources for downstream asian countries immerzeel et al 2020 however alterations of the cryosphere induced by climate change have significantly affected the water cycle in tp chen et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2020 yao et al 2022 which are highly related to the socio economic development downstream tang et al 2019 the temperature increase is predicted to continue into the future with increased intensity and frequency of extreme events which may have devastating consequences pachauri et al 2014 karki et al 2020 in order to effectively mitigate and cope with the risks induced by climate change the paris agreement requires that the global average temperature should be limited to no higher than 2 c relative to preindustrial era and it also set an objective to limit the temperature rise to 1 5 c unfccc 2015 therefore quantitative assessment of the runoff processes variations under 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise in alpine regions is very important for understanding changes in runoff processes and regional water resource management glacier melt runoff an important component of runoff in alpine regions is highly sensitive to climate change nepal 2016 zhang et al 2016 in response to significant warming glaciers have experienced accelerated melting brun et al 2017 although glacier retreat will increase river runoff in the short run the continuous retreat of glacier and losses of glacier storage may cause the reduction of melt runoff in the long term jansson et al 2003 yao et al 2012 the occurrence of the peak water of glacier melting rests with the glacier sizes and the rate of temperature increase and exhibits strong regional variability huss and hock 2018 hock et al 2019 considering the importance of glaciers to water supply and future change they have thus received wide attention kraaijenbrink et al 2017 the glacier ratio is defined as the ratio of glacier area within the basin to total area of the basin variations in glacier ratios may lead to different contribution rates of glacier melt water to total runoff and varied hydrological response to climate change zhang et al 2013 found that glacial melt water contributes 40 8 and 0 8 to the total runoff of the upper indus river with glacier ratio 9 46 and the upper yellow river with glacier ratio 0 11 basins respectively the difference in the contribution rates of glacier melt water may affect hydrological processes under climate change studies have found that the runoff of rivers dominated by glacier melt runoff had generally shown an increasing trend in central asia recently and they further stated that the higher the glacier ratio the greater the increase in total runoff kong and pang 2012 kaldybayev et al 2016 for instance the runoff in sub basins with glacier ratios of more than 5 generally showed an increasing trend while that in sub basins with glacier ratios less than 2 showed non significant increasing or even decreasing trends in the karatal river basin kaldybayev et al 2016 according to a research on glacier basins in the alps an increase in runoff was observed in basins with glaciers accounting for more than 10 and vice versa birsan et al 2005 snowmelt runoff and its dynamic changes on tp have a significant effect on the supply of domestic and irrigation water to downstream areas in asia immerzeel et al 2009 siderius et al 2013 specifically changes in snowmelt runoff are mostly manifested as the advance of runoff start time and peak runoff the extension of snowmelt period and the increase of snowmelt runoff in winter and spring barnett et al 2005 shen et al 2018 nepal et al 2021 considering the importance of water resources from tp it is imperative to evaluate the magnitude of climate change on hydrological process in tp under the target set during the paris agreement wang et al 2021 as glacier basins substantially contribute to water supply and are highly sensitive to climate change they are representative for analyzing cryospheric runoff processes therefore investigating the response mechanism of runoff process in basins with different glacier ratios would provide deeper insight into the effects of global warming moreover compared with northwestern and central tp the monsoon influenced southern tp has undergone substantial glacier retreat owing to decreased precipitation associated with the weakening indian monsoon yao et al 2022 with the remarkable shifts in glaciers the monsoon influenced southern tp is of high significance for understanding variations in water cycles under drastic changes in climate the impact of glacier ratios on runoff processes under climate change is to probe into based on a distributed hydrological model sphy and gcms general circulation models in this study for this purpose basins with different glacier ratios in the monsoon influenced southern tp were selected the specific objectives are to 1 explore the contribution of runoff components i e base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff based on quantitative simulation of long term runoff 2 investigate the spatial pattern intra annual distribution inter annual change trends and response mechanisms of runoff components to climate change with decreasing glacier ratio and 3 project the future runoff under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c based on gcms and changes in hydrological regulation function of glaciers in response to climate change 2 methodology 2 1 study area river basins with different glacier ratios i e the karuxung dudh koshi arun gandaki and lhasa river basins were selected to investigate their response mechanism to climatic change under different global warming scenarios fig 1 all the basins have large topographic relief and the glacier ratio of basins with higher elevation and larger elevation range are relatively larger table 1 these river basins are all located in the monsoon influenced region and have similar seasonal distributions of temperature and precipitation i e synchronous precipitation and heat fig s1 however the glacier ratios of the selected river basins widely vary ranging from 20 7 to 1 8 presenting high representativeness for understanding the influence of glacier retreat on hydrological processes under climate change moreover the elevation dependent variations of land use in these river basins are similar fig s2 from high elevation to low elevation land use types convert from glacier bare to grassland shrubs and forests agriculture occupies a considerable ratio below the elevation of 3000 m considering the similar spatial variation of land use types changes in hydrological processes under future glacier retreat can be characterized to a certain extent by comparing runoff processes in these basins 2 2 data collection the precipitation and temperature data were collected from the china and nepal meteorological data service centre as there is no weather station in the karuxung river basin the precipitation gradient obtained based on the rain gauges and weather stations was used to estimate the precipitation distribution zeng et al 2021 dem data were achieved from the earth data https search earthdata nasa gov land use data were obtained from the european space agency https www esa int soil characteristics were determined by the harmonized world soil database hwsd https iiasa ac at glacier distribution was gained from the rgi randolph glacier inventory data http www glims org rgi the modis monthly snow cover mod10cm product and runoff observation data shown in fig 1 were gathered to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model 2 3 definition and arrival time of future temperature rise the temperature increase was predicted on the basis of gcms in cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 in cmip6 scenariomip scenario model intercomparison project was established and ssps shared socioeconomic pathways were adopted for the prediction of climatic variables scenario mip includes 8 groups for future scenarios which can be divided into tier1 and tier2 according to their relative priority tier1 was considered as the core scenario which includes ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2016 according to the availability and completeness of the data 25 climate models were selected for analyzing the temperature and precipitation the selected rule and basic information of models were presented in the supplementary material and table s1 following the definition of unfccc united nations framework convention on climate change 2015 the year of temperature rise refers to the year when the global average annual temperature increased to a certain extent relative to that of the preindustrial era in this study each model itself was used to define the temperature change relative to the preindustrial era which is consistent with the definition of temperature rise by the fifth working group of ipcc ar5 after the temperature rise reaches 1 5 c for the first time in the model it will not fall below 1 5 c thereafter for most existing scenarios and models in ar6 global warming of 1 5 c is defined as the central year of the first 20 years when the mean global near surface temperature of 20 years was 1 5 c higher than that of 1850 1900 specifically this study adopted the following calculation schemes considering that the starting year of most model historical experiments was 1850 the 51 years from 1850 to 1900 were set as the pre industrialization period for each model and the average value of every 20 years thereafter was taken as the climatic period of the central year based on this calculation the range of temperature rise for each model relative to the pre industrialization period was obtained and then mme multi model ensemble mean was performed at the same time it is more practical to compare future climate change with the present day conditions therefore the 30 years from 1985 to 2014 were taken as the present day climate period and the future climate change relative to the base period was assessed 2 4 sphy model sphy is a grid based and spatially distributed model with cell values representing averages over a particular cell terink et al 2015 precipitation in sphy is defined as snowfall or rainfall based on a temperature threshold snow storage dynamics are simulated in the light of the approach proposed by kokkonen et al 2006 the well established degree day approach is adopted to simulate snowmelt hock 2003 some rainfall forms surface runoff while the remaining infiltrates into soil for evapotranspiration and runoff generation in sphy the degree day approach is adopted to simulate glacier melt hock 2005 and the glacier melt contributes to river runoff by direct runoff or percolation to the groundwater layer which eventually forms base flow moreover different degree day values were adopted for debris covered and debris free glaciers because of different melting rate of these two glacier types reid et al 2012 the most relevant spatial data required by the sphy model are dem soil characteristics land use glacier distribution and lake reservoir data precipitation and temperature maximum mean and minimum are the main input meteorological driving data according to previous studies remote sensing data of snow cover area and observed runoff can be applied to calibrate the hydrological process terink et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 then r square root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used for evaluating model performance 2 5 projection of runoff under 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise based on the calibrated sphy model and future climate runoff was simulated under scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise meanwhile the change of glacier area was taken into consideration for future runoff simulation assuming that the interannual change of glacier area was uniform the glacier area for the study area from 1980 to 2014 was estimated using the acquired rgi data accordingly the retreat rates of glacier area for the karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basins were determined to be 0 76 yr 0 40 yr 0 71 yr 0 57 yr and 0 67 yr respectively the glacier mass balance model mbg developed by kraaijenbrink et al 2017 was used for predicting glacier area under different scenarios ssp 1 2 6 ssp 2 4 5 ssp 3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 in the future the spatial resolution of climate change information provided by gcms was relatively coarse which would bring about large deviations when conducting climate research on a regional scale to avoid large deviations the gcm data should be downscaled downscaling methods play an important role in transforming large scale information to the regional scale e g dynamic downscaling statistical downscaling and combined downscaling statistical downscaling has been widely used owing to its advantages of good transferability and efficient computation kudo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 delta a statistical downscaling method was thus adopted to generate regional meteorological series hay et al 2000 2 6 glacier hydrological regulation index the hydrological regulation function of glaciers can be determined by comparing the variation coefficient cv of total runoff with that of non glacier runoff chris and gordon 1998 the glacier hydrological regulation index gri was defined as the ratio of cv of total runoff and non glacier runoff to characterize the strength of the glacier regulation function he et al 2021 the smaller the gri the stronger the hydrological regulation function of glaciers 3 results 3 1 model performance parameters of sphy model were optimized to obtain reasonable hydrological simulation by comparing simulated monthly runoff and snow cover area sca with observed runoff and modis sca respectively the simulated sca was compared with monthly modis snow products mod10cm https earthdata nasa gov to verify the performance of snowmelt simulation the model showed acceptable performance for sca as shown in fig 2 and the value of r2 0 520 0 641 was comparable with that of previous studies in alpine areas 0 531 0 780 zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2021 the model performance indicators for runoff simulation were found to be within acceptable ranges as shown in fig 3 the statistical value of r2 0 827 0 951 was reasonable compared with that of existing studies in alpine regions 0 620 0 890 nepal 2016 shukla et al 2021 singh et al 2021 therefore the simulated results were consistent with observed runoff 3 2 analysis of historical runoff based on hydrological modeling 3 2 1 contribution of runoff components glacier ratios of the karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basins based on rgi 4 0 were 20 7 13 5 7 5 4 4 and 2 0 respectively and the corresponding proportions of the glacier runoff component were 42 5 29 2 15 3 11 8 and 5 8 fig 4 with decreasing glacier ratio the proportion of the glacier runoff component decreased while the proportions of rainfall runoff snowmelt runoff and base flow components increased in general when the glacier ratio decreased from 20 7 to 13 5 the main component of runoff shifted from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff as the glacier ratio further decreased to 4 4 the proportion of snowmelt runoff began to exceed glacier runoff fig 5 3 2 2 spatial variations of runoff the selected river basins were divided into different elevation zones at 500 m intervals ranging from less than 500 m to higher than 8500 m in the karuxung river basin the largest runoff supply was from the elevation zone of 5000 5500 m covering 33 4 of the river basin with glacier melt as the largest source glacier ratio of 37 1 in the dudh koshi river basin the largest runoff was from the elevation zone of 5500 6000 m covering 16 0 of the river basin with glacier runoff as the major runoff component glacier ratio of 38 7 in the gandaki river basin the runoff distribution was relatively uniform the 1000 1500 m elevation zone covering 16 2 of river basin contributed approximately 20 2 to the total runoff while the 4500 5000 m 8 5 of river basin and 5000 5500 m 10 2 of river basin elevation zones both contributed approximately 12 3 to total runoff the main source of runoff in the 1000 1500 m elevation zone was base flow while that in the other two zones was glacier melt in the arun river basin covering 31 7 of the river basin the elevation zone of 5000 5500 m contributed approximately 27 3 to the total runoff with rainfall runoff as the main component glacier ratio of 0 83 in the lhasa river basin approximately 44 3 of the runoff supply was from the 5000 5500 m elevation zone covering 40 0 of the river basin base flow and rainfall runoff were the main runoff components in this elevation zone glacier ratio of 0 49 these results show that the major runoff components of these five river basins shifted from glacier and snowmelt runoff to rainfall runoff with decreasing altitude lutz et al 2014 moreover glaciers strongly affect the spatial distribution of runoff components as the contribution rate of glacier runoff to total runoff is larger than glacier ratio zhang et al 2013 kan et al 2018 3 2 3 seasonal variations of runoff the monthly distribution of runoff components for these five river basins are shown in fig 6 base flow was the major source of river runoff from october to march then runoff began to increase with precipitation and temperature rising from april to may and snowmelt and glacier runoff were found to be the major runoff components during this period in the month of june the dominant runoff components varied among the five river basins glacier runoff was the dominant component in the karuxung river basin with the maximum glacier ratio among the five river basins in the dudh koshi gandaki and arun river basins rainfall runoff began to occupy a considerable proportion in contrast snowmelt runoff was the major runoff component in the lhasa river basin with the minimum glacier ratio this difference may be attributable to the ratio of glaciers the altitude range of the basin and the spatiotemporal disparities of temperature and precipitation the monthly distribution of rainfall runoff in these five river basins were found to be consistent mainly concentrated in july to september moreover base flow during this period was relatively higher than that during other months because of increased precipitation and percolation from glacier melt 3 2 4 changing trends of runoff fig 7 shows inter annual variations in runoff and its components in the five basins the total runoff and its components in the five river basins showed different characteristics owing to the different glacier ratios and climate change the sources of base flow in the sphy model are complex including glacier melt percolation precipitation percolation and groundwater recharge overall the base flow in the five river basins exhibited an increasing trend in these basins glacier runoff showed an increasing trend with increasing temperature in particular snowfall presented a decreasing trend in the dudh koshi p 0 05 gandaki p 0 05 and arun p 0 05 river basins because of the significant increase in temperature p 0 05 and non significant decreasing trend p 0 05 of precipitation table 3 consequently rainfall and snowmelt runoff showed decreasing trends in these three river basins although precipitation showed an increasing trend in the karuxung river basin the increase was not sufficient to offset the decrease of solid precipitation caused by the rise of temperature and snowfall in the basin presented an insignificant decreasing trend table 3 resulting in increasing rainfall runoff p 0 05 and decreasing snowmelt runoff p 0 05 in the lhasa river basin both rainfall p 0 05 and snowfall p 0 05 showed increasing trends table 2 consequently both rainfall runoff and snowmelt runoff exhibited increasing trends although the changing trend of snowmelt runoff in these river basins were different the time of peak snowmelt runoff were advanced in all the river basins specifically the advance time during the last three decades was estimated as the average changing rate multiplied by 30 years and the calculated advance time was around 10 days 8 days 11 days 9 days and 7 days for karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basin respectively the contribution of glaciers to runoff change was prominent in the karuxung and dudh koshi river basins with large glacier ratios in contrast runoff change was significantly affected by precipitation in the gandaki arun and lhasa river basins with relatively small glacier ratios it could be deduced that temperature may be the leading factor for runoff change in basins with glacier ratio higher than 13 5 while precipitation may be the dominant factor in basins with glacier ratio lower than 7 5 in the monsoon influenced southern tp however for basins with glacier ratio ranging from 13 5 to 7 5 the dominant influencing factor was difficult to identify there is a consensus that glaciers with wider coverage have stronger effects on runoff liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 nevertheless the dominant factor influencing runoff would be complicated in alpine regions because of the significant differences in physical properties such as climate and topography in addition to glacier ratio lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies on headwater basins with glacier ratios greater than 9 0 on tp indicated that temperature was the major factor influencing runoff in the indus river zhang et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 however studies in tien shan central asia indicated that temperature strongly affects runoff in basins with a glacier ratio of 5 sorg et al 2012 therefore regional differences in the glacier ratio may determine the dominance of temperature or precipitation 3 3 projection of future runoff under climate change scenarios 3 3 1 changes in average temperature relative to the preindustrial era and present day fig s3a and s3b show changes in average temperature of mme relative to the preindustrial era 1850 1900 over the globe and the study area respectively according mme the temperature rise of 1 5 c will arrive in 2036 2032 2033 and 2029 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively mme under ssp1 2 6 would not exceed 2 0 c but in the other 3 scenarios it will reach and exceed 2 0 c in 2049 2047 and 2042 respectively global temperature response for a certain year provided by different gcms may be discrepant due to climate sensitivity and feedback processes zhou et al 2019 in all scenarios except ssp5 8 5 the temperature rise of 1 5 c was estimated to occur between 2030 and 2040 zhou et al 2021 the temperature rise of 2 c may be concentrated between the 2040 2050 s zhang et al 2021 overall the results of global temperature rise in this study are consistent with those of previous studies as shown in fig s3b the regional temperature change was more prominent in the study area the extent of the five river basins at 82 8 93 4 e and 27 2 93 3 n than at the global scale when the global average temperature increased by 1 5 c relative to the preindustrial era the mme average under different scenarios showed that the regional average temperature increased by about 1 9 c at the time 1985 2014 the average temperature increased about 0 8 c and 1 2 c at the regional and global scales respectively with global warming of 2 c the temperature in the study area will increase by 2 5 c and 1 7 c relative to the preindustrial era and current period respectively it can be seen that the temperature increase rate in tp would be higher than global average zhai et al 2017 yao et al 2022 3 3 2 changes in precipitation under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c when the global average temperature rise reaches 1 5 c the change in global and regional average precipitation relative to the current period 1985 2014 under different climate scenarios would be approximately 2 1 2 7 and 3 3 4 7 respectively fig s4 when the global average temperature rise reaches 2 0 c the change in global and regional average precipitation relative to the current period would be 3 2 3 5 and 5 6 5 8 respectively fig s4 it can be seen that the variation of precipitation was higher with high uncertainty in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2021 3 3 3 response of future runoff to climate change regional meteorological data of the future were obtained to analyze the inter annual and intra annual evolution trends for the five river basins based on the delta downscaling method glacier area changes of the five river basins predicted based on the mbg model are shown in fig s5 the results indicated that glaciers would retreat continually in the future and the retreat rate would follow the order ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 as the temperature rise of 2 c will not be attained by 2100 under ssp1 2 6 considering the time when the temperature increases of 1 5 c and 2 c are reached under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the future runoff in the study area would be simulated till mid century fig s6 and s7 show future runoff change trends driven by multi model ensemble means in general the simulated total runoff and glacier runoff of each river basin showed an increasing trend under the four scenarios table 3 the peak glacier runoff would not appear under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c which is supported by previous studies lutz et al 2014 nepal 2016 wang et al 2021 this can be explained by enhanced glacier melt induced by intense warming counteracting the reduction of glacier runoff caused by glacier retreat and even postponing the onset of peak runoff bliss et al 2014 to investigate the reasons behind the runoff variation the change trends of base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff were explored table 3 the increase in temperature and precipitation induced an increase in glacier runoff and rainfall runoff moreover the increasing glacier melt and precipitation would lead to increased percolation and ultimately increased base flow the proportion of snowfall decreased due to temperature rise therefore snowmelt runoff showed a decreasing trend in these five river basins fig 8 shows the contribution of the changing rates of base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff to the total runoff despite of the increasing trend of glacier runoff the contribution of glacier runoff presented a decreasing trend with glacier retreat meanwhile the contribution of base flow and snowmelt runoff both showed decreasing trends while the contribution of rainfall runoff exhibited an increasing trend under all the mentioned scenarios this implies the dominant role of precipitation in runoff change in these five river basins in the future fig 9 shows the variations in the monthly runoff component compared to the baseline period for the five river basins under global warming of 1 5 c the variations of monthly runoff under global warming of 2 c is shown in fig s8 base flow exhibited increases ranging from 2 8 to 7 7 glacier runoff showed an amplification of 10 1 27 9 the increase of rainfall runoff varied from 6 0 to 28 2 snowmelt runoff exhibited decreases ranging from 24 3 to 4 3 the change in total runoff was found to be positive with variations ranging from 1 7 to 16 0 it can be speculated that the driving factor of runoff increase in the future would change from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff with decreasing glacier ratio moreover the increase of runoff would mainly be concentrated in the warm and wet season with more precipitation in the monsoon influenced region and snowmelt runoff would decrease in the future which are in accordance with the previous findings lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 kraaijenbrink et al 2021 3 4 variations in gri under climate change 3 4 1 relationship between glacier ratio and gri based on runoff cvs of the different elevation zones and five river basins the cvs of glacier runoff total runoff and non glacier runoff were 0 131 0 090 0 186 0 128 and 0 233 0 166 respectively gri was calculated according to the definition described in 2 6 and the relationship between glacier ratio and gri was then established as some elevation zones are completely covered by glaciers and almost the entire runoff in this elevation zone is derived from glaciers the variation coefficient of non glacier runoff and gri in corresponding elevation zones were not calculated gri is spatially variable and strongly influenced by glacier ratio for instance gri ranges from 0 925 to 0 997 in headwater basins yarlung zangbo river nujiang yangtze river lancangjiang and yellow river with the glacier ratio varying from 2 08 to 0 10 on the southern and eastern tp while the scope of gri ranges from 0 339 to 0 927 for inland river basins in northwest china muzati river manas river hutubi river and shule river with glacier ratios ranging from 48 20 to 3 54 he et al 2021 the findings of this study also confirm this phenomenon as glaciers tend to stabilize the inter annual variability of runoff the regulation function of glaciers is outstanding especially when the glacier ratio is low zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 10 with the increase of glacier ratio from 0 to 10 gri exhibited a distinct decrease indicating that the hydrological regulation function increased sharply within this range this is collaterally supported by previous studies hagg et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 3 4 2 prediction of gri in the future the gris of the five river basins under different scenarios are shown in fig 11 the regulation function of glaciers will be attenuated along with the retreat of glaciers which poses challenges to water resources management in the future 4 discussion 4 1 influence of glacier ratio in runoff based on the spatiotemporal variations of runoff and its components it can be deduced that runoff is sensitive to glacier ratio kaldybayev et al 2016 and small changes in glacier ratio may induce remarkable changes in runoff processes zhang et al 2016 specifically glacier runoff was the dominant component of the total runoff in the karuxung river basin of this study with the largest glacier ratio whereas rainfall runoff was the main source of runoff in the other four river basins with relatively smaller glacier ratios glacier runoff in these five river basins represented increasing trends until the appearance of the 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise despite the retreat of glacier area which is consistent with existing research indicating that the projected glacier runoff would increase until roughly the mid century in most basins fed by high mountain glaciers in asia huss and hock 2018 furthermore glacier melt would contribute more to the increase of total runoff in basins with larger glacier ratio glaciers play a major role in regulating runoff abundance and dieback hock 2005 ding et al 2020 moreover the role of glaciers in sustaining runoff and regulating hydrological processes was also firmly confirmed in terms of the relationship between gri and glacier ratio however global warming reduces the stability of glaciers bliss et al 2014 ding et al 2019 and the retreat of glaciers would inevitably affect their hydrological regulation function overall the weakening or even disappearance of glacier runoff regulation functions may lead to the amplified variation of runoff and sustainability of water supplies resulting in the increase of extreme drought and flood disaster risk although the study mainly focuses on the impact of glaciers on runoff in monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau based on hydrological model it can provide scientific understanding for the regulation functions of glaciers on runoff under global warming in other regions such as southern andes antarctic and subantarctic central asia and central europe moreover the hydrological model is an efficient way to investigate the runoff process under climate change and this study verifies its merit performance in representing the impact of glaciers on the spatiotemporal variation of runoff and the runoff evolution under global warming and glacier changes therefore the hydrological model similar to that used in this study can be applied to investigate the runoff process of glacier river basins in other glaciated regions with suitable and effective model parameters 4 2 uncertainties and prospects of this study this study aimed to investigate the runoff process of basins with different glacier ratios under climate change but several modeling uncertainties remain to be addressed in future studies permafrost is widely distributed in tp and the increase in temperature has led to permafrost degradation and thickening of the active layer wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 which can affect the infiltration and subsurface flow path of hydrological processes rogger et al 2017 however the soil freezing and thawing scheme is seldom considered in the state of art models including the sphy model applied to high mountain areas which would introduce uncertainties in the quantitative research and prediction of hydrological processes additionally vegetation can influence the hydrological process through precipitation interception evaporation and soil infiltration processes williams et al 2012 shao et al 2019 and thus the impact of vegetation change associated with future climate change is worth considering therefore the improvement of hydrological models by considering seasonal permafrost and vegetation change is essential for more accurate hydrological modeling and prediction and this would be the direction of our further research climate data generated by gcms were used as input variables to drive the hydrological model in order to obtain more accurate hydrological responses for estimating water availability in the future therefore in addition to the uncertainty of the hydrological modeling itself the uncertainty of the climate modeling would also have an important impact on the reliability of the projection of hydrological processes future climate characteristics were estimated under certain hypothetical scenarios however there was an uncertainty in the climate change scenario driven by anthropogenic activities meinshausen et al 2011 nevertheless gcms under different scenarios can still be applied to forecast future climate change evaluate the severity of regional hazards zhu and yang 2020 and guide the formulation of national policies to reduce the risks associated with climate change the uncertainties in gcms may be attributable to the inadequate comprehension of the climate system at present moreover relevant conclusions can sometimes be controversial owing to the complexity of the models therefore numerical approximation schemes and various gcm generalizations and parameterizations are required slingo et al 1996 zhang et al 2021 moreover different gcms may have different responses to the same forcing scenario and methods for acquiring more reliable climate prediction are thus required zhuan et al 2019 for instance results of multi model ensemble means would be more consistent with observations than a single model mote and salathé 2010 although most cmip6 models could reveal a reasonable spatial pattern for the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation over tp there are systematic errors wet bias and cold bias in cmip6 models zhu and yang 2020 previous studies found a physical correlation between albedo and cold bias and the larger cold bias during the cold season may be attributed to shortcomings in the simulation of ice and snow feedback chen et al 2017a 2017b qu et al 2019 further efforts should be made to promote the scientific knowledge of sources of model errors in tp and the temperature bias in tp can possibly be reduced by improving the simulation of snow cover area in the monsoon influenced southern tp annual precipitation was overestimated resulting in large wet bias previous studies indicated that low resolution models were insufficient to accurately reproduce precipitation related to fine orography and the accuracy of precipitation over tp could be improved by increasing the resolution e g li et al 2015 however there were still large biases in the precipitation intensity and spatial distribution with higher resolution over tp which was closely related to the selection of physical parameterization schemes duan et al 2013 ji and kang 2013 therefore it is necessary to improve both the resolution and the physical process to obtain more realistic precipitation over the tp with complex precipitation physical processes he et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study runoff processes of basins with different glacier ratios in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau were explored on the basis of the observed meteorological data and river runoff modis snow cover products sphy model and 25 models of cmip6 the main findings are as follows 1 the major runoff component shifted from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff when the glacier ratio decreased and the critical threshold was between 20 and 13 5 2 glacier distribution had important impacts on the spatiotemporal variation of runoff with glacier runoff showing higher contribution to total runoff than the glacier ratio by more than two times 3 glacier and rainfall runoff would show increasing trends with increasing precipitation under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c while snowmelt runoff would present a decreasing trend 4 a power function fit was observed between glacier ratio and the hydrological regulation function of glaciers and the role of glaciers in regulating runoff abundance and dieback would decrease because of glacier retreat in the future the variations in runoff processes in glacier river basins indicated the accelerated transformation of glaciers into liquid water would increase the risk of flood disasters because the superposition of rainfall runoff and glacier melt runoff would significantly increase the water yield downstream however the contribution of glacier melt water to river runoff would be reduced and the regulating function of glaciers would be weakened with glacier retreat which would increase the risk of drought in the far future therefore mitigation measures should be implemented for sustainable water resource management in high mountain areas under climate change hydrological models and gcms are indispensable tools for exploring runoff processes under global change however owing to uncertainties in the climate model the downscaling method would lead to uncertainties in evaluating influence of climate change meanwhile changes in high mountain areas not only affect the water cycle through water phase transformation but also affect the runoff process by changing various parameters such as soil characteristics vegetation and geomorphic morphology although great progress had been made in research on the hydrological effects of changes in high mountain areas many physical mechanisms remain unclear and existing models cannot adequately consider the complex processes and influence mechanisms thus introducing large uncertainties in the simulation and prediction of river runoff in high mountain areas therefore it is essential to reduce these uncertainties through more comprehensive understanding of hydrological processes and climate system mechanisms in the future this study revealed that the glacier ratio has significant influences on the spatiotemporal distribution of runoff and the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in southern tp it also explored the future change characteristics of river runoff which would be helpful for better understanding hydrological processes in tp and other similar alpine areas the findings are expected to provide a scientific basis for water resources management under climate change credit

7767,study region river basins with glacier ratios ranging from 1 8 to 20 7 in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau study focus the response of runoff processes in basins with different glacier ratios under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c was explored based on sphy spatial processes in hydrology model and gcms general circulation models new hydrological insights for the region more prominent temperature and precipitation changes were observed in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau compared with the global averages with increasing temperature and precipitation the total runoff and glacier runoff of these basins showed increasing trends under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c compared with the baseline period 1985 2014 increases were observed in the total runoff 1 7 20 6 base flow 2 8 8 3 glacier runoff 8 1 35 9 and rainfall runoff 6 0 36 0 of these basins in contrast snowmelt runoff decreased 28 3 4 3 therefore relevant management and allocation of water resources may be required the hydrological regulation function of glaciers was found to be strongly correlated with glacier ratio in general the hydrological regulation function of glaciers would decrease in the future along with warming induced glacier retreat these findings would help deepen the understanding of runoff processes on the tibetan plateau and other alpine regions thus providing a scientific basis for water resources management under climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords tibetan plateau monsoon region glacier ratio runoff process 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings widely acknowledged as the asian water tower provides substantial water resources for downstream asian countries immerzeel et al 2020 however alterations of the cryosphere induced by climate change have significantly affected the water cycle in tp chen et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2020 yao et al 2022 which are highly related to the socio economic development downstream tang et al 2019 the temperature increase is predicted to continue into the future with increased intensity and frequency of extreme events which may have devastating consequences pachauri et al 2014 karki et al 2020 in order to effectively mitigate and cope with the risks induced by climate change the paris agreement requires that the global average temperature should be limited to no higher than 2 c relative to preindustrial era and it also set an objective to limit the temperature rise to 1 5 c unfccc 2015 therefore quantitative assessment of the runoff processes variations under 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise in alpine regions is very important for understanding changes in runoff processes and regional water resource management glacier melt runoff an important component of runoff in alpine regions is highly sensitive to climate change nepal 2016 zhang et al 2016 in response to significant warming glaciers have experienced accelerated melting brun et al 2017 although glacier retreat will increase river runoff in the short run the continuous retreat of glacier and losses of glacier storage may cause the reduction of melt runoff in the long term jansson et al 2003 yao et al 2012 the occurrence of the peak water of glacier melting rests with the glacier sizes and the rate of temperature increase and exhibits strong regional variability huss and hock 2018 hock et al 2019 considering the importance of glaciers to water supply and future change they have thus received wide attention kraaijenbrink et al 2017 the glacier ratio is defined as the ratio of glacier area within the basin to total area of the basin variations in glacier ratios may lead to different contribution rates of glacier melt water to total runoff and varied hydrological response to climate change zhang et al 2013 found that glacial melt water contributes 40 8 and 0 8 to the total runoff of the upper indus river with glacier ratio 9 46 and the upper yellow river with glacier ratio 0 11 basins respectively the difference in the contribution rates of glacier melt water may affect hydrological processes under climate change studies have found that the runoff of rivers dominated by glacier melt runoff had generally shown an increasing trend in central asia recently and they further stated that the higher the glacier ratio the greater the increase in total runoff kong and pang 2012 kaldybayev et al 2016 for instance the runoff in sub basins with glacier ratios of more than 5 generally showed an increasing trend while that in sub basins with glacier ratios less than 2 showed non significant increasing or even decreasing trends in the karatal river basin kaldybayev et al 2016 according to a research on glacier basins in the alps an increase in runoff was observed in basins with glaciers accounting for more than 10 and vice versa birsan et al 2005 snowmelt runoff and its dynamic changes on tp have a significant effect on the supply of domestic and irrigation water to downstream areas in asia immerzeel et al 2009 siderius et al 2013 specifically changes in snowmelt runoff are mostly manifested as the advance of runoff start time and peak runoff the extension of snowmelt period and the increase of snowmelt runoff in winter and spring barnett et al 2005 shen et al 2018 nepal et al 2021 considering the importance of water resources from tp it is imperative to evaluate the magnitude of climate change on hydrological process in tp under the target set during the paris agreement wang et al 2021 as glacier basins substantially contribute to water supply and are highly sensitive to climate change they are representative for analyzing cryospheric runoff processes therefore investigating the response mechanism of runoff process in basins with different glacier ratios would provide deeper insight into the effects of global warming moreover compared with northwestern and central tp the monsoon influenced southern tp has undergone substantial glacier retreat owing to decreased precipitation associated with the weakening indian monsoon yao et al 2022 with the remarkable shifts in glaciers the monsoon influenced southern tp is of high significance for understanding variations in water cycles under drastic changes in climate the impact of glacier ratios on runoff processes under climate change is to probe into based on a distributed hydrological model sphy and gcms general circulation models in this study for this purpose basins with different glacier ratios in the monsoon influenced southern tp were selected the specific objectives are to 1 explore the contribution of runoff components i e base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff based on quantitative simulation of long term runoff 2 investigate the spatial pattern intra annual distribution inter annual change trends and response mechanisms of runoff components to climate change with decreasing glacier ratio and 3 project the future runoff under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c based on gcms and changes in hydrological regulation function of glaciers in response to climate change 2 methodology 2 1 study area river basins with different glacier ratios i e the karuxung dudh koshi arun gandaki and lhasa river basins were selected to investigate their response mechanism to climatic change under different global warming scenarios fig 1 all the basins have large topographic relief and the glacier ratio of basins with higher elevation and larger elevation range are relatively larger table 1 these river basins are all located in the monsoon influenced region and have similar seasonal distributions of temperature and precipitation i e synchronous precipitation and heat fig s1 however the glacier ratios of the selected river basins widely vary ranging from 20 7 to 1 8 presenting high representativeness for understanding the influence of glacier retreat on hydrological processes under climate change moreover the elevation dependent variations of land use in these river basins are similar fig s2 from high elevation to low elevation land use types convert from glacier bare to grassland shrubs and forests agriculture occupies a considerable ratio below the elevation of 3000 m considering the similar spatial variation of land use types changes in hydrological processes under future glacier retreat can be characterized to a certain extent by comparing runoff processes in these basins 2 2 data collection the precipitation and temperature data were collected from the china and nepal meteorological data service centre as there is no weather station in the karuxung river basin the precipitation gradient obtained based on the rain gauges and weather stations was used to estimate the precipitation distribution zeng et al 2021 dem data were achieved from the earth data https search earthdata nasa gov land use data were obtained from the european space agency https www esa int soil characteristics were determined by the harmonized world soil database hwsd https iiasa ac at glacier distribution was gained from the rgi randolph glacier inventory data http www glims org rgi the modis monthly snow cover mod10cm product and runoff observation data shown in fig 1 were gathered to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model 2 3 definition and arrival time of future temperature rise the temperature increase was predicted on the basis of gcms in cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 in cmip6 scenariomip scenario model intercomparison project was established and ssps shared socioeconomic pathways were adopted for the prediction of climatic variables scenario mip includes 8 groups for future scenarios which can be divided into tier1 and tier2 according to their relative priority tier1 was considered as the core scenario which includes ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2016 according to the availability and completeness of the data 25 climate models were selected for analyzing the temperature and precipitation the selected rule and basic information of models were presented in the supplementary material and table s1 following the definition of unfccc united nations framework convention on climate change 2015 the year of temperature rise refers to the year when the global average annual temperature increased to a certain extent relative to that of the preindustrial era in this study each model itself was used to define the temperature change relative to the preindustrial era which is consistent with the definition of temperature rise by the fifth working group of ipcc ar5 after the temperature rise reaches 1 5 c for the first time in the model it will not fall below 1 5 c thereafter for most existing scenarios and models in ar6 global warming of 1 5 c is defined as the central year of the first 20 years when the mean global near surface temperature of 20 years was 1 5 c higher than that of 1850 1900 specifically this study adopted the following calculation schemes considering that the starting year of most model historical experiments was 1850 the 51 years from 1850 to 1900 were set as the pre industrialization period for each model and the average value of every 20 years thereafter was taken as the climatic period of the central year based on this calculation the range of temperature rise for each model relative to the pre industrialization period was obtained and then mme multi model ensemble mean was performed at the same time it is more practical to compare future climate change with the present day conditions therefore the 30 years from 1985 to 2014 were taken as the present day climate period and the future climate change relative to the base period was assessed 2 4 sphy model sphy is a grid based and spatially distributed model with cell values representing averages over a particular cell terink et al 2015 precipitation in sphy is defined as snowfall or rainfall based on a temperature threshold snow storage dynamics are simulated in the light of the approach proposed by kokkonen et al 2006 the well established degree day approach is adopted to simulate snowmelt hock 2003 some rainfall forms surface runoff while the remaining infiltrates into soil for evapotranspiration and runoff generation in sphy the degree day approach is adopted to simulate glacier melt hock 2005 and the glacier melt contributes to river runoff by direct runoff or percolation to the groundwater layer which eventually forms base flow moreover different degree day values were adopted for debris covered and debris free glaciers because of different melting rate of these two glacier types reid et al 2012 the most relevant spatial data required by the sphy model are dem soil characteristics land use glacier distribution and lake reservoir data precipitation and temperature maximum mean and minimum are the main input meteorological driving data according to previous studies remote sensing data of snow cover area and observed runoff can be applied to calibrate the hydrological process terink et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 then r square root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used for evaluating model performance 2 5 projection of runoff under 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise based on the calibrated sphy model and future climate runoff was simulated under scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise meanwhile the change of glacier area was taken into consideration for future runoff simulation assuming that the interannual change of glacier area was uniform the glacier area for the study area from 1980 to 2014 was estimated using the acquired rgi data accordingly the retreat rates of glacier area for the karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basins were determined to be 0 76 yr 0 40 yr 0 71 yr 0 57 yr and 0 67 yr respectively the glacier mass balance model mbg developed by kraaijenbrink et al 2017 was used for predicting glacier area under different scenarios ssp 1 2 6 ssp 2 4 5 ssp 3 7 0 and ssp 5 8 5 in the future the spatial resolution of climate change information provided by gcms was relatively coarse which would bring about large deviations when conducting climate research on a regional scale to avoid large deviations the gcm data should be downscaled downscaling methods play an important role in transforming large scale information to the regional scale e g dynamic downscaling statistical downscaling and combined downscaling statistical downscaling has been widely used owing to its advantages of good transferability and efficient computation kudo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 delta a statistical downscaling method was thus adopted to generate regional meteorological series hay et al 2000 2 6 glacier hydrological regulation index the hydrological regulation function of glaciers can be determined by comparing the variation coefficient cv of total runoff with that of non glacier runoff chris and gordon 1998 the glacier hydrological regulation index gri was defined as the ratio of cv of total runoff and non glacier runoff to characterize the strength of the glacier regulation function he et al 2021 the smaller the gri the stronger the hydrological regulation function of glaciers 3 results 3 1 model performance parameters of sphy model were optimized to obtain reasonable hydrological simulation by comparing simulated monthly runoff and snow cover area sca with observed runoff and modis sca respectively the simulated sca was compared with monthly modis snow products mod10cm https earthdata nasa gov to verify the performance of snowmelt simulation the model showed acceptable performance for sca as shown in fig 2 and the value of r2 0 520 0 641 was comparable with that of previous studies in alpine areas 0 531 0 780 zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2021 the model performance indicators for runoff simulation were found to be within acceptable ranges as shown in fig 3 the statistical value of r2 0 827 0 951 was reasonable compared with that of existing studies in alpine regions 0 620 0 890 nepal 2016 shukla et al 2021 singh et al 2021 therefore the simulated results were consistent with observed runoff 3 2 analysis of historical runoff based on hydrological modeling 3 2 1 contribution of runoff components glacier ratios of the karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basins based on rgi 4 0 were 20 7 13 5 7 5 4 4 and 2 0 respectively and the corresponding proportions of the glacier runoff component were 42 5 29 2 15 3 11 8 and 5 8 fig 4 with decreasing glacier ratio the proportion of the glacier runoff component decreased while the proportions of rainfall runoff snowmelt runoff and base flow components increased in general when the glacier ratio decreased from 20 7 to 13 5 the main component of runoff shifted from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff as the glacier ratio further decreased to 4 4 the proportion of snowmelt runoff began to exceed glacier runoff fig 5 3 2 2 spatial variations of runoff the selected river basins were divided into different elevation zones at 500 m intervals ranging from less than 500 m to higher than 8500 m in the karuxung river basin the largest runoff supply was from the elevation zone of 5000 5500 m covering 33 4 of the river basin with glacier melt as the largest source glacier ratio of 37 1 in the dudh koshi river basin the largest runoff was from the elevation zone of 5500 6000 m covering 16 0 of the river basin with glacier runoff as the major runoff component glacier ratio of 38 7 in the gandaki river basin the runoff distribution was relatively uniform the 1000 1500 m elevation zone covering 16 2 of river basin contributed approximately 20 2 to the total runoff while the 4500 5000 m 8 5 of river basin and 5000 5500 m 10 2 of river basin elevation zones both contributed approximately 12 3 to total runoff the main source of runoff in the 1000 1500 m elevation zone was base flow while that in the other two zones was glacier melt in the arun river basin covering 31 7 of the river basin the elevation zone of 5000 5500 m contributed approximately 27 3 to the total runoff with rainfall runoff as the main component glacier ratio of 0 83 in the lhasa river basin approximately 44 3 of the runoff supply was from the 5000 5500 m elevation zone covering 40 0 of the river basin base flow and rainfall runoff were the main runoff components in this elevation zone glacier ratio of 0 49 these results show that the major runoff components of these five river basins shifted from glacier and snowmelt runoff to rainfall runoff with decreasing altitude lutz et al 2014 moreover glaciers strongly affect the spatial distribution of runoff components as the contribution rate of glacier runoff to total runoff is larger than glacier ratio zhang et al 2013 kan et al 2018 3 2 3 seasonal variations of runoff the monthly distribution of runoff components for these five river basins are shown in fig 6 base flow was the major source of river runoff from october to march then runoff began to increase with precipitation and temperature rising from april to may and snowmelt and glacier runoff were found to be the major runoff components during this period in the month of june the dominant runoff components varied among the five river basins glacier runoff was the dominant component in the karuxung river basin with the maximum glacier ratio among the five river basins in the dudh koshi gandaki and arun river basins rainfall runoff began to occupy a considerable proportion in contrast snowmelt runoff was the major runoff component in the lhasa river basin with the minimum glacier ratio this difference may be attributable to the ratio of glaciers the altitude range of the basin and the spatiotemporal disparities of temperature and precipitation the monthly distribution of rainfall runoff in these five river basins were found to be consistent mainly concentrated in july to september moreover base flow during this period was relatively higher than that during other months because of increased precipitation and percolation from glacier melt 3 2 4 changing trends of runoff fig 7 shows inter annual variations in runoff and its components in the five basins the total runoff and its components in the five river basins showed different characteristics owing to the different glacier ratios and climate change the sources of base flow in the sphy model are complex including glacier melt percolation precipitation percolation and groundwater recharge overall the base flow in the five river basins exhibited an increasing trend in these basins glacier runoff showed an increasing trend with increasing temperature in particular snowfall presented a decreasing trend in the dudh koshi p 0 05 gandaki p 0 05 and arun p 0 05 river basins because of the significant increase in temperature p 0 05 and non significant decreasing trend p 0 05 of precipitation table 3 consequently rainfall and snowmelt runoff showed decreasing trends in these three river basins although precipitation showed an increasing trend in the karuxung river basin the increase was not sufficient to offset the decrease of solid precipitation caused by the rise of temperature and snowfall in the basin presented an insignificant decreasing trend table 3 resulting in increasing rainfall runoff p 0 05 and decreasing snowmelt runoff p 0 05 in the lhasa river basin both rainfall p 0 05 and snowfall p 0 05 showed increasing trends table 2 consequently both rainfall runoff and snowmelt runoff exhibited increasing trends although the changing trend of snowmelt runoff in these river basins were different the time of peak snowmelt runoff were advanced in all the river basins specifically the advance time during the last three decades was estimated as the average changing rate multiplied by 30 years and the calculated advance time was around 10 days 8 days 11 days 9 days and 7 days for karuxung dudh koshi gandaki arun and lhasa river basin respectively the contribution of glaciers to runoff change was prominent in the karuxung and dudh koshi river basins with large glacier ratios in contrast runoff change was significantly affected by precipitation in the gandaki arun and lhasa river basins with relatively small glacier ratios it could be deduced that temperature may be the leading factor for runoff change in basins with glacier ratio higher than 13 5 while precipitation may be the dominant factor in basins with glacier ratio lower than 7 5 in the monsoon influenced southern tp however for basins with glacier ratio ranging from 13 5 to 7 5 the dominant influencing factor was difficult to identify there is a consensus that glaciers with wider coverage have stronger effects on runoff liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 nevertheless the dominant factor influencing runoff would be complicated in alpine regions because of the significant differences in physical properties such as climate and topography in addition to glacier ratio lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies on headwater basins with glacier ratios greater than 9 0 on tp indicated that temperature was the major factor influencing runoff in the indus river zhang et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 however studies in tien shan central asia indicated that temperature strongly affects runoff in basins with a glacier ratio of 5 sorg et al 2012 therefore regional differences in the glacier ratio may determine the dominance of temperature or precipitation 3 3 projection of future runoff under climate change scenarios 3 3 1 changes in average temperature relative to the preindustrial era and present day fig s3a and s3b show changes in average temperature of mme relative to the preindustrial era 1850 1900 over the globe and the study area respectively according mme the temperature rise of 1 5 c will arrive in 2036 2032 2033 and 2029 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively mme under ssp1 2 6 would not exceed 2 0 c but in the other 3 scenarios it will reach and exceed 2 0 c in 2049 2047 and 2042 respectively global temperature response for a certain year provided by different gcms may be discrepant due to climate sensitivity and feedback processes zhou et al 2019 in all scenarios except ssp5 8 5 the temperature rise of 1 5 c was estimated to occur between 2030 and 2040 zhou et al 2021 the temperature rise of 2 c may be concentrated between the 2040 2050 s zhang et al 2021 overall the results of global temperature rise in this study are consistent with those of previous studies as shown in fig s3b the regional temperature change was more prominent in the study area the extent of the five river basins at 82 8 93 4 e and 27 2 93 3 n than at the global scale when the global average temperature increased by 1 5 c relative to the preindustrial era the mme average under different scenarios showed that the regional average temperature increased by about 1 9 c at the time 1985 2014 the average temperature increased about 0 8 c and 1 2 c at the regional and global scales respectively with global warming of 2 c the temperature in the study area will increase by 2 5 c and 1 7 c relative to the preindustrial era and current period respectively it can be seen that the temperature increase rate in tp would be higher than global average zhai et al 2017 yao et al 2022 3 3 2 changes in precipitation under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c when the global average temperature rise reaches 1 5 c the change in global and regional average precipitation relative to the current period 1985 2014 under different climate scenarios would be approximately 2 1 2 7 and 3 3 4 7 respectively fig s4 when the global average temperature rise reaches 2 0 c the change in global and regional average precipitation relative to the current period would be 3 2 3 5 and 5 6 5 8 respectively fig s4 it can be seen that the variation of precipitation was higher with high uncertainty in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2021 3 3 3 response of future runoff to climate change regional meteorological data of the future were obtained to analyze the inter annual and intra annual evolution trends for the five river basins based on the delta downscaling method glacier area changes of the five river basins predicted based on the mbg model are shown in fig s5 the results indicated that glaciers would retreat continually in the future and the retreat rate would follow the order ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 as the temperature rise of 2 c will not be attained by 2100 under ssp1 2 6 considering the time when the temperature increases of 1 5 c and 2 c are reached under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the future runoff in the study area would be simulated till mid century fig s6 and s7 show future runoff change trends driven by multi model ensemble means in general the simulated total runoff and glacier runoff of each river basin showed an increasing trend under the four scenarios table 3 the peak glacier runoff would not appear under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c which is supported by previous studies lutz et al 2014 nepal 2016 wang et al 2021 this can be explained by enhanced glacier melt induced by intense warming counteracting the reduction of glacier runoff caused by glacier retreat and even postponing the onset of peak runoff bliss et al 2014 to investigate the reasons behind the runoff variation the change trends of base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff were explored table 3 the increase in temperature and precipitation induced an increase in glacier runoff and rainfall runoff moreover the increasing glacier melt and precipitation would lead to increased percolation and ultimately increased base flow the proportion of snowfall decreased due to temperature rise therefore snowmelt runoff showed a decreasing trend in these five river basins fig 8 shows the contribution of the changing rates of base flow glacier runoff snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff to the total runoff despite of the increasing trend of glacier runoff the contribution of glacier runoff presented a decreasing trend with glacier retreat meanwhile the contribution of base flow and snowmelt runoff both showed decreasing trends while the contribution of rainfall runoff exhibited an increasing trend under all the mentioned scenarios this implies the dominant role of precipitation in runoff change in these five river basins in the future fig 9 shows the variations in the monthly runoff component compared to the baseline period for the five river basins under global warming of 1 5 c the variations of monthly runoff under global warming of 2 c is shown in fig s8 base flow exhibited increases ranging from 2 8 to 7 7 glacier runoff showed an amplification of 10 1 27 9 the increase of rainfall runoff varied from 6 0 to 28 2 snowmelt runoff exhibited decreases ranging from 24 3 to 4 3 the change in total runoff was found to be positive with variations ranging from 1 7 to 16 0 it can be speculated that the driving factor of runoff increase in the future would change from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff with decreasing glacier ratio moreover the increase of runoff would mainly be concentrated in the warm and wet season with more precipitation in the monsoon influenced region and snowmelt runoff would decrease in the future which are in accordance with the previous findings lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 kraaijenbrink et al 2021 3 4 variations in gri under climate change 3 4 1 relationship between glacier ratio and gri based on runoff cvs of the different elevation zones and five river basins the cvs of glacier runoff total runoff and non glacier runoff were 0 131 0 090 0 186 0 128 and 0 233 0 166 respectively gri was calculated according to the definition described in 2 6 and the relationship between glacier ratio and gri was then established as some elevation zones are completely covered by glaciers and almost the entire runoff in this elevation zone is derived from glaciers the variation coefficient of non glacier runoff and gri in corresponding elevation zones were not calculated gri is spatially variable and strongly influenced by glacier ratio for instance gri ranges from 0 925 to 0 997 in headwater basins yarlung zangbo river nujiang yangtze river lancangjiang and yellow river with the glacier ratio varying from 2 08 to 0 10 on the southern and eastern tp while the scope of gri ranges from 0 339 to 0 927 for inland river basins in northwest china muzati river manas river hutubi river and shule river with glacier ratios ranging from 48 20 to 3 54 he et al 2021 the findings of this study also confirm this phenomenon as glaciers tend to stabilize the inter annual variability of runoff the regulation function of glaciers is outstanding especially when the glacier ratio is low zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 10 with the increase of glacier ratio from 0 to 10 gri exhibited a distinct decrease indicating that the hydrological regulation function increased sharply within this range this is collaterally supported by previous studies hagg et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 3 4 2 prediction of gri in the future the gris of the five river basins under different scenarios are shown in fig 11 the regulation function of glaciers will be attenuated along with the retreat of glaciers which poses challenges to water resources management in the future 4 discussion 4 1 influence of glacier ratio in runoff based on the spatiotemporal variations of runoff and its components it can be deduced that runoff is sensitive to glacier ratio kaldybayev et al 2016 and small changes in glacier ratio may induce remarkable changes in runoff processes zhang et al 2016 specifically glacier runoff was the dominant component of the total runoff in the karuxung river basin of this study with the largest glacier ratio whereas rainfall runoff was the main source of runoff in the other four river basins with relatively smaller glacier ratios glacier runoff in these five river basins represented increasing trends until the appearance of the 1 5 c and 2 c temperature rise despite the retreat of glacier area which is consistent with existing research indicating that the projected glacier runoff would increase until roughly the mid century in most basins fed by high mountain glaciers in asia huss and hock 2018 furthermore glacier melt would contribute more to the increase of total runoff in basins with larger glacier ratio glaciers play a major role in regulating runoff abundance and dieback hock 2005 ding et al 2020 moreover the role of glaciers in sustaining runoff and regulating hydrological processes was also firmly confirmed in terms of the relationship between gri and glacier ratio however global warming reduces the stability of glaciers bliss et al 2014 ding et al 2019 and the retreat of glaciers would inevitably affect their hydrological regulation function overall the weakening or even disappearance of glacier runoff regulation functions may lead to the amplified variation of runoff and sustainability of water supplies resulting in the increase of extreme drought and flood disaster risk although the study mainly focuses on the impact of glaciers on runoff in monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau based on hydrological model it can provide scientific understanding for the regulation functions of glaciers on runoff under global warming in other regions such as southern andes antarctic and subantarctic central asia and central europe moreover the hydrological model is an efficient way to investigate the runoff process under climate change and this study verifies its merit performance in representing the impact of glaciers on the spatiotemporal variation of runoff and the runoff evolution under global warming and glacier changes therefore the hydrological model similar to that used in this study can be applied to investigate the runoff process of glacier river basins in other glaciated regions with suitable and effective model parameters 4 2 uncertainties and prospects of this study this study aimed to investigate the runoff process of basins with different glacier ratios under climate change but several modeling uncertainties remain to be addressed in future studies permafrost is widely distributed in tp and the increase in temperature has led to permafrost degradation and thickening of the active layer wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 which can affect the infiltration and subsurface flow path of hydrological processes rogger et al 2017 however the soil freezing and thawing scheme is seldom considered in the state of art models including the sphy model applied to high mountain areas which would introduce uncertainties in the quantitative research and prediction of hydrological processes additionally vegetation can influence the hydrological process through precipitation interception evaporation and soil infiltration processes williams et al 2012 shao et al 2019 and thus the impact of vegetation change associated with future climate change is worth considering therefore the improvement of hydrological models by considering seasonal permafrost and vegetation change is essential for more accurate hydrological modeling and prediction and this would be the direction of our further research climate data generated by gcms were used as input variables to drive the hydrological model in order to obtain more accurate hydrological responses for estimating water availability in the future therefore in addition to the uncertainty of the hydrological modeling itself the uncertainty of the climate modeling would also have an important impact on the reliability of the projection of hydrological processes future climate characteristics were estimated under certain hypothetical scenarios however there was an uncertainty in the climate change scenario driven by anthropogenic activities meinshausen et al 2011 nevertheless gcms under different scenarios can still be applied to forecast future climate change evaluate the severity of regional hazards zhu and yang 2020 and guide the formulation of national policies to reduce the risks associated with climate change the uncertainties in gcms may be attributable to the inadequate comprehension of the climate system at present moreover relevant conclusions can sometimes be controversial owing to the complexity of the models therefore numerical approximation schemes and various gcm generalizations and parameterizations are required slingo et al 1996 zhang et al 2021 moreover different gcms may have different responses to the same forcing scenario and methods for acquiring more reliable climate prediction are thus required zhuan et al 2019 for instance results of multi model ensemble means would be more consistent with observations than a single model mote and salathé 2010 although most cmip6 models could reveal a reasonable spatial pattern for the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation over tp there are systematic errors wet bias and cold bias in cmip6 models zhu and yang 2020 previous studies found a physical correlation between albedo and cold bias and the larger cold bias during the cold season may be attributed to shortcomings in the simulation of ice and snow feedback chen et al 2017a 2017b qu et al 2019 further efforts should be made to promote the scientific knowledge of sources of model errors in tp and the temperature bias in tp can possibly be reduced by improving the simulation of snow cover area in the monsoon influenced southern tp annual precipitation was overestimated resulting in large wet bias previous studies indicated that low resolution models were insufficient to accurately reproduce precipitation related to fine orography and the accuracy of precipitation over tp could be improved by increasing the resolution e g li et al 2015 however there were still large biases in the precipitation intensity and spatial distribution with higher resolution over tp which was closely related to the selection of physical parameterization schemes duan et al 2013 ji and kang 2013 therefore it is necessary to improve both the resolution and the physical process to obtain more realistic precipitation over the tp with complex precipitation physical processes he et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study runoff processes of basins with different glacier ratios in the monsoon influenced southern tibetan plateau were explored on the basis of the observed meteorological data and river runoff modis snow cover products sphy model and 25 models of cmip6 the main findings are as follows 1 the major runoff component shifted from glacier runoff to rainfall runoff when the glacier ratio decreased and the critical threshold was between 20 and 13 5 2 glacier distribution had important impacts on the spatiotemporal variation of runoff with glacier runoff showing higher contribution to total runoff than the glacier ratio by more than two times 3 glacier and rainfall runoff would show increasing trends with increasing precipitation under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c while snowmelt runoff would present a decreasing trend 4 a power function fit was observed between glacier ratio and the hydrological regulation function of glaciers and the role of glaciers in regulating runoff abundance and dieback would decrease because of glacier retreat in the future the variations in runoff processes in glacier river basins indicated the accelerated transformation of glaciers into liquid water would increase the risk of flood disasters because the superposition of rainfall runoff and glacier melt runoff would significantly increase the water yield downstream however the contribution of glacier melt water to river runoff would be reduced and the regulating function of glaciers would be weakened with glacier retreat which would increase the risk of drought in the far future therefore mitigation measures should be implemented for sustainable water resource management in high mountain areas under climate change hydrological models and gcms are indispensable tools for exploring runoff processes under global change however owing to uncertainties in the climate model the downscaling method would lead to uncertainties in evaluating influence of climate change meanwhile changes in high mountain areas not only affect the water cycle through water phase transformation but also affect the runoff process by changing various parameters such as soil characteristics vegetation and geomorphic morphology although great progress had been made in research on the hydrological effects of changes in high mountain areas many physical mechanisms remain unclear and existing models cannot adequately consider the complex processes and influence mechanisms thus introducing large uncertainties in the simulation and prediction of river runoff in high mountain areas therefore it is essential to reduce these uncertainties through more comprehensive understanding of hydrological processes and climate system mechanisms in the future this study revealed that the glacier ratio has significant influences on the spatiotemporal distribution of runoff and the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in southern tp it also explored the future change characteristics of river runoff which would be helpful for better understanding hydrological processes in tp and other similar alpine areas the findings are expected to provide a scientific basis for water resources management under climate change credit

of the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries pertaining to lancang mekong hydropower development over the decades and the causes of the shift in the sentiment and topics of media reporting and 3 to probe the potential link between intercountry changes in attitudes and concerns from media reporting and the emergence and evolution of hydropower related disputes 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical framework national politicians use the news media as an effective way to express their views on domestic or international political issues and narrative frames that are aligned with national interests or their dominant ideology dominate the media thereby shaping people s perceptions of events jang 2013 jiang et al 2017 in other words media reports can reflect to some extent the different attitudes and standpoints of politicians and the public jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 making media report mining an effective way to understand conflicts including those surrounding the lancang mekong hydropower development project this research uses media frame theory fig 1 a process that includes i the collection and preprocessing of media reports from mainstream news databases and the official website of the mekong river commission mrc ii sentiment analysis and topic mining designed to explore perceptions and how they change regarding lancang mekong hydropower development with sentiment scores corresponding to attitudes and topics corresponding to concerns and iii a statistical analysis designed to reveal the key factors influencing perception shifts in national media 2 2 study area the lancang mekong river originates in the tibetan plateau in china and flows through myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam mrc 2022 fig 2 it has a total length of approximately 4900 km a wide basin latitude 8 41 33 82 n and a wide ranging altitude 0 6740 m its basin spans multiple climate zones and is sensitive to global climate change xie and fan 2021 mrc 2022 longitudinal climate differences are associated with frequent droughts and floods which have adversely affected riparian countries and attracted international attention to lancang mekong water disputes pearse smith 2012 mrc 2022 especially regarding the effects of hydropower development the topography of the lancang mekong river basin is high in the north and low in the south fig 2 with complex hydrological characteristics and uneven spatial and temporal distributions of water resources and hydropower potential between upstream china myanmar and laos and downstream thailand cambodia and vietnam riparian countries fan et al 2015 yun et al 2017 the upper lancang mekong river mainly flows through mountainous valleys with a large drop in elevation hence upstream countries are rich in water and hydropower resources mrc 1995 yun et al 2017 according to schmitt et al 2019 there are 27 hydropower plants completed under construction and planned in china and 67 in laos which are in predominantly upstream locations of which 26 in china and 12 in laos are in the mainstream in contrast the lower river mainly flows through plains with small drop offs making downstream countries suitable for agriculture and fisheries but offering limited potential for hydropower development mrc 1995 yun et al 2017 the number of hydropower plants completed under construction and planned in thailand cambodia and vietnam are 4 13 and 13 respectively of which only 3 are in the mainstream 2 3 data sources and preprocessing the lexisnexis factiva and wisesearch databases were searched to extract media reports pertaining to hydropower development on the lancang mekong river from 1971 to 2020 the exact query was lancang or mekong and hydropower or hydroelectric or hydroelectricity or water power or dam or hydraulic power each item had a headline text and date of publication a total of 20 715 pieces were obtained of which 15 119 pieces were obtained from factiva 4890 pieces were obtained from lexisnexis 410 pieces of chinese media reporting were obtained from wisesearch and 296 pieces were obtained from the mrc website https www mrcmekong org news and events considering that the databases used did not include media from laos we used digital archives including the vientiane times https www vientianetimeslao la and pasaxon http www pasaxon org la to obtain media reporting in such cases by applying the search criteria described above we included at least two media sources from each riparian country to represent different political positions and ideological cultures liberal neutral or conservative carvalho 2007 counting the number of media reports in each riparian country we found that the sample size of media reports in cambodia vietnam and myanmar before the 1990 s was small this size is applicable for sentiment analysis but insufficient for topic mining moreover myanmar is not a member of the mrc mainly because less than 3 of the lancang mekong river basin area lies within the country anonworld bank group 2007 accordingly myanmar has little interest in lancang mekong development and thus its media data are limited after removing duplicate pieces 15 062 items remained for subsequent analysis media reporting in china was translated into english for unification then all data were preprocessed with the natural language toolkit nltk library in python which mainly includes uppercase to lowercase changes stopword removal and tokenization during this process indistinguishable words with a frequency that was too low or too high were also deleted in addition the transboundary freshwater dispute database created by oregon state university wolf 1999 the official websites of the mrc http www mrcmekong org and the asian disaster reduction center adrc https www adrc asia and the emergency events database em dat https www emdat be were used to analyse the drivers of the discrepancies and changes in attitudes and concerns 2 4 sentiment analysis dictionary based sentiment analysis is simple but relies on manual construction and has low accuracy devika et al 2016 it can be improved by machine learning especially deep learning algorithms including convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm and bidirectional long short term memory bilstm xu et al 2019 among these techniques bilstm is more widely used in related studies because it can more accurately capture bidirectional semantic dependence xu et al 2019 the experimental dataset was constructed from 5000 media reports of which 3500 items were randomly selected as the training set and 1500 items as the test set all clean texts were processed using the tensorflow package in python to generate bilstm sentiment analysis models each report was assigned a sentiment score the main steps included i vectorizing texts using the word2vec pretraining model ii modelling bilstm for context feature extraction based on eqs 1 3 using the keras interface of tensorflow and iii outputting sentiment probabilities using the softmax classifier next the common indicators of the field were used for verification xu et al 2019 we selected binary cross entropy as the loss function and adam as the optimizer to train the bilstm based sentiment model using an initial number of iterations of 100 a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 0 01 by applying the model the sentiment scores of media reports in six riparian countries from 1971 to 2020 were calculated 1 h t lstm x t h t 1 2 h t lstm x t h t 1 3 h t w t h t v t h t b t where h t and h

the drawback of the tendency of topic analysis to produce static observations these models consider the model parameters topic distribution and changes in the text distribution of each document over time many evolved versions are based on dtms such as continuous time dynamic topic models cdtms wang et al 2012 and dtms based on two layer of nmf dtms nmf greene and cross 2017 dtms nmf greene and cross 2017 which are based on the most used dtms blei and lafferty 2006 were used for topic content analysis via the gensim package in python taking years as the period the dynamic topic distribution in media reporting among six riparian countries in successive time periods was extracted by two layer nmf as follows greene and cross 2017 the topic intensity was calculated using the method proposed by griffiths and steyvers 2004 based on the document topic probability distribution and taking year as a variable to measure i the full time stamped media reporting databases is divided into τ disjoint time windows t 1 t τ at each time window t i the nmf parameter selection equation is applied coh t 1 k h 1 k coh t h coh is the coherence of topic models t is topic models consisting of k topics t ℎ is a single topic to generate topic models containing k i topic for each time window ii a topic term matrix b with n m size is constructed where n is the total number of topic documents and m is the remaining subset of terms when applying the second layer of dtms nmf to matrix b the matrix b was further used to identify k dynamic topics that may span multiple time windows 2 6 statistical analysis the correlation between the sentiment scores dependent variable and the drivers independent variables table 1 was analysed using spearman s rank correlation src model and an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model in pasw statistics formerly known as spss statistics software according to schäfer et al 2014 and liu et al 2011 drivers can be classified into three groups problem indicators focusing events and social feedback the src model was used to assess the correlation between the problem indicator variables and the dependent variable and their significance was assessed by src coefficients srccs the arima model was used to assess the relationships between the latter two groups of independent variables and the dependent variable and their significance was evaluated using standardized omega weights ωst and p values p 3 results the accuracy recall and f1 values are higher than 80 for the trained topic models and are higher than 71 for the sentiment analysis models as illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4a the evolutionary process of the sentiment level and topics in media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in riparian countries underwent five broad stages 1971 1991 1992 1994 1995 2008 2009 2015 and 2016 2020 specific intercountry discrepancies and changes in the sentiment and topics in media reporting are analysed as follows 3 1 intercountry discrepancies and changes in attitudes fig 3 and fig 4a show that the sentiment level and scores regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in media reporting differed substantially over the time stages and among the six riparian countries the sentiment scores of media reports in china and laos were positive and presented an increasing trend they were also higher than those in thailand cambodia vietnam and myanmar after stage ii the sentiment scores regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam shifted from positive to negative values and exhibited a substantial decreasing trend however the sentiment scores of media reports in myanmar regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were close to zero and changed only slightly during the study period representative polarity words occurring in media reports are shown in fig 3b c in stage i the issue sentiment scores of media reports were relatively low but positive in all riparian countries media reports in china laos and thailand had higher sentiment scores than those in cambodia vietnam and myanmar there are multiple generalized peaks and valleys in the sentiment scores shown in fig 4a with representative peaks occurring during stage ii and representative valleys occurring during stage iv in stage ii positive and slightly increasing sentiment scores of media reports were observed in riparian countries excluding thailand for stages iii and iv the sentiment scores of media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam dropped drastically whereas those in the remaining riparian countries were relatively constant in stage v the sentiment scores of media reports in riparian countries excluding vietnam increased slightly fig 4a also shows that the sentiment scores of media reports in laos were higher than those in china in stages iv and v 3 2 intercountry discrepancies and changes in concerns similar to the sentiment scores the topics in media reports in china and laos regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were consistently positive whereas they shifted from positive to negative in the remaining riparian countries after stage ii fig 3 relevant representative words and their exact meanings are described in depth in fig 5 the topics in media reports varied with the time stages positive topics such as carrying out mekong hydropower development topic 20 electricity demand topic 17 electricity cooperation topic 16 and electricity trade topic 18 occurred frequently in media reports in riparian countries especially china laos and thailand in stages i and ii starting in stage iii negative topics prevailed in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam which mainly focused on the impacts of the dams on the water quantity and level fisheries and livelihoods topics 1 2 and 3 meanwhile opposition to hydropower development in china topic 9 and laos topic 10 became a hot topic in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam at stage v topic 10 received more attention than topic 9 moreover lancang mekong hydropower development in china and laos was considered a geopolitical and national security issue topic 11 in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam 3 3 drivers of intercountry discrepancies as shown in table 2 the order of the average sentiment scores of media reports from 1971 to 2020 in riparian countries correlated significantly with the hydropower resource order scc 0 657 and location order scc 0 586 but weakly with the extreme weather events order scc 0 414 a weak correlation existed between the extreme weather event order and location order scc 0 429 table 3 shows that the sentiment scores of media reports in cambodia and vietnam were significantly correlated with the cambodian civil war and the cambodia vietnam war the sentiment scores of media reports in all riparian countries exhibited a significant correlation with the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment of regional mechanisms for instance the sentiment scores of media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam correlated significantly ωst 0 27 p 0 03 with the establishment of the mrc while those in china and laos correlated significantly ωst 0 25 p 0 036 with the launch of the lmcm in addition extraterritorially dominant events such as the return of the us to the lancang mekong region and the initiation of the lower mekong initiative lmi in 2009 were significantly correlated with the sentiment scores of media reports in riparian countries ωst 0 2 p 0 02 whereas the japan led greater mekong subregion gms economic cooperation and the japan association of southeast asian nations asean forum in 1992 presented strong correlations with the sentiment scores of media reports in laos ωst 0 22 p 0 02 and cambodia ωst 0 21 p 0 03 social feedback is mainly reflected in the significance of international environmental nongovernmental organization engo activity in thai media reports 4 discussion 4 1 influence of geographical location on the divergence in attitudes and concerns between upstream and downstream countries a significant divergence in sentiment scores and representative topics in media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development from 1971 to 2020 between upstream china and laos and downstream thailand cambodia and vietnam countries was observed media reports in upstream countries had higher sentiment scores and included more positive topics than those in downstream countries fig 3 a circumstance that was considerably related to the differences in geographical location and hydropower development potential among the riparian countries in the lancang mekong river this notion was supported by previous qualitative studies on other international rivers jiang et al 2017 bernauer and bohmelt 2020 which reported that countries with favourable geographical conditions for water resource utilization including hydropower development tended to build more hydropower dams along the lancang mekong river upstream countries are richer in hydropower resources than downstream countries the number of hydropower dams in upstream countries that exist that are under construction and that are planned reached 94 roughly more than three times that in downstream countries schmitt et al 2019 downstream countries rely heavily on agriculture and fisheries on the lower lancang mekong floodplains which are likely sensitive to hydropower development on the upper lancang mekong river therefore media reports in downstream countries held negative attitudes towards hydropower dams on the mainstem of the lancang mekong river in upstream countries hirsch and philip 2016 wake 2021 even though damming on the tributaries of the lower lancang mekong river exerted considerable adverse impacts on fish diversity and ecological services arias et al 2014 recent decades have witnessed a widening divergence in sentiment scores and representative topics between upstream and downstream countries media reports in downstream countries exhibited more concerns about changes in water levels and arbitrarily linked these changes to upstream dams topics 9 10 and 1 in stages iii to v this finding can be attributed to the impact of frequent extreme weather events strongly associated with global climate change as reported by previous studies stone 2011 fan et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 these subjective predictions overstated the unfavourable downstream impacts of hydropower development and triggered water related disputes in circumstances of extreme drought and flood for instance the 2009 2010 2015 2016 and 2019 2020 severe droughts in the lower lancang mekong river basin triggered malicious condemnations of lancang cascade dams in china miyan 2015 a recent study argued that the water discharge of the lancang mekong river has increased by 70 in the dry season and decreased by 30 in the rainy season following the operation of upstream hydropower dams effectively reducing the economic and ecological losses of downstream countries from droughts and floods chinadialogue 2019 moreover the decline in the suspended load to the mekong delta was another dispute resulting from upstream dams marchesiello et al 2019 bussi et al 2021 darby et al 2016 it was estimated that more than 60 of the declining fluvial suspended sediment loads were contributed by a shift in tropical cyclone climatology darby et al 2016 4 2 influence of geopolitical events on the discrepancies and changes in attitudes and concerns among riparian countries although they were generally consistent among upstream countries and among downstream countries for the entire study period media attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development differed among upstream or downstream countries in different stages and these differences have been scarcely explored quantitatively by previous studies pearse smith 2012 lu et al 2021 wei et al 2021 the results of the arima time series analysis demonstrated that the interstage differences among upstream or downstream countries were significantly related to typical geopolitical events including local wars the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment of regional mechanisms table 3 considering that during war countries are incapable of participating in lancang mekong hydropower cooperation and comprehensive development browder and ortolano 2000 media reports in cambodia and vietnam regarding hydropower development were limited during the first two stages in contrast the other riparian countries were enthusiastic about hydropower development topic 20 for instance the lancang cascade dams in china pearse smith 2012 and the sirindhorn chulabhorn and lam ta khong dams in thailand aroonrat and wongwises 2015 were planned or developed in this period and accordingly more media reporting on hydropower development occurred in these countries with the cessation of the cambodia vietnam war higher sentiment scores of media reports occurred in these two countries however the renewed establishment of the mrc in 1995 together with the interference of extraterritorial forces heightened opposing attitudes towards hydropower development between upstream and downstream countries the impacts of hydropower development on downstream livelihoods fisheries and environments topics 1 6 became predominant topics of media reports in downstream countries the sudden shift from large scale development to sustainable development of the lancang mekong river mrc 1995 raised disproportionate concerns about the unfavourable effects of hydropower development in downstream countries mrc 1995 gong 2020 moreover dams in china were irrationally regarded as a geopolitical threat by the lmi stone 2011 chang 2013 which was verified by the fact that media reports paid more attention to negative topics such as opposing hydropower development in china laos and even malicious speculation from the perspective of geopolitics and national security topics 1 9 and 10 nevertheless other geopolitical events such as the operation of the gms economic cooperation the asean forum and the lmcm homogenized the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries regarding lancang mekong hydropower development the initiation of the gms economic cooperation and the asean forum prompted most riparian countries to prioritize hydropower development and related issues topic 20 and topic 15 which led to relatively consistent media attitudes and concerns regarding hydropower development in stage ii this finding is supported by previous studies krongkaew 2004 lin and grundy warr 2012 wei et al 2021 which reported that the gms economic cooperation boosted the enthusiasm of riparian countries except thailand to build hydropower dams for economic development thailand on the other hand is the riparian country mostly affected by the western environmental movement an improvement in global environmental awareness began in the 1970 s and has been prevalent in thailand since the 1990 s dunlap and mertig 1991 the social and environmental impacts of large projects including lancang mekong hydropower dams have received increasing attention in thailand hirsch and philip 2016 where media reports reflect public opposition to dams such as the domestic pak mun dam foran and manorom 2012 dechalert 1999 for this reason thailand s media gradually lost enthusiasm for lancang mekong hydropower development in the early 1990 s foran and manorom 2012 more recently the launch of the lmcm in 2016 aimed to strengthen the cooperation among riparian countries by prioritizing water resource cooperation and water related issues of common concern feng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 it has also led to a convergence in attitudes and concerns regarding hydropower development among riparian countries however the gap in attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development between upstream and downstream countries reflected in media reporting has remained wide with projections of increasingly frequent extreme weather events and the interference of extraterritorial forces narrowing the gap in hydroelectric power between riparian countries is essential for eradicating looming conflicts and disputes and for enhancing social economic and political cooperation in the lancang mekong river basin 5 conclusions water disputes related to hydropower development in the lancang mekong river constitute a hotspot issue in regional geopolitics in this study dynamic topic modelling based on text segmentation of yearly media reports from 1971 to 2020 obtained from news databases combined with deep learning sentiment analysis and statistical analysis was used to capture the dynamics and drivers of the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries regarding lancang mekong hydropower development the results quantitatively show that the attitudes and concerns of media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development differed between upstream and downstream countries and media perspectives were dominated by the impact of geographical features of riparian countries that were associated with vulnerabilities to extreme weather events changes in media attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were also affected by geopolitical events such as local wars the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment and operation of regional mechanisms the gap in media attitudes and concerns between upstream and downstream countries was narrowed by the operation of the gms economic cooperation and the asean forum but was widened by the operation of the mrc and the lmi and sometimes the excesses of the environmental movement originating in the west however the lmcm had a limited effect on homogenizing the media attitudes and concerns between riparian countries because of its short operation time the findings highlight the value of mining media reporting for revealing the evolution and drivers of water disputes and early warning of the occurrence of water related issues in international rivers as the lancang mekong river is a transboundary in geography and produces significant effects from alterations to its ecological condition we conducted a basin wide media analysis by mining a variety of databases this method of mining media reporting can also be extended to the analysis of other domestic and transboundary environmental conflicts in addition to the practical and valuable results obtained the perception of international river water disputes can be further deepened by using an unbiased dataset once a more open and balanced media can operate within an established community that supports a common destiny among riparian countries furthermore the inclusion of social media and research papers in sentiment analysis and topical evolution modelling is urgently needed to remove the potential effects of limited media reporting in future work credit authorship contribution statement wenping yin methodology software validation

united nations world water development report in 2020 the number of water related conflicts between 2000 and 2019 was more than four times higher than that between 1980 and 1999 anonunited nations water 2020 icta uab 2021 with such conflicts mainly occurring in international river regions bernauer and bohmelt 2020 several water related disputes such as those between israel and the arab countries on the jordan river between china india and bangladesh on the brahmaputra river and between china laos thailand cambodia vietnam and myanmar on the lancang mekong river pearse smith 2012 hirsch and philip 2016 have seriously threatened regional or even global peace and development wake 2021 the management of international rivers is challenging because of insufficient knowledge about the attitudes and concerns of politicians and the public in riparian countries regarding water resource exploitation and utilization barnaby 2009 therefore understanding the discrepancies in changes in and drivers of the values and priorities of riparian countries regarding the exploitation and utilization of international rivers is essential for enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation facilitating cross boundary water resource management and preventing the escalation of water disputes numerous methods such as quantitative or comparative analysis based on the international water

2017 xie and jia 2017 or quantitative content analysis wei et al 2015 xiong et al 2016 based on media reporting have been used in international river water dispute research among them media reporting is effective in analysing environmental conflicts including international river water disputes featuring environmental political and social complexities because to some extent it reflects the perceptions of politicians and the public and serves as an early warning system as it guides public opinion jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 the development of text mining algorithms for extracting useful information from media reports can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of political environmental situations than that provided by only content analysis jiang et al 2017 wei et al 2021 in recent decades numerous text mining algorithms including sentiment analysis and topic mining have been developed and partly applied to extract attitudes and concerns pertaining to water disputes from media reporting wei et al 2015 2021 xiong et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 compared to water scarcity indicators computed from traditional data the priority claims of countries extracted from media reporting can better target and time consultations among stakeholders in multilateral negotiations although sound in topic mining static models including latent dirichlet allocation lda probabilistic latent semantic analysis plsa nonnegative matrix factorization nmf and structural topic models stms fail to discover topic evolution which is crucial for understanding and eliminating water disputes wei et al 2015 2021 xiong et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 the longest international river shared by southeast asia and china the lancang mekong river has become one of the global hotspots of transboundary water disputes pearse smith 2012 fan et al 2015 in recent decades the lancang mekong region has faced intractable water disputes under the intertwining effects of climate change and extraterritorial political interference stone 2011 chang 2013 hydropower development in particular has become one of the most active topics due to its unfavorable impacts on politics economics the transboundary environment and national security mrc 1995 hirsch and philip 2016 several events such as the severe drought in the region in 2015 and 2019 caused by el niño and la niña miyan 2015 and the break in the xe pian xe namnoy dam in laos in 2018 have heightened hydropower development disputes and triggered imminent water crises latrubesse et al 2020 although these disputes were settled through consultation they have not been fundamentally eliminated pearse smith 2012 feng et al 2019 gong 2020 wei et al 2021 however little is known about whether and to what extent the evolution of these disputes can be considerably uncovered and even accurately predicted by deeply mining the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries in news reporting therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to provide a novel way of analysing the dynamics of media reporting used for capturing environmental conflicts and developing resolution strategies 2 to quantitatively uncover the patterns and dynamics of the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries pertaining to lancang mekong hydropower development over the decades and the causes of the shift in the sentiment and topics of media reporting and 3 to probe the potential link between intercountry changes in attitudes and concerns from media reporting and the emergence and evolution of hydropower related disputes 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical framework national politicians use the news media as an effective way to express their views on domestic or international political issues and narrative frames that are aligned with national interests or their dominant ideology dominate the media thereby shaping people s perceptions of events jang 2013 jiang et al 2017 in other words media reports can reflect to some extent the different attitudes and standpoints of politicians and the public jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 making media report mining an effective way to understand conflicts including those surrounding the lancang mekong hydropower development project this research uses media frame theory fig 1 a process that includes i the collection and preprocessing of media reports from mainstream news databases and the official website of the mekong river commission mrc ii sentiment analysis and topic mining designed to explore perceptions and how they change regarding lancang mekong hydropower development with sentiment scores corresponding to attitudes and topics corresponding to concerns and iii a statistical analysis designed to reveal the key factors influencing perception shifts in national media 2 2 study area the lancang mekong river originates in the tibetan plateau in china and flows through myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam mrc 2022 fig 2 it has a total length of approximately 4900 km a wide basin latitude 8 41 33 82 n and a wide ranging altitude 0 6740 m its basin spans multiple climate zones and is sensitive to global climate change xie and fan 2021 mrc 2022 longitudinal climate differences are associated with frequent droughts and floods which have adversely affected riparian countries and attracted international attention to lancang mekong water disputes pearse smith 2012 mrc 2022 especially regarding the effects of hydropower development the topography of the lancang mekong river basin is high in the north and low in the south fig 2 with complex hydrological characteristics and uneven spatial and temporal distributions of water resources and hydropower potential between upstream china myanmar and laos and downstream thailand cambodia and vietnam riparian countries fan et al 2015 yun et al 2017 the upper lancang mekong river mainly flows through mountainous valleys with a large drop in elevation hence upstream countries are rich in water and hydropower resources mrc 1995 yun et al 2017 according to schmitt et al 2019 there are 27 hydropower plants completed under construction and planned in china and 67 in laos which are in predominantly upstream locations of which 26 in china and 12 in laos are in the mainstream in contrast the lower river mainly flows through plains with small drop offs making downstream countries suitable for agriculture and fisheries but offering limited potential for hydropower development mrc 1995 yun et al 2017 the number of hydropower plants completed under construction and planned in thailand cambodia and vietnam are 4 13 and 13 respectively of which only 3 are in the mainstream 2 3 data sources and preprocessing the lexisnexis factiva and wisesearch databases were searched to extract media reports pertaining to hydropower development on the lancang mekong river from 1971 to 2020 the exact query was lancang or mekong and hydropower or hydroelectric or hydroelectricity or water power or dam or hydraulic power each item had a headline text and date of publication a total of 20 715 pieces were obtained of which 15 119 pieces were obtained from factiva 4890 pieces were obtained from lexisnexis 410 pieces of chinese media reporting were obtained from wisesearch and 296 pieces were obtained from the mrc website https www mrcmekong org news and events considering that the databases used did not include media from laos we used digital archives including the vientiane times https www vientianetimeslao la and pasaxon http www pasaxon org la to obtain media reporting in such cases by applying the search criteria described above we included at least two media sources from each riparian country to represent different political positions and ideological cultures liberal neutral or conservative carvalho 2007 counting the number of media reports in each riparian country we found that the sample size of media reports in cambodia vietnam and myanmar before the 1990 s was small this size is applicable for sentiment analysis but insufficient for topic mining moreover myanmar is not a member of the mrc mainly because less than 3 of the lancang mekong river basin area lies within the country anonworld bank group 2007 accordingly myanmar has little interest in lancang mekong development and thus its media data are limited after removing duplicate pieces 15 062 items remained for subsequent analysis media reporting in china was translated into english for unification then all data were preprocessed with the natural language toolkit nltk library in python which mainly includes uppercase to lowercase changes stopword removal and tokenization during this process indistinguishable words with a frequency that was too low or too high were also deleted in addition the transboundary freshwater dispute database created by oregon state university wolf 1999 the official websites of the mrc http www mrcmekong org and the asian disaster reduction center adrc https www adrc asia and the emergency events database em dat https www emdat be were used to analyse the drivers of the discrepancies and changes in attitudes and concerns 2 4 sentiment analysis dictionary based sentiment analysis is simple but relies on manual construction and has low accuracy devika et al 2016 it can be improved by machine learning especially deep learning algorithms including convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm and bidirectional long short term memory bilstm xu et al 2019 among these techniques bilstm is more widely used in related studies because it can more accurately capture bidirectional semantic dependence xu et al 2019 the experimental dataset was constructed from 5000 media reports of which 3500 items were randomly selected as the training set and 1500 items as the test set all clean texts were processed using the tensorflow package in python to generate bilstm sentiment analysis models each report was assigned a sentiment score the main steps included i vectorizing texts using the word2vec pretraining model ii modelling bilstm for context feature extraction based on eqs 1 3 using the keras interface of tensorflow and iii outputting sentiment probabilities using the softmax classifier next the common indicators of the field were used for verification xu et al 2019 we selected binary cross entropy as the loss function and adam as the optimizer to train the bilstm based sentiment model using an initial number of iterations of 100 a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 0 01 by applying the model the sentiment scores of media reports in six riparian countries from 1971 to 2020 were calculated 1 h t lstm x t h t 1 2 h t lstm x t h t 1 3 h t w t h t v t h t b t where h t and h t represent forward and backward feature extraction respectively h t is the combined values of h t and h t representing the current input state w t and v t denote the output weight matrix of h t and h t respectively x t is the current input and b t is the bias vector at moment t xu et al 2019 2 5 topic evolution modelling dynamic topic models dtms were proposed by blei and lafferty 2006 to address the drawback of the tendency of topic analysis to produce static observations these models consider the model parameters topic distribution and changes in the text distribution of each document over time many evolved versions are based on dtms such as continuous time dynamic topic models cdtms wang et al 2012 and dtms based on two layer of nmf dtms nmf greene and cross 2017 dtms nmf greene and cross 2017 which are based on the most used dtms blei and lafferty 2006 were used for topic content analysis via the gensim package in python taking years as the period the dynamic topic distribution in media reporting among six riparian countries in successive time periods was extracted by two layer nmf as follows greene and cross 2017 the topic intensity was calculated using the method proposed by griffiths and steyvers 2004 based on the document topic probability distribution and taking year as a variable to measure i the full time stamped media reporting databases is divided into τ disjoint time windows t 1 t τ at each time window t i the nmf parameter selection equation is applied coh t 1 k h 1 k coh t h coh is the coherence of topic models t is topic models consisting of k topics t ℎ is a single topic to generate topic models containing k i topic for each time window ii a topic term matrix b with n m size is constructed where n is the total number of topic documents and m is the remaining subset of terms when applying the second layer of dtms nmf to matrix b the matrix b was further used to identify k dynamic topics that may span multiple time windows 2 6 statistical analysis the correlation between the sentiment scores dependent variable and the drivers independent variables table 1 was analysed using spearman s rank correlation src model and an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model in pasw statistics formerly known as spss statistics software according to schäfer et al 2014 and liu et al 2011 drivers can be classified into three groups problem indicators focusing events and social feedback the src model was used to assess the correlation between the problem indicator variables and the dependent variable and their significance was assessed by src coefficients srccs the arima model was used to assess the relationships between the latter two groups of independent variables and the dependent variable and their significance was evaluated using standardized omega weights ωst and p values p 3 results the accuracy recall and f1 values are higher than 80 for the trained topic models and are higher than 71 for the sentiment analysis models as illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4a the evolutionary process of the sentiment level and topics in media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in riparian countries underwent five broad stages 1971 1991 1992 1994 1995 2008 2009 2015 and 2016 2020 specific intercountry discrepancies and changes in the sentiment and topics in media reporting are analysed as follows 3 1 intercountry discrepancies and changes in attitudes fig 3 and fig 4a show that the sentiment level and scores regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in media reporting differed substantially over the time stages and among the six riparian countries the sentiment scores of media reports in china and laos were positive and presented an increasing trend they were also higher than those in thailand cambodia vietnam and myanmar after stage ii the sentiment scores regarding lancang mekong hydropower development in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam shifted from positive to negative values and exhibited a substantial decreasing trend however the sentiment scores of media reports in myanmar regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were close to zero and changed only slightly during the study period representative polarity words occurring in media reports are shown in fig 3b c in stage i the issue sentiment scores of media reports were relatively low but positive in all riparian countries media reports in china laos and thailand had higher sentiment scores than those in cambodia vietnam and myanmar there are multiple generalized peaks and valleys in the sentiment scores shown in fig 4a with representative peaks occurring during stage ii and representative valleys occurring during stage iv in stage ii positive and slightly increasing sentiment scores of media reports were observed in riparian countries excluding thailand for stages iii and iv the sentiment scores of media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam dropped drastically whereas those in the remaining riparian countries were relatively constant in stage v the sentiment scores of media reports in riparian countries excluding vietnam increased slightly fig 4a also shows that the sentiment scores of media reports in laos were higher than those in china in stages iv and v 3 2 intercountry discrepancies and changes in concerns similar to the sentiment scores the topics in media reports in china and laos regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were consistently positive whereas they shifted from positive to negative in the remaining riparian countries after stage ii fig 3 relevant representative words and their exact meanings are described in depth in fig 5 the topics in media reports varied with the time stages positive topics such as carrying out mekong hydropower development topic 20 electricity demand topic 17 electricity cooperation topic 16 and electricity trade topic 18 occurred frequently in media reports in riparian countries especially china laos and thailand in stages i and ii starting in stage iii negative topics prevailed in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam which mainly focused on the impacts of the dams on the water quantity and level fisheries and livelihoods topics 1 2 and 3 meanwhile opposition to hydropower development in china topic 9 and laos topic 10 became a hot topic in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam at stage v topic 10 received more attention than topic 9 moreover lancang mekong hydropower development in china and laos was considered a geopolitical and national security issue topic 11 in media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam 3 3 drivers of intercountry discrepancies as shown in table 2 the order of the average sentiment scores of media reports from 1971 to 2020 in riparian countries correlated significantly with the hydropower resource order scc 0 657 and location order scc 0 586 but weakly with the extreme weather events order scc 0 414 a weak correlation existed between the extreme weather event order and location order scc 0 429 table 3 shows that the sentiment scores of media reports in cambodia and vietnam were significantly correlated with the cambodian civil war and the cambodia vietnam war the sentiment scores of media reports in all riparian countries exhibited a significant correlation with the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment of regional mechanisms for instance the sentiment scores of media reports in thailand cambodia and vietnam correlated significantly ωst 0 27 p 0 03 with the establishment of the mrc while those in china and laos correlated significantly ωst 0 25 p 0 036 with the launch of the lmcm in addition extraterritorially dominant events such as the return of the us to the lancang mekong region and the initiation of the lower mekong initiative lmi in 2009 were significantly correlated with the sentiment scores of media reports in riparian countries ωst 0 2 p 0 02 whereas the japan led greater mekong subregion gms economic cooperation and the japan association of southeast asian nations asean forum in 1992 presented strong correlations with the sentiment scores of media reports in laos ωst 0 22 p 0 02 and cambodia ωst 0 21 p 0 03 social feedback is mainly reflected in the significance of international environmental nongovernmental organization engo activity in thai media reports 4 discussion 4 1 influence of geographical location on the divergence in attitudes and concerns between upstream and downstream countries a significant divergence in sentiment scores and representative topics in media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development from 1971 to 2020 between upstream china and laos and downstream thailand cambodia and vietnam countries was observed media reports in upstream countries had higher sentiment scores and included more positive topics than those in downstream countries fig 3 a circumstance that was considerably related to the differences in geographical location and hydropower development potential among the riparian countries in the lancang mekong river this notion was supported by previous qualitative studies on other international rivers jiang et al 2017 bernauer and bohmelt 2020 which reported that countries with favourable geographical conditions for water resource utilization including hydropower development tended to build more hydropower dams along the lancang mekong river upstream countries are richer in hydropower resources than downstream countries the number of hydropower dams in upstream countries that exist that are under construction and that are planned reached 94 roughly more than three times that in downstream countries schmitt et al 2019 downstream countries rely heavily on agriculture and fisheries on the lower lancang mekong floodplains which are likely sensitive to hydropower development on the upper lancang mekong river therefore media reports in downstream countries held negative attitudes towards hydropower dams on the mainstem of the lancang mekong river in upstream countries hirsch and philip 2016 wake 2021 even though damming on the tributaries of the lower lancang mekong river exerted considerable adverse impacts on fish diversity and ecological services arias et al 2014 recent decades have witnessed a widening divergence in sentiment scores and representative topics between upstream and downstream countries media reports in downstream countries exhibited more concerns about changes in water levels and arbitrarily linked these changes to upstream dams topics 9 10 and 1 in stages iii to v this finding can be attributed to the impact of frequent extreme weather events strongly associated with global climate change as reported by previous studies stone 2011 fan et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 these subjective predictions overstated the unfavourable downstream impacts of hydropower development and triggered water related disputes in circumstances of extreme drought and flood for instance the 2009 2010 2015 2016 and 2019 2020 severe droughts in the lower lancang mekong river basin triggered malicious condemnations of lancang cascade dams in china miyan 2015 a recent study argued that the water discharge of the lancang mekong river has increased by 70 in the dry season and decreased by 30 in the rainy season following the operation of upstream hydropower dams effectively reducing the economic and ecological losses of downstream countries from droughts and floods chinadialogue 2019 moreover the decline in the suspended load to the mekong delta was another dispute resulting from upstream dams marchesiello et al 2019 bussi et al 2021 darby et al 2016 it was estimated that more than 60 of the declining fluvial suspended sediment loads were contributed by a shift in tropical cyclone climatology darby et al 2016 4 2 influence of geopolitical events on the discrepancies and changes in attitudes and concerns among riparian countries although they were generally consistent among upstream countries and among downstream countries for the entire study period media attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development differed among upstream or downstream countries in different stages and these differences have been scarcely explored quantitatively by previous studies pearse smith 2012 lu et al 2021 wei et al 2021 the results of the arima time series analysis demonstrated that the interstage differences among upstream or downstream countries were significantly related to typical geopolitical events including local wars the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment of regional mechanisms table 3 considering that during war countries are incapable of participating in lancang mekong hydropower cooperation and comprehensive development browder and ortolano 2000 media reports in cambodia and vietnam regarding hydropower development were limited during the first two stages in contrast the other riparian countries were enthusiastic about hydropower development topic 20 for instance the lancang cascade dams in china pearse smith 2012 and the sirindhorn chulabhorn and lam ta khong dams in thailand aroonrat and wongwises 2015 were planned or developed in this period and accordingly more media reporting on hydropower development occurred in these countries with the cessation of the cambodia vietnam war higher sentiment scores of media reports occurred in these two countries however the renewed establishment of the mrc in 1995 together with the interference of extraterritorial forces heightened opposing attitudes towards hydropower development between upstream and downstream countries the impacts of hydropower development on downstream livelihoods fisheries and environments topics 1 6 became predominant topics of media reports in downstream countries the sudden shift from large scale development to sustainable development of the lancang mekong river mrc 1995 raised disproportionate concerns about the unfavourable effects of hydropower development in downstream countries mrc 1995 gong 2020 moreover dams in china were irrationally regarded as a geopolitical threat by the lmi stone 2011 chang 2013 which was verified by the fact that media reports paid more attention to negative topics such as opposing hydropower development in china laos and even malicious speculation from the perspective of geopolitics and national security topics 1 9 and 10 nevertheless other geopolitical events such as the operation of the gms economic cooperation the asean forum and the lmcm homogenized the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries regarding lancang mekong hydropower development the initiation of the gms economic cooperation and the asean forum prompted most riparian countries to prioritize hydropower development and related issues topic 20 and topic 15 which led to relatively consistent media attitudes and concerns regarding hydropower development in stage ii this finding is supported by previous studies krongkaew 2004 lin and grundy warr 2012 wei et al 2021 which reported that the gms economic cooperation boosted the enthusiasm of riparian countries except thailand to build hydropower dams for economic development thailand on the other hand is the riparian country mostly affected by the western environmental movement an improvement in global environmental awareness began in the 1970 s and has been prevalent in thailand since the 1990 s dunlap and mertig 1991 the social and environmental impacts of large projects including lancang mekong hydropower dams have received increasing attention in thailand hirsch and philip 2016 where media reports reflect public opposition to dams such as the domestic pak mun dam foran and manorom 2012 dechalert 1999 for this reason thailand s media gradually lost enthusiasm for lancang mekong hydropower development in the early 1990 s foran and manorom 2012 more recently the launch of the lmcm in 2016 aimed to strengthen the cooperation among riparian countries by prioritizing water resource cooperation and water related issues of common concern feng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 it has also led to a convergence in attitudes and concerns regarding hydropower development among riparian countries however the gap in attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development between upstream and downstream countries reflected in media reporting has remained wide with projections of increasingly frequent extreme weather events and the interference of extraterritorial forces narrowing the gap in hydroelectric power between riparian countries is essential for eradicating looming conflicts and disputes and for enhancing social economic and political cooperation in the lancang mekong river basin 5 conclusions water disputes related to hydropower development in the lancang mekong river constitute a hotspot issue in regional geopolitics in this study dynamic topic modelling based on text segmentation of yearly media reports from 1971 to 2020 obtained from news databases combined with deep learning sentiment analysis and statistical analysis was used to capture the dynamics and drivers of the attitudes and concerns of riparian countries regarding lancang mekong hydropower development the results quantitatively show that the attitudes and concerns of media reporting regarding lancang mekong hydropower development differed between upstream and downstream countries and media perspectives were dominated by the impact of geographical features of riparian countries that were associated with vulnerabilities to extreme weather events changes in media attitudes and concerns regarding lancang mekong hydropower development were also affected by geopolitical events such as local wars the interference of extraterritorial forces and the establishment and operation of regional mechanisms the gap in media attitudes and concerns between upstream and downstream countries was narrowed by the operation of the gms economic cooperation and the asean forum but was widened by the operation of the mrc and the lmi and sometimes the excesses of the environmental movement originating in the west however the lmcm had a limited effect on homogenizing the media attitudes and concerns between riparian countries because of its short operation time the findings highlight the value of mining media reporting for revealing the evolution and drivers of water disputes and early warning of the occurrence of water related issues in international rivers as the lancang mekong river is a transboundary in geography and produces significant effects from alterations to its ecological condition we conducted a basin wide media analysis by mining a variety of databases this method of mining media reporting can also be extended to the analysis of other domestic and transboundary environmental conflicts in addition to the practical and valuable results obtained the perception of international river water disputes can be further deepened by using an unbiased dataset once a more open and balanced media can operate within an established community that supports a common destiny among riparian countries furthermore the inclusion of social media and research papers in sentiment analysis and topical evolution modelling is urgently needed to remove the potential effects of limited media reporting in future work credit authorship contribution statement wenping yin methodology software validation

7769,study region middle section of the rio grande basin mrg u s study focus long term tradeoffs of technologically possible land and water management interventions were analyzed to adapt irrigated agriculture to growing water scarcity in a desert environment under a projected warm dry future nineteen different intervention scenarios were investigated to evaluate potential watershed scale agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts in the mrg the interventions are based on i management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops ii changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought and salt tolerant crops and iii limitations of the soil and water assessment tool swat model to perform scenario simulations new hydrological insights for the region 1 status quo irrigation management cannot sustain the current crop mix in the face of dwindling river water and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century 2 existing cropping and irrigation interventions create limited water savings and 3 deficit irrigation of alfalfa or removing it from the crop mix allows moderate water savings to sustain high value perennial pecan crops but the region will remain vulnerable to intensive prolonged droughts strategies for future agricultural water sustainability in the study area could include transitioning to relatively drought and salt tolerant crops desalinating brackish groundwater for irrigation and developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use

where heavily irrigated croplands face the risk of increasing water shortages and salinity due to growing demand and extreme variability of renewable water elias et al 2015 chavarria and gutzler 2018 from 1994 2013 the region experienced a 25 increase in the area of pecan orchards which is the highest value crop and the most vulnerable to water shortages and quality decline miyamoto et al 1995 miyamoto and storey 1995 miyamoto 2007 adaptive agricultural water management approaches like irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation and land use management do not require major changes in infrastructure and are already practiced to some extent by farmers in the region skaggs and samani 2005 in recent severe droughts e g 2003 2004 and 2011 2012 producers have typically decreased the acreage of other crops especially alfalfa and cotton or stopped growing them altogether to save water for pecan orchards other methods such as drip irrigation would create a heavier economic burden on farmers due to fundamental changes in irrigation infrastructure along with a variety of challenges to irrigation districts likewise substituting vulnerable high value commodity crops with climate compatible drought tolerant crops has been applied as an adaptation strategy in arid regions herrera 1997 wang et al 2015 the objectives of the paper are two fold 1 simulate a series of agricultural interventions using a calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat watershed hydrology model and 2 evaluate the water conservation potential of each scenario as well as opportunities for agricultural water savings using a combination of the analyzed interventions water conservation potential is defined in this study as the percentage of reduction in watershed scale irrigation water applied by the model under different intervention scenarios the implications of the modeled interventions e g deficit irrigation changing current cropping pattern and growing alternative high value crops for sustaining agricultural production in the mrg within the constraints of projected decreases in water supply are discussed the results inform model based evaluation of agricultural water management interventions in the mrg and hydro climatically similar agricultural watersheds to adapt to growing risks of water shortages due to climate induced future water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area watershed area 6000 km2 agricultural area 400 km2 located in the new mexico texas portion of the rio grande basin fig 1 is arid semi arid with an average annual precipitation of approximately 270 mm less than one third of global average the rio grande streamflow is regulated at the elephant butte eb and caballo reservoirs the eb reservoir capacity 2 5 billion cubic meters bcm is the principal surface water storage in the region caballo reservoir capacity 424 million cubic meters mcm located 40 kilometers downstream of the eb dam regulates the releases from the eb reservoir two usgs gauging stations usgs 08358300 rio grande conveyance channel at san marcial and usgs 08358400 rio grande floodway at san marcial measure inflow to the eb reservoir usgs gauges 08361000 rio grande below eb and 08362500 rio grande below caballo record the reservoirs releases the usgs gauge 08364000 rio grande at el paso measures the outflow from the watershed fig 1 the main irrigated agricultural activities in this portion of the rio grande occur within elephant butte irrigation district ebid which extends from downstream of the caballo reservoir to the el paso gauge surface water availability for agriculture depends on upstream reservoir releases and storage in eb reservoir is derived almost entirely from rio grande inflow as measured at san marcial holmes et al 2022 to compensate for surface water shortages during the irrigation season farmers pump groundwater from the mesilla bolson aquifer one of the main aquifers in the region sheng 2013 as a result the groundwater resources are declining due to increasing withdrawal sheng 2013 fuchs et al 2018 in normal years caballo reservoir releases water from march to september to meet the irrigation water demands in the ebid three diversion dams percha leasburg and mesilla and five main canals distribute water among irrigated farms historical changes in crop patterns reflect adjustments based on water availability fig 2 traditional flood irrigation basin irrigation is commonly practiced in the ebid leading to significant non beneficial consumptive use via surface evaporation and because irrigation schedules typically do not account for crop water demand at different growth stages skaggs and samani 2005 samani and skaggs 2008 while some fields within the irrigation district over irrigate others fail to meet their water requirements skaggs and samani 2005 as freshwater availability declines there is mounting concern about increasing salinity in groundwater and river water salinity monitoring from 2014 to 2016 indicated freshwater tds 1000 mg l flow in the river channel during the reservoir release period and fresh to slightly saline groundwater with tds values ranging 300 2000 mg l in sampled wells along the main stem of the river ma et al 2019 overdraft of fresh groundwater is expected to cause intrusion or upwelling of brackish water deteriorating the quality of water in the aquifer ashworth and hopkins 1995 sheng 2013 as such agricultural producers are concerned about the prospect of reduced fresh water availability especially the sustainability of irrigated pecan production hargrove and heyman 2020 water stress can impact the quality of nuts affect plant growth and in the long run kill the pecan tree saline water with tds more than 700 1000 mg l impacts the growth of pecan trees and shrinks the size of leaves and nuts growth decline starts at ec of 2 5 3 0 ds m in the soil saturation extract while tree die back starts at higher ec 6 8 ds m miyamoto 2007 2 2 watershed modeling accounting for irrigation soil and water assessment tool swat was used to model the mrg basin including heavily irrigated croplands swat is a semi distributed model that simulates watershed hydrology using a water balance approach arnold et al 1998 the model has been widely applied in arid semi arid areas with irrigated agriculture to simulate the impacts of changes in climate and agricultural management samimi et al 2020 the usgs 10 m 10 m dem digital elevation model usgs nd 2008 cropland data layer ssurgo soil map usda nd and precipitation and temperature data from noaa stations were used as input data the usda 2008 cropland data for the study area was assumed to represent average cropping conditions in the region since it was a near normal year with the standardized precipitation index spi of 0 9 samimi et al 2022 the watershed was first divided into hydrological response units hru based on similar land use land cover type soil characteristics and slope in each subbasin the water balance in each hru was subsequently calculated based on weather data management practices irrigation fertilization harvest etc and plant growth information swat s built in databases provide weather data land use and plant growth neitsch et al 2011 the upstream reservoir releases are introduced to the model with an inlet inflow which marks the upstream boundary of the watershed swat model was calibrated and validated for different water budget components described below as well as irrigation amounts the model was first calibrated and validated for monthly observed river flow at the watershed outlet using the sufi2 algorithm in swat cup abbaspour 2015 and then it was manually calibrated with the available data for average annual irrigation and et as well as groundwater recharge in each step the main components streamflow crop et groundwater recharge and applied irrigation were cross compared to find a realistic calibrated parameter set for the heavily managed watershed table 2 the calibration period 1995 2004 covers both high and low flows in the historical period preceded by two years of warm up 1993 1995 to initialize the model the model s performance was evaluated for the period of 2005 2013 due to limited irrigation data range of values were used based on measurements reported in the literature to evaluate the model performance with respect to irrigation e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 samani et al 2005 2009 2011 2013 swat s auto irrigation function was used to simulate the irrigation timing and amount based on default or user defined parameter values because detailed information about the irrigation schedules of each farm were unavailable for manual irrigation simulation the start of irrigation season is defined on a specific day and month or based on the amount of crop heat units the model assumes irrigation continues until soil water content reaches the field capacity neitsch et al 2011 irrigation events are triggered based on plant water demand fraction of decline in plant growth due to water stress or soil water content soil water deficit in mm the specific date and soil water content threshold was selected for auto irrigation of each crop based on agricultural practices in the region the soil water deficit threshold mm for auto irrigation was defined based on total available water content awc fraction for plant uptake in the soil calculated as the difference between the field capacity fraction and wilting point fraction which depends on the soil type the readily available water raw fraction in the soil is the portion of the awc that can be easily used by plants without any water stress raw varies between 0 3 and 0 7 of awc smaller raw values are typically used for dry and hot climates and more stress sensitive crops allen et al 1998 raw has been estimated to be 0 45 0 50 for pecan 0 65 for cotton 0 55 for oat and alfalfa and 0 30 for onion and vegetables allen et al 1998 kallestad et al 2008 the raw for each crop was calculated based on soil awc from the ssurgo soil map mostly 0 13 0 14 in the study area and the effective rooting depth of plants the final values of thresholds were determined based on the awc of each hru individually the effective rooting zone is where 80 of all roots are present and maximum water uptake occurs usda 1997 the model also uses irrigation efficiency as an input the on farm irrigation efficiency in several ebid farms has been estimated to be between 60 83 samani et al 2005 ahadi et al 2013 the higher efficiencies 70 83 are attributed to deficit irrigation and the high water demand of pecan the auto irrigation parameters were calibrated separately for each crop the water stress threshold for soil moisture deficit was calculated based on the soil and crop characteristics the amount of water application for each irrigation event irr max was set based on the irrigation application rates commonly found in the region e g about 4900 m3 or 4 acre feet for mature pecan trees during the irrigation season 2 3 climate based future water scarcity to investigate the efficiency of the selected water and land management practices under plausible future water scarcity conditions mrg surface water availability was simulated using a 21st century scenario for projected san marcial inflows developed by townsend and gutzler 2022 this scenario based on a cmip5 climate model projection access1 0 driven by the high emissions rcp8 5 greenhouse gas pathway was transformed by the us bureau of reclamation into a rio grande streamflow projection by applying downscaled climate model output to the vic surface water model reclamation 2016 townsend and gutzler 2020 then took reclamation s annual flow projections for rio grande flow and statistically adjusted them to account for upstream water diversions by determining the fractional constant values required to force the simulated flows at san marcial to match first and second moments of the observed flow during a simulated historical epoch this procedure was carried out for 97 simulations in the reclamation archive the spread of these simulations in future decades is large although future declines in san marcial inflow occur in the majority of the projections the access1 0 rcp85 simulation chosen for this study is one of the driest simulations typically near the 25th percentile of the ensemble of projected flows in future decades townsend and gutzler 2020 this simulation was used for the present study to provide something close to a worst case scenario that would require very significant water use adjustment by downstream irrigators the access1 0 rcp85 inflow scenario has been used in previous assessments of 21st century eb reservoir management holmes et al 2022 and groundwater depletion samimi et al 2022 annual inflow at san marcial in this simulation delivers on average just about 2 3 of the historical average throughout the 21st century townsend and gutzler 2020 which prevents eb reservoir from ever reaching or even approaching full capacity holmes et al 2022 there is a modest long term downward trend in san marcial flow throughout the second half of the 21st century but no appreciable acceleration in declining flow is apparent samimi et al 2022 projected reservoir releases into the study watershed and developed a regression relation to characterize conjunctive use of reservoir release and groundwater projected groundwater withdrawals under warmer and drier conditions indicate a high likelihood that fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l in the mrg would be depleted in the second half of the 21st century samimi et al 2022 reducing the annual probability of fulfilling ebid s full river water allocation to below 20 2 4 intervention scenarios nineteen intervention scenarios were analyzed table 1 to sustain irrigated agriculture in general and high value pecan crops in particular to mimic the risk aversion behavior of pecan producers in the study area the interventions are based on i management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops ii changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought and salt tolerant crops and iii limitations of the swat model to perform the scenario simulations potential agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts were evaluated by comparing the corresponding changes in total water consumption at the watershed level and average annual water availability for major crops under each intervention scenario 2 4 1 deficit irrigation deficit irrigation is applied in water scarce regions around the world to increase water use efficiency with minimal loss in crop yield martin et al 1989 costa et al 2007 common ways to implement deficit irrigation include reducing the irrigation amount increasing the raw coefficient and reducing the number of irrigation events especially during growth stages when plants are less vulnerable to water stress i e regulated deficit irrigation or throughout the growing season i e unregulated deficit irrigation kirda 2002 onder et al 2009 payero et al 2009 bauder et al 2011 chai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 djaman et al 2020 regulated deficit irrigation requires knowledge of plant growth periods and the corresponding accumulated heat units it is most practical with center pivot trickle and drip irrigation systems where the timing and amount of irrigation can be controlled kirda 2002 costa et al 2007 seven deficit irrigation scenarios were simulated including five scenarios representing different levels of unregulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa corn and cotton and two scenarios of regulated deficit irrigation in which water application to alfalfa and cotton is stopped towards the end of the growing season table 1 the impact of water stress on different crop yields is varied alfalfa is a high water demand crop that is relatively adaptable to water stress because of its deep roots and the ability to go dormant during droughts bauder et al 2011 lindenmayer et al 2011 et and yield reduction of alfalfa in unregulated deficit irrigation is greater than partial season regulated deficit irrigation bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 smeal et al 1991 regulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa can be implemented by stopping irrigation after the first second or the third harvest bauder et al 2011 lindenmayer et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 cotton under unregulated deficit irrigation with lower levels of water stress i e reducing crop et by 15 30 has resulted in acceptable yield reductions considering water sustainability challenges and the rising cost of water in arid regions dağdelen et al 2009 singh et al 2010 regulated deficit irrigation of cotton during the initial and final stages of plant growth was reported as the most efficient himanshu et al 2019 the average annual simulated et of farms under deficit irrigation were compared with the average annual calibrated and validated et of the same farms during the historical period of 1994 2013 namely etbase to represent watershed scale crop water stress due to deficit irrigation on the farm scale water stress through deficit irrigation can be defined by the percentage of crop s et relative to potential et or pan evaporation onder et al 2009 payero et al 2009 bauder et al 2011 liu et al 2017 on the watershed scale many farms already experience some levels of deficit irrigation due to water shortages in this desert environment water stress was defined by increasing the soil water deficit threshold or reducing irrigation water in swat s auto irrigation function it was assumed that changes in watershed scale et represent the water stress level in deficit irrigation for example in one scenario alfalfa 65 of etbase alfalfa farms are irrigated such that their average annual et reaches 65 of the average annual historical et of alfalfa farms in the study area i e etbase of alfalfa 2 4 2 modifying crop pattern using current crops six scenarios were simulated to investigate the impact of crop pattern changes on irrigation water consumption based on general agronomic practices in the region four scenarios examine the effects of water conservation associated with taking all or part of the less valuable crops e g alfalfa cotton and corn out of production table 1 producers reduce alfalfa and cotton acreage or stop their cultivation altogether ganjegunte and clark 2017 depending on surface water availability while they rely on fresh groundwater to sustain pecans the most vulnerable perennial crop corn pepper and vegetables had the maximum acreage decline 30 56 during the 2003 2004 period compared to the acreage in the previous year 2002 2003 the largest single year acreage decline in major crops in the study area was recorded for alfalfa in 2011 during an exceptional drought d4 intensity based on us drought monitor which was 56 less than 2010 alfalfa acreage the decline in cotton fields during the same year was about 26 less than 2010 cotton acreage similarly corn pecan alfalfa and vegetables reached their minimum cultivation area in 2011 a scenario was defined to investigate the current increasing trend of pecan acreage i e 4 relative to 2012 2013 with a corresponding reduction in the acreage of other crops based on the fixed water allocation of the ebid a combination of the water demand of young to mature trees was used for the new orchards in the simulation 2022 2099 further an extreme pecan only scenario was considered to reflect the risk aversion behavior of the producers to save pecan trees during severe droughts table 1 2 4 3 alternative crops pistachio and pomegranate were considered as alternative crops it was assumed that instead of expanding pecan orchards irrigated lands are replaced with new pomegranate or pistachio orchards for example cotton fields 10 of ebid are changed to flood irrigated pistachio and pomegranate orchards by 2030 in recent years some new mexico farmers have expressed interest in growing pistachio and pomegranate as potential alternatives to pecan wang et al 2015 carreon 2019 thus in an extreme scenario pistachio and pomegranate trees could replace pecan orchards in 2050 table 1 pistachio is relatively resistant to salinity e g tds up to 4000 mg l and water stress needs about 610 1180 mm of water annually compared to pecan water demand of up to 1400 mm year e g miyamoto 1983 it has been cultivated in the u s as a commercial crop since 1929 herrera 1997 goldhamer and beede 2004 geisseler and horwath 2016 the tree starts to bear fruit after 5 10 years while the full fruit production takes up to 15 years despite being a drought adaptive crop enough soil moisture during late winter spring and early summer is required to produce a quality crop for commercial purposes with maximum water demand from june to august herrera 1997 goldhamer et al 1985 doster et al 2001 deficit irrigation at certain stages of crop growth may have minimal impact on pistachio yield goldhamer and beede 2004 pomegranate is gaining attention as a competitive commodity crop due to its growing use in the food and medicine industries çam et al 2009 lansky and newman 2007 carreon 2019 the water use in surface or flood irrigation of pomegranate is 1250 1500 mm year glozer and ferguson 2008 and in subsurface and surface drip irrigation is 53 953 mm year based on the tree age and irrigation method wang et al 2015 aseri et al 2008 volschenk 2020 it takes 3 5 years for a young pomegranate tree to become productive glozer and ferguson 2008 the salinity tolerance threshold of pomegranate is reported to be up to 2560 mg l 2 5 4 ds m of tds holland et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration and validation parameter values obtained by the sufi aided calibration are summarized in table 2 the model performed well both during calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 68 percent bias pbias 1 5 and r squared 0 86 and validation nse 0 70 pbias 7 0 and r squared 0 84 although some peak flows e g 2003 and 2004 and low flows during validation are overestimated fig 3 the annual average groundwater recharge was simulated at 25 mm which is close to the results of other modeling applications in the study e g ahn et al 2018 calibration of crop et and irrigation values improved model performance to assess water availability at the watershed scale the initial auto irrigation settings based on the field raw resulted in lower average annual irrigation amounts than expected based on the literature for crops especially pecan and alfalfa e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 sammis et al 2004 samani et al 2009 2011 2013 in reality some farms are over irrigated to leach out the salt or because most farmers do not schedule irrigation based on raw ganjegunte and clark 2017 calibrating the irrigation amounts by adjusting the auto irrigation parameters based on individual hru characteristics improved simulated streamflow at the completion of calibration some hrus remained over irrigated by the model while others were under irrigated based on water availability to each hru and subbasin at each time step in the swat model to ensure realistic irrigation water consumption at the watershed scale the average simulated irrigation et and yield of major crops were compared with available reported values table 3 the reported values are in ranges based on the different sources and years of reports e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 samani et al 2004 2009 2011 kannan et al 2011 usda 2018 the range of simulated values refers to the minimum and maximum values obtained among the hrus the model performance for crop irrigation and et was acceptable moriasi et al 2007 during calibration and validation while the model has limitations in simulating detailed spatial distribution of water among hrus the average amount of irrigation of each crop at the watershed scale is within the range of reported crop irrigation in the region the range of simulated crop irrigation and et in swat for major crops especially for pecan is comparable with the range of reported irrigation values table 3 the model underestimates the average annual irrigation simulated for corn which comprises 1 2 of the ebid the irrigation and et of onion matches the reported values in the literature kannan et al 2011 although the calibration approach focused on the hydrologic aspects rather than agronomic processes the ranges of simulated yields are reasonable compared with reported crop yields except for onion yield and to a lesser extent corn table 3 pecan and alfalfa are the most water demanding crops in the basin covering about 74 of the ebid cultivated area so the accuracy of simulated water consumption by these crops can largely influence the regional water budget calculations for this reason the irrigation and et for these crops were calibrated with a higher precision on a monthly basis table 4 presents results of the comparison of four years of measured irrigation data from a flood irrigated pecan orchard sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 with historical maximum and average irrigation of pecan simulated by swat it is noteworthy that the trees in the experimental orchards did not experience any water stress throughout the experiment due to groundwater supply from two wells sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 although irrigation data from a single well watered farm are not necessarily representative of the pecan irrigation practices across the study area the closeness of the simulated and measured pecan irrigation amounts increases the confidence in the model simulation performance the higher measured irrigation data in 2003 a severely dry year samimi et al 2022 indicates increased groundwater withdrawal and possibly additional irrigation in the experimental orchards to avoid adverse drought impacts the hru level irrigation amount and the resulting et vary across the watershed the semi distributed nature of the swat model and the limited irrigation schedule for each farm complicates capturing the spatial distribution of water across various farms ebid farms do not receive similar amounts of water some farms apply deficit irrigation forced by limited available surface water and groundwater expectedly as shown in fig 4 average monthly swat simulated et is consistently lower than measured et at a well irrigated farm that experiences no water stress e g sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 samani et al 2013 the maximum simulated et values for pecan and alfalfa for an hru that receives sufficient water are comparable with the measured et values at well watered experimental farms fig 4 indicating that the model is performing well in terms of representing watershed scale irrigation and crop et for regional water budget assessments overall the disproportionate irrigation of hrus by swat model is reasonable due to unequal irrigation of farms 3 2 assessment of intervention scenarios the long term tradeoffs of technologically possible land and water management interventions were analyzed to adapt irrigated agriculture in order to continue producing high value perennial crops in the face of growing water scarcity in a warm dry future table 5 summarizes the results of total water consumption and average annual irrigation water availability compared with the projected status quo for six example scenarios the results for all the nineteen intervention scenarios are reported in table s1 in supplementary material both regulated i e early termination of irrigation and unregulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa resulted in increased water availability for pecan moderate to severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa farms reduced the total water consumption of the farmlands across the watershed based on average annual et more than other interventions combining the severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa and mild deficit irrigation of cotton e g alfalfa 50 of etbase and cotton 85 of etbase slightly improved the water conservation potential compared to the severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa farms alone table s1 under this scenario the amount of water available to irrigate pecan orchards could be increased by about 19 table s1 moderate deficit irrigation of alfalfa i e curtailing the irrigation of this crop to lower alfalfa et to 65 of its etbase increased pecan water availability by 14 the deficit irrigation of other crops alone does not produce the same level of water saving because of lower area and water demand for example reducing the irrigation to lower the consumptive use of water in cotton fields by 50 resulted in only about a 2 increase in pecan water availability table 5 as expected regulated deficit irrigation of cotton had less impact on pecan water availability compared to the unregulated deficit irrigation with high water stress of up to 50 of etbase for cotton removal of alfalfa from the crop mix had a much larger effect on increasing pecan water availability than removing cotton in an extreme case removing alfalfa farms in 2050 increased pecan water availability up to 27 under this scenario corn and cotton also received about 11 and 35 more water than the projected status quo while watershed outflow increased by 16 overall however even the aggressive scenario of completely removing alfalfa from the crop mix after 2050 will not provide sufficient water to maintain the et level for pecan orchards which might result in crop loss during major prolonged droughts fig 5 growing pistachio and pomegranate instead of cotton about 9 of ebid farmlands after 2050 resulted in a small to moderate reduction up to 12 of irrigation water availability for other crops because the water requirements of these alternative crops are comparable to pecan replacing current pecan orchards with pistachio or pomegranate trees after 2050 would increase alfalfa water availability by about 10 and the watershed outflow up to 2 the water availability changes for other crops are insignificant while the annual irrigation water consumed across the watershed would be about 5 14 less than the projected status quo replacing all pecan orchards with pistachio or pomegranate after 2022 would not change the results significantly compared to replacing the trees after 2050 this can be explained by the small difference between the water demands of pecan and pistachio and pomegranate trees under status quo irrigation management in a warmer and drier future 2022 2099 characterized by falling reliability of full water allocation from eb reservoir due to dwindling river water and risk of fresh groundwater depletion samimi et al 2022 the current level of pecan production would require significant loss of other crops besides the extreme scenarios of removing all alfalfa farms by 2050 and only pecan grown after 2050 which led to minimal water stress for pecan orchards other scenarios result in pecan irrigation demand being met about 30 of the time see fig s1 in supplementary material given the risk of fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l depletion in the region in the coming decades samimi et al 2022 only the extreme scenarios would save adequate water to maintain the current acreage of pecan orchards fig 6 however pecan orchards are expected to remain vulnerable to significant water stress during severe prolonged droughts e g 2070 2079 even under the extreme intervention scenarios decreasing the acreage of pecan orchards is not economically viable without some sort of compensation to growers due to the significant loss of pecan trees that are usually productive for several decades it will also be challenging to expand the acreage of pecan orchards in the face of dwindling agricultural water supply and increasing salinity due to growing likelihood of fresh groundwater depletion even a slight increase in the acreage of pecan i e a 4 increase in 2020 results in significant water shortage for other crops pecan production is negatively affected by water stress and salinity miyamoto et al 1995 miyamoto 2007 using more irrigation water to leach out salt from the root zone diluting the saline water with available fresh water switching to drip irrigation on farm desalinization units and growing more salt tolerant crops are example strategies to deal with the impacts of salinity deficit irrigation and reducing the acreage of water intensive crops like alfalfa allow modest water savings in the study area but not enough to drastically change the vulnerability of pecan farms to future severe droughts however reducing the acreage or removing other crops is also challenging due to a strong sense of ownership of water hargrove and heyman 2020 alternative crops such as pistachio and pomegranate might not generate significant water savings especially in surface irrigation but they offer a potential strategy to improve the resiliency of the agricultural sector in this region along with using deficit irrigation drip irrigation or irrigation with marginal quality water the time required for the new alternative crops to reach commercial fruiting should be considered in the planning of this adaptation strategy the effectiveness of deficit irrigation depends on climate water retention potential of the soil and plant physiology and mechanisms to cope with water stress aydinsakir et al 2013 witt et al 2020 although some studies have reported that deficit irrigation may decrease crop productivity to some extent bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 other studies have shown increased crop quality or improvements in the yield under deficit drip irrigation such as increased boll weights and opened boll numbers in cotton onder et al 2009 liu et al 2017 regulated deficit irrigation of crops like alfalfa could have less negative impact on their yield bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 smeal et al 1991 in some cases the yield reduction associated with deficit irrigation was negligible costa et al 2007 in areas facing growing water scarcity and rising economic value of water the increase in water use efficiency may justify the yield reduction the yield reduction and optimum time for deficit irrigation in arid and semi arid regions depend on many factors that vary from year to year payero et al 2009 deficit drip irrigation of cotton during the initial and final stages of growth were most efficient in the southern high plains with 350 450 mm rainfall himanshu et al 2019 moderate water stress without decreasing irrigation events had minimum yield loss in cotton in the arid climate of central asia pereira et al 2009 mixing deficit irrigation with other measures like mulching to manage soil water might be more effective pereira et al 2009 there is a dearth of literature on deficit irrigation of pecan orchards although it is generally known that pecan is highly sensitive to water stress miyamoto et al 1995 miyamoto and storey 1995 3 3 limitations of the modeling approach the results should be interpreted in light of the spatial scale of the analyses and limited data despite extensive calibration of the model to realistically simulate irrigation alongside streamflow et and groundwater recharge the results from the watershed scale model are not directly generalizable to field scale this is because of the model s semi distributed nature which hinders explicit simulation of the spatial variability of water availability on the farm with varying crop types and soil characteristics swat distributes the saved water under different irrigation interventions among all other crops for example despite the decrease in cotton irrigation by deficit irrigation the available water for pecan and alfalfa did not change significantly as the model distributed the conserved water across all other cultivated areas fig s2 in reality farmers can leverage the conserved water to prioritize the irrigation of higher value crops in addition to the irrigation of other crops by the conserved water a portion of the saved water leaves the watershed as outflow table 5 although this may be considered as a desirable outcome from the standpoint of surface water availability for downstream users this could also be an artifact of using the auto irrigation function of swat the largest outflow belonged to scenarios of deficit irrigation of alfalfa while other crops in some farms remained under irrigated likely due to differences in soil types crops and soil moisture variation in the farms which affects auto irrigation timing farm level analyses of water saving potential and likely impacts on crop yield require detailed field scale measurements and modeling to reduce uncertainties in model setup and parametrization drip irrigation of the alternative crop orchards or existing crops could create additional water conservation opportunities but this scenario could not be explicitly simulated due to the limitation of the current swat model 3 4 need for holistic analysis of policy implications this study focused on the water budget implications of the analyzed interventions as a first step toward a more holistic analysis of the broad important policy implications of leveraging agricultural water conservation and cropping change to adapt to a warmer and drier future in the mrg effective planning and implementation of the discussed interventions would facilitate additional evaluation of the interventions considering the required infrastructure crop yield loss gain finding establishing markets for alternative crops and social and environmental considerations compared to business as usual it is expected that the modeled interventions result in reductions in net profitability for growers to varying degrees and they will not be implemented voluntarily without policy interventions that would somehow compensate growers through financial incentives or catalyze change through disincentives to this end there is a critical need to better understand what would each intervention scenario cost to implement what is the cost benefit ratio of each scenario and what are the opportunities and hurdles to develop the infrastructure and markets for new crops if irrigated agriculture is to be sustained viable policy interventions are necessary to preempt the end of agriculture in the region due to depletion of fresh groundwater and loss of economic competitiveness 4 conclusions nineteen land and water management interventions were investigated to evaluate potential watershed scale agricultural water savings to sustain high value crop production and associated tradeoffs in the middle section of the rio grande basin in a warm dry future the intervention scenarios were developed focusing on deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops or introducing new alternative crops taking into account the limitations of the swat model to perform scenario simulations results demonstrate that maintaining the current crop mix with status quo irrigation management will be challenging due to declining river water availability and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century the water conservation potential of existing cropping and irrigation interventions will be limited in a warm dry future extreme interventions such as aggressive deficit irrigation or stopping the cultivation of alfalfa generate moderate water savings for perennial pecan crops it is timely to prepare for scenarios of reduced freshwater availability and intensive prolonged droughts some examples of potential technologies that hold promise include desalination of brackish groundwater for irrigation developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use and transitioning to high value crops that are relatively drought and salt tolerant to increase the resiliency of irrigated agriculture detailed study of crop growth stages and yield reduction due to water stress is necessary for planning more sustainable deficit irrigation with minimal loss of crop yield and the introduction of alternative high value crops there is also a need for more holistic analysis of the policy implications of more

miyamoto and storey 1995 miyamoto 2007 adaptive agricultural water management approaches like irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation and land use management do not require major changes in infrastructure and are already practiced to some extent by farmers in the region skaggs and samani 2005 in recent severe droughts e g 2003 2004 and 2011 2012 producers have typically decreased the acreage of other crops especially alfalfa and cotton or stopped growing them altogether to save water for pecan orchards other methods such as drip irrigation would create a heavier economic burden on farmers due to fundamental changes in irrigation infrastructure along with a variety of challenges to irrigation districts likewise substituting vulnerable high value commodity crops with climate compatible drought tolerant crops has been applied as an adaptation strategy in arid regions herrera 1997 wang et al 2015 the objectives of the paper are two fold 1 simulate a series of agricultural interventions using a calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat watershed hydrology model and 2 evaluate the water conservation potential of each scenario as well as opportunities for agricultural water savings using a combination of the analyzed interventions water conservation potential is defined in this study as the percentage of reduction in watershed scale irrigation water applied by the model under different intervention scenarios the implications of the modeled interventions e g deficit irrigation changing current cropping pattern and growing alternative high value crops for sustaining agricultural production in the mrg within the constraints of projected decreases in water supply are discussed the results inform model based evaluation of agricultural water

methods 2 1 study area the study area watershed area 6000 km2 agricultural area 400 km2 located in the new mexico texas portion of the rio grande basin fig 1 is arid semi arid with an average annual precipitation of approximately 270 mm less than one third of global average the rio grande streamflow is regulated at the elephant butte eb and caballo reservoirs the eb reservoir capacity 2 5 billion cubic meters bcm is the principal surface water storage in the region caballo reservoir capacity 424 million cubic meters mcm located 40 kilometers downstream of the eb dam regulates the releases from the eb reservoir two usgs gauging stations usgs 08358300 rio grande conveyance channel at san marcial and usgs 08358400 rio grande floodway at san marcial measure inflow to the eb reservoir usgs gauges 08361000 rio grande below eb and 08362500 rio grande below caballo record the reservoirs releases the usgs gauge 08364000 rio grande at el paso measures the outflow from the watershed fig 1 the main irrigated agricultural activities in this portion of the rio grande occur within elephant butte irrigation district ebid which extends from downstream of the caballo reservoir to the el paso gauge surface water availability for agriculture depends on upstream reservoir releases and storage in eb reservoir is derived almost entirely from rio grande inflow as measured at san marcial holmes et al 2022 to compensate for surface water shortages during the irrigation season farmers pump groundwater from the mesilla bolson aquifer one of the main aquifers in the region sheng 2013 as a result the groundwater resources are declining due to increasing withdrawal sheng 2013 fuchs et al 2018 in normal years caballo reservoir releases water from march to september to meet the irrigation water demands in the ebid three diversion dams percha leasburg and mesilla and five main canals distribute water among irrigated farms historical changes in crop patterns reflect adjustments based on water availability fig 2 traditional flood irrigation basin irrigation is commonly practiced in the ebid leading to significant non beneficial consumptive use via surface evaporation and because irrigation schedules typically do not account for crop water demand at different growth stages skaggs and samani 2005 samani and skaggs 2008 while some fields within the irrigation district over irrigate others fail to meet their water requirements skaggs and samani 2005 as freshwater availability declines there is mounting concern about increasing salinity in groundwater and river water salinity monitoring from 2014 to 2016 indicated freshwater tds 1000 mg l flow in the river channel during the reservoir release period and fresh to slightly saline groundwater with tds values ranging 300 2000 mg l in sampled wells along the main stem of the river ma et al 2019 overdraft of fresh groundwater is expected to cause intrusion or upwelling of brackish water deteriorating the quality of water in the aquifer ashworth and hopkins 1995 sheng 2013 as such agricultural producers are concerned about the prospect of reduced fresh water availability especially the sustainability of irrigated pecan production hargrove and heyman 2020 water stress can impact the quality of nuts affect plant growth and in the long run kill the pecan tree saline water with tds more than 700 1000 mg l impacts the growth of pecan trees and shrinks the size of leaves and nuts growth decline starts at ec of 2 5 3 0 ds m in the soil saturation extract while tree die back starts at higher ec 6 8 ds m miyamoto 2007 2 2 watershed modeling accounting for irrigation soil and water assessment tool swat was used to model the mrg basin including heavily irrigated croplands swat is a semi distributed model that simulates watershed hydrology using a water balance approach arnold et al 1998 the model has been widely applied in arid semi arid areas with irrigated agriculture to simulate the impacts of changes in climate and agricultural management samimi et al 2020 the usgs 10 m 10 m dem digital elevation model usgs nd 2008 cropland data layer ssurgo soil map usda nd and precipitation and temperature data from noaa stations were used as input data the usda 2008 cropland data for the study area was assumed to represent average cropping conditions in the region since it was a near normal year with the standardized precipitation index spi of 0 9 samimi et al 2022 the watershed was first divided into hydrological response units hru based on similar land use land cover type soil characteristics and slope in each subbasin the water balance in each hru was subsequently calculated based on weather data management practices irrigation fertilization harvest etc and plant growth information swat s built in databases provide weather data land use and plant growth neitsch et al 2011 the upstream reservoir releases are introduced to the model with an inlet inflow which marks the upstream boundary of the watershed swat model was calibrated and validated for different water budget components described below as well as irrigation amounts the model was first calibrated and validated for monthly observed river flow at the watershed outlet using the sufi2 algorithm in swat cup abbaspour 2015 and then it was manually calibrated with the available data for average annual irrigation and et as well as groundwater recharge in each step the main components streamflow crop et groundwater recharge and applied irrigation were cross compared to find a realistic calibrated parameter set for the heavily managed watershed table 2 the calibration period 1995 2004 covers both high and low flows in the historical period preceded by two years of warm up 1993 1995 to initialize the model the model s performance was evaluated for the period of 2005 2013 due to limited irrigation data range of values were used based on measurements reported in the literature to evaluate the model performance with respect to irrigation e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 samani et al 2005 2009 2011 2013 swat s auto irrigation function was used to simulate the irrigation timing and amount based on default or user defined parameter values because detailed information about the irrigation schedules of each farm were unavailable for manual irrigation simulation the start of irrigation season is defined on a specific day and month or based on the amount of crop heat units the model assumes irrigation continues until soil water content reaches the field capacity neitsch et al 2011 irrigation events are triggered based on plant water demand fraction of decline in plant growth due to water stress or soil water content soil water deficit in mm the specific date and soil water content threshold was selected for auto irrigation of each crop based on agricultural practices in the region the soil water deficit threshold mm for auto irrigation was defined based on total available water content awc fraction for plant uptake in the soil calculated as the difference between the field capacity fraction and wilting point fraction which depends on the soil type the readily available water raw fraction in the soil is the portion of the awc that can be easily used by plants without any water stress raw varies between 0 3 and 0 7 of awc smaller raw values are typically used for dry and hot climates and more stress sensitive crops allen et al 1998 raw has been estimated to be 0 45 0 50 for pecan 0 65 for cotton 0 55 for oat and alfalfa and 0 30 for onion and vegetables allen et al 1998 kallestad et al 2008 the raw for each crop was calculated based on soil awc from the ssurgo soil map mostly 0 13 0 14 in the study area and the effective rooting depth of plants the final values of thresholds were determined based on the awc of each hru individually the effective rooting zone is where 80 of all roots are present and maximum water uptake occurs usda 1997 the model also uses irrigation efficiency as an input the on farm irrigation efficiency in several ebid farms has been estimated to be between 60 83 samani et al 2005 ahadi et al 2013 the higher efficiencies 70 83 are attributed to deficit irrigation and the high water demand of pecan the auto irrigation parameters were calibrated separately for each crop the water stress threshold for soil moisture deficit was calculated based on the soil and crop characteristics the amount of water application for each irrigation event irr max was set based on the irrigation application rates commonly found in the region e g about 4900 m3 or 4 acre feet for mature pecan trees during the irrigation season 2 3 climate based future water scarcity to investigate the efficiency of the selected water and land management practices under plausible future water scarcity conditions mrg surface water availability was simulated using a 21st century scenario for projected san marcial inflows developed by townsend and gutzler 2022 this scenario based on a cmip5 climate model projection access1 0 driven by the high emissions rcp8 5 greenhouse gas pathway was transformed by the us bureau of reclamation into a rio grande streamflow projection by applying downscaled climate model output to the vic surface water model reclamation 2016 townsend and gutzler 2020 then took reclamation s annual flow projections for rio grande flow and statistically adjusted them to account for upstream water diversions by determining the fractional constant values required to force the simulated flows at san marcial to match first and second moments of the observed flow during a simulated historical epoch this procedure was carried out for 97 simulations in the reclamation archive the spread of these simulations in future decades is large although future declines in san marcial inflow occur in the majority of the projections the access1 0 rcp85 simulation chosen for this study is one of the driest simulations typically near the 25th percentile of the ensemble of projected flows in future decades townsend and gutzler 2020 this simulation was used for the present study to provide something close to a worst case scenario that would require very significant water use adjustment by downstream irrigators the access1 0 rcp85 inflow scenario has been used in previous assessments of 21st century eb reservoir management holmes et al 2022 and groundwater depletion samimi et al 2022 annual inflow at san marcial in this simulation delivers on average just about 2 3 of the historical average throughout the 21st century townsend and gutzler 2020 which prevents eb reservoir from ever reaching or even approaching full capacity holmes et al 2022 there is a modest long term downward trend in san marcial flow throughout the second half of the 21st century but no appreciable acceleration in declining flow is apparent samimi et al 2022 projected reservoir releases into the study watershed and developed a regression relation to characterize conjunctive use of reservoir release and groundwater projected groundwater withdrawals under warmer and drier conditions indicate a high likelihood that fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l in the mrg would be depleted in the second half of the 21st century samimi et al 2022 reducing the annual probability of fulfilling ebid s full river water allocation to below 20 2 4 intervention scenarios nineteen intervention scenarios were analyzed table 1 to sustain irrigated agriculture in general and high value pecan crops in particular to mimic the risk aversion behavior of pecan producers in the study area the interventions are based on i management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops ii changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought and salt tolerant crops and iii limitations of the swat model to perform the scenario simulations potential agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts were evaluated by comparing the corresponding changes in total water consumption at the watershed level and average annual water availability for major crops under each intervention scenario 2 4 1 deficit irrigation deficit irrigation is applied in water scarce regions around the world to increase water use efficiency with minimal loss in crop yield martin et al 1989 costa et al 2007 common ways to implement deficit irrigation include reducing the irrigation amount increasing the raw coefficient and reducing the number of irrigation events especially during growth stages when plants are less vulnerable to water stress i e regulated deficit irrigation or throughout the growing season i e unregulated deficit irrigation kirda 2002 onder et al 2009 payero et al 2009 bauder et al 2011 chai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 djaman et al 2020 regulated deficit irrigation requires knowledge of plant growth periods and the corresponding accumulated heat units it is most practical with center pivot trickle and drip irrigation systems where the timing and amount of irrigation can be controlled kirda 2002 costa et al 2007 seven deficit irrigation scenarios were simulated including five scenarios representing different levels of unregulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa corn and cotton and two scenarios of regulated deficit irrigation in which water application to alfalfa and cotton is stopped towards the end of the growing season table 1 the impact of water stress on different crop yields is varied alfalfa is a high water demand crop that is relatively adaptable to water stress because of its deep roots and the ability to go dormant during droughts bauder et al 2011 lindenmayer et al 2011 et and yield reduction of alfalfa in unregulated deficit irrigation is greater than partial season regulated deficit irrigation bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 smeal et al 1991 regulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa can be implemented by stopping irrigation after the first second or the third harvest bauder et al 2011 lindenmayer et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 cotton under unregulated deficit irrigation with lower levels of water stress i e reducing crop et by 15 30 has resulted in acceptable yield reductions considering water sustainability challenges and the rising cost of water in arid regions dağdelen et al 2009 singh et al 2010 regulated deficit irrigation of cotton during the initial and final stages of plant growth was reported as the most efficient himanshu et al 2019 the average annual simulated et of farms under deficit irrigation were compared with the average annual calibrated and validated et of the same farms during the historical period of 1994 2013 namely etbase to represent watershed scale crop water stress due to deficit irrigation on the farm scale water stress through deficit irrigation can be defined by the percentage of crop s et relative to potential et or pan evaporation onder et al 2009 payero et al 2009 bauder et al 2011 liu et al 2017 on the watershed scale many farms already experience some levels of deficit irrigation due to water shortages in this desert environment water stress was defined by increasing the soil water deficit threshold or reducing irrigation water in swat s auto irrigation function it was assumed that changes in watershed scale et represent the water stress level in deficit irrigation for example in one scenario alfalfa 65 of etbase alfalfa farms are irrigated such that their average annual et reaches 65 of the average annual historical et of alfalfa farms in the study area i e etbase of alfalfa 2 4 2 modifying crop pattern using current crops six scenarios were simulated to investigate the impact of crop pattern changes on irrigation water consumption based on general agronomic practices in the region four scenarios examine the effects of water conservation associated with taking all or part of the less valuable crops e g alfalfa cotton and corn out of production table 1 producers reduce alfalfa and cotton acreage or stop their cultivation altogether ganjegunte and clark 2017 depending on surface water availability while they rely on fresh groundwater to sustain pecans the most vulnerable perennial crop corn pepper and vegetables had the maximum acreage decline 30 56 during the 2003 2004 period compared to the acreage in the previous year 2002 2003 the largest single year acreage decline in major crops in the study area was recorded for alfalfa in 2011 during an exceptional drought d4 intensity based on us drought monitor which was 56 less than 2010 alfalfa acreage the decline in cotton fields during the same year was about 26 less than 2010 cotton acreage similarly corn pecan alfalfa and vegetables reached their minimum cultivation area in 2011 a scenario was defined to investigate the current increasing trend of pecan acreage i e 4 relative to 2012 2013 with a corresponding reduction in the acreage of other crops based on the fixed water allocation of the ebid a combination of the water demand of young to mature trees was used for the new orchards in the simulation 2022 2099 further an extreme pecan only scenario was considered to reflect the risk aversion behavior of the producers to save pecan trees during severe droughts table 1 2 4 3 alternative crops pistachio and pomegranate were considered as alternative crops it was assumed that instead of expanding pecan orchards irrigated lands are replaced with new pomegranate or pistachio orchards for example cotton fields 10 of ebid are changed to flood irrigated pistachio and pomegranate orchards by 2030 in recent years some new mexico farmers have expressed interest in growing pistachio and pomegranate as potential alternatives to pecan wang et al 2015 carreon 2019 thus in an extreme scenario pistachio and pomegranate trees could replace pecan orchards in 2050 table 1 pistachio is relatively resistant to salinity e g tds up to 4000 mg l and water stress needs about 610 1180 mm of water annually compared to pecan water demand of up to 1400 mm year e g miyamoto 1983 it has been

takes up to 15 years despite being a drought adaptive crop enough soil moisture during late winter spring and early summer is required to produce a quality crop for commercial purposes with maximum water demand from june to august herrera 1997 goldhamer et al 1985 doster et al 2001 deficit irrigation at certain stages of crop growth may have minimal impact on pistachio yield goldhamer and beede 2004 pomegranate is gaining attention as a competitive commodity crop due to its growing use in the food and medicine industries çam et al 2009 lansky and newman 2007 carreon 2019 the water use in surface or flood irrigation of pomegranate is 1250 1500 mm year glozer and ferguson 2008 and in subsurface and surface drip irrigation is 53 953 mm year based on the tree age and irrigation method

in table 2 the model performed well both during calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 68 percent bias pbias 1 5 and r squared 0 86 and validation nse 0 70 pbias 7 0 and r squared 0 84 although some peak flows e g 2003 and 2004 and low flows during validation are overestimated fig 3 the annual average groundwater recharge was simulated at 25 mm which is close to the results of other modeling applications in the study e g ahn et al 2018 calibration of crop et and irrigation values improved model performance to assess water availability at the watershed scale the initial auto irrigation settings based on the field raw resulted in lower average annual irrigation amounts than expected based on the literature for crops especially pecan and alfalfa e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 sammis et al 2004 samani et al 2009 2011 2013 in reality some farms are over irrigated to leach out the salt or because most farmers do not schedule irrigation based on raw ganjegunte and clark 2017 calibrating the irrigation amounts by adjusting the auto irrigation parameters based on individual hru characteristics improved simulated streamflow at the completion of calibration some hrus remained over irrigated by the model while others were under irrigated based on water availability to each hru and subbasin at each time step in the swat model to ensure realistic irrigation water consumption at the watershed scale the average simulated irrigation et and yield of major crops were compared with available reported values table 3 the reported values are in ranges based on the different sources and years of reports e g abdul jabbar et al 1983 samani et al 2004 2009 2011 kannan et al 2011 usda 2018 the range of simulated values refers to the minimum and maximum values obtained among the hrus the model performance for crop irrigation and et was acceptable moriasi et al 2007 during calibration and validation while the model has limitations in simulating detailed spatial distribution of water among hrus the average amount of irrigation of each crop at the watershed scale is within the range of reported crop irrigation in the region the range of simulated crop irrigation and et in swat for major crops especially for pecan is comparable with the range of reported irrigation values table 3 the model underestimates the average annual irrigation simulated for corn which comprises 1 2 of the ebid the irrigation and et of onion matches the reported values in the literature kannan et al 2011 although the calibration approach focused on the hydrologic aspects rather than agronomic processes the ranges of simulated yields are reasonable compared with reported crop yields except for onion yield and to a lesser extent corn table 3 pecan and alfalfa are the most water demanding crops in the basin covering about 74 of the ebid cultivated area so the accuracy of simulated water consumption by these crops can largely influence the regional water budget calculations for this reason the irrigation and et for these crops were calibrated with a higher precision on a monthly basis table 4 presents results of the comparison of four years of measured irrigation data from a flood irrigated pecan orchard sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 with historical maximum and average irrigation of pecan simulated by swat it is noteworthy that the trees in the experimental orchards did not experience any water stress throughout the experiment due to groundwater supply from two wells sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 although irrigation data from a single well watered farm are not necessarily representative of the pecan irrigation practices across the study area the closeness of the simulated and measured pecan irrigation amounts increases the confidence in the model simulation performance the higher measured irrigation data in 2003 a severely dry year samimi et al 2022 indicates increased groundwater withdrawal and possibly additional irrigation in the experimental orchards to avoid adverse drought impacts the hru level irrigation amount and the resulting et vary across the watershed the semi distributed nature of the swat model and the limited irrigation schedule for each farm complicates capturing the spatial distribution of water across various farms ebid farms do not receive similar amounts of water some farms apply deficit irrigation forced by limited available surface water and groundwater expectedly as shown in fig 4 average monthly swat simulated et is consistently lower than measured et at a well irrigated farm that experiences no water stress e g sammis et al 2004 wang et al 2007 samani et al 2013 the maximum simulated et values for pecan and alfalfa for an hru that receives sufficient water are comparable with the measured et values at well watered experimental farms fig 4 indicating that the model is performing well in terms of representing watershed scale irrigation and crop et for regional water budget assessments overall the disproportionate irrigation of hrus by swat model is reasonable due to unequal irrigation of farms 3 2 assessment of intervention scenarios the long term tradeoffs of technologically possible land and water management interventions were analyzed to adapt irrigated agriculture in order to continue producing high value perennial crops in the face of growing water scarcity in a warm dry future table 5 summarizes the results of total water consumption and average annual irrigation water availability compared with the projected status quo for six example scenarios the results for all the nineteen intervention scenarios are reported in table s1 in supplementary material both regulated i e early termination of irrigation and unregulated deficit irrigation of alfalfa resulted in increased water availability for pecan moderate to severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa farms reduced the total water consumption of the farmlands across the watershed based on average annual et more than other interventions combining the severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa and mild deficit irrigation of cotton e g alfalfa 50 of etbase and cotton 85 of etbase slightly improved the water conservation potential compared to the severe deficit irrigation of alfalfa farms alone table s1 under this scenario the amount of water available to irrigate pecan orchards could be increased by about 19 table s1 moderate deficit irrigation of alfalfa i e curtailing the irrigation of this crop to lower alfalfa et to 65 of its etbase increased pecan water availability by 14 the deficit irrigation of other crops alone does not produce the same level of water saving because of lower area and water demand for example reducing the irrigation to lower the consumptive use of water in cotton fields by 50 resulted in only about a 2 increase in pecan water availability table 5 as expected regulated deficit irrigation of cotton had less impact on pecan water availability compared to the unregulated deficit irrigation with high water stress of up to 50 of etbase for cotton removal of alfalfa from the crop mix had a much larger effect on increasing pecan water availability than removing cotton in an extreme case removing alfalfa farms in 2050 increased pecan water availability up to 27 under this scenario corn and cotton also received about 11 and 35 more water than the projected status quo while watershed outflow increased by 16 overall however even the aggressive scenario of completely removing alfalfa from the crop mix after 2050 will not provide sufficient water to maintain the et level for pecan orchards which might result in crop loss during major prolonged droughts fig 5 growing pistachio and pomegranate instead of cotton about 9 of ebid farmlands after 2050 resulted in a small to moderate reduction up to 12 of irrigation water availability for other crops because the water requirements of these alternative crops are comparable to pecan replacing current pecan orchards with pistachio or pomegranate trees after 2050 would increase alfalfa water availability by about 10 and the watershed outflow up to 2 the water availability changes for other crops are insignificant while the annual irrigation water consumed across the watershed would be about 5 14 less than the projected status quo replacing all pecan orchards with pistachio or pomegranate after 2022 would not change the results significantly compared to replacing the trees after 2050 this can be explained by the small difference between the water demands of pecan and pistachio and pomegranate trees under status quo irrigation management in a warmer and drier future 2022 2099 characterized by falling reliability of full water allocation from eb reservoir due to dwindling river water and risk of fresh groundwater depletion samimi et al 2022 the current level of pecan production would require significant loss of other crops besides the extreme scenarios of removing all alfalfa farms by 2050 and only pecan grown after 2050 which led to minimal water stress for pecan orchards other scenarios result in pecan irrigation demand being met about 30 of the time see fig s1 in supplementary material given the risk of fresh groundwater tds 1000 mg l depletion in the region in the coming decades samimi et al 2022 only the extreme scenarios would save adequate water to maintain the current acreage of pecan orchards fig 6 however pecan orchards are expected to remain vulnerable to significant water stress during severe prolonged droughts e g 2070 2079 even under the extreme intervention scenarios decreasing the acreage of pecan orchards is not economically viable without some sort of compensation to growers due to the significant loss of pecan trees that are usually productive for several decades it will also be challenging to expand the acreage of pecan orchards in the face of dwindling agricultural water supply and increasing salinity due to growing likelihood of fresh groundwater depletion even a slight increase in the acreage of pecan i e a 4 increase in 2020 results in significant water shortage for other crops pecan production is negatively affected by water stress and salinity miyamoto et al 1995 miyamoto 2007 using more irrigation water to leach out salt from the root zone diluting the saline water with available fresh water switching to drip irrigation on farm desalinization units and growing more salt tolerant crops are example strategies to deal with the impacts of salinity deficit irrigation and reducing the acreage of water intensive crops like alfalfa allow modest water savings in the study area but not enough to drastically change the vulnerability of pecan farms to future severe droughts however reducing the acreage or removing other crops is also challenging due to a strong sense of ownership of water hargrove and heyman 2020 alternative crops such as pistachio and pomegranate might not generate significant water savings especially in surface irrigation but they offer a potential strategy to improve the resiliency of the agricultural sector in this region along with using deficit irrigation drip irrigation or irrigation with marginal quality water the time required for the new alternative crops to reach commercial fruiting should be considered in the planning of this adaptation strategy the effectiveness of deficit irrigation depends on climate water retention potential of the soil and plant physiology and mechanisms to cope with water stress aydinsakir et al 2013 witt et al 2020 although some studies have reported that deficit irrigation may decrease crop productivity to some extent bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 other studies have shown increased crop quality or improvements in the yield under deficit drip irrigation such as increased boll weights and opened boll numbers in cotton onder et al 2009 liu et al 2017 regulated deficit irrigation of crops like alfalfa could have less negative impact on their yield bauder et al 2011 djaman et al 2020 smeal et al 1991 in some cases the yield reduction associated with deficit irrigation was negligible costa et al 2007 in areas facing growing water scarcity and rising economic value of water the increase in water use efficiency may justify the yield reduction the yield reduction and optimum time for deficit irrigation in arid and semi arid regions depend on many factors that vary from year to year payero et al 2009 deficit drip irrigation of cotton during the initial and final stages of growth were most efficient in the southern high plains with 350 450 mm rainfall himanshu et al 2019 moderate water stress without decreasing irrigation events had minimum yield loss in cotton in the arid climate of central asia pereira et al 2009 mixing deficit irrigation with other measures like mulching to manage soil water might be more effective pereira et al 2009 there is a dearth of literature on deficit irrigation of pecan orchards although it is generally known that pecan is highly sensitive to water stress miyamoto et al 1995 miyamoto and storey 1995 3 3 limitations of the modeling approach the results should be interpreted in light of the spatial scale of the analyses and limited data despite extensive calibration of the model to realistically simulate irrigation alongside streamflow et and groundwater recharge the results from the watershed scale model are not directly generalizable to field scale this is because of the model s semi distributed nature which hinders explicit simulation of the spatial variability of water availability on the farm with varying crop types and soil characteristics swat distributes the saved water under different irrigation interventions among all other crops for example despite the decrease in cotton irrigation by deficit irrigation the available water for pecan and alfalfa did not change significantly as the model distributed the conserved water across all other cultivated areas fig s2 in reality farmers can leverage the conserved water to prioritize the irrigation of higher value crops in addition to the irrigation of other crops by the conserved water a portion of the saved water leaves the watershed as outflow table 5 although this may be considered as a desirable outcome from the standpoint of surface water availability for downstream users this could also be an artifact of using the auto irrigation function of swat the largest outflow belonged to scenarios of deficit irrigation of alfalfa while other crops in some farms remained under irrigated likely due to differences in soil types crops and soil moisture variation in the farms which affects auto irrigation timing farm level analyses of water saving potential and likely impacts on crop yield require detailed field scale measurements and modeling to reduce uncertainties in model setup and parametrization drip irrigation of the alternative crop orchards or existing crops could create additional water conservation opportunities but this scenario could not be explicitly simulated due to the limitation of the current swat model 3 4 need for holistic analysis of policy implications this study focused on the water budget implications of the analyzed interventions as a first step toward a more holistic analysis of the broad important policy implications of leveraging agricultural water conservation and cropping change to adapt to a warmer and drier future in the mrg effective planning and implementation of the discussed interventions would facilitate additional evaluation of the interventions considering the required infrastructure crop yield loss gain finding establishing markets for alternative crops and social and environmental considerations compared to business as usual it is expected that the modeled interventions result in reductions in net profitability for growers to varying degrees and they will not be implemented voluntarily without policy interventions that would somehow compensate growers through financial incentives or catalyze change through disincentives to this end there is a critical need to better understand what would each intervention scenario cost to implement what is the cost benefit ratio of each scenario and what are the opportunities and hurdles to develop the infrastructure and markets for new crops if irrigated agriculture is to be sustained viable policy interventions are necessary to preempt the end of agriculture in the region due to depletion of fresh groundwater and loss of economic competitiveness 4 conclusions nineteen land and water management interventions were investigated to evaluate potential watershed scale agricultural water savings to sustain high value crop production and associated tradeoffs in the middle section of the rio grande basin in a warm dry future the intervention scenarios were developed focusing on deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops or introducing new alternative crops taking into account the limitations of the swat model to perform scenario simulations results demonstrate that maintaining the current crop mix with status quo irrigation management will be challenging due to declining river water availability and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century the water conservation potential of existing cropping and irrigation interventions will be limited in a warm dry future extreme interventions such as aggressive deficit irrigation or stopping the cultivation of alfalfa generate moderate water savings for perennial pecan crops it is timely to prepare for scenarios of reduced freshwater availability and intensive prolonged droughts some examples of potential technologies that hold promise include desalination of brackish groundwater for irrigation developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use and transitioning to high value crops that are relatively drought and salt tolerant to increase the resiliency of irrigated agriculture detailed study of crop growth stages and yield reduction due to water stress is necessary for planning more sustainable deficit irrigation with minimal loss of crop yield and the introduction of alternative high value crops there is also a need for more holistic analysis of the policy implications of more
