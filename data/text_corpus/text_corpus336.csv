1680,enhanced upward mobility of a non aqueous phase liquid napl present in wet sand during natural drying and in the absence of any external pressure gradients is reported for the first time this mobility was significantly higher than that expected from capillary rise experiments were performed in a glass column with a small layer of napl saturated sand trapped between two layers of water saturated sand drying of the wet sand was induced by flow of air across the top surface of the wet sand the upward movement of the napl in the direction of water transport commenced when the drying effect reached the location of the napl and continued as long as there was significant water evaporation in the vicinity of napl indicating a clear correlation between the napl rise and water evaporation the magnitude and the rate of napl rise was measured at different water evaporation rates different initial locations of the napl different grain size of the sand and the type of napl on the basis of different napl glass contact angle viscosity and density a positive correlation was observed between average rate of napl rise and the water evaporation while a negative correlation was obtained between the average napl rise rate and the napl properties of contact angle viscosity and density there was no significant correlation of average napl rise rate with variation of sand grain size between 0 1 to 0 5mm based on these observations and on previous studies reported in the literature two possible mechanisms are hypothesized a the effect of the spreading coefficient resulting in the wetting of napl on the water films created and b a moving water film due to evaporation that drags the napl upwards the napl rise reported in this paper has implications in fate and transport of chemicals in napl contaminated porous media such as soils and exposed dredged sediment material which are subjected to varying water saturation levels due to drying and rewetting keywords napl water evaporation enhanced napl rise porous media imaging capillary rise 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls are a class of organic chemicals present in contaminated sediments soils sludges and exposed dredged materials panagiotakis and dermatas 2015 usepa 1994 luthy et al 1994 ma et al 2010 feo et al 2011 ravikrishna et al 2001 the napl phase may be a single compound such as solvents or a mixture of components petroleum fractions such as petrol diesel or crude oil johnston et al 2007 hamed 2005 lang et al 2009 napl components belong to a wide range of chemical classification including saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs chlorinated hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic compounds which have relatively low solubility in water in addition to their presence in the environment as a separate non aqueous phase napls are also a potential source of contamination of ground and surface water and pore vapor via transport processes such as dissolution evaporation and diffusion vasudevan et al 2016 zhu and sykes 2000 abriola et al 2004 coulon et al 2010 the fate and transport of the napl phase in the porous medium has significant influence in determining the fate and transport of the individual components present in the napl as well as other contaminants that are present in the porous medium but are physically separated and not part of the napl phase petri et al 2015 these may be chemicals in the adsorbed phase on solids or in the pore vapor or pore water fate and transport of organic chemicals present in contaminated soils flury 1996 mcgechan and lewis 2002 brusseau and rao 1990 jury and fl√ºhler 1992 and exposed contaminated dredged sediment material stored in confined disposal facilities thibodeaux 1996 thibodeaux and mackay 2010 choy and reible 1999 valsaraj et al 1999 ravikrishna et al 2001 have been reported the fate and transport of the chemicals that are not associated with the napl phase in such systems could be significantly affected by changes in the properties and location of the napl phase hence realistic estimation of the position and transport of napl is necessary for better characterization of the fate and transport of individual chemical solutes in systems such as soil and exposed dredged materials for environmental risk assessment and for the design of effective environmental remediation methods the mobility of napls under a variety of natural and engineered conditions has been studied and reported the influence of groundwater flow on the transport of napls has been extensively studied fagerlund et al 2007 oostrom et al 2006 barth et al 2003 chevalier and petersen 1999 abriola and bradford 1998 illangasekare et al 1995 cary et al 1989 the components of the napl are subject to dissolution in water saturated soils bradford et al 2003 sauer and costa 2003 lekmine et al 2014 heyse et al 2002 and volatilization in unsaturated soils davis et al 2005 van meurs et al 2004 such dissolution or volatilization of components of the napl results in change of the properties of the residual napl phase weathering the mobilization of napl under an external force such as the application of vacuum or positive pressure has also been observed in the context of engineering interventions for remediation of contaminated soils these include air sparging and soil vapor extraction wang et al 1995 benson et al 1993 pasha et al 2014 freeze thaw cycling singh et al 2011 and engineered pressure gradients rathfelder et al 1995 yoon et al 2007 both soils and exposed dredged materials are similar in structure and are subject to varying water saturation levels as a result of drying due to evaporation of water and rewetting due to rain the presence of a napl phase in the pore spaces can potentially influence the fate and transport of any organic solute present in the pore air pore water or on the solid phase in the porous medium sorbed state luong 1996 reported the appearance of an oil sheen on the surface of the sediment while observing a significant reduction of the measured pah flux in laboratory experiments designed to study the release of pahs from napl contaminated sediments to surface water this observation suggested a possible mobilization of napl from within the bulk of the contaminated sediment to the surface and creating a significant diffusional barrier for the transport of pahs in previous work unsaturated soils contaminated with a pah phenanthrene and containing small amounts of napl motor oil were exposed to air flowing at the soil air interface to study the effect of the napl on the release of phenanthrene ravikrishna et al 2002 the moisture and the napl content in the system were low 8 w w and 4 w w respectively and consequently occupied very low volume fractions in the soil pore space which was predominantly occupied by air the presence of motor oil in the soil significantly decreased phenanthrene flux at the air soil interface as compared to the flux in an experiment where the soil did not contain any motor oil post experiment sectioning of the soil column however revealed no significant mobility of the motor oil suggesting that the reduction of phenanthrene flux could only be attributed to its sorption on the motor oil present in the soil based on these observations of napl and solute transport it is clear that the presence of napl affects the fate and transport of individual solutes in porous media by two possible mechanisms a enhancing the retardation through the sorption of chemicals resulting in a decrease in the solute concentration in the pore air or pore water and consequently reducing the diffusion flux and b by mobilization of the napl and causing the creation of a physical diffusion barrier within the pore spaces in previous studies described above where both the moisture and napl content were low in the porous medium no significant redistribution of napl was observed however the effect of drying of porous material with an initially high moisture and high napl content on the redistribution of napl is unknown this is relevant to the understanding of fate and transport of solutes in systems containing high moisture and high napl content such as wet soils and exposed dredged material that are subject to change in water saturation conditions due to evaporation in the current study the mobility of napl trapped in a water saturated sand column was studied under the conditions of evaporation of water laboratory experiments were conducted in a glass column where a layer of napl saturated sand was placed between two layers of water saturated sand and exposed to a flow of air at the sand air interface the napl mobility and water fluxes were measured as a function of time flow rate of air varying evaporation rates of water initial position of the napl property of the napl and grain size of sand 2 experimental methods 2 1 measurement of napl mobility and water flux 2 1 1 preparation of the sand column experiments to measure napl mobility and water flux were performed using a setup represented schematically in fig 1 the experimental system was a t shaped hollow tubular structure constructed from glass and consisted of a vertical section 110 mm tall and i d of 10 mm that intersected with a horizontal section 90 mm height from the bottom and i d of 10 mm the part of the vertical section above the intersection with the horizontal section was fitted with a ground glass joint that allowed the closure at the top of the vertical section using a glass stopper compressed ambient air was supplied to the horizontal section of the experimental setup through a hepa filter and a flow controller in a typical experiment a small layer of napl saturated sand was placed between two layers of water saturated sand as shown in fig 1 the top surface of the upper water saturated sand layer in the vertical sand column was flush with the bottom surface of the horizontal glass section to facilitate air flow across the surface of the sand the relative humidity and temperature of the inlet and outlet air were measured using thermohygrometers extech model no rh305 experiments were performed with three different grain sizes of porous material a white sand ws of grain size of 0 3 mm tamilnadu minerals limited b glass beads gb of size 0 1 mm and c glass beads of size 0 5 mm both glass beads from sigma aldrich the napl used in the study were a commercial motor oil mo servo futura plus indian oil corporation india b bunker oil bo from chennai petrochemical corporation limited cpcl and c light crude oil lco from indian oil corporation table 1 shows the relevant properties of these oils in order to visualize the napl movement the contrast of the napl with respect to sand and water was enhanced by the addition of a red oil soluble dye oil o red dye to the motor oil at a concentration of 500 ppm the dye in the napl did not stain water glass or sand in the experiment the dye was not added to the experiments with bunker oil and light crude oil since there was sufficient visual contrast of these napls with reference to the sand and water for a typical experimental run the sand column with the napl was prepared using the following procedure a small amount of water was added to the vertical section of the glass column and a small amount of pre washed sand was poured to create a small layer of water saturated sand to ensure that the sand was water saturated the amount of sand added was such that the level of water was always bit higher than the submerged sand the column was tapped to release any air bubbles in the system this procedure was repeated until the total height of the water saturated sand was that of the intended napl position at this point 0 2 g of the napl was added on top of the water saturated sand layer using a stainless steel syringe fitted with a long needle sand was then added to the napl to prepare the napl saturated sand layer that was 8 9 mm thick the second layer of water saturated sand on top of the napl saturated sand was prepared by successively adding small amounts of water and sand until the total height of the sand in the column reached 90 mm from the bottom the upper layer of water saturated sand was also tapped to release any trapped air bubbles this water saturated sand layer above the napl extended to 90 mm from the bottom the height where the horizontal section intersected the vertical section experiments were conducted with three different initial positions of the 8 9 mm thick napl saturated sand layer in the glass column in these three positions the lower end of the napl saturated sand layer was at three different positions 70 mm top 50 mm center and 10 mm bottom from the bottom of the sand column different control experiments were also conducted to observe the effect of other processes that may also cause napl rise in one set of control experiment there was no air flow in the experimental setup shown in fig 1 resulting in no water evaporation from the wet sand this was conducted to observe if any napl rise occurred due to buoyancy with reference to water in a different type of control experiment dry sand instead of water saturated sand was placed on top of the napl saturated sand layer in the glass column this was conducted to observe capillary rise of the napl in dry sand in the absence of water evaporation a third type of control experiment was conducted to observe water evaporation rate in the absence of any napl in the sand column all control experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 1 2 water flux measurements in a typical experimental run compressed ambient air filtered through a 3Œºm filter was sent through the experimental setup at a desired flow rate the relative humidity and temperature of the air exiting the compressor varied between 10 14 and 29 32 c respectively the relative humidity and the temperature of the inlet and outlet air were measured using two different thermo hygrometers extech which were calibrated before every experimental run using calibration salts 33 and 75 relative humidity flux of the evaporating water from the sand column n w was calculated using eq 1 1 n w œÅ w o u t œÅ w i n q a where œÅ w o u t and œÅ w i n were the mass concentrations of water vapor in the outlet and inlet air respectively q was the volumetric flow rate of air across the surface and a was the surface area for water evaporation which was the internal cross sectional area of the vertical section of the glass column the mass concentration œÅ w i n and œÅ w o u t were calculated from the inlet and outlet relative humidity measurements using ideal gas law according to eq 2 2 œÅ w i r h i p s a t t i m w r t i where rh i was the measured relative humidity where i was either the inlet or the outlet p sat the saturated vapor pressure of water at temperature t i was obtained using the antoine equation green and maloney 1997 at the temperature of the inlet or the outlet streams m w was the molecular mass of water and r was the universal gas constant experiments were performed using three different values of q 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min to induce three different water drying rates an experimental run was considered to start when air flow was introduced across the top surface of the sand column a list of the different experimental conditions and controls are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material 2 1 3 measurement of napl mobility the mobility of the napl was recorded visually by capturing the images of the glass experimental set up every 3min until the end of the experiment with a samsung galaxy s5 mobile phone camera resolution of 1920 1080pixels using an android application lapse it pro the images were processed to obtain the vertical extent of the napl movement as a function of time automation of the image processing routine was considered necessary since manual visual estimation of the spread of the napl was subject to errors based on individual perception of color in the automated method the raw images were cropped to the same dimension to include only the glass column with the sand and its contents since the napl soluble dye was red and the sand was white these were set as the two extreme colors in an image to obtain the vertical extent of napl movement the detection of the farthest red colored pixel from the initial napl location was required based on the total physical height of the glass column in each image and the pixel resolution of the image in the vertical direction it was determined that one pixel dimension in the image of the glass column corresponded to a physical height of 0 14 mm in the glass column the napl position was measured with reference to the top end of the napl saturated layer at the beginning of the experimental run image analysis was performed using matlab which provided an rgb map of all the pixels in the image using the in built function imread in the rgb format the red and white colors corresponded to rgb values of 255 0 0 and 255 255 255 respectively in this system where red and white were the only colors of interest it was possible that a particular pixel might contain a fraction of red and white and the true representation of this color would be somewhere in between the rgb values for pure red and pure white however since the objective was to estimate the extent of the napl migration the presence of any red pixel in the system was sufficient to obtain the napl position therefore all partially red pixels were converted to fully red pixels complimentary colors were then added to each pixel in the images to render the red channel values of non red pixels to zero the r red color value for a particular height was computed as the average of r values from the rgb values obtained from all pixels in a particular x y plane at that height since each pixel along the vertical direction corresponded approximately to a height of 0 14 mm of sand in the glass column the average r was thus estimated as a function of the physical height of sand in the column and provided the vertical spread of the napl the capability of automated imaging technique in identifying different shapes was tested using a variety of patterns of red and white using the matlab algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observations of napl mobility fig 2 a shows the mobility of motor oil under conditions of different evaporation rates induced by different flow rates of air at the surface with the initial position of the napl in the center 50 mm from the bottom of the column the first image in fig 2a shows the napl and the water saturated sand layers initially at time t 0 the other three images in fig 2a show the extent of the napl rise after 1440min of drying due to exposure to air at surface flow rates q of 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min respectively which result in three different water evaporation rates fig 2b shows two sets of images representing two of the control experiments in the first two images the effect of buoyancy is shown where at both time t 0 and t 1440min there was no napl rise in the absence of water evaporation though the density of the motor oil was slightly lower than that of water the rise due to buoyancy was insignificant the last three images in fig 2b show the effect of capillary rise in the sand column conventional capillary rise of liquids in porous media and in capillary channels is an expected phenomenon in porous media washburn 1921 lockington and parlange 2004 napl rise was observed in these cases in the absence of water evaporation and in dry sand capillary channels the rise occurred for a very short duration and the level of the napl remained constant after that the magnitude of capillary rise observed was much less compared to the napl rise seen in the images in fig 2a with water evaporation these images clearly illustrate that the napl rise seen in fig 2a were related to the evaporation of water from the sand and could not be attributed to normal capillary rise or buoyancy in order to visualize the water evaporation with reference to the mobility of the motor oil separate experiments were conducted with certain modifications to visualize the process more effectively in these experiments conducted with 0 5 mm glass beads the water was colored with a blue water soluble dye brilliant blue g dye sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india fig 3 a shows the time series images of the water evaporation and the mobility of the motor oil at the beginning of the experimental run the water saturated region above the red napl saturated sand region was dark blue in color as time progressed a water drying front visible by a boundary demarcating the light blue and the dark blue region appeared and moved downwards as evaporation occurred the light blue color indicated a region where the water content had reduced and the dark blue color appeared as thin patches the most significant observation in fig 3a was that the napl started to spread only after the drying reached the napl region at around a time t 350min and continued till about t 1000min and there was no mobility after that the mobility of napl seemed to occur when the water drying front reached the napl region implying strongly that the mechanism of drying in the region of the napl somehow caused the napl to mobilize one of the other observations from fig 3a was the accumulation of the blue dye at the top most part of the column at the sand air interface since the blue dye in the water was a non volatile dye the possible explanation for its accumulation at the surface was that the evaporation at the surface induced a flow of liquid water within the sand column the non volatile dye accumulated at the surface while water left the system as vapor a variation of this experiment is shown in fig 3b where the column did not contain any napl and the water in the top half of the sand column was not dyed with the blue color and water on the bottom half was dyed with the blue color fig 3b shows that the blue color started moving up only around 300min when the water drying front reaches the middle of the glass column the observations in fig 3a and b imply that the water transport in the drying region was due to an advection of liquid water in the pore space of the sand column this mechanism was also suggested in recent literature on the drying of water in porous media where thin films of water extended from within the porous medium towards the drying surface yiotis et al 2015 fig 3c also showed that in the absence of water evaporation the spread of the blue dye is very small characteristic of that due to diffusion implying that the movement of the blue dye observed in fig 3a and b and consequently the movement of water was mainly due to advection 3 2 effect of air flow rate on water flux and napl rise the effect of the water evaporation was further examined by comparing the water evaporation rates and the napl rise rates under a variety of experimental conditions fig 4 a and b shows the water evaporation and napl rise respectively in sand columns when the napl was in the center position 50 mm from the bottom as a function of different water evaporation rates induced by different values of q the flux and the napl rise shown in fig 4a and b were average values and the error bars were the standard deviation of data from the triplicate experimental runs as expected the initial water flux was higher when the surface air flow rate was higher from fig 4a the water flux was 0 32 0 07g cm2 h 0 42 0 05g cm2 h and 0 56 0 09g cm2 h for the air flow rates q of 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min respectively after 30min the fluxes decreased gradually initially and drastically after 250 325 and 470min for the cases where q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively the decrease in flux coincided approximately with the rise in the napl in the sand column fig 4b shows the napl rise in the sand column as a function of time and the three different rates of evaporation for the case where q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min the first significant napl movement occurred after 87 100 and 288min respectively during this period the average napl rise was estimated as 6 98 1 64mm 7 10 1 34mm and 7 06 3 03mm respectively for the cases when q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively however the onset and the rate of napl rise were different for each flow rate the napl rise rate was estimated as 0 035 mm min 0 030 mm min and 0 0061 mm min for the cases when q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively in contrast the napl rise in the capillary experiment was 3 0 0 86mm after 1440min with an average napl rise rate of 0 0024mm min this data clearly illustrated that the rate of drying induced by different surface airflow rates q influenced the rate of napl rise the data shown in fig 4a and b illustrate the behavior of the water flux and napl rise as a function of q with the initial napl position at the center of the column 50 mm from the bottom similar experiments were performed with the initial napl position closer to the top and bottom of the glass column figs 5 and 6 show the water flux and napl rise with the napl in the top 70 mm from the bottom and bottom 10 mm from the bottom positions respectively fig 5a and b shows the water flux and napl rise data respectively for the three different flow rates with the initial napl in the top position 70 mm from the bottom the napl rise began much earlier as compared to the case where the napl was in the center position the initial values of water flux for the three values of q were similar to those observed in the case where the napl was in the center position fig 4 the napl rise started 36min from the start of the experimental run with a q of 10 l min while it started after 39min and 75min for the runs with q values of 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively the overall rise of the napl was also similar to the rise observed in the case where the initial napl position was in the center 50 mm from the bottom fig 4b fig 6a and b shows the water flux and napl rise data for the three different flow rates with the initial napl in the bottom position 10 mm from the bottom the napl rise began much later as compared to the case where the napl was in the center or the top position the initial values of water flux for the three air flow rates q were similar to those observed in the case where the napl was in the center and the top position fig 4 the napl rise for the cases when q was 10 l min and 5 l min occurred at almost similar times at around 350min after the start of the experimental run for the case of lower q value of 2 5 l min case the napl rise started approximately at 420min after the commencement of the experimental run the overall rise of the napl was however much larger in this case the total napl rise with a q value of 10 l min case was about 15 mm after about 1400min for the case with q values of 2 5l min and the 5 l min the total napl rise was around 10 mm after about 1400min data from figs 5 and 6 clearly corroborate the point made with the data in figs 2 and 3 that napl rise occurred only when the drying front reached the napl layer as was evident from the observation that it took longer to mobilize the napl when it was in the bottom position 3 3 effect of initial location of napl the effect of initial napl position is further illustrated in figs 7 8 and 9 where the comparison of water flux and napl rise at different initial napl positions is presented for q values of 10 5 and 2 5 l min respectively fig s1a c shows the images of rise of motor oil from initial positions of top central and bottom position respectively at a drying rate of water corresponding to 5 l min in figs 7a 8a and 9a the water flux from the water saturated sand column in the absence of napl is also shown this set of data reiterate the correlation between the napl rise and the water evaporation from the water flux data two distinct levels of water flux were observed a high initial flux regime characterized usually as the constant rate period was followed by a rapid decrease leading to a regime of relatively lower and slowly decreasing flux these two regimes were bridged by a period showing decrease in flux the decrease in flux to the lower value is likely due to the diffusional resistance presented by the spread of the napl in the case where there is no napl the water drying usually follows three distinct regions constant rate falling rate and receding rate periods falling rate and receding rate periods were not observed clearly in the presence of napl in the case where the initial napl position was near the top the high flux period extended up to about 200min where the flux decreased from 0 33g cm2 h to 0 30g cm2 h in 177min and flux decreased much more rapidly from 0 30g cm2 h to 0 18g cm2 h within about 90min in the period leading to a period of very slowly decreasing flux similar trends of higher rate of decrease of water flux in both regimes were observed for higher values of q as well one of the significant observations corresponding to the water flux and napl rise data was that the period of water flux decrease corresponding to the rapid rate decrease period coincided with the period of napl rise corroborating the inference that napl rise was influenced strongly by the process of water evaporation the initial high water flux was controlled by the air side mass transfer coefficient governed primarily by the surface air flow rate q the initial decrease of water flux before 180 250 and 325min for the 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min cases respectively was most likely due to the depletion of water near the air sand interface and a few millimeters below the surface the water flux decrease observed during this period was primarily governed by increasing length for diffusion of water transport in the pores of the drying wet sand through capillary rise and diffusion in the porous media or et al 2007 the rapidly decreasing flux implied that the water drying front reached the napl layer triggering the napl redistribution and subsequently the napl layer acted as a significant transport barrier for the evaporation of water from below the napl layer if the water evaporation process was radially uniform and a theoretical sharp drying front would have been observed and the water flux was expected to decrease to zero as the water drying front reached the napl layer however it was observed that the fast decreasing flux period lasted a significant period of time implying a non ideal or non uniform drying front one possible explanation is that as the water evaporation front approached the napl region it induced the redistribution of napl which in turn caused some local redistribution of the water as well resulting in a region with the pore spaces in the sand containing napl water and air the resultant mass transfer of the water trapped in the region was likely to be very slow due to the higher resistance to water vapor diffusion or advective transport due to the presence of the napl in the pores in the time period following the rapid flux decrease the water flux observed for the case with a q of 10 l min and 5 l min were significantly lower than that for the case with a q value of 2 5 l min the lower initial rate of water evaporation in the case of the lower q implied that there was much more water present in the sand in the region above the napl layer that was slowly evaporating this was clearly illustrated in fig 9 where the trend followed by the water flux in the presence of napl at the bottom was very similar to the water flux from a system without napl till about 800min the relatively higher water flux compared to the cases with higher values of q was due to the relatively higher residual water in the sand above the napl layer however the redistribution of napl as the water front approached the napl resulted in a slight decrease in the water diffusion due to the transport resistance offered by the presence of napl in the pores this decrease in the flux was however lower than the decrease observed for the cases with the higher q values this suggested a non uniform water evaporation that was also observed visually fig 3 where patches of water were observed and corresponding patches of napl rise in certain portions of the sand column the effect was exaggerated in the case of the napl in the bottom since water evaporation occurred for a relatively longer period 3 4 effect of napl properties and grain size of porous media experiments were performed to study the effect of the napl rise as a function of different napls and sand grain size fig 10 a f shows the water evaporation and the napl rise patterns for three different napls and grain sizes of sand the three different napls used were motor oil mo light crude oil lco and bunker oil bo and the three different porous solids used were white sand ws with a reported mean grain size of about 0 3 mm glass beads of 0 5 mm grain size gb05 and glass beads of 0 1 mm grain size gb01 fig 10a and b shows the water flux and the napl rise for the three different napls for white sand all the experiments were performed at a drying rate corresponding to a q value of 5 l min and with the initial napl position at the center fig s2a c shows images of the rise of bunker oil motor oil and light crude oil from a central position at a drying rate of water corresponding to 5 l min for white sand the water evaporation data was similar for the three different napl types this was expected since the value of q was the same for all three different napl types however the rise of napl was in the order lco mo bo the properties of the napls are listed in table 1 fig 10c and d show the water fluxes and napl rise for the three napls with the glass beads with 0 5 mm grain size respectively fig 10e and f show the water fluxes and napl rise for the three napls with the glass beads with 0 1 mm grain size respectively the effect of grain size was significant in the case of lco with higher rise occurring with higher grain size and consequently higher pore size a slight increase in napl rise was observed for bo with respect to increase in grain size in the case of mo the size of the error bars for napl rise makes it difficult to conclude if grain size has an effect or not from the data it seems that there is a threshold viscosity or interfacial tension before which the pore size might become significant however this aspect needs to be studied further with other napls with a wider range of properties in fig 11 the napl rise rate or velocity v n avg was correlated with the liquid water evaporation velocities associated with the drying process during the time period when the napl rise occurred at different initial position of the napl the average liquid water evaporation velocity v w avg associated with drying was computed as n w a œÅ w œµ where n w was the water evaporation flux a was the cross section area of the sand column 0 785cm2 œÅ w was the density of water 1g cm3 and œµ was the total porosity of sand estimated as 0 4 the flux value n w used to compute the water evaporation velocity was the flux at the end of capillary rise period in figs 7 9 before the sharp decline in the water flux and just before the napl rise the reasoning for this was that the rate of water drying at the time when the drying front approached the napl layer was hypothesized as the primary influencing factor for causing the napl to rise the linearized average napl rise rate mm min was computed from the total napl rise mm divided by the time min taken to achieve this rise fig 11 showed the correlation of the napl rise rate to the water evaporation velocity was positive and non linear the data for the correlation also includes the capillary rise where the water evaporation velocity was zero shown as the intercept on the y axis the napl rise rate was significantly higher for the case where motor oil was present in the top initial position the non linear correlation presented in fig 11 was obtained using the entire data set different correlations may be obtained for the napl rise pattern as a function of initial position of the napl the correlation presented in fig 11 is an empirical relationship between the rise of motor oil and the evaporation velocities which are obtained from a given surface air flow rate q fig 12 a b c and d shows the correlation of the napl rise rate to napl contact angle with glass napl density napl viscosity and the grain size respectively fig 12a b and c shows a negative correlation for napl rise with glass contact angle of napl napl density and napl viscosity light crude oil lco has the lowest contact angle with glass the lowest viscosity and density the three napls used in this study have the same trend for all the three properties that are relevant for their transport in porous media therefore it is difficult to delineate the individual effect of each of these three properties experiments with other napls whose properties vary differently from the ones chosen in this experiment should be carried out to obtain a more specific dependency on napl property 3 5 mechanism of napl rise from the data seen in figs 11 and 12a c it is clear that the napl rise is a function of water evaporation rate and napl viscosity and contact angle from the data it is clear that the water evaporation has to reach the napl region to cause the napl to rise yiotis et al 2003 2012 reported that during the evaporation of water from porous media water travels through the porous medium in the form of thin films along the edges of the pore spaces which is also supported from data in the present study in their work the suggested mechanism for this advection of water film is an excess capillary pressure developed due to the drying that induces the connected liquid film and sustains a constant evaporation period during drying this theory was also reported by coussot 2000 keita et al 2013 the model proposed by yiotis et al 2003 2012 uses the excess capillary pressure gravity and the evaporation rate to estimate saturation levels in porous media and further extended their theoretical treatment to develop a pore network model yiotis et al 2015 coussot 2000 keita et al 2013 proposed a similar theory while modeling it differently estimating a capillary velocity within a particular zone in the drying porous media column where the thin water films were expected to be present based on this the water evaporation is expected to generate pore vapor space at the location of the initial napl where three fluid phases water napl and air exist and the water expected to be attached to the sand particles with interfaces with air and the napl in other literature reporting the behavior of napl at the interface with water and air a spreading coefficient has been defined harkins and feldman 1922 adamson 1960 which is equal to Œ≥ aw Œ≥ nw Œ≥ an where Œ≥ aw Œ≥ nw and Œ≥ an are the interfacial tensions for air water napl water and air napl respectively if the spreading coefficient is positive the napl is expected to spread on the water film to different degrees the theory of the spreading coefficient has been applied to model the drainage of napl with water under the influence of gravity in different systems vizika et al 1996 zhou and blunt 1997 singh et al 2016 based on the reported behavior of napl and water in porous media two possible hypotheses are proposed to explain the napl rise during water evaporation the first hypothesis is based on water wetting and the spreading coefficient in this mechanism the process of water evaporation creates pore vapor resulting in the formation of a three phase region that initiates the wetting of the napl on the water film that is present in the unsaturated region upwards towards the sand air interface this mechanism therefore relies entirely on the presence of a continuous water film in the unsaturated drying zone and the napl rising between the water and air phases due to the wetting process defined by the spreading coefficient at higher rates of evaporation the time taken for the drying front to reach the napl layer is shorter and a relatively quicker formation of the three phase system resulting in earlier commencement of the napl rise the second hypothesis is that the movement of a water film during evaporation resulting in a shear stress at the napl interface causing the napl to be dragged along with the water as long as a water film of sufficient thickness exists napl rise can be sustained there is sufficient evidence in the theory of flow of immiscible fluids to support this hypothesis as well packham and shall 1971 chamkha 2000 the experimental observations presented in this study were examined with reference to the proposed hypotheses the spreading coefficients of a variety of organic materials on water air interface have been reported by takamura et al 2012 these include positive spreading coefficients for a variety of alkanes and aromatics but negative coefficients for several mineral oils of both high and low viscosity which are typically mixtures of several aliphatic compounds positive spreading coefficients were also reported for a commercial mixture of hydrocarbons oren et al 1994 vizika et al 1996 the magnitude of napl rise was observed to be a function of napl properties napl of lower viscosity and contact angle displayed higher rise different spreading coefficients for the different napls may lead to different spreading rates and consequently different magnitudes of spread shear stress at the napl water interface also is a function of the viscosity of the napl and therefore higher friction is experienced for higher viscosity napls and therefore the magnitude of rise is lower for napls with relatively higher viscosity therefore both the hypotheses seem plausible and support the observations in this study further investigation is necessary to determine the different conditions under which one of the hypotheses dominates in the present study there was difficulty in estimating the interfacial tension between the napl and water and therefore the spreading coefficients could not be estimated if the napls in this study display negative spreading coefficients then the spreading coefficient hypothesis cannot explain napl rise and the drag hypothesis seems more favorable it is therefore essential to estimate or measure the spreading coefficients for all the napls to understand their spreading behavior additional experiments can be performed to examine whether the mere presence of a three phase zone is sufficient for the napl rise or if additional movement of the water film is necessary to induce and sustain napl rise experiments in a single capillary can also be planned in order to test the hypothesis of the spreading versus drag realistic mathematical modeling of the napl rise during evaporation requires the resolution of the mechanism however simulation of the different scenarios presented in this paper may provide a better understanding of the validity of the hypotheses presented existing multiphase flow models may be applied under different scenarios to compare with experimental results one of the challenges in doing so is the coupling of the water evaporation and the napl rise dynamic changes in water and napl saturations at the pore level may be modeled by considering a boundary condition of the rate of evaporation at the air sand interface surface yiotis et al 2015 have reported a pore network model on the drying of sand to model the napl rise two different approaches representing the two different hypotheses can be examined for the spreading coefficient hypothesis the napl rise is linked to the dynamics of pore vapor generation in the three dimensional space at the pore level controlled by the water evaporation process the variation of the spreading coefficient at the pore scale may be modeled using the pore scale saturation estimation of the water evaporation model for the drag effect hypothesis fluid transport models that predict the velocities induced in an initially stationary fluid in contact with a moving film of a different fluid these models require the thicknesses of the different film at the pore scale which may be obtained from the pore network water evaporation model for effective comparison of the model and experiment higher resolution three dimensional data for the dynamic napl and water saturations in the sand is required a non invasive technique nmr mri is being explored currently to obtain data of higher spatial resolution that can offer greater insight into the pore level mechanisms 4 conclusion in this study the observation of napl mobility in sand under the influence of water evaporation from the porous media is reported significantly higher napl rise was observed compared to capillary rise without water evaporation the napl rise rate was observed to be strongly correlated to the water evaporation rate water evaporation studies reported in the literature suggest the presence of a thin moving film of water along the edges of the pores in the direction of the water evaporation this is substantiated by the experimental findings in this study as well based on reports in the literature of napl movement in unsaturated porous media two hypotheses to explain the napl rise are proposed the first hypothesis is that spreading of the napl occurs on the water films when the napl is exposed to air at the napl water air interface the pore air in this scenario is created by the evaporation the second hypothesis is that the advective velocity of the thin water film during evaporation induces movement in the napl thus dragging it during the evaporation process and causing the napl to rise from different experiments it was also observed that the napl rise rate was a function of the napl viscosity and glass contact angle typically as the viscosity or the density increases the napl rise rate decreases pore network modeling coupling the water evaporation and the napl rise hypothesis are required to further investigate the validity of either of these hypotheses pore scale water and napl saturation measurements with higher spatial resolution are required to provide a greater understanding of the process and to support the modeling process in a system such as soils the napl rise is also expected to be a function of other factors such as the amount of clay and organic carbon since clay undergoes shrinkage and swelling due to moisture content changes through drying or rewetting resulting in the change of napl mobility further experiments are currently under way to study these effects from a perspective of contaminant fate and transport the observed behavior of napl migration can have an impact on the modeling of solute transport within variably saturated soils or similar porous media that can undergo cyclic drying and rewetting the findings in this paper may also have implications on engineering methods applied to mobilize napl during the remediation of napl contaminated sites conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was partially supported by a

1680,enhanced upward mobility of a non aqueous phase liquid napl present in wet sand during natural drying and in the absence of any external pressure gradients is reported for the first time this mobility was significantly higher than that expected from capillary rise experiments were performed in a glass column with a small layer of napl saturated sand trapped between two layers of water saturated sand drying of the wet sand was induced by flow of air across the top surface of the wet sand the upward movement of the napl in the direction of water transport commenced when the drying effect reached the location of the napl and continued as long as there was significant water evaporation in the vicinity of napl indicating a clear correlation between the napl rise and water evaporation the magnitude and the rate of napl rise was measured at different water evaporation rates different initial locations of the napl different grain size of the sand and the type of napl on the basis of different napl glass contact angle viscosity and density a positive correlation was observed between average rate of napl rise and the water evaporation while a negative correlation was obtained between the average napl rise rate and the napl properties of contact angle viscosity and density there was no significant correlation of average napl rise rate with variation of sand grain size between 0 1 to 0 5mm based on these observations and on previous studies reported in the literature two possible mechanisms are hypothesized a the effect of the spreading coefficient resulting in the wetting of napl on the water films created and b a moving water film due to evaporation that drags the napl upwards the napl rise reported in this paper has implications in fate and transport of chemicals in napl contaminated porous media such as soils and exposed dredged sediment material which are subjected to varying water saturation levels due to drying and rewetting keywords napl water evaporation enhanced napl rise porous media imaging capillary rise 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls are a class of organic chemicals present in contaminated sediments soils sludges and exposed dredged materials panagiotakis and dermatas 2015 usepa 1994 luthy et al 1994 ma et al 2010 feo et al 2011 ravikrishna et al 2001 the napl phase may be a single compound such as solvents or a mixture of components petroleum fractions such as petrol diesel or crude oil johnston et al 2007 hamed 2005 lang et al 2009 napl components belong to a wide range of chemical classification including saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs chlorinated hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic compounds which have relatively low solubility in water in addition to their presence in the environment as a separate non aqueous phase napls are also a potential source of contamination of ground and surface water and pore vapor via transport processes such as dissolution evaporation and diffusion vasudevan et al 2016 zhu and sykes 2000 abriola et al 2004 coulon et al 2010 the fate and transport of the napl phase in the porous medium has significant influence in determining the fate and transport of the individual components present in the napl as well as other contaminants that are present in the porous medium but are physically separated and not part of the napl phase petri et al 2015 these may be chemicals in the adsorbed phase on solids or in the pore vapor or pore water fate and transport of organic chemicals present in contaminated soils flury 1996 mcgechan and lewis 2002 brusseau and rao 1990 jury and fl√ºhler 1992 and exposed contaminated dredged sediment material stored in confined disposal facilities thibodeaux 1996 thibodeaux and mackay 2010 choy and reible 1999 valsaraj et al 1999 ravikrishna et al 2001 have been reported the fate and transport of the chemicals that are not associated with the napl phase in such systems could be significantly affected by changes in the properties and location of the napl phase hence realistic estimation of the position and transport of napl is necessary for better characterization of the fate and transport of individual chemical solutes in systems such as soil and exposed dredged materials for environmental risk assessment and for the design of effective environmental remediation methods the mobility of napls under a variety of natural and engineered conditions has been studied and reported the influence of groundwater flow on the transport of napls has been extensively studied fagerlund et al 2007 oostrom et al 2006 barth et al 2003 chevalier and petersen 1999 abriola and bradford 1998 illangasekare et al 1995 cary et al 1989 the components of the napl are subject to dissolution in water saturated soils bradford et al 2003 sauer and costa 2003 lekmine et al 2014 heyse et al 2002 and volatilization in unsaturated soils davis et al 2005 van meurs et al 2004 such dissolution or volatilization of components of the napl results in change of the properties of the residual napl phase weathering the mobilization of napl under an external force such as the application of vacuum or positive pressure has also been observed in the context of engineering interventions for remediation of contaminated soils these include air sparging and soil vapor extraction wang et al 1995 benson et al 1993 pasha et al 2014 freeze thaw cycling singh et al 2011 and engineered pressure gradients rathfelder et al 1995 yoon et al 2007 both soils and exposed dredged materials are similar in structure and are subject to varying water saturation levels as a result of drying due to evaporation of water and rewetting due to rain the presence of a napl phase in the pore spaces can potentially influence the fate and transport of any organic solute present in the pore air pore water or on the solid phase in the porous medium sorbed state luong 1996 reported the appearance of an oil sheen on the surface of the sediment while observing a significant reduction of the measured pah flux in laboratory experiments designed to study the release of pahs from napl contaminated sediments to surface water this observation suggested a possible mobilization of napl from within the bulk of the contaminated sediment to the surface and creating a significant diffusional barrier for the transport of pahs in previous work unsaturated soils contaminated with a pah phenanthrene and containing small amounts of napl motor oil were exposed to air flowing at the soil air interface to study the effect of the napl on the release of phenanthrene ravikrishna et al 2002 the moisture and the napl content in the system were low 8 w w and 4 w w respectively and consequently occupied very low volume fractions in the soil pore space which was predominantly occupied by air the presence of motor oil in the soil significantly decreased phenanthrene flux at the air soil interface as compared to the flux in an experiment where the soil did not contain any motor oil post experiment sectioning of the soil column however revealed no significant mobility of the motor oil suggesting that the reduction of phenanthrene flux could only be attributed to its sorption on the motor oil present in the soil based on these observations of napl and solute transport it is clear that the presence of napl affects the fate and transport of individual solutes in porous media by two possible mechanisms a enhancing the retardation through the sorption of chemicals resulting in a decrease in the solute concentration in the pore air or pore water and consequently reducing the diffusion flux and b by mobilization of the napl and causing the creation of a physical diffusion barrier within the pore spaces in previous studies described above where both the moisture and napl content were low in the porous medium no significant redistribution of napl was observed however the effect of drying of porous material with an initially high moisture and high napl content on the redistribution of napl is unknown this is relevant to the understanding of fate and transport of solutes in systems containing high moisture and high napl content such as wet soils and exposed dredged material that are subject to change in water saturation conditions due to evaporation in the current study the mobility of napl trapped in a water saturated sand column was studied under the conditions of evaporation of water laboratory experiments were conducted in a glass column where a layer of napl saturated sand was placed between two layers of water saturated sand and exposed to a flow of air at the sand air interface the napl mobility and water fluxes were measured as a function of time flow rate of air varying evaporation rates of water initial position of the napl property of the napl and grain size of sand 2 experimental methods 2 1 measurement of napl mobility and water flux 2 1 1 preparation of the sand column experiments to measure napl mobility and water flux were performed using a setup represented schematically in fig 1 the experimental system was a t shaped hollow tubular structure constructed from glass and consisted of a vertical section 110 mm tall and i d of 10 mm that intersected with a horizontal section 90 mm height from the bottom and i d of 10 mm the part of the vertical section above the intersection with the horizontal section was fitted with a ground glass joint that allowed the closure at the top of the vertical section using a glass stopper compressed ambient air was supplied to the horizontal section of the experimental setup through a hepa filter and a flow controller in a typical experiment a small layer of napl saturated sand was placed between two layers of water saturated sand as shown in fig 1 the top surface of the upper water saturated sand layer in the vertical sand column was flush with the bottom surface of the horizontal glass section to facilitate air flow across the surface of the sand the relative humidity and temperature of the inlet and outlet air were measured using thermohygrometers extech model no rh305 experiments were performed with three different grain sizes of porous material a white sand ws of grain size of 0 3 mm tamilnadu minerals limited b glass beads gb of size 0 1 mm and c glass beads of size 0 5 mm both glass beads from sigma aldrich the napl used in the study were a commercial motor oil mo servo futura plus indian oil corporation india b bunker oil bo from chennai petrochemical corporation limited cpcl and c light crude oil lco from indian oil corporation table 1 shows the relevant properties of these oils in order to visualize the napl movement the contrast of the napl with respect to sand and water was enhanced by the addition of a red oil soluble dye oil o red dye to the motor oil at a concentration of 500 ppm the dye in the napl did not stain water glass or sand in the experiment the dye was not added to the experiments with bunker oil and light crude oil since there was sufficient visual contrast of these napls with reference to the sand and water for a typical experimental run the sand column with the napl was prepared using the following procedure a small amount of water was added to the vertical section of the glass column and a small amount of pre washed sand was poured to create a small layer of water saturated sand to ensure that the sand was water saturated the amount of sand added was such that the level of water was always bit higher than the submerged sand the column was tapped to release any air bubbles in the system this procedure was repeated until the total height of the water saturated sand was that of the intended napl position at this point 0 2 g of the napl was added on top of the water saturated sand layer using a stainless steel syringe fitted with a long needle sand was then added to the napl to prepare the napl saturated sand layer that was 8 9 mm thick the second layer of water saturated sand on top of the napl saturated sand was prepared by successively adding small amounts of water and sand until the total height of the sand in the column reached 90 mm from the bottom the upper layer of water saturated sand was also tapped to release any trapped air bubbles this water saturated sand layer above the napl extended to 90 mm from the bottom the height where the horizontal section intersected the vertical section experiments were conducted with three different initial positions of the 8 9 mm thick napl saturated sand layer in the glass column in these three positions the lower end of the napl saturated sand layer was at three different positions 70 mm top 50 mm center and 10 mm bottom from the bottom of the sand column different control experiments were also conducted to observe the effect of other processes that may also cause napl rise in one set of control experiment there was no air flow in the experimental setup shown in fig 1 resulting in no water evaporation from the wet sand this was conducted to observe if any napl rise occurred due to buoyancy with reference to water in a different type of control experiment dry sand instead of water saturated sand was placed on top of the napl saturated sand layer in the glass column this was conducted to observe capillary rise of the napl in dry sand in the absence of water evaporation a third type of control experiment was conducted to observe water evaporation rate in the absence of any napl in the sand column all control experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 1 2 water flux measurements in a typical experimental run compressed ambient air filtered through a 3Œºm filter was sent through the experimental setup at a desired flow rate the relative humidity and temperature of the air exiting the compressor varied between 10 14 and 29 32 c respectively the relative humidity and the temperature of the inlet and outlet air were measured using two different thermo hygrometers extech which were calibrated before every experimental run using calibration salts 33 and 75 relative humidity flux of the evaporating water from the sand column n w was calculated using eq 1 1 n w œÅ w o u t œÅ w i n q a where œÅ w o u t and œÅ w i n were the mass concentrations of water vapor in the outlet and inlet air respectively q was the volumetric flow rate of air across the surface and a was the surface area for water evaporation which was the internal cross sectional area of the vertical section of the glass column the mass concentration œÅ w i n and œÅ w o u t were calculated from the inlet and outlet relative humidity measurements using ideal gas law according to eq 2 2 œÅ w i r h i p s a t t i m w r t i where rh i was the measured relative humidity where i was either the inlet or the outlet p sat the saturated vapor pressure of water at temperature t i was obtained using the antoine equation green and maloney 1997 at the temperature of the inlet or the outlet streams m w was the molecular mass of water and r was the universal gas constant experiments were performed using three different values of q 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min to induce three different water drying rates an experimental run was considered to start when air flow was introduced across the top surface of the sand column a list of the different experimental conditions and controls are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material 2 1 3 measurement of napl mobility the mobility of the napl was recorded visually by capturing the images of the glass experimental set up every 3min until the end of the experiment with a samsung galaxy s5 mobile phone camera resolution of 1920 1080pixels using an android application lapse it pro the images were processed to obtain the vertical extent of the napl movement as a function of time automation of the image processing routine was considered necessary since manual visual estimation of the spread of the napl was subject to errors based on individual perception of color in the automated method the raw images were cropped to the same dimension to include only the glass column with the sand and its contents since the napl soluble dye was red and the sand was white these were set as the two extreme colors in an image to obtain the vertical extent of napl movement the detection of the farthest red colored pixel from the initial napl location was required based on the total physical height of the glass column in each image and the pixel resolution of the image in the vertical direction it was determined that one pixel dimension in the image of the glass column corresponded to a physical height of 0 14 mm in the glass column the napl position was measured with reference to the top end of the napl saturated layer at the beginning of the experimental run image analysis was performed using matlab which provided an rgb map of all the pixels in the image using the in built function imread in the rgb format the red and white colors corresponded to rgb values of 255 0 0 and 255 255 255 respectively in this system where red and white were the only colors of interest it was possible that a particular pixel might contain a fraction of red and white and the true representation of this color would be somewhere in between the rgb values for pure red and pure white however since the objective was to estimate the extent of the napl migration the presence of any red pixel in the system was sufficient to obtain the napl position therefore all partially red pixels were converted to fully red pixels complimentary colors were then added to each pixel in the images to render the red channel values of non red pixels to zero the r red color value for a particular height was computed as the average of r values from the rgb values obtained from all pixels in a particular x y plane at that height since each pixel along the vertical direction corresponded approximately to a height of 0 14 mm of sand in the glass column the average r was thus estimated as a function of the physical height of sand in the column and provided the vertical spread of the napl the capability of automated imaging technique in identifying different shapes was tested using a variety of patterns of red and white using the matlab algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observations of napl mobility fig 2 a shows the mobility of motor oil under conditions of different evaporation rates induced by different flow rates of air at the surface with the initial position of the napl in the center 50 mm from the bottom of the column the first image in fig 2a shows the napl and the water saturated sand layers initially at time t 0 the other three images in fig 2a show the extent of the napl rise after 1440min of drying due to exposure to air at surface flow rates q of 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min respectively which result in three different water evaporation rates fig 2b shows two sets of images representing two of the control experiments in the first two images the effect of buoyancy is shown where at both time t 0 and t 1440min there was no napl rise in the absence of water evaporation though the density of the motor oil was slightly lower than that of water the rise due to buoyancy was insignificant the last three images in fig 2b show the effect of capillary rise in the sand column conventional capillary rise of liquids in porous media and in capillary channels is an expected phenomenon in porous media washburn 1921 lockington and parlange 2004 napl rise was observed in these cases in the absence of water evaporation and in dry sand capillary channels the rise occurred for a very short duration and the level of the napl remained constant after that the magnitude of capillary rise observed was much less compared to the napl rise seen in the images in fig 2a with water evaporation these images clearly illustrate that the napl rise seen in fig 2a were related to the evaporation of water from the sand and could not be attributed to normal capillary rise or buoyancy in order to visualize the water evaporation with reference to the mobility of the motor oil separate experiments were conducted with certain modifications to visualize the process more effectively in these experiments conducted with 0 5 mm glass beads the water was colored with a blue water soluble dye brilliant blue g dye sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india fig 3 a shows the time series images of the water evaporation and the mobility of the motor oil at the beginning of the experimental run the water saturated region above the red napl saturated sand region was dark blue in color as time progressed a water drying front visible by a boundary demarcating the light blue and the dark blue region appeared and moved downwards as evaporation occurred the light blue color indicated a region where the water content had reduced and the dark blue color appeared as thin patches the most significant observation in fig 3a was that the napl started to spread only after the drying reached the napl region at around a time t 350min and continued till about t 1000min and there was no mobility after that the mobility of napl seemed to occur when the water drying front reached the napl region implying strongly that the mechanism of drying in the region of the napl somehow caused the napl to mobilize one of the other observations from fig 3a was the accumulation of the blue dye at the top most part of the column at the sand air interface since the blue dye in the water was a non volatile dye the possible explanation for its accumulation at the surface was that the evaporation at the surface induced a flow of liquid water within the sand column the non volatile dye accumulated at the surface while water left the system as vapor a variation of this experiment is shown in fig 3b where the column did not contain any napl and the water in the top half of the sand column was not dyed with the blue color and water on the bottom half was dyed with the blue color fig 3b shows that the blue color started moving up only around 300min when the water drying front reaches the middle of the glass column the observations in fig 3a and b imply that the water transport in the drying region was due to an advection of liquid water in the pore space of the sand column this mechanism was also suggested in recent literature on the drying of water in porous media where thin films of water extended from within the porous medium towards the drying surface yiotis et al 2015 fig 3c also showed that in the absence of water evaporation the spread of the blue dye is very small characteristic of that due to diffusion implying that the movement of the blue dye observed in fig 3a and b and consequently the movement of water was mainly due to advection 3 2 effect of air flow rate on water flux and napl rise the effect of the water evaporation was further examined by comparing the water evaporation rates and the napl rise rates under a variety of experimental conditions fig 4 a and b shows the water evaporation and napl rise respectively in sand columns when the napl was in the center position 50 mm from the bottom as a function of different water evaporation rates induced by different values of q the flux and the napl rise shown in fig 4a and b were average values and the error bars were the standard deviation of data from the triplicate experimental runs as expected the initial water flux was higher when the surface air flow rate was higher from fig 4a the water flux was 0 32 0 07g cm2 h 0 42 0 05g cm2 h and 0 56 0 09g cm2 h for the air flow rates q of 2 5 l min 5 l min and 10 l min respectively after 30min the fluxes decreased gradually initially and drastically after 250 325 and 470min for the cases where q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively the decrease in flux coincided approximately with the rise in the napl in the sand column fig 4b shows the napl rise in the sand column as a function of time and the three different rates of evaporation for the case where q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min the first significant napl movement occurred after 87 100 and 288min respectively during this period the average napl rise was estimated as 6 98 1 64mm 7 10 1 34mm and 7 06 3 03mm respectively for the cases when q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively however the onset and the rate of napl rise were different for each flow rate the napl rise rate was estimated as 0 035 mm min 0 030 mm min and 0 0061 mm min for the cases when q was 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively in contrast the napl rise in the capillary experiment was 3 0 0 86mm after 1440min with an average napl rise rate of 0 0024mm min this data clearly illustrated that the rate of drying induced by different surface airflow rates q influenced the rate of napl rise the data shown in fig 4a and b illustrate the behavior of the water flux and napl rise as a function of q with the initial napl position at the center of the column 50 mm from the bottom similar experiments were performed with the initial napl position closer to the top and bottom of the glass column figs 5 and 6 show the water flux and napl rise with the napl in the top 70 mm from the bottom and bottom 10 mm from the bottom positions respectively fig 5a and b shows the water flux and napl rise data respectively for the three different flow rates with the initial napl in the top position 70 mm from the bottom the napl rise began much earlier as compared to the case where the napl was in the center position the initial values of water flux for the three values of q were similar to those observed in the case where the napl was in the center position fig 4 the napl rise started 36min from the start of the experimental run with a q of 10 l min while it started after 39min and 75min for the runs with q values of 5 l min and 2 5 l min respectively the overall rise of the napl was also similar to the rise observed in the case where the initial napl position was in the center 50 mm from the bottom fig 4b fig 6a and b shows the water flux and napl rise data for the three different flow rates with the initial napl in the bottom position 10 mm from the bottom the napl rise began much later as compared to the case where the napl was in the center or the top position the initial values of water flux for the three air flow rates q were similar to those observed in the case where the napl was in the center and the top position fig 4 the napl rise for the cases when q was 10 l min and 5 l min occurred at almost similar times at around 350min after the start of the experimental run for the case of lower q value of 2 5 l min case the napl rise started approximately at 420min after the commencement of the experimental run the overall rise of the napl was however much larger in this case the total napl rise with a q value of 10 l min case was about 15 mm after about 1400min for the case with q values of 2 5l min and the 5 l min the total napl rise was around 10 mm after about 1400min data from figs 5 and 6 clearly corroborate the point made with the data in figs 2 and 3 that napl rise occurred only when the drying front reached the napl layer as was evident from the observation that it took longer to mobilize the napl when it was in the bottom position 3 3 effect of initial location of napl the effect of initial napl position is further illustrated in figs 7 8 and 9 where the comparison of water flux and napl rise at different initial napl positions is presented for q values of 10 5 and 2 5 l min respectively fig s1a c shows the images of rise of motor oil from initial positions of top central and bottom position respectively at a drying rate of water corresponding to 5 l min in figs 7a 8a and 9a the water flux from the water saturated sand column in the absence of napl is also shown this set of data reiterate the correlation between the napl rise and the water evaporation from the water flux data two distinct levels of water flux were observed a high initial flux regime characterized usually as the constant rate period was followed by a rapid decrease leading to a regime of relatively lower and slowly decreasing flux these two regimes were bridged by a period showing decrease in flux the decrease in flux to the lower value is likely due to the diffusional resistance presented by the spread of the napl in the case where there is no napl the water drying usually follows three distinct regions constant rate falling rate and receding rate periods falling rate and receding rate periods were not observed clearly in the presence of napl in the case where the initial napl position was near the top the high flux period extended up to about 200min where the flux decreased from 0 33g cm2 h to 0 30g cm2 h in 177min and flux decreased much more rapidly from 0 30g cm2 h to 0 18g cm2 h within about 90min in the period leading to a period of very slowly decreasing flux similar trends of higher rate of decrease of water flux in both regimes were observed for higher values of q as well one of the significant observations corresponding to the water flux and napl rise data was that the period of water flux decrease corresponding to the rapid rate decrease period coincided with the period of napl rise corroborating the inference that napl rise was influenced strongly by the process of water evaporation the initial high water flux was controlled by the air side mass transfer coefficient governed primarily by the surface air flow rate q the initial decrease of water flux before 180 250 and 325min for the 10 l min 5 l min and 2 5 l min cases respectively was most likely due to the depletion of water near the air sand interface and a few millimeters below the surface the water flux decrease observed during this period was primarily governed by increasing length for diffusion of water transport in the pores of the drying wet sand through capillary rise and diffusion in the porous media or et al 2007 the rapidly decreasing flux implied that the water drying front reached the napl layer triggering the napl redistribution and subsequently the napl layer acted as a significant transport barrier for the evaporation of water from below the napl layer if the water evaporation process was radially uniform and a theoretical sharp drying front would have been observed and the water flux was expected to decrease to zero as the water drying front reached the napl layer however it was observed that the fast decreasing flux period lasted a significant period of time implying a non ideal or non uniform drying front one possible explanation is that as the water evaporation front approached the napl region it induced the redistribution of napl which in turn caused some local redistribution of the water as well resulting in a region with the pore spaces in the sand containing napl water and air the resultant mass transfer of the water trapped in the region was likely to be very slow due to the higher resistance to water vapor diffusion or advective transport due to the presence of the napl in the pores in the time period following the rapid flux decrease the water flux observed for the case with a q of 10 l min and 5 l min were significantly lower than that for the case with a q value of 2 5 l min the lower initial rate of water evaporation in the case of the lower q implied that there was much more water present in the sand in the region above the napl layer that was slowly evaporating this was clearly illustrated in fig 9 where the trend followed by the water flux in the presence of napl at the bottom was very similar to the water flux from a system without napl till about 800min the relatively higher water flux compared to the cases with higher values of q was due to the relatively higher residual water in the sand above the napl layer however the redistribution of napl as the water front approached the napl resulted in a slight decrease in the water diffusion due to the transport resistance offered by the presence of napl in the pores this decrease in the flux was however lower than the decrease observed for the cases with the higher q values this suggested a non uniform water evaporation that was also observed visually fig 3 where patches of water were observed and corresponding patches of napl rise in certain portions of the sand column the effect was exaggerated in the case of the napl in the bottom since water evaporation occurred for a relatively longer period 3 4 effect of napl properties and grain size of porous media experiments were performed to study the effect of the napl rise as a function of different napls and sand grain size fig 10 a f shows the water evaporation and the napl rise patterns for three different napls and grain sizes of sand the three different napls used were motor oil mo light crude oil lco and bunker oil bo and the three different porous solids used were white sand ws with a reported mean grain size of about 0 3 mm glass beads of 0 5 mm grain size gb05 and glass beads of 0 1 mm grain size gb01 fig 10a and b shows the water flux and the napl rise for the three different napls for white sand all the experiments were performed at a drying rate corresponding to a q value of 5 l min and with the initial napl position at the center fig s2a c shows images of the rise of bunker oil motor oil and light crude oil from a central position at a drying rate of water corresponding to 5 l min for white sand the water evaporation data was similar for the three different napl types this was expected since the value of q was the same for all three different napl types however the rise of napl was in the order lco mo bo the properties of the napls are listed in table 1 fig 10c and d show the water fluxes and napl rise for the three napls with the glass beads with 0 5 mm grain size respectively fig 10e and f show the water fluxes and napl rise for the three napls with the glass beads with 0 1 mm grain size respectively the effect of grain size was significant in the case of lco with higher rise occurring with higher grain size and consequently higher pore size a slight increase in napl rise was observed for bo with respect to increase in grain size in the case of mo the size of the error bars for napl rise makes it difficult to conclude if grain size has an effect or not from the data it seems that there is a threshold viscosity or interfacial tension before which the pore size might become significant however this aspect needs to be studied further with other napls with a wider range of properties in fig 11 the napl rise rate or velocity v n avg was correlated with the liquid water evaporation velocities associated with the drying process during the time period when the napl rise occurred at different initial position of the napl the average liquid water evaporation velocity v w avg associated with drying was computed as n w a œÅ w œµ where n w was the water evaporation flux a was the cross section area of the sand column 0 785cm2 œÅ w was the density of water 1g cm3 and œµ was the total porosity of sand estimated as 0 4 the flux value n w used to compute the water evaporation velocity was the flux at the end of capillary rise period in figs 7 9 before the sharp decline in the water flux and just before the napl rise the reasoning for this was that the rate of water drying at the time when the drying front approached the napl layer was hypothesized as the primary influencing factor for causing the napl to rise the linearized average napl rise rate mm min was computed from the total napl rise mm divided by the time min taken to achieve this rise fig 11 showed the correlation of the napl rise rate to the water evaporation velocity was positive and non linear the data for the correlation also includes the capillary rise where the water evaporation velocity was zero shown as the intercept on the y axis the napl rise rate was significantly higher for the case where motor oil was present in the top initial position the non linear correlation presented in fig 11 was obtained using the entire data set different correlations may be obtained for the napl rise pattern as a function of initial position of the napl the correlation presented in fig 11 is an empirical relationship between the rise of motor oil and the evaporation velocities which are obtained from a given surface air flow rate q fig 12 a b c and d shows the correlation of the napl rise rate to napl contact angle with glass napl density napl viscosity and the grain size respectively fig 12a b and c shows a negative correlation for napl rise with glass contact angle of napl napl density and napl viscosity light crude oil lco has the lowest contact angle with glass the lowest viscosity and density the three napls used in this study have the same trend for all the three properties that are relevant for their transport in porous media therefore it is difficult to delineate the individual effect of each of these three properties experiments with other napls whose properties vary differently from the ones chosen in this experiment should be carried out to obtain a more specific dependency on napl property 3 5 mechanism of napl rise from the data seen in figs 11 and 12a c it is clear that the napl rise is a function of water evaporation rate and napl viscosity and contact angle from the data it is clear that the water evaporation has to reach the napl region to cause the napl to rise yiotis et al 2003 2012 reported that during the evaporation of water from porous media water travels through the porous medium in the form of thin films along the edges of the pore spaces which is also supported from data in the present study in their work the suggested mechanism for this advection of water film is an excess capillary pressure developed due to the drying that induces the connected liquid film and sustains a constant evaporation period during drying this theory was also reported by coussot 2000 keita et al 2013 the model proposed by yiotis et al 2003 2012 uses the excess capillary pressure gravity and the evaporation rate to estimate saturation levels in porous media and further extended their theoretical treatment to develop a pore network model yiotis et al 2015 coussot 2000 keita et al 2013 proposed a similar theory while modeling it differently estimating a capillary velocity within a particular zone in the drying porous media column where the thin water films were expected to be present based on this the water evaporation is expected to generate pore vapor space at the location of the initial napl where three fluid phases water napl and air exist and the water expected to be attached to the sand particles with interfaces with air and the napl in other literature reporting the behavior of napl at the interface with water and air a spreading coefficient has been defined harkins and feldman 1922 adamson 1960 which is equal to Œ≥ aw Œ≥ nw Œ≥ an where Œ≥ aw Œ≥ nw and Œ≥ an are the interfacial tensions for air water napl water and air napl respectively if the spreading coefficient is positive the napl is expected to spread on the water film to different degrees the theory of the spreading coefficient has been applied to model the drainage of napl with water under the influence of gravity in different systems vizika et al 1996 zhou and blunt 1997 singh et al 2016 based on the reported behavior of napl and water in porous media two possible hypotheses are proposed to explain the napl rise during water evaporation the first hypothesis is based on water wetting and the spreading coefficient in this mechanism the process of water evaporation creates pore vapor resulting in the formation of a three phase region that initiates the wetting of the napl on the water film that is present in the unsaturated region upwards towards the sand air interface this mechanism therefore relies entirely on the presence of a continuous water film in the unsaturated drying zone and the napl rising between the water and air phases due to the wetting process defined by the spreading coefficient at higher rates of evaporation the time taken for the drying front to reach the napl layer is shorter and a relatively quicker formation of the three phase system resulting in earlier commencement of the napl rise the second hypothesis is that the movement of a water film during evaporation resulting in a shear stress at the napl interface causing the napl to be dragged along with the water as long as a water film of sufficient thickness exists napl rise can be sustained there is sufficient evidence in the theory of flow of immiscible fluids to support this hypothesis as well packham and shall 1971 chamkha 2000 the experimental observations presented in this study were examined with reference to the proposed hypotheses the spreading coefficients of a variety of organic materials on water air interface have been reported by takamura et al 2012 these include positive spreading coefficients for a variety of alkanes and aromatics but negative coefficients for several mineral oils of both high and low viscosity which are typically mixtures of several aliphatic compounds positive spreading coefficients were also reported for a commercial mixture of hydrocarbons oren et al 1994 vizika et al 1996 the magnitude of napl rise was observed to be a function of napl properties napl of lower viscosity and contact angle displayed higher rise different spreading coefficients for the different napls may lead to different spreading rates and consequently different magnitudes of spread shear stress at the napl water interface also is a function of the viscosity of the napl and therefore higher friction is experienced for higher viscosity napls and therefore the magnitude of rise is lower for napls with relatively higher viscosity therefore both the hypotheses seem plausible and support the observations in this study further investigation is necessary to determine the different conditions under which one of the hypotheses dominates in the present study there was difficulty in estimating the interfacial tension between the napl and water and therefore the spreading coefficients could not be estimated if the napls in this study display negative spreading coefficients then the spreading coefficient hypothesis cannot explain napl rise and the drag hypothesis seems more favorable it is therefore essential to estimate or measure the spreading coefficients for all the napls to understand their spreading behavior additional experiments can be performed to examine whether the mere presence of a three phase zone is sufficient for the napl rise or if additional movement of the water film is necessary to induce and sustain napl rise experiments in a single capillary can also be planned in order to test the hypothesis of the spreading versus drag realistic mathematical modeling of the napl rise during evaporation requires the resolution of the mechanism however simulation of the different scenarios presented in this paper may provide a better understanding of the validity of the hypotheses presented existing multiphase flow models may be applied under different scenarios to compare with experimental results one of the challenges in doing so is the coupling of the water evaporation and the napl rise dynamic changes in water and napl saturations at the pore level may be modeled by considering a boundary condition of the rate of evaporation at the air sand interface surface yiotis et al 2015 have reported a pore network model on the drying of sand to model the napl rise two different approaches representing the two different hypotheses can be examined for the spreading coefficient hypothesis the napl rise is linked to the dynamics of pore vapor generation in the three dimensional space at the pore level controlled by the water evaporation process the variation of the spreading coefficient at the pore scale may be modeled using the pore scale saturation estimation of the water evaporation model for the drag effect hypothesis fluid transport models that predict the velocities induced in an initially stationary fluid in contact with a moving film of a different fluid these models require the thicknesses of the different film at the pore scale which may be obtained from the pore network water evaporation model for effective comparison of the model and experiment higher resolution three dimensional data for the dynamic napl and water saturations in the sand is required a non invasive technique nmr mri is being explored currently to obtain data of higher spatial resolution that can offer greater insight into the pore level mechanisms 4 conclusion in this study the observation of napl mobility in sand under the influence of water evaporation from the porous media is reported significantly higher napl rise was observed compared to capillary rise without water evaporation the napl rise rate was observed to be strongly correlated to the water evaporation rate water evaporation studies reported in the literature suggest the presence of a thin moving film of water along the edges of the pores in the direction of the water evaporation this is substantiated by the experimental findings in this study as well based on reports in the literature of napl movement in unsaturated porous media two hypotheses to explain the napl rise are proposed the first hypothesis is that spreading of the napl occurs on the water films when the napl is exposed to air at the napl water air interface the pore air in this scenario is created by the evaporation the second hypothesis is that the advective velocity of the thin water film during evaporation induces movement in the napl thus dragging it during the evaporation process and causing the napl to rise from different experiments it was also observed that the napl rise rate was a function of the napl viscosity and glass contact angle typically as the viscosity or the density increases the napl rise rate decreases pore network modeling coupling the water evaporation and the napl rise hypothesis are required to further investigate the validity of either of these hypotheses pore scale water and napl saturation measurements with higher spatial resolution are required to provide a greater understanding of the process and to support the modeling process in a system such as soils the napl rise is also expected to be a function of other factors such as the amount of clay and organic carbon since clay undergoes shrinkage and swelling due to moisture content changes through drying or rewetting resulting in the change of napl mobility further experiments are currently under way to study these effects from a perspective of contaminant fate and transport the observed behavior of napl migration can have an impact on the modeling of solute transport within variably saturated soils or similar porous media that can undergo cyclic drying and rewetting the findings in this paper may also have implications on engineering methods applied to mobilize napl during the remediation of napl contaminated sites conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was partially supported by a

1681,mercury is a contaminant of global concern due to its harmful effects on human health and for the detrimental consequences of its release in the environment sources of liquid elemental mercury are usually anthropogenic such as chlor alkali plants to date insight into the infiltration behaviour of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface is lacking although this is critical for assessing both characterization and remediation approaches for mercury dnapl contaminated sites therefore in this study the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in fully and partially water saturated systems was investigated using column experiments the properties affecting the constitutive relations governing the infiltration behaviour of liquid hg0 and pce for comparison were determined using pc s experiments with different granular porous media glass beads and sands for different two and three phase configurations results showed that in water saturated porous media elemental mercury as pce acted as a non wetting fluid the required entry head for elemental mercury was higher from about 5 to 7 times however due to the almost tenfold higher density of mercury the required napl entry heads of 6 19cm and 12 51cm for mercury to infiltrate were 37 5 to 20 7 lower than for pce for the same porous media although leverett scaling was able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media it considerably underestimated hg0 infiltration capacity in comparison with the experimental results in the partially water saturated system in contrast with pce elemental mercury also acted as a nonwetting fluid therefore having to overcome an entry head to infiltrate the required hg0 entry heads 10 45 and 15 74cm were considerably higher 68 9 and 25 8 than for the water saturated porous systems furthermore in the partially water saturated systems experiments showed that elemental mercury displaced both air and water depending on the initial water distribution within the pores this indicates that the conventional wettability hierarchy in which the napl has an intermediate wetting state between the air and the water phases is not valid for liquid elemental mercury therefore for future modelling of elemental mercury dnapl infiltration behaviour in variably water saturated porous media a different formulation of the governing constitutive relations will be required keywords elemental mercury dnapl pce variably water saturated leverett scaling scaling parameters 1 introduction mercury is globally recognised for

due to the low aqueous solubility of elemental mercury of 0 07mg l eichholz et al 1988 it can act as a source of mercury contamination in soil and groundwater systems for decades davis et al 1997 combined with its high density of about 13 5kg l crc 2014 liquid elemental mercury behaves like an immiscible dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl in the subsurface although its physical properties

1998b oostrom et al 1999 wu et al 2000 oostrom et al 2003 for example elemental mercury has an 8 times higher density an almost 2 times higher viscosity and an approximately 15 times higher surface tension than pce schwille 1988 crc 2014 insight into the infiltration and flow behaviour of elemental mercury in the subsurface is critical for effective characterization and remediation approaches although in petroleum engineering liquid elemental mercury is extensively used as a nonwetting fluid for the analysis of the pore structure mercury porosimetry of geological formations under vacuum conditions wardlaw and taylor 1976 vavra et al 1992 pittman 1992 smith et al 2002 newsham et al 2004 ruth et al 2013 only recently a few studies devasena and nambi 2010 sweijen et al 2014 d aniello 2017 d aniello et al 2018 have addressed liquid hg0 infiltration behaviour in water saturated porous media under environmental conditions devasena and nambi 2010 confirmed that liquid hg0 acts as a nonwetting fluid thus requiring to overcome an entry head to infiltrate into water saturated granular porous media and that residual mercury entrapment in the two phase hg0 water system was much lower 0 04 than in the tce water 0 14 and pce water 0 17 systems they argued that this significant variation in residual saturation was probably due to the high interfacial tension of mercury with water and to its high density and viscosity and that mercury dnapl flow behaviour is governed by gravitational and capillary forces and is practically independent of viscous forces supported by field site characterization of mercury dnapl distribution sweijen et al 2014 made a first attempt for the modelling of the infiltration and distribution behaviour of elemental mercury in a sandy aquifer for water saturated conditions in particular the numerical comparison between hg0 and pce dnapls infiltration behaviour indicated that hg0 had a higher potential to penetrate to greater depths than pce a difference which was further enhanced in the presence of horizontally layered heterogeneities although these studies have shed light on the behaviour of liquid elemental mercury once it has reached the saturated zone to date however it is unclear how this behaviour compares with that in partially water saturated conditions moreover the validity of the classical constitutive relations parker et al 1987 used to describe dnapls flow behaviour as well as the scaling theory lenhard and parker 1987 is uncertain for liquid elemental mercury in both fully and partially water saturated systems to address these knowledge gaps this study aimed to evaluate the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in both fully and partially water saturated conditions for a range of ideal glass beads and natural sands porous media the constitutive relations governing hg0 dnapl infiltration behaviour were evaluated using capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments performed on these porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media three types of glass beads coarse d50 1mm medium d50 0 375mm and fine d50 0 175mm glaswarenfabrik karl hecht retsch and two different medium sands filtersand 0 2 0 5mm and silversand s60 filcom sibelco group were used as porous media table 1 the two medium sands will be referred to as medium sand 1 ms1 and medium sand 2 ms2 the particle size distribution of ms1 d50 0 39mm is wider fig 1 table 1 than ms2 d50 0 26mm and the particle sizes mainly fall in the range of 0 200 0 500mm and 0 125 0 355mm for ms1 and ms2 respectively for each granular porous medium information regarding hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability were obtained experimentally using the falling head method bear 1972 2 2 fluids demineralized water was used as the wetting fluid while laboratory grade 99 tetrachloroethylene pce acros organics and 99 9 redistilled liquid elemental mercury hg0 alfa aesar were used as the nonwetting fluids for the pc s measurements table 2 2 3 columns column experiments were performed to determine the intrinsic permeability and the pc s curves for different two and three phase systems under stable flow conditions two cylindrical columns with identical dimensions 42mm diameter by 51mm length were used one column was made of poly methyl methacrylate pmma and was used for all the experiments except those involving pce as it is wetting with respect to pmma hence to prevent preferential flow along the column wall a stainless steel column was used the two columns were closed by two caps each of them provided with a rubber ring to ensure water and air tightness the packing of the porous media was performed under water saturated conditions to avoid any presence of entrapped air within the grains the column was initially filled halfway with water and then after having thoroughly mixed the grains with water in another container the solid particles were gradually poured into it in order to maintain a fully water saturated system attention was paid to constantly ensure a water head over the top layer of the porous medium at each filling step each layer was subjected to the same degree of tamping a nylon filter with coarse mesh size was put at the inflow and outflow ports of the column to prevent loss of solid particles this filter acted as a water wet membrane and had a sufficiently coarse mesh size to not affect the measurements at the end of the packing procedure the porosity was analytically derived based on the volume and the weight of the filled column and the densities of both water and the solid particles 2 4 capillary pressure saturation measurements after filling the columns with the porous media these were used to determine the pc s retention curves fig 2 glass burettes were used to host the wetting and the nonwetting fluids and both top ports of the burettes were covered with an aluminium foil cap to prevent any liquid loss through volatilization the columns and the burettes were connected by tygon tubes while for the pce experiments they were connected using a combination of viton and teflon tubes bottom and top valves of the columns had a three way configuration which allowed the removal of any entrapped air in the tubes connecting the columns to the glass burettes valves were made of polystyrene ps exception for the bottom valve used for the pce experiments where stainless steel was used the choice of different materials for valves and connections was dictated by i the incompatibility of ps and tygon to pce and ii by the tendency of elemental mercury to adsorb to metallic surfaces such as stainless steel components in the air water experiments the column was connected at the bottom to a burette filled with water while the top of the column was left in contact with air and covered with an aluminium foil cap to prevent water loss through evaporation in the two phase napl water experiments the columns were connected at the top to a burette filled with water while at the bottom to a burette filled with napl an additional nylon filter 10Œºm mesh size of about 0 1mm thickness was inserted all around the column port mechanically sealed with the port junction and placed on the top of the porous sample as a water wet membrane to allow the flow of water and not of the napl the napl was passed from below in order to maintain a stable interface with water thus avoiding the triggering of gravity induced instability phenomena such as fingering mayer and hassanizadeh 2005 in the hg0 air water experiments the top of the column was connected to an empty burette in contact with air these three phase retention curves were determined after having obtained for each sample the drainage branch of the retention curve for the air water system hence the sample structure porosity and intrinsic permeability was the same between the two couples of experiments within each sample the air phase was continuous thus giving the possibility to determine whether hg0 was able to infiltrate into a partially water saturated porous medium or not and in particular to evaluate the head required to overcome the resistance exerted by the presence of air within the pores the drainage branch of the retention curves was explored by subjecting the columns to stepwise increments in capillary head in the air water experiments this was achieved by gradually lowering the water filled burette whereas in the other experiments by gradually elevating the napl filled burette at each step the levels in the burettes were allowed to equilibrate until no further changes were observed at each step the water saturation was calculated based on the initial water volume in the sample and the volume increments in the water filled burette only in the hg0 air water experiments the hg0 saturation was calculated at each step based on the volume decrements in the hg0 filled burette in the air water experiments the stepwise procedure was continued until the water in the bottom tube became disconnected due to the presence of air symptom that the air phase became continuous from the top to the bottom of the sample in the other experiments the procedure was continued until the breakthrough of napl from the top of the columns the experimental determinations were fitted by means of swrc fit seki 2007 adopting the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 1 s s w ir 1 s w ir s 2 s 1 Œ± h c n m where s is the wetting phase saturation sw ir is the irreducible water saturation s is the effective wetting phase saturation hc is the capillary head between nonwetting and wetting phases Œ± n and m are the van genuchten model parameters with m equal to 1 1 n n 1 since the data revealed an incremental rather than a stepwise infiltration pattern at entry head section 3 2 figs 3 9 the van genuchten mualem model was chosen as it gives the best fit of the initial branch of the drainage curves the parameters taken into account in the fitting procedure were Œ± and n whereas the irreducible water saturation was assumed to be zero due to the lack of measured data in the last branch of the pc s curves to study the effects of this assumption the pc s data were fitted again assuming the values of 0 05 and 0 10 for the irreducible water saturation as a result there was no substantial change in the van genuchten fit of the Œ± parameter with respect to the values obtained with sw ir 0 with variations ranging from the 0 23 to the 1 41 for sw ir 0 05 and from the 0 48 to the 2 88 for sw ir 0 10 moreover this assumption had no effect on the estimation of the nonwetting phase entry heads since these were determined with the graphical method sillers et al 2001 pasha et al 2015 based on the raw data appendix fig a 1 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conductivity measurements results showed that the intrinsic permeability table 3 of the glass beads decreased with decreasing particle size with small variation in porosity for the medium sands both porosity and intrinsic permeability of ms1 were slightly lower than ms2 although based on the particle size range table 1 alone ms1 would be expected to have a higher intrinsic permeability than ms2 it also has a wider particle size distribution fig 1 which negatively affects its intrinsic permeability as a consequence the resulting intrinsic permeability of ms1 and ms2 is similar 3 2 capillary pressure saturation curves the pc s curves were obtained for hg0 water in the three types of glass beads fig 3 and for ms1 and ms2 for air water samples ms1a b c and ms2a b c figs 4 and 5 pce water samples ms1d and ms2d fig 6 hg0 water samples ms1e and ms2e fig 7 and hg0 air water samples ms1c bis and ms2c bis figs 8 and 9 in figs 8 and 9 the hg0 head hn is plotted versus the nonwetting hg0 saturation sn and the total liquid saturation st for ms1 and ms2 respectively in contrast with other dnapls elemental mercury had to overcome an entry head to infiltrate and migrate into the partially water saturated samples as elemental mercury infiltrated sn increased and at a certain point the rise in the hg0 head no longer induced any increase in the total liquid saturation at this point the infiltration of mercury resulted in the expulsion of an equal volume of water from the top of the sand column and in the entrapment of discontinuous air of about the 20 of the pore volume on the basis of the experimental observations previously shown in partially water saturated porous media the hg0 infiltration is also affected by the presence of water in the pores once mercury overcomes the resistance exerted by continuous air and infiltrates within the sample it also displaces water prior to hg0 infiltration the air phase is expected to be present in higher saturations in bigger pores hence as elemental mercury infiltrates it is likely to find a preferential pathway through smaller pores mostly filled with water even though the pores are smaller elemental mercury displaces the water phase easier than air due to the lower interfacial tension with water table 2 to further enforce this the comparison of the entry heads required by mercury to infiltrate in fully and partially water saturated sands table 4 clearly shows that hg0 entry heads considerably increase in presence of air as mercury infiltration continues the air phase becomes discontinuous and entrapped within both liquid phases and most of the elemental mercury comes in contact with water at this point a further infiltration of mercury induces the displacement of an equal amount of water as shown in the last branch of the pc st curves in figs 8 and 9 until the breakthrough of hg0 in the outflow port of the column the results obtained from the pc s experiments for each two and three phase system are summarized in table 4 in table 4 sw 0 is the initial water saturation of the porous sample while he denotes the entry head required by the nonwetting phase to infiltrate into the granular porous medium 4 discussion based on the results the infiltration behaviour of hg0 in granular porous media is analysed and discussed first the results of the two and three phase pc s experiments are discussed in relation to the samples intrinsic permeability and porosity to assess the role played by porous media characteristics on hg0 infiltration behaviour then the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in water saturated systems is compared with that of pce aiming to verify the applicability of the traditional scaling theory separately for each sand type the hg0 infiltration behaviour and the scaling of its retention properties in variably water saturated systems are finally addressed 4 1 hg0 infiltration behaviour and porous media characteristics pore structure is a key aspect that affects the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury as illustrated by the correlation of entry head with intrinsic permeability fig 10 found in the two phase glass beads systems analysed a power law results in the best fit of the data thus showing a general tendency of the entry head to be higher in samples with lower intrinsic permeability but not necessarily with lower porosity tables 3 and 4 although intrinsic permeability is a bulk parameter affected by the combined inner pore structure characteristics of a porous medium it related with the more locally expressed entry head for the glass beads samples however within the small range in intrinsic permeability of the medium sand samples used the correlation did not hold despite the somewhat 11 higher intrinsic permeability of ms2 table 3 the entry head is higher than for ms1 fig 11 likely this is the result of the smaller particle size and narrow range in ms2 than ms1 fig 1 which limit the potential for locally present larger pores 4 2 leverett scaling in pce water and hg0 water systems as the fluid properties of pce and elemental mercury strongly differ table 2 their infiltration behaviour is expected to differ as well the Œ± parameter typically used for scaling purposes in numerical modelling parker et al 1987 for elemental mercury is lower than for pce table 4 and conversely the entry heads are higher if expressed in terms of water head however in terms of the respective dnapl heads pce requires to overcome an entry head of about 60 higher than hg0 for ms1 while of about 26 for ms2 this is considerably more than when assuming leverett scaling leverett 1941 to be applicable devasena and nambi 2010 neglecting the effect of the contact angle a general form of the leverett function j at a given water saturation sw is given by leverett 1941 3 j s w p c œÉ k œï where pc is the capillary pressure œÉ is the fluid pair interfacial tension k is intrinsic permeability and œï is porosity since the j sw function is a constant at a given water saturation demond and roberts 1991 eq 3 can be used to scale capillary pressures between different fluid systems therefore after simple manipulations of eq 3 the relation between hg0 and pce entry heads he can be defined as follows under the hypothesis of no flow hydrostatic pressure distribution and assuming the pore structure to be identical for the two systems as for each sand type the couples of samples studied have practically the same porosity table 4 4 h e hg h e pce œÅ pce œÅ hg œÉ hg w œÉ pce w where œÅ denotes the fluid density using the fluids properties reported in table 2 eq 4 yields that he hg 0 947 he pce and he hg 1 048 he pce with œÉhg w equal to 375dyn cm and 415dyn cm respectively hence according to leverett scaling in the first case pce should require to overcome an entry head of about 5 6 higher than hg0 to infiltrate in the same porous medium while in the latter pce entry head would be of about 4 6 lower than hg0 whereas in the first case leverett scaling is able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media although it considerably underestimates hg0 infiltration capacity in comparison with the experimental results in the latter case leverett scaling fails showing an opposite behaviour than the experimental evidence 4 3 experimental scaling parameters for pce water and hg0 water systems in fig 12 the observed pce water scaling parameters Œ≤nw defined as the ratio Œ±nw Œ±aw between the dnapl water and the three air water Œ± parameters lenhard and parker 1987 are plotted versus the samples porosity ratio œï nw œï aw the ratio between the dnapl water and the three air water samples porosity for ms1 and ms2 respectively to verify the ability of the scaling theory to cope with pce behaviour the leverett scaling parameter given as the ratio between the water surface tension œÉa w and the dnapl interfacial tension with water œÉpce w table 2 lenhard and parker 1987 calculated taking into account the non spreading behaviour of pce white et al 2004 is also plotted for ms1 the observed scaling parameters get closer to the value based on the fluid properties 1 618 with underestimations ranging from 15 to 4 5 as the porosity ratio approaches unity and the pore structure likely becomes more similar between the couples of samples analysed for ms2 instead the agreement between the experimental determinations and the leverett scaled value is definitely good with only a slight overestimation of about 1 these results show that the scaling procedure is applicable for the two phase pce water system congruently with the experimental evidence found in sands for other napls like benzene p cymene o xylene and benzyl alcohol lenhard and parker 1987 and soltrol 170 toluene and tce busby et al 1995 in particular for these studies the reported deviations between leverett and experimental scaling parameters are 12 5 2 5 8 5 1 8 15 and 5 respectively the agreement found for pce between leverett and experimental scaling parameters was less for elemental mercury fig 13 for ms2 the differences between the experimentally determined values are negligible and the deviations from the values based on the fluids properties 0 192 and 0 173 given as the ratio between the water surface tension and the hg0 interfacial tension with water œÉhg w 1 375dyn cm and œÉhg w 2 415dyn cm table 2 remain practically constant even when the porosity ratio slightly deviates from unity assuming œÉhg w 1 the leverett scaling parameter underestimates by 14 similar to the largest deviations observed in literature while in the case of œÉhg w 2 the underestimation increases by 26 in ms1 the agreement with the leverett scaled values does not improve as the porosity ratio approaches unity but rather worsens with overestimations ranging from 23 8 to 36 4 with œÉhg w 1 and from 37 to 50 9 with œÉhg w 2 the reason why this deficiency exists when using leverett scaling in the hg0 water systems analysed is yet to be clarified most likely the fluid properties of liquid mercury play a crucial role and a microscale evidence of liquid hg0 interaction with water within the pores might give further insight into this behaviour 4 4 hg0 infiltration in variably water saturated systems based on the required dnapl heads the capacity of hg0 to infiltrate in partially water saturated porous media is lower than pce and hg0 in fully water saturated systems fig 11 table 4 the elemental mercury entry head in a partially water saturated system was 5 6 higher than for pce in fully water saturated conditions for ms1 while it was practically the same of pce for ms2 for the partially water saturated ms1 sample hg0 required to overcome an entry head 68 9 higher than required in the fully water saturated counterpart also for ms2 the entry head in the partially water saturated system was higher than for the fully water saturated counterpart by 25 8 the mercury entry heads were determined at residual water saturations and it could be expected that entry heads would increase further at lower partial water contents therefore assuming leverett scaling to be applicable section 4 2 the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation namely 100 air saturation was estimated for both sands based on the measured hg0 and pce entry heads in water saturated media table 4 by substituting the elemental mercury surface tension table 2 in lieu of its interfacial tension with water in eq 4 and assuming the hg0 water and pce water systems to be the two respective references for the scaling of the hg0 air retention properties two different estimates of hg0 entry head values can be derived at zero water saturation for both sands assuming only the value of 375dyn cm for œÉhg w since it was the only one giving a sort of agreement with the experimental evidence when using leverett scaling as shown in section 4 2 this results in two estimated entry head values of fictitious completely dry ms1 and ms2 samples the leverett scaled pce water values of the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation fig 14 are 16 1 and 22 7 higher than the experimental observations for the partially water saturated samples for ms1 and ms2 respectively for the hg0 water scaled values fig 14 only the scaled entry head in ms2 is higher 2 8 than for the partially water saturated sample conversely for ms1 the scaled value of the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation is 23 4 lower nevertheless in both cases the scaled values are higher than the measured hg0 entry heads for the water saturated conditions 29 3 for the hg0 water scaled values and 96 and 54 4 for the pce water scaled values for ms1 and ms2 respectively how entry head develops in more detail with decreasing water content remains to be explored however considering the spread in the scaled estimates for the entry head at zero water saturation the entry head in the partially water saturated residual conditions is possibly already controlled by the larger air filled pores 4 5 experimental scaling parameters for hg0 air water systems in table 5 the observed hg0 air water scaling parameter Œ≤naw defined as the ratio Œ±naw Œ±aw between the hg0 air water and the air water Œ± parameter is reported together with the leverett scaled value 0 148 given as the ratio œÉa w œÉhg a between the water and the dnapl surface tensions table 2 lenhard and parker 1987 for ms1 and ms2 respectively in particular the scaling procedure is limited to the experimental set of ms1c ms1c bis and ms2c ms2c bis because the respective air water and hg0 air water pc s curves were determined on the same porous sample section 2 4 and thus on identical pore structure ideal for an accurate and reliable scaling as for the hg0 water system section 4 3 there is a poor agreement between experimental and leverett determinations for the hg0 air water system even though the pore structure is exactly the same the experimentally derived scaling parameter is 9 6 higher than the scaled value for ms1 and 28 6 higher for ms2 the deviations found in both two and three phase systems may suggest that the classical scaling theory is less able to cope with hg0 retention properties than for other napls still the order of magnitude of the experimental scaling parameters is similar to that of the determinations based solely on the fluids properties thus not excluding its application to elemental mercury dnapl among the reasons for the observed discrepancies is probably that if the porous medium is partially water saturated to a degree that allows air to be continuous within the pores the hg0 that tries to infiltrate is expected to be predominantly in contact with air however as the sample is water wet it is also in contact with water hence the leverett scaling parameter defined as the ratio of water and hg0 surface tensions may not be accurate and the effect induced by the hg0 interfacial tension with water could be relevant since liquid hg0 is in contact with both air and water different contact angles may also arise thus further influencing its flow behaviour furthermore once infiltration occurs in a partially water saturated porous medium elemental mercury displaces both air and water section 3 2 depending on the initial water distribution within the pores 5 conclusions liquid elemental mercury shows a deviating infiltration behaviour with respect to more extensively studied dnapls such as pce both theory and experiments confirmed that elemental mercury behaves as a nonwetting fluid requiring to overcome an entry head to infiltrate not only in fully but also in partially water saturated porous media as for other dnapls the pore structure of the porous medium has an important control on the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury as illustrated by the experimental correlation of entry head with intrinsic permeability for the tested glass beads samples for fully water saturated systems experimental results showed that hg0 dnapl has a higher capacity to infiltrate than pce based on the dnapl heads required although leverett scaling is able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media it considerably underestimates this behaviour in comparison with the experimental results most strikingly and in contrast with other dnapls in partially water saturated systems the capacity of hg0 dnapl to infiltrate is considerably lower than in fully water saturated systems furthermore once hg0 infiltration occurs in a partially water saturated porous medium experiments showed that elemental mercury displaces both air and water depending on the initial water distribution within the pores the results indicate that the conventional wettability hierarchy in which the napl has an intermediate wetting state between the air and the water phases is not valid for liquid elemental mercury therefore especially for future modelling a new formulation of the constitutive relations governing elemental mercury dnapl infiltration and

leads to substantial overestimations of the entry head with respect to the graphical method this is in agreement with the literature as it has been shown that 1 Œ± is only relatively related to the entry head van genuchten and nielsen 1985 therefore the 1 Œ± value was not taken into account as an indication of the entry head the brooks corey model which actually incorporates the entry head in its formulation gives values more similar to those obtained by the graphical method however since the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was chosen to fit the pc s curves

1681,mercury is a contaminant of global concern due to its harmful effects on human health and for the detrimental consequences of its release in the environment sources of liquid elemental mercury are usually anthropogenic such as chlor alkali plants to date insight into the infiltration behaviour of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface is lacking although this is critical for assessing both characterization and remediation approaches for mercury dnapl contaminated sites therefore in this study the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in fully and partially water saturated systems was investigated using column experiments the properties affecting the constitutive relations governing the infiltration behaviour of liquid hg0 and pce for comparison were determined using pc s experiments with different granular porous media glass beads and sands for different two and three phase configurations results showed that in water saturated porous media elemental mercury as pce acted as a non wetting fluid the required entry head for elemental mercury was higher from about 5 to 7 times however due to the almost tenfold higher density of mercury the required napl entry heads of 6 19cm and 12 51cm for mercury to infiltrate were 37 5 to 20 7 lower than for pce for the same porous media although leverett scaling was able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media it considerably underestimated hg0 infiltration capacity in comparison with the experimental results in the partially water saturated system in contrast with pce elemental mercury also acted as a nonwetting fluid therefore having to overcome an entry head to infiltrate the required hg0 entry heads 10 45 and 15 74cm were considerably higher 68 9 and 25 8 than for the water saturated porous systems furthermore in the partially water saturated systems experiments showed that elemental mercury displaced both air and water depending on the initial water distribution within the pores this indicates that the conventional wettability hierarchy in which the napl has an intermediate wetting state between the air and the water phases is not valid for liquid elemental mercury therefore for future modelling of elemental mercury dnapl infiltration behaviour in variably water saturated porous media a different formulation of the governing constitutive relations will be required keywords elemental mercury dnapl pce variably water saturated leverett scaling scaling parameters 1 introduction mercury is globally recognised for

combined with its high density of about 13 5kg l crc 2014 liquid elemental mercury behaves like an immiscible dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl in the subsurface although its physical properties strongly differ from more widely studied dnapls such as creosote carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce schwille 1988 busby et al 1995 hofstee et al 1998a hofstee et al 1998b oostrom et al 1999 wu et al 2000 oostrom et al 2003 for example elemental mercury has an 8 times higher density an almost 2 times higher viscosity and an approximately 15 times higher surface tension than pce schwille 1988 crc 2014 insight into the infiltration and flow behaviour of elemental mercury in the subsurface is critical for effective characterization and remediation approaches although in petroleum engineering liquid elemental mercury is extensively used as a nonwetting fluid for the analysis of the pore structure mercury porosimetry of geological formations under vacuum conditions wardlaw and taylor 1976 vavra et al 1992 pittman 1992 smith et al 2002 newsham et al 2004 ruth et al 2013 only recently a few studies devasena and nambi 2010 sweijen et al 2014 d aniello 2017 d aniello et al 2018 have addressed liquid hg0 infiltration behaviour in water saturated porous media under environmental conditions devasena and nambi 2010 confirmed that liquid hg0 acts as a nonwetting fluid thus requiring to overcome an entry head to infiltrate into water saturated granular porous media and that residual mercury entrapment in the two phase hg0 water system was much lower 0 04 than in the tce water 0 14 and pce water 0 17 systems they argued that this significant variation in residual saturation was probably due to the high interfacial tension of mercury with water and to its high density and viscosity and that mercury dnapl flow behaviour is governed by gravitational and capillary forces and is practically independent of viscous forces supported by field site characterization of mercury dnapl distribution sweijen et al 2014 made a first attempt for the modelling of the infiltration and distribution behaviour of elemental mercury in a sandy aquifer for water saturated conditions in particular the numerical comparison between hg0 and pce dnapls infiltration behaviour indicated that hg0 had a higher potential to penetrate to greater depths than pce a difference which was further enhanced in the presence of horizontally layered heterogeneities although these studies have shed light on the behaviour of liquid elemental mercury once it has reached the saturated zone to date however it is unclear how this behaviour compares with that in partially water saturated conditions moreover the validity of the classical constitutive relations parker et al 1987 used to describe dnapls flow behaviour as well as the scaling theory lenhard and parker 1987 is uncertain for liquid elemental mercury in both fully and partially water saturated systems to address these knowledge gaps this study aimed to evaluate the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in both fully and partially water saturated conditions for a range of ideal glass beads and natural sands porous media the constitutive relations governing hg0 dnapl infiltration behaviour were evaluated using capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments performed on these porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media three types of glass beads coarse d50 1mm medium d50 0 375mm and fine d50 0 175mm glaswarenfabrik karl hecht retsch and two different medium sands filtersand 0 2 0 5mm and silversand s60 filcom sibelco group were used as porous media table 1 the two medium sands will be referred to as medium sand 1 ms1 and medium sand 2 ms2 the particle size distribution of ms1 d50 0 39mm is wider fig 1 table 1 than ms2 d50 0 26mm and the particle sizes mainly fall in the range of 0 200 0 500mm and 0 125 0 355mm for ms1 and ms2 respectively for each granular porous medium information regarding hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability were obtained experimentally using the falling head method bear 1972 2 2 fluids demineralized water was used as the wetting fluid while laboratory grade 99 tetrachloroethylene pce acros organics and 99 9 redistilled liquid elemental mercury hg0 alfa aesar were used as the nonwetting fluids for the pc s measurements table 2 2 3 columns column experiments were performed to determine the intrinsic permeability and the pc s curves for different two and three phase systems under stable flow conditions two cylindrical columns with identical dimensions 42mm diameter by 51mm length were used one column was made of poly methyl methacrylate pmma and was used for all the experiments except those involving pce as it is wetting with respect to pmma hence to prevent preferential flow along the column wall a stainless steel column was used the two columns were closed by two caps each of them provided with a rubber ring to ensure water and air tightness the packing of the porous media was performed under water saturated conditions to avoid any presence of entrapped air within the grains the column was initially filled halfway with water and then after having thoroughly mixed the grains with water in another container the solid particles were gradually poured into it in order to maintain a fully water saturated system attention was paid to constantly ensure a water head over the top layer of the porous medium at each filling step each layer was subjected to the same degree of tamping a nylon filter with coarse mesh size was put at the inflow and outflow ports of the column to prevent loss of solid particles this filter acted as a water wet membrane and had a sufficiently coarse mesh size to not affect the measurements at the end of the packing procedure the porosity was analytically derived based on the volume and the weight of the filled column and the densities of both water and the solid particles 2 4 capillary pressure saturation measurements after filling the columns with the porous media these were used to determine the pc s retention curves fig 2 glass burettes were used to host the wetting and the nonwetting fluids and both top ports of the burettes were covered with an aluminium foil cap to prevent any liquid loss through volatilization the columns and the burettes were connected by tygon tubes while for the pce experiments they were connected using a combination of viton and teflon tubes bottom and top valves of the columns had a three way configuration which allowed the removal of any entrapped air in the tubes connecting the columns to the glass burettes valves were made of polystyrene ps exception for the bottom valve used for the pce experiments where stainless steel was used the choice of different materials for valves and connections was dictated by i the incompatibility of ps and tygon to pce and ii by the tendency of elemental mercury to adsorb to metallic surfaces such as stainless steel components in the air water experiments the column was connected at the bottom to a burette filled with water while the top of the column was left in contact with air and covered with an aluminium foil cap to prevent water loss through evaporation in the two phase napl water experiments the columns were connected at the top to a burette filled with water while at the bottom to a burette filled with napl an additional nylon filter 10Œºm mesh size of about 0 1mm thickness was inserted all around the column port mechanically sealed with the port junction and placed on the top of the porous sample as a water wet membrane to allow the flow of water and not of the napl the napl was passed from below in order to maintain a stable interface with water thus avoiding the triggering of gravity induced instability phenomena such as fingering mayer and hassanizadeh 2005 in the hg0 air water experiments the top of the column was connected to an empty burette in contact with air these three phase retention curves were determined after having obtained for each sample the drainage branch of the retention curve for the air water system hence the sample structure porosity and intrinsic permeability was the same between the two couples of experiments within each sample the air phase was continuous thus giving the possibility to determine whether hg0 was able to infiltrate into a partially water saturated porous medium or not and in particular to evaluate the head required to overcome the resistance exerted by the presence of air within the pores the drainage branch of the retention curves was explored by subjecting the columns to stepwise increments in capillary head in the air water experiments this was achieved by gradually lowering the water filled burette whereas in the other experiments by gradually elevating the napl filled burette at each step the levels in the burettes were allowed to equilibrate until no further changes were observed at each step the water saturation was calculated based on the initial water volume in the sample and the volume increments in the water filled burette only in the hg0 air water experiments the hg0 saturation was calculated at each step based on the volume decrements in the hg0 filled burette in the air water experiments the stepwise procedure was continued until the water in the bottom tube became disconnected due to the presence of air symptom that the air phase became continuous from the top to the bottom of the sample in the other experiments the procedure was continued until the breakthrough of napl from the top of the columns the experimental determinations were fitted by means of swrc fit seki 2007 adopting the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 1 s s w ir 1 s w ir s 2 s 1 Œ± h c n m where s is the wetting phase saturation sw ir is the irreducible water saturation s is the effective wetting phase saturation hc is the capillary head between nonwetting and wetting phases Œ± n and m are the van genuchten model parameters with m equal to 1 1 n n 1 since the data revealed an incremental rather than a stepwise infiltration pattern at entry head section 3 2 figs 3 9 the van genuchten mualem model was chosen as it gives the best fit of the initial branch of the drainage curves the parameters taken into account in the fitting procedure were Œ± and n whereas the irreducible water saturation was assumed to be zero due to the lack of measured data in the last branch of the pc s curves to study the effects of this assumption the pc s data were fitted again assuming the values of 0 05 and 0 10 for the irreducible water saturation as a result there was no substantial change in the van genuchten fit of the Œ± parameter with respect to the values obtained with sw ir 0 with variations ranging from the 0 23 to the 1 41 for sw ir 0 05 and from the 0 48 to the 2 88 for sw ir 0 10 moreover this assumption had no effect on the estimation of the nonwetting phase entry heads since these were determined with the graphical method sillers et al 2001 pasha et al 2015 based on the raw data appendix fig a 1 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conductivity measurements results showed that the intrinsic permeability table 3 of the glass beads decreased with decreasing particle size with small variation in porosity for the medium sands both porosity and intrinsic permeability of ms1 were slightly lower than ms2 although based on the particle size range table 1 alone ms1 would be expected to have a higher intrinsic permeability than ms2 it also has a wider particle size distribution fig 1 which negatively affects its intrinsic permeability as a consequence the resulting intrinsic permeability of ms1 and ms2 is similar 3 2 capillary pressure saturation curves the pc s curves were obtained for hg0 water in the three types of glass beads fig 3 and for ms1 and ms2 for air water samples ms1a b c and ms2a b c figs 4 and 5 pce water samples ms1d and ms2d fig 6 hg0 water samples ms1e and ms2e fig 7 and hg0 air water samples ms1c bis and ms2c bis figs 8 and 9 in figs 8 and 9 the hg0 head hn is plotted versus the nonwetting hg0 saturation sn and the total liquid saturation st for ms1 and ms2 respectively in contrast with other dnapls elemental mercury had to overcome an entry head to infiltrate and migrate into the partially water saturated samples as elemental mercury infiltrated sn increased and at a certain point the rise in the hg0 head no longer induced any increase in the total liquid saturation at this point the infiltration of mercury resulted in the expulsion of an equal volume of water from the top of the sand column and in the entrapment of discontinuous air of about the 20 of the pore volume on the basis of the experimental observations previously shown in partially water saturated porous media the hg0 infiltration is also affected by the presence of water in the pores once mercury overcomes the resistance exerted by continuous air and infiltrates within the sample it also displaces water prior to hg0 infiltration the air phase is expected to be present in higher saturations in bigger pores hence as elemental mercury infiltrates it is likely to find a preferential pathway through smaller pores mostly filled with water even though the pores are smaller elemental mercury displaces the water phase easier than air due to the lower interfacial tension with water table 2 to further enforce this the comparison of the entry heads required by mercury to infiltrate in fully and partially water saturated sands table 4 clearly shows that hg0 entry heads considerably increase in presence of air as mercury infiltration continues the air phase becomes discontinuous and entrapped within both liquid phases and most of the elemental mercury comes in contact with water at this point a further infiltration of mercury induces the displacement of an equal amount of water as shown in the last branch of the pc st curves in figs 8 and 9 until the breakthrough of hg0 in the outflow port of the column the results obtained from the pc s experiments for each two and three phase system are summarized in table 4 in table 4 sw 0 is the initial water saturation of the porous sample while he denotes the entry head required by the nonwetting phase to infiltrate into the granular porous medium 4 discussion based on the results the infiltration behaviour of hg0 in granular porous media is analysed and discussed first the results of the two and three phase pc s experiments are discussed in relation to the samples intrinsic permeability and porosity to assess the role played by porous media characteristics on hg0 infiltration behaviour then the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury in water saturated systems is compared with that of pce aiming to verify the applicability of the traditional scaling theory separately for each sand type the hg0 infiltration behaviour and the scaling of its retention properties in variably water saturated systems are finally addressed 4 1 hg0 infiltration behaviour and porous media characteristics pore structure is a key aspect that affects the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury as illustrated by the correlation of entry head with intrinsic permeability fig 10 found in the two phase glass beads systems analysed a power law results in the best fit of the data thus showing a general tendency of the entry head to be higher in samples with lower intrinsic permeability but not necessarily with lower porosity tables 3 and 4 although intrinsic permeability is a bulk parameter affected by the combined inner pore structure characteristics of a porous medium it related with the more locally expressed entry head for the glass beads samples however within the small range in intrinsic permeability of the medium sand samples used the correlation did not hold despite the somewhat 11 higher intrinsic permeability of ms2 table 3 the entry head is higher than for ms1 fig 11 likely this is the result of the smaller particle size and narrow range in ms2 than ms1 fig 1 which limit the potential for locally present larger pores 4 2 leverett scaling in pce water and hg0 water systems as the fluid properties of pce and elemental mercury strongly differ table 2 their infiltration behaviour is expected to differ as well the Œ± parameter typically used for scaling purposes in numerical modelling parker et al 1987 for elemental mercury is lower than for pce table 4 and conversely the entry heads are higher if expressed in terms of water head however in terms of the respective dnapl heads pce requires to overcome an entry head of about 60 higher than hg0 for ms1 while of about 26 for ms2 this is considerably more than when assuming leverett scaling leverett 1941 to be applicable devasena and nambi 2010 neglecting the effect of the contact angle a general form of the leverett function j at a given water saturation sw is given by leverett 1941 3 j s w p c œÉ k œï where pc is the capillary pressure œÉ is the fluid pair interfacial tension k is intrinsic permeability and œï is porosity since the j sw function is a constant at a given water saturation demond and roberts 1991 eq 3 can be used to scale capillary pressures between different fluid systems therefore after simple manipulations of eq 3 the relation between hg0 and pce entry heads he can be defined as follows under the hypothesis of no flow hydrostatic pressure distribution and assuming the pore structure to be identical for the two systems as for each sand type the couples of samples studied have practically the same porosity table 4 4 h e hg h e pce œÅ pce œÅ hg œÉ hg w œÉ pce w where œÅ denotes the fluid density using the fluids properties reported in table 2 eq 4 yields that he hg 0 947 he pce and he hg 1 048 he pce with œÉhg w equal to 375dyn cm and 415dyn cm respectively hence according to leverett scaling in the first case pce should require to overcome an entry head of about 5 6 higher than hg0 to infiltrate in the same porous medium while in the latter pce entry head would be of about 4 6 lower than hg0 whereas in the first case leverett scaling is able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media although it considerably underestimates hg0 infiltration capacity in comparison with the experimental results in the latter case leverett scaling fails showing an opposite behaviour than the experimental evidence 4 3 experimental scaling parameters for pce water and hg0 water systems in fig 12 the observed pce water scaling parameters Œ≤nw defined as the ratio Œ±nw Œ±aw between the dnapl water and the three air water Œ± parameters lenhard and parker 1987 are plotted versus the samples porosity ratio œï nw œï aw the ratio between the dnapl water and the three air water samples porosity for ms1 and ms2 respectively to verify the ability of the scaling theory to cope with pce behaviour the leverett scaling parameter given as the ratio between the water surface tension œÉa w and the dnapl interfacial tension with water œÉpce w table 2 lenhard and parker 1987 calculated taking into account the non spreading behaviour of pce white et al 2004 is also plotted for ms1 the observed scaling parameters get closer to the value based on the fluid properties 1 618 with underestimations ranging from 15 to 4 5 as the porosity ratio approaches unity and the pore structure likely becomes more similar between the couples of samples analysed for ms2 instead the agreement between the experimental determinations and the leverett scaled value is definitely good with only a slight overestimation of about 1 these results show that the scaling procedure is applicable for the two phase pce water system congruently with the experimental evidence found in sands for other napls like benzene p cymene o xylene and benzyl alcohol lenhard and parker 1987 and soltrol 170 toluene and tce busby et al 1995 in particular for these studies the reported deviations between leverett and experimental scaling parameters are 12 5 2 5 8 5 1 8 15 and 5 respectively the agreement found for pce between leverett and experimental scaling parameters was less for elemental mercury fig 13 for ms2 the differences between the experimentally determined values are negligible and the deviations from the values based on the fluids properties 0 192 and 0 173 given as the ratio between the water surface tension and the hg0 interfacial tension with water œÉhg w 1 375dyn cm and œÉhg w 2 415dyn cm table 2 remain practically constant even when the porosity ratio slightly deviates from unity assuming œÉhg w 1 the leverett scaling parameter underestimates by 14 similar to the largest deviations observed in literature while in the case of œÉhg w 2 the underestimation increases by 26 in ms1 the agreement with the leverett scaled values does not improve as the porosity ratio approaches unity but rather worsens with overestimations ranging from 23 8 to 36 4 with œÉhg w 1 and from 37 to 50 9 with œÉhg w 2 the reason why this deficiency exists when using leverett scaling in the hg0 water systems analysed is yet to be clarified most likely the fluid properties of liquid mercury play a crucial role and a microscale evidence of liquid hg0 interaction with water within the pores might give further insight into this behaviour 4 4 hg0 infiltration in variably water saturated systems based on the required dnapl heads the capacity of hg0 to infiltrate in partially water saturated porous media is lower than pce and hg0 in fully water saturated systems fig 11 table 4 the elemental mercury entry head in a partially water saturated system was 5 6 higher than for pce in fully water saturated conditions for ms1 while it was practically the same of pce for ms2 for the partially water saturated ms1 sample hg0 required to overcome an entry head 68 9 higher than required in the fully water saturated counterpart also for ms2 the entry head in the partially water saturated system was higher than for the fully water saturated counterpart by 25 8 the mercury entry heads were determined at residual water saturations and it could be expected that entry heads would increase further at lower partial water contents therefore assuming leverett scaling to be applicable section 4 2 the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation namely 100 air saturation was estimated for both sands based on the measured hg0 and pce entry heads in water saturated media table 4 by substituting the elemental mercury surface tension table 2 in lieu of its interfacial tension with water in eq 4 and assuming the hg0 water and pce water systems to be the two respective references for the scaling of the hg0 air retention properties two different estimates of hg0 entry head values can be derived at zero water saturation for both sands assuming only the value of 375dyn cm for œÉhg w since it was the only one giving a sort of agreement with the experimental evidence when using leverett scaling as shown in section 4 2 this results in two estimated entry head values of fictitious completely dry ms1 and ms2 samples the leverett scaled pce water values of the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation fig 14 are 16 1 and 22 7 higher than the experimental observations for the partially water saturated samples for ms1 and ms2 respectively for the hg0 water scaled values fig 14 only the scaled entry head in ms2 is higher 2 8 than for the partially water saturated sample conversely for ms1 the scaled value of the hg0 entry head at zero water saturation is 23 4 lower nevertheless in both cases the scaled values are higher than the measured hg0 entry heads for the water saturated conditions 29 3 for the hg0 water scaled values and 96 and 54 4 for the pce water scaled values for ms1 and ms2 respectively how entry head develops in more detail with decreasing water content remains to be explored however considering the spread in the scaled estimates for the entry head at zero water saturation the entry head in the partially water saturated residual conditions is possibly already controlled by the larger air filled pores 4 5 experimental scaling parameters for hg0 air water systems in table 5 the observed hg0 air water scaling parameter Œ≤naw defined as the ratio Œ±naw Œ±aw between the hg0 air water and the air water Œ± parameter is reported together with the leverett scaled value 0 148 given as the ratio œÉa w œÉhg a between the water and the dnapl surface tensions table 2 lenhard and parker 1987 for ms1 and ms2 respectively in particular the scaling procedure is limited to the experimental set of ms1c ms1c bis and ms2c ms2c bis because the respective air water and hg0 air water pc s curves were determined on the same porous sample section 2 4 and thus on identical pore structure ideal for an accurate and reliable scaling as for the hg0 water system section 4 3 there is a poor agreement between experimental and leverett determinations for the hg0 air water system even though the pore structure is exactly the same the experimentally derived scaling parameter is 9 6 higher than the scaled value for ms1 and 28 6 higher for ms2 the deviations found in both two and three phase systems may suggest that the classical scaling theory is less able to cope with hg0 retention properties than for other napls still the order of magnitude of the experimental scaling parameters is similar to that of the determinations based solely on the fluids properties thus not excluding its application to elemental mercury dnapl among the reasons for the observed discrepancies is probably that if the porous medium is partially water saturated to a degree that allows air to be continuous within the pores the hg0 that tries to infiltrate is expected to be predominantly in contact with air however as the sample is water wet it is also in contact with water hence the leverett scaling parameter defined as the ratio of water and hg0 surface tensions may not be accurate and the effect induced by the hg0 interfacial tension with water could be relevant since liquid hg0 is in contact with both air and water different contact angles may also arise thus further influencing its flow behaviour furthermore once infiltration occurs in a partially water saturated porous medium elemental mercury displaces both air and water section 3 2 depending on the initial water distribution within the pores 5 conclusions liquid elemental mercury shows a deviating infiltration behaviour with respect to more extensively studied dnapls such as pce both theory and experiments confirmed that elemental mercury behaves as a nonwetting fluid requiring to overcome an entry head to infiltrate not only in fully but also in partially water saturated porous media as for other dnapls the pore structure of the porous medium has an important control on the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury as illustrated by the experimental correlation of entry head with intrinsic permeability for the tested glass beads samples for fully water saturated systems experimental results showed that hg0 dnapl has a higher capacity to infiltrate than pce based on the dnapl heads required although leverett scaling is able to reproduce the natural tendency of hg0 to be more prone than pce to infiltrate in water saturated porous media it considerably underestimates this behaviour in comparison with the experimental results most strikingly and in contrast with other dnapls in partially water saturated systems the capacity of hg0 dnapl to infiltrate is considerably lower than in fully water saturated systems furthermore once hg0 infiltration occurs in a partially water saturated porous medium experiments showed that elemental mercury displaces both air and water depending on the initial water distribution within the pores the results indicate that the conventional wettability hierarchy in which the napl has an intermediate wetting state between the air and the water phases is not valid for liquid elemental mercury therefore especially for future modelling a new formulation of the constitutive relations governing elemental mercury dnapl infiltration and flow behaviour in variably water saturated porous media is required acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the p o r campania fse 2007 2013 2014 2020 appendix a appendix a 1 the

1682,hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a well stimulation technique used to extract resources from a low permeability formation currently the most common application of fracking is for the extraction of oil and gas from shale during the operation a large volume of brine rich in hazardous chemicals is produced spills of brine from wells or pits might negatively impact underground water resources and in particular one of the major concerns is the migration of radionuclides such as radium ra2 into the shallow subsurface however the transport behaviour of ra2 through a reactive porous medium under conditions typical of a brine i e high salinity is not well understood yet here a study on the transport behaviour of barium ba2 congener of radium through a porous medium containing a common mineral such as goethite feo oh is presented batch and column flood tests were carried out at conditions resembling the produced brine i e large values of ionic strength i namely 1 to 3mol kg the measurements were described with the triple layer surface complexation model coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method and a reactive transport model in the case of the transport tests the experimental results show that the adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh increases with ph but decreases with i and it becomes negligible at the brine conditions moreover even if isotherms show adsorption at large i at the same conditions during transport ba2 travels without retardation through the feo oh porous medium the triple layer model agrees very well with all batch data but it does not describe well the transport tests in all cases in particular the model cannot match the ph measurements at large i values this suggests that the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface do not capture the mechanism of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh at large salinity finally this study suggests that barium and potentially its congeners namely radium calcium magnesium and strontium may travel at the average flow velocity through a soil where the dominant reactive mineral is goethite graphical abstract keywords barium brine fracking hydraulic fracturing salinity transport in porous media msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a well stimulation technique used to maximize the extraction of underground resources such as oil natural gas geothermal energy and water from low permeability formations in recent years fracking technology has become widespread particularly for the production of oil and gas from unconventional shale formations for the extraction wells may be drilled to a depth of 1 500 4 500m and in lateral sections may extend 300 2000m away from the well the injected fluids are commonly made up of water sand and chemical additives such as surfactants chelating agents and biocides fracfocus 2017 which are pumped at high pressure into the geologic formations recovered fracturing fluids are referred to as flowback and produced water overall drilling and fracking require approximately 2 4 million gallons of water per well i e 8 000 15 000m3 per year scanlon et al 2017 however only a fraction of 10 80 of the injected fluid returns to the surface again at relatively high flow rates and relatively high in total dissolved solids tds bi et al 2016 after few weeks the flow of water decreases significantly and the tds increases sharply this subsequent stream is known as produced water and will continue to flow to the surface over the entire lifetime of the well thiel and lienhard 2014 api 2015 flowback and produced water are both enriched with materials from the shale formation such as brines hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials with the latter having the greater concentration of formation materials the produced water generated during the production of unconventional gas from onshore activities was estimated to be approximately 3268 millionm3 in 2012 veil 2015 as an example the average composition of produced water from fracking in the marcellus shale pennsylvania which is by far the largest and the best documented shale gas resource in the united states is shown in fig 1 with seawater for comparison the figure reports in detail the concentrations of inorganic compounds however organic molecules are also present in the flowback and produced water primarily due to the composition of the fracturing fluids their concentration is within the micro molal range and their effect on the inorganic ion speciation and interaction is negligible thiel and lienhard 2014 kharaka and hanor 2013 the salinity of produced water given as total dissolved solids tds can be as high as 10 times the tds of seawater resulting in an ionic strength i between 1 and 4mol kg the produced water was found to have the highest concentration of calcium ca2 barium ba2 magnesium mg2 sodium na strontium sr2 and radium ra2 namely 226ra and 228ra the radionuclide such as radium makes the water a potential hazard in the case of a spill flowback and produced water leaks have been documented at locations in the u s such as at sites in colorado new mexico north dakota and pennsylvania patterson et al 2017 between 2005 and 2014 reported spills ranged from the hundreds to the thousands of cubic meters of flowback and produced water these spills usually occurred during storage in tanks and pits and when moving the fluids via flowlines upon a spill the fluid may migrate towards the shallow aquifers and potentially contaminate it to identify the level of risk the prediction of the transport of the major hazardous compounds in the flowback and produced water is required at this aim of particular interest is the understanding of the transport of radium because of its relatively long half life and high radiotoxicity especially 226ra zhang et al 2015 rowan et al 2011 kirby et al 1964 radium is an alkaline earth metal the sixth element in the group ii of the periodic table and it is a radioactive isotope part of the decay chains of u isotopes rowan et al 2011 kirby et al 1964 its physical and chemical properties congener resemble ba2 which is generally used as a proxy in laboratory experiments instead of ra2 because of its less hazardous properties major processes affecting solute transport in subsurface permeable rocks are adsorption and desorption onto and from the reactive surface of the minerals coating the grains of the porous medium iron oxides such as goethite feo oh are among the most common minerals in the subsurface and they are present often as coating on rocks mishra and tiwary 1999 iron oxides are also very reactive towards ra2 and have been proposed as based sorbents for coagulants in uranium mining water treatment chellam and clifford 2002 earlier studies bassot et al 2001 sverjensky 2005 sajih et al 2014 have been carried out to investigate the adsorption of ra2 or ba2 as a function of ph and for i up to approximately 0 1mol kg the results from these studies show negligible effect of the ionic strength on the cations transport hayes 1987 however experimental data are not available at conditions typical of flowback and produced water i e for i between 1 and 3mol kg thiel and lienhard 2014 moreover at the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies where the transport of ba2 has been investigated systematically at various ph and ionic strength in this paper a study on the transport behaviour of ba2 through a porous medium containing feo oh is presented experiments in batch and with a column flood system were carried out under various conditions of ph i and temperature the experiments were described with the triple layer surface complexation model coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method and a reactive transport model in the case of the transport tests the paper is divided into four sections in section 2 the materials and the methods used and applied during the experiments are described in section 3 the model implemented to describe the adsorption desorption of ba2 in batch and during transport through the reactive porous medium is explained in section 4 the results and their comparison with the model are

analyzed for ba2 and na using the icp oes 3 modeling 3 1 surface complexation model a triple layer model tlm davis and leckie 1978 1980 was implemented to describe the adsorption of ba2 as a function

and a value of z t equal to 1 10 2 mol kg was assumed results in parts a through d of the figure show that the difference between the concentration and the activity of barium increases with i as expected becoming significant above 1mol kg of nacl moreover in all cases the diagrams show that the concentration of the surface complex soba decreases above ph7 while sobaoh becomes the dominant surface complex therefore in the surface complexation model reactions for the adsorption of both free barium ba2 and of barium hydroxide aqueous complex baoh were considered 3 2 transport model one dimensional 1d ph dependent transport of ba2 through a reactive porous medium containing feo oh was developed assuming incompressible fluid and isothermal conditions 18 c b z b t v c b x d 2 c b x 2 0

and solved using the pitzer activity coefficient method to account for the effect of the large ionic strength values present in this work 4 results and discussion 4 1 batch adsorption fig 4 shows the experimental data with the best fit for of batch tests of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh coated beads at nacl concentration between 0 and 3mol kg and at 25 and 65 c the error bar of the data points corresponds to the calculated error which ranges between 5 and 40 0 in this figure z b is the amount of ba2 adsorbed onto feo oh mol kg the results show that the adsorption becomes significant above ph5 and 6 at correspondingly 25 and 65 c moreover they indicate that adsorbed concentration decreases with the background electrolyte reaching negligible values at 3mol kg of nacl at both investigated temperatures these results agree with the observations by sajih et al 2014 where ba2 adsorption onto feo oh was tested up to 0 1mol kg but comparing our study with the earlier work by hayes 1987 it is possible to notice that here a much more significant effect of the background electrolyte on barium adsorption is observed the model parameters used in the tlm namely k 1 through k 5 c1 and c2 were equal to 105 8 10 11 1 10 5 1 10 11 0 82 10 8 0 1 1f cm2 and 0 2f cm2 correspondingly these values agree with the estimates in hayes 1987 expect for the equilibrium constant of reaction 7 i e k 4 that was adjusted within the indicated interval of an order of magnitude i e 10 0 82 the value of z t and a were estimated to be respectively 0 5mol kg and 2 19 1 12 m2 kg with the latter resembling the measured value of 1 096m2 kg the mass of reactive solid was fixed at 1g further details about the implemented model and the fitting of the data are reported in the supporting information document 4 2 transport a summary of the conditions applied during the column flood experiments is given in table 1 here the ph values of the initial and injected solutions are listed together with the injected concentrations of ba2 and nacl the measured n the estimated v and d and the calculated saturation index si with respect to witherite baco3 the values of v and d were determined by fitting a front of na with the analytic solution of the 1d advection dispersion equation fetter 1993 under conditions where no na adsorption onto the porous medium surface was expected details in the supporting information document the concentration of the background electrolyte was increased up to the value at which no retardation r m s for the barium front was observed with r given by 21 r v 1 z b c b figs 5 and 6 report the measurements with the model of the transport tests listed in table 1 in these experiments the column was initially stabilized with a solution without ba2 at ph5 and then a second solution was injected which contained a known concentration of ba2 a ph approximately equal to 7 or 8 and a selected concentration of nacl once the system reached equilibrium and the injected ba2 concentration was equal to the ba2 concentration at the outlet the initial solution was again injected in this way the concentration fronts due to adsorption and desorption processes could be determined fig 5 shows the data from the experiments performed at injected ph 7 in this figure the concentrations are given as a function of pore volume injected pv qt narl where ar is the cross sectional area of the column here it is possible to see that as the concentration of nacl increases to 0 1mol kg parts d through f of the figure the retardation of ba2 becomes negligible as it breakthroughs the column at 1 pv this is because negligible adsorption of ba2 occurs at that injected condition allowing the cation to travel at the average flow velocity this behaviour was however unexpected because batch measurements reported in fig 4 a show indeed adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh at the ph and nacl concentration of the injected solution during the transport experiment this type of response to the increase of nacl concentration was also observed in the experiments carried out injecting a second solution of ph approximately 8 in these experiments shown in fig 6 as nacl concentration equals 0 1mol kg the retardation of ba2 becomes negligible indicating that no significant adsorption of ba2 onto the reactive porous medium is occurring similarly to the previous tests this behaviour was unexpected as in the batch measurement performed at the condition of the injected solution fig 4 a adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh was still significant discrepancy between batch and column experiments has been already observed in previous works indrek et al 2000 bajracharya et al 1996 to investigate the difference in the adsorption behaviour of ba2 onto feo oh in batch and during transport would require tests where the same solid is used and systematically e g the solid solution ratio the flow rate and the porosity are modified however this was not the scope of the work presented here figs 5 and 6 show the simulations results upon inversion of the model on the transport data here it is important to highlight that for the fitting of the measurements only z t and a were changed while all the other parameters were kept constant at the values estimated from the batch tests the optimal mean values of z t and a with their uncertainty are respectively 0 12 0 18mol kg and 4 00 2 30m2 kg overall the model agrees well with the measurements and allows to capture the behaviour of ba2 transport through the reactive porous medium however the model fails to capture the evolution of the ph in most of the cases during the desorption process in particular this occurs when the largest nacl concentrations were applied parts d through f of fig 5 and in the parts j through l of fig 6 this may suggest that the tlm as it is formulated in the literature hayes 1987 sverjensky 2005 and applied here does not capture the mechanism of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh at large salinity and may be need to be extended in order to include missing reaction mechanisms the formulation of the tlm proposed by sverjensky 2006 and recently applied by sajih et al 2014 was also considered and implemented results not shown here but the model could not capture the evolution of the concentration fronts in particular for ba2 and h finally fig 7 summarizes the results and illustrates the effect of i on the ba2 front in the early phase of the adsorption process here it is possible to see that as the nacl concentration increases from 0 to 1mol kg the value of the pv at which the cation breakthroughs decreases from 10 to 2pv this indicates that the concentration of nacl has a significant effect on ba2 transport 4 3 simulations of radium transport and comparison with barium simulations of ra2 through a porous medium containing feo oh were performed to predict the behaviour of the radionuclide under the same conditions tested for ba2 following bassot et al 2001 the chemical reactions of ra2 adsorption onto feo oh were assumed equal to reactions 5 and 7 with intrinsic equilibrium constants namely k 3 ra and k 4 ra equal to 10 3 5 and 10 10 95 respectively and values of capacitance namely c 1 and c 2 equal to 3 and 0 2f m2 respectively in particular in order to match the data from the literature bassot et al 2001 sajih et al 2014 with our model the value of the second c 1 was adjusted the details and the results of this optimization are reported in section 8 of the supporting information document the results of the 1d transport simulations are reported in fig 8 and the ra2 profiles are compared with barium fronts to highlight the different behaviour here the conditions applied are as in the calculations run for fig 7 it is possible to notice that in the absence of nacl ra2 is more retarded than ba2 and as the salt concentration increases the two cations behave similarly and they breakthrough between 1 and 2pv traveling with negligible retardation or even none 5 conclusion in this work batch and transport experiments were performed to investigate ba2 adsorption behaviour at various ph ionic strength and temperature batch experiments show that the adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh increases with ph and decreases with nacl concentration which changed from 0 to 3mol kg contrarily no significant variation in ba2 adsorption behaviour was observed between 25 c and 65 c transport experiments show that the retardation of ba2 decreases with nacl concentration reaching the value of 1 pv for nacl concentration 1mol kg all experiments were described with a triple layer surface complexation model coupled with pitzer activity coefficients method and with a transport model in the case of column flood tests the model agrees well with both batch and transport measurements but fails to capture the ph fronts measured during the transport tests at high nacl concentration the transport of ra2 through the porous medium containing feo oh was simulated calculations show that the transport of ra2 is affected by the change in ionic strength which agree with the ba2 experimental and simulation results finally this study shows that i may have a significant effect on the migration of barium and radium through reactive porous medium made of goethite this may imply that their congeners i e calcium magnesium and strontium may travel at the average flow velocity through a soil where the dominant reactive mineral is iron oxide acknowledgments this research project used microscope resources partially funded by the national science

1682,hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a well stimulation technique used to extract resources from a low permeability formation currently the most common application of fracking is for the extraction of oil and gas from shale during the operation a large volume of brine rich in hazardous chemicals is produced spills of brine from wells or pits might negatively impact underground water resources and in particular one of the major concerns is the migration of radionuclides such as radium ra2 into the shallow subsurface however the transport behaviour of ra2 through a reactive porous medium under conditions typical of a brine i e high salinity is not well understood yet here a study on the transport behaviour of barium ba2 congener of radium through a porous medium containing a common mineral such as goethite feo oh is presented batch and column flood tests were carried out at conditions resembling the produced brine i e large values of ionic strength i namely 1 to 3mol kg the measurements were described with the triple layer surface complexation model coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method and a reactive transport model in the case of the transport tests the experimental results show that the adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh increases with ph but decreases with i and it becomes negligible at the brine conditions moreover even if isotherms show adsorption at large i at the same conditions during transport ba2 travels without retardation through the feo oh porous medium the triple layer model agrees very well with all batch data but it does not describe well the transport tests in all cases in particular the model cannot match the ph measurements at large i values this suggests that the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface do not capture the mechanism of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh at large salinity finally this study suggests that barium and potentially its congeners namely radium calcium magnesium and strontium may travel at the average flow velocity through a soil where the dominant reactive mineral is goethite graphical abstract keywords barium brine fracking hydraulic fracturing salinity transport in porous media msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a well stimulation technique used to maximize the extraction of underground resources such as oil natural gas geothermal energy and water from low permeability formations in recent years fracking technology has become widespread particularly for the production of oil and gas from unconventional shale formations for the extraction wells may be drilled to a depth of 1 500 4 500m and in lateral sections may extend 300 2000m away from the well the injected fluids are commonly made up of water sand and chemical additives such as surfactants chelating agents and biocides fracfocus 2017 which are pumped at high pressure into the geologic formations recovered fracturing fluids are referred to as flowback and produced water overall drilling and fracking require approximately 2 4 million gallons of water per well i e 8 000 15 000m3 per year scanlon et al 2017 however only a fraction of 10 80 of the injected fluid returns to the surface again at relatively high flow rates and relatively high in total dissolved solids tds bi et al 2016 after few weeks the flow of water decreases significantly and the tds increases sharply this subsequent stream is known as produced water and will continue to flow to the surface over the entire lifetime of the well thiel and lienhard 2014 api 2015 flowback and produced water are both enriched with materials from the shale formation such as brines hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials with the latter having the greater concentration of formation materials the produced water generated during the production of unconventional gas from onshore activities was estimated to be approximately 3268 millionm3 in 2012 veil 2015 as an example the average composition of produced water from fracking in the marcellus shale pennsylvania which is by far the largest and the best documented shale gas resource in the united states is shown in fig 1 with seawater for comparison the figure reports in detail the concentrations of inorganic compounds however organic molecules are also present in the flowback and produced water primarily due to the composition of the fracturing fluids their concentration is within the micro molal range and their effect on the inorganic ion speciation and interaction is negligible thiel and lienhard 2014 kharaka and hanor 2013 the salinity of produced water given as total dissolved solids tds can be as high as 10 times the tds of seawater resulting in an ionic strength i between 1 and 4mol kg the produced water was found to have the highest concentration of calcium ca2 barium ba2 magnesium mg2 sodium na strontium sr2 and radium ra2 namely 226ra and 228ra the radionuclide such as radium makes the water a potential hazard in the case of a spill flowback and produced water leaks have been documented at locations in the u s such as at sites in colorado new mexico north dakota and pennsylvania patterson et al 2017 between 2005 and 2014 reported spills ranged from the hundreds to the thousands of cubic meters of flowback and produced water these spills usually occurred during storage in tanks and pits and when moving the fluids via flowlines upon a spill the fluid may migrate towards the shallow aquifers and potentially contaminate it to identify the level of risk the prediction of the transport of the major hazardous compounds in the flowback and produced water is required at this aim of particular interest is the understanding of the transport of radium because of its relatively long half life and high radiotoxicity especially 226ra zhang et al 2015 rowan et al 2011 kirby et al 1964 radium is an alkaline earth metal the sixth element in the group ii of the periodic table and it is a radioactive isotope part of the decay chains of u isotopes rowan et al 2011 kirby et al 1964 its physical and chemical properties congener resemble ba2 which is generally used as a proxy in laboratory experiments instead of ra2 because of its less hazardous properties major processes affecting solute transport in subsurface permeable rocks are adsorption and desorption onto and from the reactive surface of the minerals coating the grains of the porous medium iron oxides such as goethite feo oh are among the most common minerals in the subsurface and they are present often as coating on rocks mishra and tiwary 1999 iron oxides are also very reactive towards ra2 and have been proposed as based sorbents for coagulants in uranium mining water treatment chellam and clifford 2002 earlier studies bassot et al 2001 sverjensky 2005 sajih et al 2014 have been carried out to investigate the adsorption of ra2 or ba2 as a function of ph and for i up to approximately 0 1mol kg the results from these studies show negligible effect of the ionic strength on the cations transport hayes 1987 however experimental data are not available at conditions typical of flowback and produced water i e for i between 1 and 3mol kg thiel and lienhard 2014 moreover at the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies where the transport of ba2 has been investigated systematically at various ph and ionic strength in this paper a study on the transport behaviour of ba2 through a porous medium containing feo oh is presented experiments in batch and with a column flood system were carried out under various conditions of ph i and temperature the experiments were described with the triple layer surface complexation model coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method and a reactive transport model in the case of the transport tests the paper is divided into four sections in section 2 the materials and the methods used and applied during the experiments are described in section 3 the model implemented to describe the adsorption desorption of ba2 in batch and during transport through the reactive porous medium is explained in section 4 the results and their comparison with the model are shown and discussed and simulations of radium transport are reported finally in section 5 the conclusions are drawn 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of goethite goethite was prepared following atkinson 1967 a mass of 50g of fe no3 3 9h2o 98 0 to 101 0 purity fisher scientific u s a was added to 825ml of deionized water a volume of 200ml of 2 5n koh fisher scientific u s a was added to the previous solution and aged at 60 c for 24hours afterwards the feo oh suspension was purified through dialysis using a cellulose tube the tube with the feo oh suspension was immersed in deionized water and the water was changed twice a day until the nitrate no 3 concentration became less than 10 4 mol kg then a sample of suspension of approximately of 5ml in volume was dried at 105 c for 24hours for characterization as explained below whereas the rest of the feo oh suspension was stored in polythene bottles to be used as a coating for glass beads 2 2 coating the glass beads with synthesized feo

shows a very good agreement of the x ray measurement from this work and the reference peaks from the literature krehula et al 2016 the thickness and the uniformity of feo oh coated beads was measured using scanning electron microscope focused ion beam sem fib an uniform coating of approximately 8Œºm of thickness was observed as shown in parts b and c of fig 2 brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area was measured using a quantachrome instrument version 11 0 u s a and it resulted to be 1 096m2 g of coated beads 2 4 sorption experiments batch experiments were performed to determine the adsorption isotherm of ba2 and protons h at different values of ph i and temperature t c the concentration of ba2 was selected in order to maintain the aqueous solution unsaturated with respect to any solid phase under the investigated conditions the values of the saturation index si were calculated using phreeqc v 3 u s g s 2016 with the pitzer database upon these calculations the selected concentration of ba2 was 3 64 10 5 mol kg the solid phase with the largest si was witherite baco3 and the maximum si value was equal to 1 35 see table 1 during the adsorption tests a mass of 1g of feo oh coated beads was added to a 20ml solution of deionized water containing ba2 and sodium chloride nacl at concentration of 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 and 3 0mol kg and at temperatures of 25 and 65 c initially the suspension of fe oh coated beads with a selected concentration of nacl was adjusted to the designed ph using either hydrochloric acid hcl fisher chemical u s a or sodium hydroxide naoh fisher chemical u s a once the ph reached the desired value a known amount of ba2 was added the overall suspension was then mixed for 24hours using a tube rotator fisher scientific u s a and the ph was measured again after that time finally the concentration of ba2 and sodium na were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes model 5100 icp oes agilent technologies u s a 2 5 transport experiments column flood experiments were performed to investigate the transport behaviour of ba2 under different values of ph and i a column of 15mm of diameter and 200mm of length was used flexcolumn u s a was filled with feo oh coated beads and then stabilized using a solution of deionized water with ph equal to 5 representing a condition of a slightly acidic uncontaminated shallow aquifer appelo and postma 2005 the ph of the inlet and the outlet streams was monitored continuously with two in line ph meter sensors connected to a computer through a datalogger liquiline cm442 endress hauser u s a once the ph of the outlet stream stabilized at the ph of the injected solution a solution containing 3 64 10 5 m of ba2 was injected at a constant flow rate of 1ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s u s a during the tests samples were collected in 5ml vials using a fraction collector ge healthcare life sciences mod frac 920 u s a and then analyzed for ba2 and na using the icp oes 3 modeling 3 1 surface complexation model a triple layer model tlm davis and leckie 1978 1980 was implemented to describe the adsorption of ba2 as a function

fig 1 in the supporting information document as expected the difference in the activity values of the aqueous species calculated with the two methods increases with i this is because the debye h√ºckel activity coefficient method does not account for the short range interactions in the presence of a solvent between the solute particles which become important at large i helgeson 1969 such short range interactions are instead accounted for in the pitzer activity coefficient method therefore the latter was selected to carry out all chemical calculations in this work finally fig 3 shows the results of the surface complexation calculations for feo oh at atmospheric condition including the concentration of free ba2 in these simulations an initial concentration of ba2 of 3 64 10 5 mol kg was used and a value of z t equal to 1 10 2 mol kg was assumed results in parts a through d of the figure show that the difference between the concentration and the activity of barium increases with i as expected becoming significant above 1mol kg of nacl moreover in all cases the diagrams show that the concentration of the surface complex soba decreases above ph7 while sobaoh becomes the dominant surface complex therefore in the surface complexation model reactions for the adsorption of both free barium ba2 and of barium hydroxide aqueous complex baoh were considered 3 2 transport model one

and solved using the pitzer activity coefficient method to account for the effect of the large ionic strength values present in this work 4 results and discussion 4 1 batch adsorption fig 4 shows the experimental data with the best fit for of batch tests of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh coated beads at nacl concentration between 0 and 3mol kg and at 25 and 65 c the error bar of the data points corresponds to the calculated error which ranges between 5 and 40 0 in this figure z b is the amount of ba2 adsorbed onto feo oh mol kg the results show that the adsorption becomes significant above ph5 and 6 at correspondingly 25 and 65 c moreover they indicate that adsorbed concentration decreases with the background electrolyte reaching negligible values at 3mol kg of nacl at both investigated temperatures these results agree with the observations by sajih et al 2014 where ba2 adsorption onto feo oh was tested up to 0 1mol kg but comparing our study with the earlier work by hayes 1987 it is possible to notice that here a much more significant effect of the background electrolyte on barium adsorption is observed the model parameters used in the tlm namely k 1 through k 5 c1 and c2 were equal to 105 8 10 11 1 10 5 1 10 11 0 82 10 8 0 1 1f cm2 and 0 2f cm2 correspondingly these values agree with the estimates in hayes 1987 expect for the equilibrium constant of reaction 7 i e k 4 that was adjusted within the indicated interval of an order of magnitude i e 10 0 82 the value of z t and a were estimated to be respectively 0 5mol kg and 2 19 1 12 m2 kg with the latter resembling the measured value of 1 096m2 kg the mass of reactive solid was fixed at 1g further details about the implemented model and the fitting of the data are reported in the supporting information document 4 2 transport a summary of the conditions applied during the column flood experiments is given in table 1 here the ph values of the initial and injected solutions are listed together with the injected

information document the concentration of the background electrolyte was increased up to the value at which no retardation r m s for the barium front was observed with r given by 21 r v 1 z b c b figs 5 and 6 report the measurements with the model of the transport tests listed in table 1 in these experiments the column was initially stabilized with a solution without ba2 at ph5 and then a second solution was injected which contained a known concentration of ba2 a ph approximately equal to 7 or 8 and a selected concentration of nacl once the system reached equilibrium and the injected ba2 concentration was equal to the ba2 concentration at the outlet the initial solution was again injected in this way the concentration fronts due to adsorption and desorption processes could be determined fig 5 shows the data from the experiments performed at injected ph 7 in this figure the concentrations are given as a function of pore volume injected pv qt narl where ar is the cross sectional area of the column here it is possible to see that as the concentration of nacl increases to 0 1mol kg parts d through f of the figure the retardation of ba2 becomes negligible as it breakthroughs the column at 1 pv this is because negligible adsorption of ba2 occurs at that injected condition allowing the cation to travel at the average flow velocity this behaviour was however unexpected because batch measurements reported in fig 4 a show indeed adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh at the ph and nacl concentration of the injected solution during the transport experiment this type of response to the increase of nacl concentration was also observed in the experiments carried out injecting a second solution of ph approximately 8 in these experiments shown in fig 6 as nacl concentration equals 0 1mol kg the retardation of ba2 becomes negligible indicating that no significant adsorption of ba2 onto the reactive porous medium is occurring similarly to the previous tests this behaviour was unexpected as in the batch measurement performed at the condition of the injected solution fig 4 a adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh was still significant discrepancy between batch and column experiments has been already observed in previous works indrek et al 2000 bajracharya et al 1996 to investigate the difference in the adsorption behaviour of ba2 onto feo oh in batch and during transport would require tests where the same solid is used and systematically e g the solid solution ratio the flow rate and the porosity are modified however this was not the scope of the work presented here figs 5 and 6 show the simulations results upon inversion of the model on the transport data here it is important to highlight that for the fitting of the measurements only z t and a were changed while all the other parameters were kept constant at the values estimated from the batch tests the optimal mean values of z t and a with their uncertainty are respectively 0 12 0 18mol kg and 4 00 2 30m2 kg overall the model agrees well with the measurements and allows to capture the behaviour of ba2 transport through the reactive porous medium however the model fails to capture the evolution of the ph in most of the cases during the desorption process in particular this occurs when the largest nacl concentrations were applied parts d through f of fig 5 and in the parts j through l of fig 6 this may suggest that the tlm as it is formulated in the literature hayes 1987 sverjensky 2005 and applied here does not capture the mechanism of ba2 adsorption onto feo oh at large salinity and may be need to be extended in order to include missing reaction mechanisms the formulation of the tlm proposed by sverjensky 2006 and recently applied by sajih et al 2014 was also considered and implemented results not shown here but the model could not capture the evolution of the concentration fronts in particular for ba2 and h finally fig 7 summarizes the results and illustrates the effect of i on the ba2 front in the early phase of the adsorption process here it is possible to see that as the nacl concentration increases from 0 to 1mol kg the value of the pv at which the cation breakthroughs decreases from 10 to 2pv this indicates that the concentration of nacl has a significant effect on ba2 transport 4 3 simulations of radium transport and comparison with barium simulations of ra2 through a porous medium containing feo oh were performed to predict the behaviour of the radionuclide under the same conditions tested for ba2 following bassot et al 2001 the chemical reactions of ra2 adsorption onto feo oh were assumed equal to reactions 5 and 7 with intrinsic equilibrium constants namely k 3 ra and k 4 ra equal to 10 3 5 and 10 10 95 respectively and values of capacitance namely c 1 and c 2 equal to 3 and 0 2f m2 respectively in particular in order to match the data from the literature bassot et al 2001 sajih et al 2014 with our model the value of the second c 1 was adjusted the details and the results of this optimization are reported in section 8 of the supporting information document the results of the 1d transport simulations are reported in fig 8 and the ra2 profiles are compared with barium fronts to highlight the different behaviour here the conditions applied are as in the calculations run for fig 7 it is possible to notice that in the absence of nacl ra2 is more retarded than ba2 and as the salt concentration increases the two cations behave similarly and they breakthrough between 1 and 2pv traveling with negligible retardation or even none 5 conclusion in this work batch and transport experiments were performed to investigate ba2 adsorption behaviour at various ph ionic strength and temperature batch experiments show that the adsorption of ba2 onto feo oh increases with ph and decreases with nacl concentration which changed from 0 to 3mol kg contrarily no significant variation in ba2 adsorption behaviour was observed between 25 c and 65 c transport experiments show that the retardation of ba2 decreases with nacl concentration reaching the value of 1 pv for nacl concentration 1mol kg all experiments were described with a triple layer surface complexation model coupled with pitzer activity coefficients method and with a transport model in the case of column flood tests the model agrees well with both batch and transport measurements but fails to capture the ph fronts measured during the transport tests at high nacl concentration the transport of ra2 through the porous medium containing feo oh was simulated calculations show that the transport of ra2 is affected by the change in ionic strength which agree with the ba2 experimental and simulation results finally this study shows that i may have a significant effect on the migration of barium and radium through reactive porous medium made of goethite this may imply that their congeners i e calcium magnesium and strontium may travel at the

1683,an in situ field demonstration was performed in fractured rock impacted with trichloroethene tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce to assess the impacts of contaminant rebound after removing dissolved contaminants within hydraulically conductive fractures using a bedrock well pair spaced 2 4m apart tce and dce were first flushed with water to create a decrease in dissolved contaminant concentrations while hydraulically isolating the well pair from upgradient contaminant impacts contaminant rebound then was observed between the well pair over 151days the magnitude but not trend of tce rebound was reasonably described by a matrix back diffusion screening model that employed an effective diffusion coefficient and first order abiotic tce dechlorination rate constant that was based on bench scale testing furthermore a shift in the tce dce ratio and carbon isotopic enrichment was observed during the rebound suggesting that both biotic and abiotic dechlorination were occurring within the rock matrix the isotopic data and back diffusion model together served as a convincing argument that matrix back diffusion was the mechanism responsible for the observed contaminant rebound results of this field demonstration highlight the importance and applicability of rock matrix parameters determined at the bench scale and suggest that carbon isotopic enrichment can be used as a line of evidence for abiotic dechlorination within rock matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bedrock fracture matrix tce rebound abiotic 1 introduction management of chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce in groundwater systems remains a major environmental challenge in many instances implementation of in situ remedial technologies has met with limited success as initially promising decreases in dissolved contaminant concentrations have been followed by a subsequent rebound in contaminant concentrations following treatment e g burns et al 2017 while many factors can contribute to observed chlorinated solvent rebound several studies have shown that the primary causes for observed rebound are the slow release from low permeability zones e g damgaard et al 2013a tressler and uchrin 2014 and or the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl chlorinated solvent sources e g mcguire et al 2006 krembs et al 2010 the issue of contaminant rebound in fractured rock can be especially challenging due to the typically very low effective porosities associated with hydraulically conductive fractures as well as the complex nature of fracture flow diffusive uptake and subsequent release of contaminants from the rock matrix is a well known process that causes contaminant persistence in bedrock aquifers west and kueper 2010 r√©v√©sz et al 2014 the slow release of contaminants from the rock matrix can result in observed rebound following treatment or removal of contaminants located in hydraulically conductive fractures likewise both laboratory and field studies in fractured rock have also demonstrated how residual dnapl can serve as a source of rebound in fractured rock systems schaefer et al 2012a 2017b identifying the extent to which these rebound mechanisms can impact treatment as well as whether rebound is controlled by matrix back diffusion or by residual dnapl is important for both remedial selection and design using measurement of carbon isotopes results obtained by morrill et al 2009 suggest that rebound caused by dnapl sources is unlikely to exhibit significant isotopic enrichment due to dissolution pce or tce rebound derived from rock matrix back diffusion may however exhibit substantial carbon isotopic enrichment this enrichment can occur in rock matrices where naturally occurring ferrous minerals facilitate the abiotic reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes to short chain hydrocarbons such as acetylene ethene ethane propane and butane schaefer et al 2013 2015 2017a known pathways of both biotic and abiotic tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce reductive transformation are provided in the supplemental information abiotic ferrous mineral induced dechlorination of chlorinated solvents has been shown to result in carbon isotopic enrichment zwank et al 2005 liang et al 2007 a recent field study by damgaard et al 2013b in a clay till demonstrated that naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions for dce and 1 1 1 trichlorethane tca could be identified via high resolution matrix sampling and compound specific isotopic analysis csia for carbon thus it is plausible that carbon isotopic enrichment during post treatment contaminant rebound can be used as a line of evidence for both identifying abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix thus verifying what may be an important natural attenuation mechanism at the site and for determining the mechanisms i e dnapl sources versus matrix back diffusion responsible for the observed rebound while laboratory methods have been developed to determine both the aqueous diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 schaefer et al 2012b and abiotic dechlorination rate constant schaefer et al 2015 in rock matrices field scale assessment of these coupled processes is lacking an in situ verification of these rock matrix parameters is desired so that an appropriate scale can be assessed as laboratory scale testing has typically involved a scale that does not exceed the diameter of a typical rock core the overall objective of this study was to assess the processes controlling contaminant rebound following removal of dissolved contaminant mass in hydraulically conductive fractures and to assess the hypothesis that a small scale field test could be used to provide critical insight regarding back diffusion rates and dechlorination processes in the rock matrix specifically an in situ test was used to quantify the rate of tce rebound identify the likely rebound mechanism through modeling measurement of site specific physical and hydraulic properties bench scale testing and use of isotopic analysis and identify verify if naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions are occurring in the rock matrix the coupled approach described herein has potential to serve as a useful tool for attaining information critical for advancing conceptual site models and for assessing the practical limits of remediation when using in situ approaches such as bioaugmentation or chemical oxidation that target contaminants residing in hydraulically conductive fractures 2 method and materials 2 1 demonstration location the field demonstration was performed in shallow bedrock at the calf pasture point cpp site 7 which is part of the former u s naval construction battalion center davisville located in north kingston ri usa cpp is bordered by narragansett bay to the east and allen harbor to the southwest cpp was decommissioned in 1994 ea engineering science and technology 1999 the depth to bedrock at cpp site 7 in the vicinity of the demonstration location is approximately 15 to 18m bedrock consists of quartzite and gneiss fracture density generally decreases with depth the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow in bedrock is uncertain but the flow direction is likely towards allen harbor southwest groundwater data in the shallow bedrock within the demonstration location showed impacts by primarily tce and dce although lower concentrations of 1 1 2 2 tetrachloethane teca and 1 1 2 trichloroethane were also present as well as trace levels of vinyl chloride and xylenes the concentrations of these compounds were 10 of the tce and dce and thus were not considered significant in terms of the molar and isotopic balances that were evaluated as part of this study the demonstration was located approximately 60m south of a suspected chlorinated solvent source area in the overlying unconsolidated materials ea engineering science and technology 1999 groundwater in the existing shallow bedrock well used for this study had a ph of approximately 7 7 an oxidation reduction potential of 260mv and a dissolved iron level of 390Œºg l tetra tech 2013 2 2 rock coring and bedrock wells two bedrock wells were used for this demonstration the first well was an existing bedrock well designated mw07 5r that was ultimately used as an injection well for the testing the second well installed approximately 2 4m down gradient from the first well and designated mw07 46r was used as the monitoring well for the demonstration mw07 46r was installed using sonic drilling techniques with a triple tube wire line pq core barrel system which allows for collection of minimally disturbed 3 25 inch diameter rock cores details for each of these two wells are provided in table 1 rock core from mw07 46r was carefully logged and revealed a highly fractured zone from approximately 17 4 to 18 9m below ground surface bgs and intermittent fractures to the final depth of 20 4m bgs the rock coring logs are provided in the supplemental materials based on boring logs from both the injection and monitoring wells 3 low to medium angled fractures were identified between 19 7 and 20 2m bgs borehole geophysical logging in mw07 46r including acoustic and optical televiewers heat pulse flow meters and caliper logging were generally consistent with the visual boring logs the placement of the inflatable packers indicated in table 1 divided the monitoring well mw07 46r into a shallow and a deep zone with mw07 46rs designated as the shallow interval and mw07 46rd designated as the deep interval it is noted that the screened interval in mw07 5r intersected the fracture zone associated with mw07 46rd but not mw07 46rs 2 3 hydraulic and tracer testing testing was performed to evaluate the flow and interconnectedness between the two bedrock wells the packers used in the monitoring well were designed to allow for sampling and pumping within the isolated packer interval thereby facilitating the implementation of short term pump testing and tracer testing short term pumping tests were performed using the discrete mw07 46rs and mw07 46rd intervals indicated in table 1 the packer system consisted of two inflatable packers with a submersible pump and a water level transducer for collecting water levels above below and between the straddle packers the packers were inflated isolating the target zone from zones above and below and short term pump and recharge tests 2h each were performed during each pump test groundwater levels were monitored in mw07 05r a tracer test was performed to further assess hydraulic connectivity and travel time between the injection well mw07 5r and the monitoring well shallow and deep intervals of mw07 46r a tracer solution 0 25l containing 27g of sodium bromide was added to injection well mw07 05r immediately following the addition of the sodium bromide tracer water was recirculated within the well using a submersible pump to facilitate tracer mixing throughout the water column this was accomplished by pumping groundwater from the bottom of the 3 3m screen interval up to the ground surface the water was continuously re injected into the upper portion of the water column within the well approximately 125l 3 well volumes were recirculated to sufficiently mix the bromide tracer within the water column and to achieve the target bromide concentration of 500mg l within the well column once the bromide was mixed in the water column within injection well mw07 05r a bromide injection tracer test was initiated a 380l batch of 500mg l bromide solution 244g of nabr was mixed within a 380l conical bottom poly tank located adjacent to the injection well the solution was injected at a rate of approximately 75ml min for 8 5h on the first day of testing groundwater samples were collected from mw07 46rs and d every hour during this injection samples from the monitoring locations were collected by recirculating 0 6l of water from the dedicated sample pump to the surface and back into the sampling interval just below the bottom of the top bounding packer approximately 0 01l of sample were collected at the end of each 0 6l recirculation sampling was performed in this manner to minimize the removal of groundwater from the expected small fracture volume between the injection and monitoring well approximately 38l of bromide solution was injected during the first day of testing injection of bromide solution resumed on the second day of testing at a rate of 75ml min and was increased to 200ml min 3 3h into the second day of injection the injection continued overnight and concluded the morning of april 17 2014 groundwater samples were collected from the two monitoring well intervals every hour during the second day during business hours and once on the morning of the last day april 17th a total of approximately 300l of 500mg l bromide solution was injected during the tracer test at the completion of the bromide tracer tests approximately 182l of groundwater were extracted from the injection well to reduce the concentration of bromide in the groundwater in preparation of the borehole dilution testing the bromide concentration in the injection well following this extraction was 61mg l as a final hydraulic test a borehole dilution tracer test pitrak et al 2007 was performed to determine the ambient groundwater flowrate through the injection well the borehole dilution test was performed at injection well mw07 05r and was initiated approximate 13days after completing the bromide tracer test described above a 250ml solution containing 8 9g of nabr was added to the 3 3m interval below the packer to achieve a target bromide tracer concentration in the water column of 500mg l immediately following the addition of the sodium bromide tracer water was recirculated within the well using the dedicated bladder pump installed below the packer to facilitate tracer mixing throughout the 3 3m interval this was accomplished by pumping groundwater from near the bottom of the interval up to the ground surface the water was continuously re injected back through the packer to the top of the packer interval approximately 21l 3 well volumes was recirculated to sufficiently mix the bromide tracer within the interval bromide samples were collected from mw07 05r after recirculation time 0 and on days 4 11 19 and 25 samples were collected using the same low volume sampling methodology used for the tracer test 2 4 rock matrix characterization using rock core collected during installation of mw07 46r testing of the rock matrix was performed to determine the matrix porosity and abiotic dechlorination of tce through the rock this information was ultimately used to assess the fate and transport of tce through the rock matrix as discussed in section 3 rock core from a depth interval of 18 1 18 3m bgs was used targeting phyllitic rock core adjacent to water bearing zones the rock core adjacent to shallow and deep fractures is the demonstration area is described as a combination of both phyllite and quartzite and thus it is recognized that the rock sample used for the laboratory testing may not be completely representative of the entire rock matrix interrogated by the in situ rebound test described in section 2 5 rock samples were shipped to the laboratory and stored under anaerobic conditions until the initiation of testing the water accessible porosity of the rock matrix was determined using the water uptake method schaefer et al 2012b applied to a slice of rock a small slice of rock core approximately 40g was oven dried at 105 degrees c the rock was subsequently placed in a water bath with the very top of the rock face above the waterline to allow for escape of air during imbibition the water uptake experiment continued until moisture equilibrium was established the effective porosity was estimated by the mass of water taken up by the rock the ferrous mineral content of the rock matrix was determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline method amonette and templeton 1998 batch tests to determine the abiotic dechlorination of tce by naturally occurring ferrous minerals within the rock matrix were performed using laboratory methodology similar to that previously described schaefer et al 2015 where mercuric chloride was employed as a microbial inhibitor a previously developed model schaefer et al 2013 which incorporates the coupled diffusion and first order abiotic transformation of tce was used to provide a screening level estimate of the first order abiotic dechlorination rate constant based on the observed tce transformation products this transformation rate constant was ultimately used in the model to simulate the observed tce rebound from the rock matrix section 3 herein this methodology was used for screening purposes only to ultimately provide an estimate within a factor of 2 of the abiotic dechlorination rate constant additional details of this bench scale testing are provided in the supplemental materials 2 5 in situ rebound testing as illustrated in fig 1 an initial flushing step was intended to remove dissolved chlorinated solvent mass from the hydraulically conductive fractures prior to initiating flushing and approximately 12months following the hydraulic testing described in the previous section baseline samples were collected in the injection and monitoring shallow and deep intervals wells to determine chlorinated solvent concentrations and for compound specific isotopic analysis csia for carbon on both tce and dce flushing was performed by injecting hydrant water stored in a polyethylene tank via gravity drainage using a flow controller into the injection well at a constant flow rate of approximately 300ml min for 44days during the final 16days of this flushing water also was injected into each interval of monitoring well mw07 46r at a rate of 150ml min to enhance the removal of chlorinated solvents chlorinated solvent levels were monitored weekly to bi weekly in the shallow and deep monitoring locations during the flushing flushing ceased when tce and dce concentrations decreased by approximately 98 to 99 in the monitoring intervals following the flushing described above the rebound phase of the demonstration was initiated as indicated in fig 1 the rebound phase of the testing was accompanied by a slow injection of clean hydrant water into injection well mw07 05r a bromide tracer also was added to this injection water the purpose for injecting water without vocs was to prevent the migration of chlorinated solvents from upgradient thereby assuring that any observed increase in chlorinated solvents in the monitoring well was from contaminant mass residing between the injection well and the extraction well the injection rate used during the rebound phase was intended to limit excessive dilution while at the same time preventing up gradient impacts to the monitoring well from the low angle fractures intersecting the deep monitoring interval the injection well flow rate used for the rebound phase of the testing as well as the basis for this injection flow rate are discussed in the results the slow flushing rebound phase of the demonstration continued for 151days the shallow and deep monitoring intervals were sampled every 1 to 2months to determine the extent and rate of any increases in tce and dce at the final chlorinated solvent sampling event csia analyses was repeated for tce and dce to assess any changes that occurred during the contaminant rebound period 2 6 analytical methods bromide was analyzed via ion chromatography dionex dx 120 sunnyvale ca groundwater analyses of volatile organic compounds vocs was performed using mass spectrometry via epa method 8260b revision 2 usepa 1996a the practical quantification limit for vocs was 5Œºg l csia analysis for carbon on both tce and dce was performed by pace analytical pittsburgh pa for the bench scale rock matrix testing only headspace analyses were preformed see the supplemental materials headspace was analyzed for chlorinated ethene and reduced gases using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector as described previously schaefer et al 2015 aqueous concentration were calculated based on the headspace data using henry s law 3 model to describe tce back diffusion from the rock matrix results from the rebound testing were carefully assessed so as to provide insight into the mechanisms potentially responsible for the increases in any observed tce concentrations to determine if the observed tce rebound during the demonstration was potentially due to rock matrix back diffusion a semi analytical model was developed to describe the back diffusion of tce from the rock matrix into the 3 fracture planes connecting the injection well mw07 05r to the deep interval of the monitoring well mw07 46r as described in detail in the supplemental materials the model considers a well mixed fracture network conveying a volumetric groundwater flow entering from the injection well to the deep interval of the monitoring well using diffusion and abiotic dechlorination rates based on rock matrix characterization described in section 2 4 the diffusive flux and resultant concentration of tce into the 3 transmissive fractures and ultimately the monitoring well was estimated as a function of time during the slow flushing rebound phase of testing previous studies schaefer et al 2013 2015 suggest that the abiotic dechlorination rate constant will remain constant for the timescale of the current field experiment thus the dechlorination rate constants used in the model were assumed constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic and tracer testing while pumping at mw07 46rs or d during the short term pumping tests drawdown 31 7cm when pumping the shallow zone and 16 8cm when pumping the deep zone was observed in well mw07 05r indicating a direct hydraulic connection between select water bearing fractures in each of these wells the hydraulic connection while pumping that was observed in the shallow zone likely was attributable to the presence of high angle fractures that intersected the nearly horizontal fractures connecting the injection well and the deep monitoring interval bromide data for the deep interval for mw07 46r are provided in fig 2 no measurable increases in bromide were observed in the shallow interval indicating that a solute flow path despite observing a hydraulic connection during the short term pumping tests does not exist between the injection well mw07 05r and the shallow interval of mw07 46r under the hydraulic conditions of the bromide tracer test bromide tracer results indicated that bromide appeared rapidly approximately 3 5h in mw07 05rd the bromide concentration in the deep interval increased linearly with the injected volume to estimate the fracture aperture along the fracture flow path from the injection well to the deep interval of mw07 46r radial fracture flow emanating from the injection well is assumed which is a reasonable assumption given the geometry of the identified fractures the fracture aperture a is calculated as follows 1 a v b nœÄ r 2 where vb is the volume of tracer injected until tracer is observed in the monitoring well 16 000cm3 n is the number of fractures in the deep interval 3 based on visual and geophysical boring logs and r is the radial distance between the injection and monitoring well 240cm eq 1 results in an estimated fracture aperture of 0 029cm 290Œºm assuming 3 hydraulically conductive fractures with an aperture of 0 029cm each intersect the injection well along its 330cm depth interval the effective fracture porosity in the deep interval is 0 00026 these parameters were used in the back diffusion model results of the borehole dilution test performed in mw07 05r are provided in fig 3 the rate of bromide decay in the injection well provides an estimate of the darcy velocity the darcy velocity is calculated by first determining the ambient flow rate into the test well as follows pitrak et al 2007 nordqvist et al 2008 2 ln c c 0 q a v iw t where c is the bromide concentration at time t c0 is the initial bromide concentration in the injection well borehole qa is ambient flow rate into the well and t is the time viw is the water volume of the injection well including the porosity within the sandpack which is approximately 12 000cm3 linear regression of the data to eq 2 is shown in fig 3 with a resulting ambient flow rate into the well qa of 564cm3 day 0 39cm3 min the darcy flow of the aquifer is subsequently calculated as nordqvist et al 2008 3 q d q a 2 r iw l s Œ± where qd is the darcy velocity riw is the borehole radius of injection well mw07 05r ls is the length interval of the sand pack 3 3m and Œ± is flow convergence correction factor estimated at 2 the calculated value of qd is 0 091cm day average over the 3 3m interval of mw07 05r using the calculated effective porosity of 0 00026 the linear velocity is 350cm day resulting in a travel time of 16h between the injection and extraction wells under ambient no injecting conditions the ambient darcy flow was used to determine the injection flow rate needed to hydraulically isolate mw07 46rd during the rebound phase of the testing based on the ambient darcy flow 0 091cm day determined during the borehole dilution testing the ambient flow intersecting the 3 3m open interval in mw07 05r and out a radial distance of 2 4m is approximately 10cm3 min to hydraulically isolate mw07 46rd located at a radial distance of 2 4m away from the injection well the injection flow rate would need to be at least equal to 10cm3 min this provides a very conservative estimate for hydraulic control at twice the ambient volumetric flow the residence time between the injection and monitoring well during the rebound injection phase was approximately half that as under ambient conditions thus the target injection flow rate during the rebound phase was set at 20cm3 min to hydraulically isolate the monitoring well and prevent up gradient tce from impacting the well based on the 3 5h residence time observed during the 75cm3 min injection that occurred during the first day of the tracer test the residence time during the 20cm3 min flow rate during the slow injection rebound phase was estimated to be approximately 13h 4 2 rock properties results from the water uptake method showed that the rock matrix porosity was approximately 3 9 this value is within the range expected for quartzite winograd and thordarson 1975 and was used in the matrix diffusion model based on previously published correlations for rock that are based on the water accessible porosity boving and grathwohl 2001 the estimated effective diffusion coefficient for tce through the rock is 1 4 10 3 cm2 d abiotic dechlorination was observed in the bench scale batch testing as indicated by generation of propane and ethane in a molar ratio of approximately 4 1 fig 4 it is noted that the tce dechlorination was based on transformation product generation as only a trace fraction of the tce present 2 10 7 was transformed in the batch experiment these results are similar to previous observations of tce abiotic dechlorination in sedimentary rock schaefer et al 2015 applying a previously developed coupled diffusion and first order dechlorination model for tce in these bench scale experiments schaefer et al 2013 2015 the bulk first order tce abiotic degradation rate constant defined as the first order rate constant multiplied by the linear sorption coefficient and the rock density of 2 6g cm3 in the rock matrix is estimated as 2 3 10 3 day 1 this value falls within the range observed in previous studies using sedimentary rock that were based on a minimum of 4 sampling points schaefer et al 2013 2015 the ferrous mineral content of the rock matrix was 510mg kg which also falls within the range of ferrous mineral content for rocks with measurable abiotic dechlorination schaefer et al 2015 it is noted that this regressed rate constant is considered only a screening value within a factor of 2 as the number of data points to which it was regressed is limited fig 4 the first order rate constant estimated from this bench scale experiment was used in the field scale matrix back diffusion model described in section 3 and the supplemental materials 4 3 assessment of rebound due to the lack of tracer observed at the shallow monitoring interval during the hydraulic testing rebound monitoring focused on mw07 46rd initial flushing performed prior to rebound resulted in a decrease in tce concentration of approximately 99 from baseline conditions to the end of the 44day flushing period in mw07 46rd increases in tce relative to baseline plotted as a function of time during the rebound phase are shown in fig 5 results show that tce concentrations increased with time indicating that there was a persistent contaminant source present between the demonstration wells that was not removed during the flushing the data collected over 151days of rebound testing are unclear as to whether or not tce concentrations were stable or still increasing tce concentrations increased nearly 5 fold during the rebound period under ambient flow conditions with approximately twice the residence time between the injection and monitoring well compared to that during the slow injection phase the tce concentration even in the absence of up gradient impacts would likely have increased by nearly another factor of two thus the flushing of contaminant mass from the fractures over 44days had only temporarily limited the impacts of tce in the conductive fractures as substantial contaminant rebound occurred potential sources of contaminant mass responsible for the observed rebound include the rock matrix residual dnapl sources and or low transmissivity zones within the targeted fracture planes the rebound model was used to determine if the observed tce rebound could potentially be explained based on rock matrix back diffusion as shown in fig 5 if tce abiotic dechlorination is included in the model the observed rebound is reasonably described by the model in terms of magnitude within 20 of the observed data for the last 3 sampling events although the trend in the data is not as well described by the model excluding abiotic dechlorination results in a more substantial over prediction of the data at early times deviations between the model prediction and the experimental data likely reflect the complexities associated with attempting to estimate the fracture aperture and mixing within the borehole interval these deviations highlight the difficulties in attempting to accurately model fracture matrix interactions for even these very tightly spaced wells and limit the ability of the model to convincingly demonstrate that the mechanism of the observed rebound is due to matrix back diffusion for example if there were only two fractures connecting the injection to the extraction well instead of 3 which could be the case if 1 of the observed fractures at each borehole was local only to the borehole and not interconnected the simulated tce concentrations in fig 5 would decrease by approximately 33 and excluding abiotic reactions would result in an improved model description of the data at later times thus use of the back diffusion model can only suggest that the rock matrix is a plausible source for the observed rebound and that abiotic dechlorination with the rock matrix see the discussion beginning in the following paragraph potentially played a role in mitigating rebound from the rock matrix neglecting abiotic dechlorination results in a small but significant up to 35 difference in c c0 difference in the model thus any uncertainties owed to uncertainties in the regressed first order abiotic dechlorination rate constant fig 3 including differences in the rate constant due to temperature differences between the ambient groundwater and the room temperature conditions present during the bench scale rock testing have a minimal impact on the overall model results thus use of the model alone as evidence for abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix is not warranted due to the uncertainties inherent within the model comparison of the csia carbon data for both tce and dce are provided in table 2 comparison of the carbon isotopes and relative concentrations of tce and dce between baseline and post rebound conditions provide useful information although caution is warranted as only one set of pre and post testing csia analysis was performed first the molar tce dce ratio decreases from approximately 4 1 at baseline to 1 1 at the end of rebound in addition comparison of baseline to post rebound csia data show that the tce becomes heavier and the dce becomes lighter together these results suggest that the origin of the observed rebound was from a source that had become enriched in dce likely due to the biotic reductive dechlorination of tce to dce and possibly the abiotic dechlorination of tce previous studies have shown that the abiotic dechlorination rate of tce is greater than that of dce lee and batchelor 2002 2004 thus abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix likely would cause a decrease in the tce dce ratio these results also provide a line of evidence to confirm that the observed increases in tce are not from a lack of hydraulic control from the injection well and infiltration of upgradient tce and dce as such lack of hydraulic control would not result in the observed shift in tce dce ratio the net isotopic enrichment for tce and dce considering the mass balance on the fracture shown in fig s2 is calculated as follows 4 Œ¥ x tce Œ¥ 13 c tce x dce Œ¥ 13 c dce rebound x tce Œ¥ 13 c tce x dce Œ¥ 13 c dce baseline where Œ¥ is the molar weighted isotopic enrichment of tce dce between baseline and the end of rebound x is the mole fraction of either tce or dce in the groundwater and Œ¥13 is the 13c isotopic level in either the tce or dce this isotopic mass balance approach used to assess potential transformation of monitored compounds s to unidentified compounds has been previously employed for chlorinated ethenes and ethene mundle et al 2012 the change in conditions from baseline to the final rebound in eq 4 is due to the difference in contaminants that emanated from upgradient baseline compared to contaminants that emanated from presumably the rock matrix final rebound event thus eq 4 is an isotopic balance comparing 13c originally coming in to the fracture test zone compared to 13c coming from the rock matrix within the test zone as shown in table 2 tce and dce together are enriched when comparing baseline to rebound values with no transformation other than the biotic dechlorination of tce to dce the 13c would have expected to be conserved in tce and dce thus Œ¥ would be expected to be zero a positive value of Œ¥ suggests that additional tce and or dce transformation reactions were occurring within the source of the observed rebound based on the average time scale of the rebound period and the measured tce abiotic dechlorination rate constant of 2 3 10 3 day 1 measured in our bench scale testing a 21 decrease in tce would have been expected which results in an enrichment factor of 52 based on Œ¥ in table 2 this value is in reasonable agreement with the abiotic tce enrichment factor of 33 table s3 measured by liang et al 2007 using fes solids thus the enrichment factors observed in these two studies are in reasonable agreement vc was observed at 0 19Œºm but this relatively low quantity of generated vc could not account for the observed isotopic shift as the vc would have needed to have a Œ¥13 vc value of 325 for Œ¥ to be zero if vinyl chloride were included in the isotopic balance in eq 2 it is possible that some of the generated vc was subsequently biologically mineralized within the conductive fractures as the injected water during the rebound phase likely contained dissolved oxygen however multiple lines of evidence suggest that aerobic biotransformation of vc was negligible during this study as discussed below first during the initial 28days of flushing when the rate of dissolved oxygen delivery to the subsurface likely was the greatest 15 times greater injection rate than during the slow injection used during the rebound portion of the test both tce and vc were removed at approximately the same relative rate with an observed half live of removal due to flushing of approximately 10days if vc aerobic biotic transformation occurred with a half life of 20days an observable increase in the rate of vc removal compared to tce would have been readily observed during this flushing phase the residence time in the test system time of travel between the injection well and monitoring well and time needed to flush the deep monitoring well interval was approximately 40days this is based on the tracer data borehole dilution data and bromide tracer concentrations observed during the rebound testing even if vc was being biotically transformed with a half life of 20days the measured vc levels indicate that only 14 of the dce would have been biotically transformed to vc or subsequent products which is still a small fraction for an isotopic balance Œ¥ 0 in eq 4 and applying the rayleigh equation an enrichment factor of 80 would be needed for the biotransformation of dce to vc and any subsequent biotransformation products if such biotransformation of vc was included enrichment factors for dce biotransformation to vc have been shown to be 16 table s3 abe et al 2009 bloom et al 2000 thus it is unlikely that aerobic biotransformation of vc is responsible for the net enrichment shown in table 2 as a second line of evidence trace 0 09 to 0 8Œºm levels of xylenes were present in the groundwater the observed rate of rebound of the xylenes exceeded that of tce although precise quantification is uncertain because of the elevated detection limits due to the sample dilution used for the elevated tce levels xylenes are very susceptible to aerobic biotransformation schaefer et al 2010 thus substantial rebound of the xylenes suggests that conditions in the subsurface likely were not conducive to aerobic biodegradation despite any dissolved oxygen that may have been introduced in the injected water it is far more likely that consistent with the bench scale testing that demonstrated the abiotic dechlorination of tce within the rock matrix that the positive value of Œ¥ was due to the abiotic dechlorination of tce and or dce damgaard et al 2013b employed a similar reasoning as a line of evidence that the abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes were occurring in clay matrices although high resolution sampling of the clay matrix was employed in their study whereas much more limited sampling of the adjacent fracture zone was employed in the current study thus the isotopic enrichment of tce dce for the rebound data not only provides a line of evidence that abiotic dechlorination is occurring within the rock matrix but that these data also are consistent with the contaminant mass within the rock matrix serving as the source of the observed rebound if residual dnapl present along the fracture flow path was the primary source of the rebound an observed isotopic shift as well as a decrease in molar tce dce ratio would not have been expected it is possible that the molar shift in the tce dce ratio is due to slow mass transfer from low permeability zones within the fracture plane however it is unlikely although possible that release from low permeability zones within the fracture plane would result in the isotopic shifts observed as the abiotic dechlorination reactions responsible for such shifts are likely located within the rock matrix schaefer et al 2013 while studying the biogeochemical conditions of a clay matrix adjacent to fractures and sand lenses damgaard et al 2013b observed that conditions within the clay matrix were in some cases more conducive to biological reductive dechlorination than in the adjacent higher permeability zones lima et al 2012 also observed dechlorinating bacteria in the rock matrix of sandstones suggesting if rock pore diameters are sufficiently large or microfractures are present that biotic dechlorination can occur within the rock matrix thus it is plausible that the enhanced tce to dce transformation as well as the isotopic enrichment were due in part to biotic reductive dechlorination in the rock matrix that was naturally enhanced compared to that in that in the hydraulically conductive fractures however as described previously biotic transformation alone cannot explain the discrepancy in isotopic balance eq 4 in addition any biotic tce to dce transformation likely had a minimal impact on tce concentrations in the rock matrix the following form of the rayleigh equation is used to express the expected change in tce concentration based on the isotopic enrichment of the biotic dechlorination product dce 5a ln c dce c dce 0 Œ¥ 13 c t Œ¥ 13 c 0 œµ 5b c tce c tce 0 0 24 c dce c dce 0 where ctce 0 and ctce are the tce concentrations moles at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively cdce 0 and cdce are the dce concentrations moles at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively Œ¥13c0 and Œ¥13ct are the dce 13c isotopic levels at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively per mil Œµ is the isotopic enrichment factor per mil and the factor of 0 24 represents the molar dce tce ratio at baseline conditions only trace levels of vinyl chloride were observed in the field thus dce effectively served as the final biotic dechlorination product using an isotopic enrichment factor of 8 for the biotic dechlorination of tce in the rock matrix table s3 bloom et al 2000 liang et al 2007 and even making the assumption that the dce isotopic enrichment was solely from biotic mechanisms only a 12 decrease in tce concentration is expected based on eqs 5a and 5b thus biotic transformation likely had a negligible impact on tce concentrations in the rock matrix for the duration of the rebound the observed change in the tce dce ratio cannot be explained by any difference in the aqueous diffusion coefficient between these compounds as the aqueous diffusion coefficient for tce and dce differs by only 20 usepa 1996b in addition the diffusion model shows that the chlorinated ethene concentrations in the rock matrix near the fracture interface where mass was exchanged during the flushing and rebound phases were 20 of the initial chlorinated ethene concentration in the fractures table s2 and the chlorinated ethene concentrations in the fracture at the end of the rebound period were 5 of those in the rock matrix at these relative concentrations it has been shown labolle et al 2008 that carbon isotopic enrichment due to diffusion would be negligible compared to the enrichment shown in table 2 it is noted that the baseline dce was heavier than the baseline tce which is not expected if the dce was present at baseline due to the ongoing dechlorination of tce and without appreciable continued biotic dechlorination of dce to vinyl chloride vc vc molar concentrations at baseline were approximately 70 times less than molar dce concentrations possible explanations the baseline dce was heavier than the baseline tce include a separate upgradient dce source where dce was not generated from tce and or the upgradient generation of dce from transformation of a tca source 4 4 implications for treatment and site assessment the csia data laboratory batch testing and matrix back diffusion model together provided lines of evidence that the observed contaminant rebound was due to matrix back diffusion reliance on any one of these approaches alone would have not provided a convincing argument for the rebound mechanism thus use of this integrated approach has provides potential means to improve conceptual site models the lack of strong agreement between the back diffusion model prediction and the tce rebound data highlight the challenges associated with applying back diffusion models even at very small scales and the increased challenges associated with application of more complex models e g west and kueper 2010 over much greater length and time scales in addition consistent with observations in clay performed by damgaard et al 2013b the observed carbon isotopic enrichment during rebound from the rock matrix suggests that such isotopic analyses may serve as a useful line of evidence in identifying abiotic dechlorination processes in rock matrices while previously performed ex situ bench scale testing to measure abiotic dechlorination in rock matrices has been limited to the core scale darlington et al 2013 schaefer et al 2013 the approach described herein allows for interrogation of a much greater extent of the rock matrix in situ csia analysis performed on rock cores compared to csia analysis on groundwater in adjacent hydraulically active fractures might also serve as a useful approach to identify the carbon isotopic enrichment due to naturally occurring dechlorination reactions within the rock matrix 5 conclusions the in situ field testing approach discussed herein provided a means to assess contaminant rebound and abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix following removal of contaminants present in hydraulically conductive zones discrete interval tracer testing using groundwater sampling that limited extraction from the wells along with rock core logging and borehole geophysical data were utilized to estimate the groundwater velocity and fracture aperture between the injection and monitoring locations tce rebound was reasonably described using a rock matrix back diffusion model in addition decreases in the molar tce dce ratio and carbon isotopic enrichment following rebound provided lines of evidence that the rock matrix was the source of the observed contaminant rebound thus abiotic dechlorination within the rock matrix can provide evidence that the rock matrix is in fact the source of observed contaminant rebound although the limited isotopic data set warrants caution with the data interpretation carbon isotopic enrichment observed during rock matrix back diffusion was consistent with bench scale testing suggesting that csia analysis may serve as a useful tool for confirming naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions in situ it is noted that the approach used herein may prove challenging if fracture flow paths cannot be readily discerned or if residual non aqueous sources are present in sufficient quantity such that dissolved concentrations are not substantially reduced

1683,an in situ field demonstration was performed in fractured rock impacted with trichloroethene tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce to assess the impacts of contaminant rebound after removing dissolved contaminants within hydraulically conductive fractures using a bedrock well pair spaced 2 4m apart tce and dce were first flushed with water to create a decrease in dissolved contaminant concentrations while hydraulically isolating the well pair from upgradient contaminant impacts contaminant rebound then was observed between the well pair over 151days the magnitude but not trend of tce rebound was reasonably described by a matrix back diffusion screening model that employed an effective diffusion coefficient and first order abiotic tce dechlorination rate constant that was based on bench scale testing furthermore a shift in the tce dce ratio and carbon isotopic enrichment was observed during the rebound suggesting that both biotic and abiotic dechlorination were occurring within the rock matrix the isotopic data and back diffusion model together served as a convincing argument that matrix back diffusion was the mechanism responsible for the observed contaminant rebound results of this field demonstration highlight the importance and applicability of rock matrix parameters determined at the bench scale and suggest that carbon isotopic enrichment can be used as a line of evidence for abiotic dechlorination within rock matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bedrock fracture matrix tce rebound abiotic 1 introduction management of chlorinated solvents

limited success as initially promising decreases in dissolved contaminant concentrations have been followed by a subsequent rebound in contaminant concentrations following treatment e g burns et al 2017 while many factors can contribute to observed chlorinated solvent rebound several studies have shown that the primary causes for observed rebound are the slow release from low permeability zones e g damgaard et al 2013a tressler and uchrin 2014 and or the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl chlorinated solvent sources e g mcguire et al 2006 krembs et al 2010 the issue of contaminant rebound in fractured rock can be especially challenging due to the typically very low effective porosities associated with hydraulically conductive fractures as well as the complex nature of fracture flow diffusive uptake and subsequent release of contaminants from the rock matrix is a well known process that causes contaminant persistence in bedrock aquifers west and kueper 2010 r√©v√©sz et al 2014 the slow release of contaminants from the rock matrix can result in observed rebound following treatment or removal of contaminants located in hydraulically conductive fractures likewise both laboratory and field studies in fractured rock have also demonstrated how residual dnapl can serve as a source of rebound in fractured rock systems schaefer et al 2012a 2017b identifying the extent to which these rebound mechanisms can impact treatment as well as whether rebound is controlled by matrix back diffusion or by residual dnapl is important for both remedial selection and design using measurement of carbon isotopes results obtained by morrill et al 2009 suggest that rebound caused by dnapl sources is unlikely to exhibit significant isotopic enrichment due to dissolution pce or tce rebound derived from rock matrix back diffusion may however exhibit substantial carbon isotopic enrichment this enrichment can occur in rock matrices where naturally occurring ferrous minerals facilitate the abiotic reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes to short chain hydrocarbons such as acetylene ethene ethane propane and butane schaefer et al 2013 2015 2017a known pathways of both biotic and abiotic tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce reductive transformation are provided in the supplemental information abiotic ferrous mineral induced dechlorination of chlorinated solvents has been shown to result in carbon isotopic enrichment zwank et al 2005 liang et al 2007 a recent field study by damgaard et al 2013b in a clay till demonstrated that naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions for dce and 1 1 1 trichlorethane tca could be identified via high resolution matrix sampling and compound specific isotopic analysis csia for carbon thus it is plausible that carbon isotopic enrichment during post treatment contaminant rebound can be used as a line of evidence for both identifying abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix thus verifying what may be an important natural attenuation mechanism at the site and for determining the mechanisms i e dnapl sources versus matrix back diffusion responsible for the observed rebound while laboratory methods have been developed to determine both the aqueous diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 schaefer et al 2012b and abiotic dechlorination rate constant schaefer et al 2015 in rock matrices field scale assessment of these coupled processes is lacking an in situ verification of these rock matrix parameters is desired so that an appropriate scale can be assessed as laboratory scale testing has typically involved a scale that does not exceed the diameter of a typical rock core the overall objective of this study was to assess the processes controlling contaminant rebound following removal of dissolved contaminant mass in hydraulically conductive fractures and to assess the hypothesis that a small scale field test could be used to provide critical insight regarding back diffusion rates and dechlorination processes in the rock matrix specifically an in situ test was used to quantify the rate of tce rebound identify the likely rebound mechanism through modeling measurement of site specific physical and hydraulic properties bench scale testing and use of isotopic analysis and identify verify if naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions are occurring in the rock matrix the coupled approach described herein has potential to serve as a useful tool for attaining information critical for advancing conceptual site models and for assessing the practical limits of remediation when using in situ approaches such as bioaugmentation or chemical oxidation that target contaminants residing in hydraulically conductive fractures 2 method and materials 2 1 demonstration location the field demonstration was performed in shallow bedrock at the calf pasture point cpp site 7 which is part of the former u s naval construction battalion center davisville located in north kingston ri usa cpp is bordered by narragansett bay to the east and allen harbor to the southwest cpp was decommissioned in 1994 ea engineering science and technology 1999 the depth to bedrock at cpp site 7 in the vicinity of the demonstration location is approximately 15 to 18m bedrock consists of quartzite and gneiss fracture density generally decreases with depth the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow in bedrock is uncertain but the flow direction is likely towards allen harbor southwest groundwater data in the shallow bedrock within the demonstration location showed impacts by primarily tce and dce although lower concentrations of 1 1 2 2 tetrachloethane teca and 1 1 2 trichloroethane were also present as well as trace levels of vinyl chloride and xylenes the concentrations of these compounds were 10 of the tce and dce and thus were not considered significant in terms of the molar and isotopic balances that were evaluated as part of this study the demonstration was located approximately 60m south of a suspected chlorinated solvent source area in the overlying unconsolidated materials ea engineering science and technology 1999 groundwater in the existing shallow bedrock well used for this study had a ph of approximately 7 7 an oxidation reduction potential of 260mv and a dissolved iron level of 390Œºg l tetra tech 2013 2 2 rock coring and bedrock wells two bedrock wells were used for this demonstration the first well was an existing bedrock well designated mw07 5r that was ultimately used as an injection well for the testing the second well installed approximately 2 4m down gradient from the first well and designated mw07 46r was used as the monitoring well for the demonstration mw07 46r was installed using sonic drilling techniques with a triple tube wire line pq core barrel system which allows for collection of minimally disturbed 3 25 inch diameter rock cores details for each of these two wells are provided in table 1 rock core from mw07 46r was carefully logged and revealed a highly fractured zone from approximately 17 4 to 18 9m below ground surface bgs and intermittent fractures to the final depth of 20 4m bgs the rock coring logs are provided in the supplemental materials based on boring logs from both the injection and monitoring wells 3 low to medium angled fractures were identified between 19 7 and 20 2m bgs borehole geophysical logging in mw07 46r including acoustic and optical televiewers heat pulse flow meters and caliper logging were generally consistent with the visual boring logs the placement of the inflatable packers indicated in table 1 divided the monitoring well mw07 46r into a shallow and a deep zone with mw07 46rs designated as the shallow interval and mw07 46rd designated as the deep interval it is noted that the screened interval in mw07 5r intersected the fracture zone associated with mw07 46rd but not mw07 46rs 2 3 hydraulic and tracer testing testing was performed to evaluate the flow and interconnectedness between the two bedrock wells the packers used in the monitoring well were designed to allow for sampling and pumping within the isolated packer interval thereby facilitating the implementation of short term pump testing and tracer testing short term pumping tests were performed using the discrete mw07 46rs and mw07 46rd intervals indicated in table 1 the packer system consisted of two inflatable packers with a submersible pump and a water level transducer for collecting water levels above below and between the straddle packers the packers were inflated isolating the target zone from zones above and below and short term pump and recharge tests 2h each were performed during each pump test groundwater levels were monitored in mw07 05r a tracer test was performed to further assess hydraulic connectivity and travel time between the injection well mw07 5r and the monitoring well shallow and deep intervals of mw07 46r a tracer solution 0 25l containing 27g of sodium bromide was added to injection well mw07 05r immediately following the addition of the sodium bromide tracer water was recirculated within the well using a submersible pump to facilitate tracer mixing throughout the water column this was accomplished by pumping groundwater from the bottom of the 3 3m screen interval up to the ground surface the water was continuously re injected into the upper portion of the water column within the well approximately 125l 3 well volumes were recirculated to sufficiently mix the bromide tracer within the water column and to achieve the target bromide concentration of 500mg l within the well column once the bromide was mixed in the water column within injection well mw07 05r a bromide injection tracer test was initiated a 380l batch of 500mg l bromide solution 244g of nabr was mixed within a 380l conical bottom poly tank located adjacent to the injection well the solution was injected at a rate of approximately 75ml min for 8 5h on the first day of testing groundwater samples were collected from mw07 46rs and d every hour during this injection samples from the monitoring locations were collected by recirculating 0 6l of water from the dedicated sample pump to the surface and back into the sampling interval just below the bottom of the top bounding packer approximately 0 01l of sample were collected at the end of each 0 6l recirculation sampling was performed in this manner to minimize the removal of groundwater from the expected small fracture volume between the injection and monitoring well approximately 38l of bromide solution was injected during the first day of testing injection of bromide solution resumed on the second day of testing at a rate of 75ml min and was increased to 200ml min 3 3h into the second day of injection the injection continued overnight and concluded the morning of april 17 2014 groundwater samples were collected from the two monitoring well intervals every hour during the second day during business hours and once on the morning of the last day april 17th a total of approximately 300l of 500mg l bromide solution was injected during the tracer test at the completion of the bromide tracer tests approximately 182l of groundwater were extracted from the injection well to reduce the concentration of bromide in the groundwater in preparation of the borehole dilution testing the bromide concentration in the injection well following this extraction was 61mg l as a final hydraulic test a borehole dilution tracer test pitrak et al 2007 was performed to determine the ambient groundwater flowrate through the injection well the borehole dilution test was performed at injection well mw07 05r and was initiated approximate 13days after completing the bromide tracer test described above a 250ml solution containing 8 9g of nabr was added to the 3 3m interval below the packer to achieve a target bromide tracer concentration in the water column of 500mg l immediately following the addition of the sodium bromide tracer water was recirculated within the well using the dedicated bladder pump installed below the packer to facilitate tracer mixing throughout the 3 3m interval this was accomplished by pumping groundwater from near the bottom of the interval up to the ground surface the water was continuously re injected back through the packer to the top of the packer interval approximately 21l 3 well volumes was recirculated to sufficiently mix the bromide tracer within the interval bromide samples were collected from mw07 05r after recirculation time 0 and on days 4 11 19 and 25 samples were collected using the same low volume sampling methodology used for the tracer test 2 4 rock matrix characterization using rock core collected during installation of mw07 46r testing of the rock matrix was performed to determine the matrix porosity and abiotic dechlorination of tce through the rock this information was ultimately used to assess the fate and transport of tce through the rock matrix as discussed in section 3 rock core from a depth interval of 18 1 18 3m bgs was used targeting phyllitic rock core adjacent to water bearing zones the rock core adjacent to shallow and deep fractures is the demonstration area is described as a combination of both phyllite and quartzite and thus it is recognized that the rock sample used for the laboratory testing may not be completely representative of the entire rock matrix interrogated by the in situ rebound test described in section 2 5 rock samples were shipped to the laboratory and stored under anaerobic conditions until the initiation of testing the water accessible porosity of the rock matrix was determined using the water uptake method schaefer et al 2012b applied to a slice of rock a small slice of rock core approximately 40g was oven dried at 105 degrees c the rock was subsequently placed in a water bath with the very top of the rock face above the waterline to allow for escape of air during imbibition the water uptake experiment continued until moisture equilibrium was established the effective porosity was estimated by the mass of water taken up by the rock the ferrous mineral content of the rock matrix was determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline method amonette and templeton 1998 batch tests to determine the abiotic dechlorination of tce by naturally occurring ferrous minerals within the rock matrix were performed using laboratory methodology similar to that previously described schaefer et al 2015 where mercuric chloride was employed as a microbial inhibitor a previously developed model schaefer et al 2013 which incorporates the coupled diffusion and first order abiotic transformation of tce was used to provide a screening level estimate of the first order abiotic dechlorination rate constant based on the observed tce transformation products this transformation rate constant was ultimately used in the model to simulate the observed tce rebound from the rock matrix section 3 herein this methodology was used for screening purposes only to ultimately provide an estimate within a factor of 2 of the abiotic dechlorination rate constant additional details of this bench scale testing are provided in the supplemental materials 2 5 in situ rebound testing as illustrated in fig 1 an initial flushing step was intended to remove dissolved chlorinated solvent mass from the hydraulically conductive fractures prior to initiating flushing and approximately 12months following the hydraulic testing described in the previous section baseline samples were collected in the injection and monitoring shallow and deep intervals wells to determine chlorinated solvent concentrations and for compound specific isotopic analysis csia for carbon on both tce and dce flushing was performed by injecting hydrant water stored in a polyethylene tank via gravity drainage using a flow controller into the injection well at a constant flow rate of approximately 300ml min for 44days during the final 16days of this flushing water also was injected into each interval of monitoring well mw07 46r at a rate of 150ml min to enhance the removal of chlorinated solvents chlorinated solvent levels were monitored weekly to bi weekly in the shallow and deep monitoring locations during the flushing flushing ceased when tce and dce concentrations decreased by approximately 98 to 99 in the monitoring intervals following the flushing described above the rebound phase of the demonstration was initiated as indicated in fig 1 the rebound phase of the testing was accompanied by a slow injection of clean hydrant water into injection well mw07 05r a bromide tracer also was added to this injection water the purpose for injecting water without vocs was to prevent the migration of chlorinated solvents from upgradient thereby assuring that any observed increase in chlorinated solvents in the monitoring well was from contaminant mass residing between the injection well and the extraction well the injection rate used during the rebound phase was intended to limit excessive dilution while at the same time preventing up gradient impacts to the monitoring well from the low angle fractures intersecting the deep monitoring interval the injection well flow rate used for the rebound phase of the testing as well as the basis for this injection flow rate are discussed in the results the slow flushing rebound phase of the demonstration continued for 151days the shallow and deep monitoring intervals were sampled every 1 to 2months to determine the extent and rate of any increases in tce and dce at the final chlorinated solvent sampling event csia analyses was repeated for tce and dce to assess any changes that occurred during the contaminant rebound period 2 6 analytical methods bromide was analyzed via ion chromatography dionex dx 120 sunnyvale ca groundwater analyses of volatile organic compounds vocs was performed using mass spectrometry via epa method 8260b revision 2 usepa 1996a the practical quantification limit for vocs was 5Œºg l csia analysis for carbon on both tce and dce was performed by pace analytical pittsburgh pa for the bench scale rock matrix testing only headspace analyses were preformed see the supplemental materials headspace was analyzed for chlorinated ethene and reduced gases using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector as described previously schaefer et al 2015 aqueous concentration were calculated based on the headspace data using henry s law 3 model to describe tce back diffusion from the rock matrix results from the rebound testing were carefully assessed so as to provide insight into the mechanisms potentially responsible for the increases in any observed tce concentrations to determine if the observed tce rebound during the demonstration was potentially due to rock matrix back diffusion a semi analytical model was developed to describe the back diffusion of tce from the rock matrix into the 3 fracture planes connecting the injection well mw07 05r to the deep interval of the monitoring well mw07 46r as described in detail in the supplemental materials the model considers a well mixed fracture network conveying a volumetric groundwater flow entering from the injection well to the deep interval of the monitoring well using diffusion and abiotic dechlorination rates based on rock matrix characterization described in section 2 4 the diffusive flux and resultant concentration of tce into the 3 transmissive fractures and ultimately the monitoring well was estimated as a function of time during the slow flushing rebound phase of testing previous studies schaefer et al 2013 2015 suggest that the abiotic dechlorination rate constant will remain constant for the timescale of the current field experiment thus the dechlorination rate constants used in the model were assumed constant 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic and tracer testing while pumping at mw07 46rs or d during the short term pumping tests drawdown 31 7cm when pumping the shallow zone and 16 8cm when pumping the deep zone was observed in well mw07 05r indicating a direct hydraulic connection between select water bearing fractures in each of these wells the hydraulic connection while pumping that was observed in the shallow zone likely was attributable to the presence of high angle fractures that intersected the nearly horizontal fractures connecting the injection well and the deep monitoring interval bromide data for the deep interval for mw07 46r are provided in fig 2 no measurable increases in bromide were observed in the shallow interval indicating that a solute flow path despite observing a hydraulic connection during the short term pumping tests does not exist between the injection well mw07 05r and the shallow interval of mw07 46r under the hydraulic conditions of the bromide tracer test bromide tracer results indicated that bromide appeared rapidly approximately 3 5h in mw07 05rd the bromide concentration in the deep interval increased linearly with the injected volume to estimate the fracture aperture along the fracture flow path from the injection well to the deep interval of mw07 46r radial fracture flow emanating from the injection well is assumed which is a reasonable assumption given the geometry of the identified fractures the fracture aperture a is calculated as follows 1 a v b nœÄ r 2 where vb is the volume of tracer injected until tracer is observed in the monitoring well 16 000cm3 n is the number of fractures in the deep interval 3 based on visual and geophysical boring logs and r is the radial distance between the injection and monitoring well 240cm eq 1 results in an estimated fracture aperture of 0 029cm 290Œºm assuming 3 hydraulically conductive fractures with an aperture of 0 029cm each intersect the injection well along its 330cm depth interval the effective fracture porosity in the deep interval is 0 00026 these parameters were used in the back diffusion model results of the borehole dilution test performed in mw07 05r are provided in fig 3 the rate of bromide decay in the injection well provides an estimate of the darcy velocity the darcy velocity is calculated by first determining the ambient flow rate into the test well as follows pitrak et al 2007 nordqvist et al 2008 2 ln c c 0 q a v iw t where c is the bromide concentration at time t c0 is the initial bromide concentration in the injection well borehole qa is ambient flow rate into the well and t is the time viw is the water volume of the injection well including the porosity within the sandpack which is approximately 12 000cm3 linear regression of the data to eq 2 is shown in fig 3 with a resulting ambient flow rate into the well qa of 564cm3 day 0 39cm3 min the darcy flow of the aquifer is subsequently calculated as nordqvist et al 2008 3 q d q a 2 r iw l s Œ± where qd is the darcy velocity riw is the borehole radius of injection well mw07 05r ls is the length interval of the sand pack 3 3m and Œ± is flow convergence correction factor estimated at 2 the calculated value of qd is 0 091cm day average over the 3 3m interval of mw07 05r using the calculated effective porosity of 0 00026 the linear velocity is 350cm day resulting in a travel time of 16h between the injection and extraction wells under ambient no injecting conditions the ambient darcy flow was used to determine the injection flow rate needed to hydraulically isolate mw07 46rd during the rebound phase of the testing based on the ambient darcy flow 0 091cm day determined during the borehole dilution testing the ambient flow intersecting the 3 3m open interval in mw07 05r and out a radial distance of 2 4m is approximately 10cm3 min to hydraulically isolate mw07 46rd located at a radial distance of 2 4m away from the injection well the injection flow rate would need to be at least equal to 10cm3 min this provides a very conservative estimate for hydraulic control at twice the ambient volumetric flow the residence time between the injection and monitoring well during the rebound injection phase was approximately half that as under ambient conditions thus the target injection flow rate during the rebound phase was set at 20cm3 min to hydraulically isolate the monitoring well and prevent up gradient tce from impacting the well based on the 3 5h residence time observed during the 75cm3 min injection that occurred during the first day of the tracer test the residence time during the 20cm3 min flow rate during the slow injection rebound phase was estimated to be approximately 13h 4 2 rock properties results from the water uptake method showed that the rock matrix porosity was approximately 3 9 this value is within the range expected for quartzite winograd and thordarson 1975 and was used in the matrix diffusion model based on previously published correlations for rock that are based on the water accessible porosity boving and grathwohl 2001 the estimated effective diffusion coefficient for tce through the rock is 1 4 10 3 cm2 d abiotic dechlorination was observed in the bench scale batch testing as indicated by generation of propane and ethane in a molar ratio of approximately 4 1 fig 4 it is noted that the tce dechlorination was based on transformation product generation as only a trace fraction of the tce present 2 10 7 was transformed in the batch experiment these results are similar to previous observations of tce abiotic dechlorination in sedimentary rock schaefer et al 2015 applying a previously developed coupled diffusion and first order dechlorination model for tce in these bench scale experiments schaefer et al 2013 2015 the bulk first order tce abiotic degradation rate constant defined as the first order rate constant multiplied by the linear sorption coefficient and the rock density of 2 6g cm3 in the rock matrix is estimated as 2 3 10 3 day 1 this value falls within the range observed in previous studies using sedimentary rock that were based on a minimum of 4 sampling points schaefer et al 2013 2015 the ferrous mineral content of the rock matrix was 510mg kg which also falls within the range of ferrous mineral content for rocks with measurable abiotic dechlorination schaefer et al 2015 it is noted that this regressed rate constant is considered only a screening value within a factor of 2 as the number of data points to which it was regressed is limited fig 4 the first order rate constant estimated from this bench scale experiment was used in the field scale matrix back diffusion model described in section 3 and the supplemental materials 4 3 assessment of rebound due to the lack of tracer observed at the shallow monitoring interval during the hydraulic testing rebound monitoring focused on mw07 46rd initial flushing performed prior to rebound resulted in a decrease in tce concentration of approximately 99 from baseline conditions to the end of the 44day flushing period in mw07 46rd increases in tce relative to baseline plotted as a function of time during the rebound phase are shown in fig 5 results show that tce concentrations increased with time indicating that there was a persistent contaminant source present between the demonstration wells that was not removed during the flushing the data collected over 151days of rebound testing are unclear as to whether or not tce concentrations were stable or still increasing tce concentrations increased nearly 5 fold during the rebound period under ambient flow conditions with approximately twice the residence time between the injection and monitoring well compared to that during the slow injection phase the tce concentration even in the absence of up gradient impacts would likely have increased by nearly another factor of two thus the flushing of contaminant mass from the fractures over 44days had only temporarily limited the impacts of tce in the conductive fractures as substantial contaminant rebound occurred potential sources of contaminant mass responsible for the observed rebound include the rock matrix residual dnapl sources and or low transmissivity zones within the targeted fracture planes the rebound model was used to determine if the observed tce rebound could potentially be explained based on rock matrix back diffusion as shown in fig 5 if tce abiotic dechlorination is included in the model the observed rebound is reasonably described by the model in terms of magnitude within 20 of the observed data for the last 3 sampling events although the trend in the data is not as well described by the model excluding abiotic dechlorination results in a more substantial over prediction of the data at early times deviations between the model prediction and the experimental data likely reflect the complexities associated with attempting to estimate the fracture aperture and mixing within the borehole interval these deviations highlight the difficulties in attempting to accurately model fracture matrix interactions for even these very tightly spaced wells and limit the ability of the model to convincingly demonstrate that the mechanism of the observed rebound is due to matrix back diffusion for example if there were only two fractures connecting the injection to the extraction well instead of 3 which could be the case if 1 of the observed fractures at each borehole was local only to the borehole and not interconnected the simulated tce concentrations in fig 5 would decrease by approximately 33 and excluding abiotic reactions would result in an improved model description of the data at later times thus use of the back diffusion model can only suggest that the rock matrix is a plausible source for the observed rebound and that abiotic dechlorination with the rock matrix see the discussion beginning in the following paragraph potentially played a role in mitigating rebound from the rock matrix neglecting abiotic dechlorination results in a small but significant up to 35 difference in c c0 difference in the model thus any uncertainties owed to uncertainties in the regressed first order abiotic dechlorination rate constant fig 3 including differences in the rate constant due to temperature differences between the ambient groundwater and the room temperature conditions present during the bench scale rock testing have a minimal impact on the overall model results thus use of the model alone as evidence for abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix is not warranted due to the uncertainties inherent within the model comparison of the csia carbon data for both tce and dce are provided in table 2 comparison of the carbon isotopes and relative concentrations of tce and dce between baseline and post rebound conditions provide useful information although caution is warranted as only one set of pre and post testing csia analysis was performed first the molar tce dce ratio decreases from approximately 4 1 at baseline to 1 1 at the end of rebound in addition comparison of baseline to post rebound csia data show that the tce becomes heavier and the dce becomes lighter together these results suggest that the origin of the observed rebound was from a source that had become enriched in dce likely due to the biotic reductive dechlorination of tce to dce and possibly the abiotic dechlorination of tce previous studies have shown that the abiotic dechlorination rate of tce is greater than that of dce lee and batchelor 2002 2004 thus abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix likely would cause a decrease in the tce dce ratio these results also provide a line of evidence to confirm that the observed increases in tce are not from a lack of hydraulic control from the injection well and infiltration of upgradient tce and dce as such lack of hydraulic control would not result in the observed shift in tce dce ratio the net isotopic enrichment for tce and dce considering the mass balance on the fracture shown in fig s2 is calculated as follows 4 Œ¥ x tce Œ¥ 13 c tce x dce Œ¥ 13 c dce rebound x tce Œ¥ 13 c tce x dce Œ¥ 13 c dce baseline where Œ¥ is the molar weighted isotopic enrichment of tce dce between baseline and the end of rebound x is the mole fraction of either tce or dce in the groundwater and Œ¥13 is the 13c isotopic level in either the tce or dce this isotopic mass balance approach used to assess potential transformation of monitored compounds s to unidentified compounds has been previously employed for chlorinated ethenes and ethene mundle et al 2012 the change in conditions from baseline to the final rebound in eq 4 is due to the difference in contaminants that emanated from upgradient baseline compared to contaminants that emanated from presumably the rock matrix final rebound event thus eq 4 is an isotopic balance comparing 13c originally coming in to the fracture test zone compared to 13c coming from the rock matrix within the test zone as shown in table 2 tce and dce together are enriched when comparing baseline to rebound values with no transformation other than the biotic dechlorination of tce to dce the 13c would have expected to be conserved in tce and dce thus Œ¥ would be expected to be zero a positive value of Œ¥ suggests that additional tce and or dce transformation reactions were occurring within the source of the observed rebound based on the average time scale of the rebound period and the measured tce abiotic dechlorination rate constant of 2 3 10 3 day 1 measured in our bench scale testing a 21 decrease in tce would have been expected which results in an enrichment factor of 52 based on Œ¥ in table 2 this value is in reasonable agreement with the abiotic tce enrichment factor of 33 table s3 measured by liang et al 2007 using fes solids thus the enrichment factors observed in these two studies are in reasonable agreement vc was observed at 0 19Œºm but this relatively low quantity of generated vc could not account for the observed isotopic shift as the vc would have needed to have a Œ¥13 vc value of 325 for Œ¥ to be zero if vinyl chloride were included in the isotopic balance in eq 2 it is possible that some of the generated vc was subsequently biologically mineralized within the conductive fractures as the injected water during the rebound phase likely contained dissolved oxygen however multiple lines of evidence suggest that aerobic biotransformation of vc was negligible during this study as discussed below first during the initial 28days of flushing when the rate of dissolved oxygen delivery to the subsurface likely was the greatest 15 times greater injection rate than during the slow injection used during the rebound portion of the test both tce and vc were removed at approximately the same relative rate with an observed half live of removal due to flushing of approximately 10days if vc aerobic biotic transformation occurred with a half life of 20days an observable increase in the rate of vc removal compared to tce would have been readily observed during this flushing phase the residence time in the test system time of travel between the injection well and monitoring well and time needed to flush the deep monitoring well interval was approximately 40days this is based on the tracer data borehole dilution data and bromide tracer concentrations observed during the rebound testing even if vc was being biotically transformed with a half life of 20days the measured vc levels indicate that only 14 of the dce would have been biotically transformed to vc or subsequent products which is still a small fraction for an isotopic balance Œ¥ 0 in eq 4 and applying the rayleigh equation an enrichment factor of 80 would be needed for the biotransformation of dce to vc and any subsequent biotransformation products if such biotransformation of vc was included enrichment factors for dce biotransformation to vc have been shown to be 16 table s3 abe et al 2009 bloom et al 2000 thus it is unlikely that aerobic biotransformation of vc is responsible for the net enrichment shown in table 2 as a second line of evidence trace 0 09 to 0 8Œºm levels of xylenes were present in the groundwater the observed rate of rebound of the xylenes exceeded that of tce although precise quantification is uncertain because of the elevated detection limits due to the sample dilution used for the elevated tce levels xylenes are very susceptible to aerobic biotransformation schaefer et al 2010 thus substantial rebound of the xylenes suggests that conditions in the subsurface likely were not conducive to aerobic biodegradation despite any dissolved oxygen that may have been introduced in the injected water it is far more likely that consistent with the bench scale testing that demonstrated the abiotic dechlorination of tce within the rock matrix that the positive value of Œ¥ was due to the abiotic dechlorination of tce and or dce damgaard et al 2013b employed a similar reasoning as a line of evidence that the abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes were occurring in clay matrices although high resolution sampling of the clay matrix was employed in their study whereas much more limited sampling of the adjacent fracture zone was employed in the current study thus the isotopic enrichment of tce dce for the rebound data not only provides a line of evidence that abiotic dechlorination is occurring within the rock matrix but that these data also are consistent with the contaminant mass within the rock matrix serving as the source of the observed rebound if residual dnapl present along the fracture flow path was the primary source of the rebound an observed isotopic shift as well as a decrease in molar tce dce ratio would not have been expected it is possible that the molar shift in the tce dce ratio is due to slow mass transfer from low permeability zones within the fracture plane however it is unlikely although possible that release from low permeability zones within the fracture plane would result in the isotopic shifts observed as the abiotic dechlorination reactions responsible for such shifts are likely located within the rock matrix schaefer et al 2013 while studying the biogeochemical conditions of a clay matrix adjacent to fractures and sand lenses damgaard et al 2013b observed that conditions within the clay matrix were in some cases more conducive to biological reductive dechlorination than in the adjacent higher permeability zones lima et al 2012 also observed dechlorinating bacteria in the rock matrix of sandstones suggesting if rock pore diameters are sufficiently large or microfractures are present that biotic dechlorination can occur within the rock matrix thus it is plausible that the enhanced tce to dce transformation as well as the isotopic enrichment were due in part to biotic reductive dechlorination in the rock matrix that was naturally enhanced compared to that in that in the hydraulically conductive fractures however as described previously biotic transformation alone cannot explain the discrepancy in isotopic balance eq 4 in addition any biotic tce to dce transformation likely had a minimal impact on tce concentrations in the rock matrix the following form of the rayleigh equation is used to express the expected change in tce concentration based on the isotopic enrichment of the biotic dechlorination product dce 5a ln c dce c dce 0 Œ¥ 13 c t Œ¥ 13 c 0 œµ 5b c tce c tce 0 0 24 c dce c dce 0 where ctce 0 and ctce are the tce concentrations moles at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively cdce 0 and cdce are the dce concentrations moles at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively Œ¥13c0 and Œ¥13ct are the dce 13c isotopic levels at baseline and at the end of rebound respectively per mil Œµ is the isotopic enrichment factor per mil and the factor of 0 24 represents the molar dce tce ratio at baseline conditions only trace levels of vinyl chloride were observed in the field thus dce effectively served as the final biotic dechlorination product using an isotopic enrichment factor of 8 for the biotic dechlorination of tce in the rock matrix table s3 bloom et al 2000 liang et al 2007 and even making the assumption that the dce isotopic enrichment was solely from biotic mechanisms only a 12 decrease in tce concentration is expected based on eqs 5a and 5b thus biotic transformation likely had a negligible impact on tce concentrations in the rock matrix for the duration of the rebound the observed change in the tce dce ratio cannot be explained by any difference in the aqueous diffusion coefficient between these compounds as the aqueous diffusion coefficient for tce and dce differs by only 20 usepa 1996b in addition the diffusion model shows that the chlorinated ethene concentrations in the rock matrix near the fracture interface where mass was exchanged during the flushing and rebound phases were 20 of the initial chlorinated ethene concentration in the fractures table s2 and the chlorinated ethene concentrations in the fracture at the end of the rebound period were 5 of those in the rock matrix at these relative concentrations it has been shown labolle et al 2008 that carbon isotopic enrichment due to diffusion would be negligible compared to the enrichment shown in table 2 it is noted that the baseline dce was heavier than the baseline tce which is not expected if the dce was present at baseline due to the ongoing dechlorination of tce and without appreciable continued biotic dechlorination of dce to vinyl chloride vc vc molar concentrations at baseline were approximately 70 times less than molar dce concentrations possible explanations the baseline dce was heavier than the baseline tce include a separate upgradient dce source where dce was not generated from tce and or the upgradient generation of dce from transformation of a tca source 4 4 implications for treatment and site assessment the csia data laboratory batch testing and matrix back diffusion model together provided lines of evidence that the observed contaminant rebound was due to matrix back diffusion reliance on any one of these approaches alone would have not provided a convincing argument for the rebound mechanism thus use of this integrated approach has provides potential means to improve conceptual site models the lack of strong agreement between the back diffusion model prediction and the tce rebound data highlight the challenges associated with applying back diffusion models even at very small scales and the increased challenges associated with application of more complex models e g west and kueper 2010 over much greater length and time scales in addition consistent with observations in clay performed by damgaard et al 2013b the observed carbon isotopic enrichment during rebound from the rock matrix suggests that such isotopic analyses may serve as a useful line of evidence in identifying abiotic dechlorination processes in rock matrices while previously performed ex situ bench scale testing to measure abiotic dechlorination in rock matrices has been limited to the core scale darlington et al 2013 schaefer et al 2013 the approach described herein allows for interrogation of a much greater extent of the rock matrix in situ csia analysis performed on rock cores compared to csia analysis on groundwater in adjacent hydraulically active fractures might also serve as a useful approach to identify the carbon isotopic enrichment due to naturally occurring dechlorination reactions within the rock matrix 5 conclusions the in situ field testing approach discussed herein provided a means to assess contaminant rebound and abiotic dechlorination in the rock matrix following removal of contaminants present in hydraulically conductive zones discrete interval tracer testing using groundwater sampling that limited extraction from the wells along with rock core logging and borehole geophysical data were utilized to estimate the groundwater velocity and fracture aperture between the injection and monitoring locations tce rebound was reasonably described using a rock matrix back diffusion model in addition decreases in the molar tce dce ratio and carbon isotopic enrichment following rebound provided lines of evidence that the rock matrix was the source of the observed contaminant rebound thus abiotic dechlorination within the rock matrix can provide evidence that the rock matrix is in fact the source of observed contaminant rebound although the limited isotopic data set warrants caution with the data interpretation carbon isotopic enrichment observed during rock matrix back diffusion was consistent with bench scale testing suggesting that csia analysis may serve as a useful tool for confirming naturally occurring abiotic dechlorination reactions in situ it is noted that the approach used herein may prove challenging if fracture flow paths cannot be readily discerned or if residual non aqueous sources are present in sufficient quantity such that dissolved concentrations are not substantially reduced

1684,groundwater denitrification bioreactors under limited phosphorus conditions were studied in column experiments using four types of plant chips when the phosphate p concentration in the influent increased from 0 04mg l to 0 4mg l the nitrate removal ratio increased from 61 6 to 86 1 in reed from 7 2 to 12 6 in japanese cedar from 37 0 to 73 6 in moso bamboo and from 19 2 to 50 5 in lithocarpus edulis the carbon source of the denitrifiers growth was indicated by the content of acid detergent soluble organic matter in the chips furthermore according to the modified michaelis menten type equation proposed in the study the denitrification rate was largely limited by the phosphate p concentration in reed and l eduilis and by the dissolved organic carbon doc in japanese cedar denitrification in moso bamboo was affected by both phosphate p and doc besides the doc phosphorus emerged as an important limiting element of denitrification in some bioreactor plant chips keywords denitrification nitrate phosphate plant chips dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater is a serious global environmental problem compromising the eutrophication of waterbodies and the health of human bathers nitrate is mainly sourced from fertilization livestock excretion and domestic wastewater bedessem et al 2005 korom 1992 nitrate contamination is especially widespread in areas with intensive agricultural activities cey et al 1999 trudell et al 1986 denitrification is among the most promising natural ways of removing nitrate from basin water gibert et al 2008 the transformation of nitrate into nitrogen gas is aided by a group of microorganisms called denitrifiers which are numerous in the natural discharge areas of local groundwater namely riparian zones and wetlands cey et al 1999 hill et al 2000 korom 1992 additionally denitrification requires an anaerobic or restricted oxygen environment and an electron donor such as organic carbon korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 in denitrification walls that enhance the removal of nitrate from groundwater the carbon is typically sourced from woodchips sawdust branch leaf compost robertson and anderson 1999 robertson et al 2000 schipper and vojvodic vukovic 1998 schipper et al 2004 2010a because they operate for over a decade denitrification bioreactors are both cost effective and feasible long et al 2011 robertson et al 2008 the denitrification rates of different types of plant chips have been reported in laboratory studies robertson 2010 found that the denitrification rate is 41 60 lower in 7year old woodchips than in fresh woodchips the performance of the woodchips was reduced by half in the first year before stabilizing under the release of dissolved organic carbon doc robertson 2010 although maize cobs and wheat straw have higher denitrification rates than wood they tend to produce large amounts of ammonium and increase the biochemical oxygen demand in the effluents cameron and schipper 2010 softwood and hardwood efficiently remove nitrate from groundwater but coniferous mulch willow compost and leaves perform poorly in the denitrification permeable reactive barrier gibert et al 2008 this suggests that the biodegradability of the plant chips affects their denitrification efficiency in a bioreactor system the performances of bioreactors with plant chips strongly depend on the available phosphorus and organic carbon in the system the operating temperature and the nitrate concentration in the influent in general phosphorus and organic carbon are limited in subsurface and groundwater environments bedessem et al 2005 flores lopez et al 2013 hunter 2003 piao et al 2016 as is well known phosphate is important for the metabolism and growth of denitrifiers under low phosphate conditions the nitrate removal efficiency is low and the nitrate is transformed into nitrite or nitrous oxide rather than nitrogen gas indicating that the denitrification is incomplete hunter 2003 zhang et al 2015 in general phosphorous is easily absorbed in the vadose zone as evidenced by its much higher retardation than nitrate robertson et al 1998 hence low phosphate and high nitrate groundwater typifies agricultural regions with high fertilizer usage under these conditions bioreactors constructed with plant chips are unlikely to successfully treat groundwater nevertheless many bioreactor models have considered the temperature nitrate organic carbon and oxygen conditions while ignoring the effect of phosphorus on denitrification processes cameron and schipper 2010 ghane et al 2015 gu et al 2007 halaburka et al 2017 respirable carbon is positively correlated with denitrification rate warneke et al 2011b and plant chips with lower c n ratio and less lignification are more efficient for denitrification greenan et al 2006 the decomposition characteristics of organic substances can be effectively determined by acid detergent analysis consequently the acid detergent soluble organic matter adsom is available as readily decomposable organic matter for microbial growth fujiwara et al 2009 however few studies have evaluated the available carbon associated with the decomposition characteristics of plant chips during denitrification the denitrification rate is hypothesized to increase exponentially with temperature a 10 c rise in temperature would increase the denitrification rate by 0 8 4 7 fold depending on the plant chips used cameron and schipper 2010 ghane et al 2015 schmidt and clark 2013 warneke et al 2011b therefore temperature is the most important factor in groundwater nitrate remediation similarly the nitrate kinetics in denitrification constitute a simple zero order first order or michaelis menten reaction when the denitrification rate is constant and independent of the nitrate concentration it is modeled by the simple zero order reaction robertson 2010 robertson et al 2008 schipper et al 2010b warneke et al 2011a to evaluate the effects of limiting factors such as nitrate organic carbon and phosphate on the denitrification rate the coupled michaelis menten model is preferred modeling the denitrification rate will increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of denitrification by plant chips and reveal the importance of phosphate p in groundwater in column experiments of four kinds of plant chips the present study estimates the nitrate removal ratio in the chips discusses the effects of phosphate p and decomposable organic matter on the denitrification process and comprehensively evaluates the denitrification rate by a modified michaelis menten equation under limited phosphorus conditions in terms of the adsom it also quantifies the effect of organic carbon on the denitrification of

dissolved n2o n concentrations were similar in the influent and effluent but no2 n was detected at 0 3 to 0 5mg l from days 13 to 25 of the experiments in general the nitrate removal efficiency was affected by both the phosphorous content and type of plant chips used in the effluents of the np50 solutions the no3 n concentration ranged from 0 0 to 5 9mg l in reed run 2 from 15 4 to 19 2mg l in japanese cedar run 3 from 0 0 to 10 5mg l in moso bamboo run 4 and from 5 1 to 16 5mg l in l eduilis run 5 in the effluents of the np100 solution the no3 n ranged from 0 0 to 5 9mg l in reed run 6 from 17 3 to 19 1mg l in japanese cedar run 7 from 0 0 to 11 2mg l in moso bamboo run 8 and from 9 0 to 16 7mg l in l eduilis run 9 in those of the np500 solutions the no3 n concentrations ranged from 0 0 to 10 2mg l in reed run 10 from 18 4 to 19 5mg l in japanese cedar run 11 from 4 6 to 15 0mg l in moso bamboo run 12 and from 15 4 to 17 7mg l in l eduilis run 13 overall the lowest and highest nitrate concentrations were found in the effluents from reed and japanese cedar respectively that is the nitrate removal efficiencies largely differed among the plant chips moreover in japanese cedar the nitrate removal efficiency was insensitive to n p ratio fig 2 in the effluents from the reed column no2 n was detected at 0 4 1 0mg l on days 13 25 and 29 in run 2 at 0 2mg l on day 9 in run 6 and at 0 5mg l on day 9 in run 10 in the effluents from the japanese cedar column the no2 n ranged from 0 3 to 1 0mg l from the beginning until day 13 in run 3 from 0 2 to 0 3mg l until day 9 in run 7 and from 0 2 to 0 5mg l throughout the experiment in run 11 in the effluents from the moso bamboo column no no2 n was detected in run 4 but the no2 n concentration ranged from 0 2 to 4 6mg l from the beginning until day 13 in run 8 and from 0 3 to 6 7mg l throughout the whole experiment in run 12 the no2 n concentrations of the effluents from the l eduilis column were approximately 2 1mg l or less in runs 5 and 9 and ranged from 0 1 to 1 2mg l in run 13 in the column effluents from reed the dissolved n2o n concentrations remained below 0 15mg l in runs 6 and 10 but were detected at high values on days 25 and 29 1 06 and 2 08mg l respectively in run 2 in the column effluents from japanese cedar the average dissolved n2o n concentration was as low as 0 04mg l in run 11 but was approximately 10 times higher in runs 3 and 7 in the effluents from moso bamboo it remained below 0 19mg l in the effluents from l eduilis the dissolved no2 n concentrations remained below 0 05mg l in run 5 rising to 0 34mg l on day 17 in run 9 they remained at 0 40mg l from the beginning until day 9 then fell to below 0 03mg l in run 13 they remained below 0 13mg l with little changes throughout the experimental period 3 4 carbon species and phosphate p concentration fig 3 shows the variations of hco3 c co2 aq c doc and phosphate p in the influents np50 np100 and np500 and effluents runs 1 13 throughout the experimental period the phosphate p concentrations in the influents of np50 np100 and np500 were 0 40mg l 0 20mg l and 0 04mg l respectively meanwhile the influent hco3 c co2 aq c and doc concentrations were approximately 28 9mg l 2 3mg l and 2 3mg l respectively in the gravel effluent run 1 the effluent concentrations 29 3mg l hco3 c 2 7mg l co2 aq c and 3 1mg l doc were similar to the influent concentrations however the phosphate p concentration in the gravel effluent run 1 was approximately 0 20mg l on day 5 rising to 0 35mg l on day 29 this indicates that some phosphate p was absorbed by the gravel in reed the effluent hco3 c concentrations ranged from 42 0 to 46 8mg l run 2 from 39 0 to 46 8mg l run 6 and from 37 2 to 45 6mg l run 10 in moso bamboo they ranged from 36 0 to 45 6mg l run 4 from 35 4 to 43 2mg l run 8 and from 33 6 to 36 0mg l run 12 in japanese cedar they ranged from 27 6 to 34 8mg l run 3 and from 28 8 to 31 2mg l runs 7 and 11 in the l eduilis effluents the hco3 c concentrations were lower than the influent values over the first 5days then varied from 32 4 to 44 4mg l in run 5 from 33 6 to 38 4mg l in run 9 and from 30 0 to 34 8mg l in run 13 among the four types of plant chips the hco3 c concentrations were highest in reed and lowest in japanese cedar fig 3 regardless of phosphate p content the effluent co2 aq c concentrations ranged from 5 3 to 12 9mg l in reed 2 4 to 9 6mg l in japanese cedar and 5 4 to 14 0mg l in moso bamboo in the effluents from l eduilis the co2 aq c concentrations ranged from 6 0 to 14 4mg l with three exceptions 20 4mg l on day 5 and 18 2mg l on day 13 in run 5 and 32 8mg l on day 5 in run 9 the doc concentrations in the effluents from all plant chips were highest during the first 5days and decreased thereafter the average doc concentrations were 16 3mg l in reed 6 1mg l in japanese cedar 17 0mg l in moso bamboo and 12 3mg l in l eduilis in the effluents from the np50 solutions of reed and moso bamboo the phosphate p concentration was below 0 04mg l throughout the first 13days thereafter it increased to around 0 14mg l in reed run 2 in moso bamboo it increased to 0 19mg l on day 21 then decreased to 0 08mg l on day 29 run 4 in the effluents from the l eduilis column run 5 the phosphate p concentration was as high as 0 29mg l during the first 5days then decreased to 0 02mg l on day 13 and partially recovered to 0 20mg l thereafter the phosphate p concentration was higher in japanese cedar than in the other plant chips exceeding 0 30mg l after day 17 over the experimental period the average phosphate p concentrations in the effluents from the np100 solutions were 0 01mg l in reed run 6 0 13mg l in japanese cedar run 7 0 01mg l in moso bamboo run 8 and 0 03mg l in l eduilis run 9 the phosphate p concentrations in all effluents of the np500 solutions were below 0 01mg l therefore the fluctuations in the effluent phosphate p concentrations from each plant chip reduced with increasing n p ratio i e with decreasing inlet phosphate in the experimental solutions fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of phosphate p on denitrification as the concentrations of both do and no3 n decreased in the effluents see figs 1 and 2 the microorganisms likely utilized doc for aerobic respiration in the first part of the column and for denitrification in the remainder of the column in the aerobic phase the microorganisms decompose the organic carbon reducing the do and increasing the dissolved inorganic carbon dic at sufficiently low do concentrations the column environment became anaerobic or o2 limited in the anaerobic phase the denitrifiers predominantly reduced no3 n to n2 gas with production of dic hco3 co2 aq in fact no2 n and n2o n were the intermediate products of denitrification fig 2 the influent phosphate p concentration did not affect the do concentrations of the effluents from the plant chip columns but largely influenced the change of nitrogen budget in each column table 3 to estimate the nitrogen budgets the nitrate removal ratios were calculated as the quotients of the amounts of no3 n removed differences between the inflow and outflow no3 n and the no3 n inflows obviously the no3 n was reduced to no2 n n2o n or n2 within the column depending on the denitrifying processes the amounts of no2 n and n2o n were estimated from the measured data and the n2 n2 cal was calculated by subtracting the sum of no2 n and n2o n from the amount of no3 n removed a high n2 cal value indicates that the intermediate products no2 n and n2o n were not rapidly reduced to n2 gas during the denitrification with increasing phosphate p in the influent the nitrate removal ratio increased from 61 6 to 86 1 in reed from 37 0 to 73 6 in moso bamboo and from 19 2 to 50 5 in l eduilis the change in japanese cedar 7 2 to 12 6 was smaller than in the other plant chips also owing to the no2 n or n2o n products the n2 cal ratio in the japanese cedar column was below 77 7 in contrast the n2 cal ratio was 96 in reed and 89 in l eduilis suggesting that denitrification was almost completed in these columns in the moso bamboo columns the n2 cal ratio was 99 8 in run 4 and 92 6 in run 8 but decreased to 74 3 in run 12 when the no2 n ratio reached 25 0 a similar phenomenon was reported in column experiments of soybean oil emulsion as an organic carbon source hunter 2003 probably because the nitrite reductase synthesis was restricted relative to the nitrate reductase synthesis blaszczyk 1993 the nitrate removal efficiency obviously decreased with increasing n p ratio in the experimental solutions to maintain high denitrification performance the phosphate p concentration in the influent must exceed 0 2mg l i e the n p ratio must be below 100 however the phosphate p concentration of groundwater is below 0 2mg l in most agricultural regions burkart et al 2004 carlyle and hill 2001 domagalski and johnson 2011 flores lopez et al 2013 piao et al 2016 therefore phosphate p should be regarded as the limiting factor in the performance of groundwater nitrate treatment by plant chip based bioreactors 4 2 relationship between nitrate removal efficiency and decomposition characteristics of the plant chips among the four types of plant chips the nitrate removal efficiency decreased in the order reed moso bamboo lithocarpus eduilis japanese cedar table 3 most microorganisms cannot directly access the carbon in the polymeric organic compounds of plant chips instead they utilize the low molecular weight organic carbon produced by hydrolyzing microorganisms primarily fungi in the plant chips throughout the experiments the doc concentrations were higher in the effluents of plant chips than in the influents indicating that hydrolysis reactions occurred within the plant chip columns fig 3 we may also reasonably consider that the variations in doc concentration largely depend on the decomposition characteristics of the plant chips the total carbon content in all plant chips was almost constant 50drywt throughout the experiments so was clearly uninvolved in the decomposition rate and nitrate removal efficiency in contrast the adf and adsom contents differed among the plant chips table 2 in general the adf accounts for the sum of cellulose and lignin and the adsom corresponds to the organic matter containing hemicelluloses other than adf fujiwara et al 2009 as is well known the hemicellulose in plant chips is more easily hydrolyzed than cellulose and lignin p√©rez et al 2002 consequently the nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing adsom and its standard deviation which varied from 0 17 to 0 44 depended on phosphate p concentration fig 4a this suggests that the adsom is a useful indicator of nitrate removal efficiency and the supply of organic carbon available for denitrification to calculate the average decomposition rate of the plant chips the change in the sum of the generated doc and dic is divided by the total amount of organic carbon consumed per unit time the average decomposition rates were 0 031 0 036mg g h in reed 0 007 0 01mg g h in japanese cedar 0 014 0 02mg g h in moso bamboo and 0 011 0 016mg g h in l eduilis the average decomposition rate clearly increased with increasing adsom content fig 4b interestingly the coefficient of variation of the decomposition rate in each plant chip was relatively small 0 08 0 22 suggesting that the phosphate p in the influents little affected the plant chip decomposition according to the adsom results reed exhibited the highest nitrate removal efficiency whereas japanese cedar had a longer durability than the other plant chips therefore the plant chip should be appropriately selected to suit the availability cost and reaction rate of the treatment schipper et al 2010b 4 3 effect of phosphate p and doc concentration on denitrification rate in previous column experiments of solid organic substrates the denitrification rates nitrate removal rates ranged from 0 3 to 11 5mg n l h table 4 this diversity has been predominantly attributed to differences in temperature nitrate inlet concentration and water velocity residence time the effect of phosphate p in the influent has been ignored overall the denitrification rate is higher in bioreactors using herbaceous plant chips than in bioreactors using woody plant chips schipper et al 2010b probably due to differences in the plant decomposition rate which supplies the doc as discussed above in our experiments the final denitrification rates were 1 0 1 9mg n l h in reed 0 2mg n l h in japanese cedar 0 6 1 5mg n l h in moso bamboo and 0 5 1 3mg n l h in l eduilis similar tendencies have been reported in previous studies however phosphorus has been a neglected element in denitrification studies despite its importance and low concentration in groundwater the michaelis menten model effectively describes the overall microbial kinetics especially those related to denitrification in the michaelis menten formulation the heterotrophic denitrification rate v is upper bounded by oxygen inhibition nitrate limitation and carbon limitation gu et al 2007 halaburka et al 2017 as described above the denitrification rates of plant chips v also depend on the available phosphate p therefore the conventional michaelis menten equation was modified by adding a phosphate limitation term 3 v v max p k p p c k c c n k n n k i k i o where v max is the maximum denitrification rate mg n l h p c n and o are the concentrations of phosphate p doc nitrate n and do respectively mg l and k p k c and k n are the half saturation constants of phosphate p doc and nitrate n respectively mg l k i is the inhibition constant of do mg l microspores in the plant chips create anaerobic environments for denitrification within the columns denitrification in plant chip columns is uninhibited at do concentrations between 1 7 and 3 7mg l healy et al 2006 seitzinger et al 2006 warneke et al 2011a in this experiment the do concentration in the column effluents was approximately 1mg l from the literature on denitrification the k n was determined as 0 05 1 0mg l halaburka et al 2017 because the nitrate n concentration in this experiment 20mg l was much higher than the suggested k n the nitrate limitation should be neglected robertson 2010 removing the do and the nitrate terms from eq 3 the denitrification rates of plant chips were calculated as 4 v v max p k p p c k c c in previous works the fitting ranges of v max and k c were 0 05 7 1mg n l h and 0 1 3 0mg l respectively ghane et al 2015 halaburka et al 2017 in the present study k p was fitted over a much wider range of 0 001 1 000mg l the fitted values of v max k p and k c for each plant chip column were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis and are presented in table 5 fig 5 shows the relationships between the denitrification rate and doc at different phosphate p concentrations the k p was determined as 0 035mg l for reed and 0 067mg l for l eduilis but the k c 0 1mg l was identical in both chips this suggests that the denitrification rate is limited by phosphate p rather than by doc the k p and k c for moso bamboo were 0 083mg l and 3 0mg l respectively the denitrification rate in this material is probably limited by both phosphate p and doc in contrast the k p and k c in japanese cedar were 0 001mg l and 3 0mg l respectively indicating that japanese cedar is more limited by doc than phosphate p furthermore the v max of japanese cedar was only 0 3mg l h significantly lower than in reed 2 1mg l h moso bamboo 2 1mg l h and l eduilis 1 5mg l h in fact the v max reflects the heterotrophic denitrifier concentration in steady state halaburka et al 2017 therefore it was speculated that japanese cedar is not favored by denitrifiers 5 conclusions the denitrification processes and nitrate removal efficiencies in groundwaters with different phosphate p concentrations were evaluated in laboratory column experiments of various plant chips reed japanese cedar moso bamboo and lithocarpus eduilis in the first part of each column most of the do was consumed by aerobic reactions leaving a reduced environment for denitrification in the second part various carbon and nitrogen species were produced in the columns and the doc controlled both the aerobic reaction and denitrification despite the similar total carbon contents in the four types of plant chips the nitrate removal efficiency was highest in reed and lowest in japanese cedar the order of nitrate removal efficiency reed moso bamboo l eduilis japanese cedar well matched the adsom results of each chip along with the doc which is associated with the adsom in plant chips phosphorus controls the denitrification rate and the nitrogen species produced consequently the nitrate removal efficiency decreased with decreasing phosphate p concentration in the system in the moso bamboo column the reduction of no2 n to n2 was restricted by the low phosphate p according to the modified michaelis menten equation the denitrification rate was largely limited by the doc in japanese cedar and by phosphate p in reed and l eduilis in moso bamboo the denitrification rate was limited by both phosphate p and doc acknowledgments the authors

1684,groundwater denitrification bioreactors under limited phosphorus conditions were studied in column experiments using four types of plant chips when the phosphate p concentration in the influent increased from 0 04mg l to 0 4mg l the nitrate removal ratio increased from 61 6 to 86 1 in reed from 7 2 to 12 6 in japanese cedar from 37 0 to 73 6 in moso bamboo and from 19 2 to 50 5 in lithocarpus edulis the carbon source of the denitrifiers growth was indicated by the content of acid detergent soluble organic matter in the chips furthermore according to the modified michaelis menten type equation proposed in the study the denitrification rate was largely limited by the phosphate p concentration in reed and l eduilis and by the dissolved organic carbon doc in japanese cedar denitrification in moso bamboo was affected by both phosphate p and doc besides the doc phosphorus emerged as an important limiting element of denitrification in some bioreactor plant chips keywords denitrification nitrate phosphate plant chips dissolved organic carbon 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater is a serious global environmental problem compromising the eutrophication of waterbodies and the health of human bathers nitrate is mainly sourced from fertilization livestock excretion and domestic wastewater bedessem et al 2005 korom 1992 nitrate contamination is especially widespread in areas with intensive agricultural activities cey et al 1999 trudell et al 1986 denitrification is among the most promising natural ways of removing nitrate from basin water gibert et al 2008 the transformation of nitrate into nitrogen gas is aided by a group of microorganisms called denitrifiers which are numerous in the natural discharge areas of local groundwater namely riparian zones and wetlands cey et al 1999 hill et al 2000 korom 1992 additionally denitrification requires an anaerobic or restricted oxygen environment and an electron donor such as organic carbon korom 1992 rivett et al 2008 in denitrification walls that enhance the removal of nitrate from groundwater the carbon is typically sourced from woodchips sawdust branch leaf compost robertson and anderson 1999 robertson et al 2000 schipper and vojvodic vukovic 1998 schipper et al 2004 2010a because they operate for over a decade denitrification bioreactors are both cost effective and feasible long et al 2011 robertson et al 2008 the denitrification rates of different types of plant chips have been reported in laboratory studies robertson 2010 found that the denitrification rate is 41 60 lower in 7year old woodchips than in fresh woodchips the performance of the woodchips was reduced by half in the first year before stabilizing under the release of dissolved organic carbon doc robertson 2010 although maize cobs and wheat straw have higher denitrification rates than wood they tend to produce large amounts of ammonium and increase the biochemical oxygen demand in the effluents cameron and schipper 2010 softwood and hardwood efficiently remove nitrate from groundwater but coniferous mulch willow compost and leaves perform poorly in the denitrification permeable reactive barrier gibert et al 2008 this suggests that the biodegradability of the plant chips affects their denitrification efficiency in a bioreactor system the performances of bioreactors with plant chips strongly depend on the available phosphorus and organic carbon in the system the operating temperature and the nitrate concentration in the influent in general phosphorus and organic carbon are limited in subsurface and groundwater environments bedessem et al 2005 flores lopez et al 2013 hunter 2003 piao et al 2016 as is well known phosphate is important for the metabolism and growth of denitrifiers under low phosphate conditions the nitrate removal efficiency is low and the nitrate is transformed into nitrite or nitrous oxide rather than nitrogen gas indicating that the denitrification is incomplete hunter 2003 zhang et al 2015 in general phosphorous is easily absorbed in the vadose zone as evidenced by its much higher retardation than nitrate robertson et al 1998 hence low phosphate and high nitrate groundwater typifies agricultural regions with high fertilizer usage under these conditions bioreactors constructed with plant chips are unlikely to successfully treat groundwater nevertheless many bioreactor models have considered the temperature nitrate organic carbon and oxygen conditions while ignoring the effect of phosphorus on denitrification processes cameron and schipper 2010 ghane et al 2015 gu et al 2007 halaburka et al 2017 respirable carbon is positively correlated with denitrification rate warneke et al 2011b and plant chips with lower c n ratio and less lignification are more efficient for denitrification greenan et al 2006 the decomposition characteristics of organic substances can be effectively determined by acid detergent analysis consequently the acid detergent soluble organic matter adsom is available as readily decomposable organic matter for microbial growth fujiwara et al 2009 however few studies have evaluated the available carbon associated with the decomposition characteristics of plant chips during denitrification the denitrification rate is hypothesized to increase exponentially with temperature a 10 c rise in temperature would increase the denitrification rate by 0 8 4 7 fold depending on the plant chips used cameron and schipper 2010 ghane et al 2015 schmidt and clark 2013 warneke et al 2011b therefore temperature is the most important factor in groundwater nitrate remediation similarly the nitrate kinetics in denitrification constitute a simple zero order first order or michaelis menten reaction when the denitrification rate is constant and independent of the nitrate concentration it is modeled by the simple zero order reaction robertson 2010 robertson et al 2008 schipper et al 2010b warneke et al 2011a to evaluate the effects of limiting factors such as nitrate organic carbon and phosphate on the denitrification rate the coupled michaelis menten model is preferred modeling the denitrification rate will increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of denitrification by plant chips and reveal the importance of phosphate p in groundwater in column experiments of four kinds of plant chips the present study estimates the nitrate removal ratio in the chips discusses the effects of phosphate p and decomposable organic matter on the denitrification process and comprehensively evaluates the denitrification rate by a modified michaelis menten equation under limited phosphorus conditions in terms of the adsom it also quantifies the effect of organic carbon on the denitrification of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 column setups four plant chips reed herbaceous japanese cedar conifer moso bamboo and l eduilis broadleaf tree were cut and passed through a sieve with a 2mmmesh the reference material was gravel diameter 2 4mm all materials were heat sterilized in a muffle furnace at 135 c for 2h then packed into separate columns each column was constructed from 5 5cm diameter pvc pipe and was uniformly filled with the plant chips to retain the plant chips throughout the experiments nylon made filters were attached to both ends of the columns the columns were then closed by pvc lids the residence time in the column was set to 10h by adjusting the column length prior to experiments the water soluble substances attached to the surface of the filling materials was washed from the columns with deionized water the washing was continued until the electro conductivity of the effluent no longer changed between successive washings the final conductivities were 70Œºs cm for gravel 45Œºs cm for reed 12Œºs cm for japanese cedar 15Œºs cm for moso bamboo and 25Œºs cm for l eduilis 2 2 column experiments na2hpo4 was added to 20mg l no3 n solution at n p ratios of 50 100 and 500 hereafter these experimental solutions are referred to as np50 np100 np500 respectively all solutions were stored separately in a 20l polyethylene bucket at an appropriate time the solutions were introduced to the columns at 42ml h by a peristaltic pump all experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 c the materials and solutions of the column experiments are listed in table 1 during the experiments the ph and dissolved oxygen do in the influents and effluents were monitored by a ph meter b 711 horiba japan and a do meter do 24p dkk toa japan respectively the oxidation reduction potential orp and temperature were also measured by an orp meter d 55 horiba japan the standard hydrogen electrode eh was then calculated from the orp as follows 1 eh orp 206 0 7 t 25 where t is the water temperature c the effluents were collected in a 280 ml polyethylene bottle and sampled once every 4days for analyzing their water chemistry and their dissolved n2o and co2 contents for the water chemistry analysis all samples were filtered through 0 22 Œºm membrane filters the dissolved gases were analyzed in a 35 ml glass vial completely filled with the water sample and sealed by an aluminum cap one milliliter of hibitane 5 chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to the sample through a butyl rubber septum passed through the cap 2 3 analytical techniques the carbon and nitrogen contents in the plant chips were measured by a cn coder mt 700 yanaco analytical instruments corporation japan the contents of acid detergent fiber adf and adsom in the plant chips were determined in the acid detergent analysis and evaluated as indicators of the decomposition property fujiwara et al 2009 in the water samples hco3 was measured by the ph 4 8 alkalinity titration method using 0 02n sulfuric acid and no2 and no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography lc 10a shimadzu corporation japan the phosphate p concentration was determined by the ascorbic acid molybdenum blue method in a uv visible spectrophotometer tu 1810 beijing purkinje general instruments china the doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu corporation japan to analyze the dissolved n2o and co2 10ml of each sample stored in its glass vial was removed and replaced with pure helium gas and the vials were kept at 40 c for 24h the n2o and co2 concentrations were then quantified by injecting 0 5ml of the head space gas into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector and a thermal conductivity detector gc 2014 shimadzu japan respectively the concentration of each dissolved gas was calculated as follows 2 c œâ k h c gas c gas v gas v q where c œâ and c gas are the concentrations of the dissolved gas in the liquid and gas phases respectively k h is the henry s law constant at 40 c and v gas and v q are the volumes of the gas and liquid phases in the vial respectively 3 results 3 1 components of plant chips the average nitrogen content was approximately 1drywt in japanese cedar moso bamboo and l eduilis and approximately 2drywt in reed the carbon contents were similar in the four plant chips 50drywt the adf content increased in the following order reed 51 6drywt moso bamboo 79 3drywt l eduilis 84 9drywt japanese cedar 93 9drywt correspondingly the adsom content decreased in the order reed 37 3drywt moso bamboo 19 7drywt l eduilis 13 8drywt japanese cedar 5 9drywt table 2 3 2 ph do and eh values fig 1 shows the variations of ph do and eh in the influents and effluents during the experiments the ph of the effluent in the gravel column ranged from 7 9 to 8 5 the ph of the influent trended similarly the parameter changes in each plant chip column were independent of phosphorous concentration the ph ranged from 7 0 to 7 4 in the effluents and from 7 9 to 8 2 in the influents excluding the ph of the effluents from l eduilis on day 4 the do values in the influents ranged from 6 92 to 7 47mg l the do in the effluent from the gravel column was 6 14 6 60mg l indicating that the do had been little used while passing through the column however the dos of the effluents in the plant chips columns were considerably lower than their influent values from day 8 of the experiments the do values reduced to 1mg l in reed moso bamboo and l eduilis except for run 3 on day 20 japanese cedar at np50 which read 2 65mg l the eh values of the influent and effluent from the gravel column were similar and ranged from 300 to 400mv however when the experimental solutions flowed through japanese cedar or l eduilis the eh varied from 260 to 360mv in reed and moso bamboo the eh recovered to above 200mv after day 12 3 3 nitrogen species three nitrogen species no3 n no2 n and n2o n were analyzed during the experiments fig 2 the no3 n and dissolved n2o n concentrations in the influents were around 20mg l and 0 02mg l at most respectively and no2 n was not detected in run 1 gravel the no3 n and dissolved n2o n concentrations were similar in the influent and effluent but no2 n was detected at 0 3 to 0 5mg l from days 13 to 25 of the experiments in general the nitrate removal efficiency was affected by both the phosphorous content and type of plant chips used in the effluents of the np50 solutions the no3 n concentration ranged from 0 0 to 5 9mg l in reed run 2 from 15 4 to 19 2mg l in japanese cedar run 3 from 0 0 to 10 5mg l in moso bamboo run 4 and from 5 1 to 16 5mg l in l eduilis run 5 in the effluents of the np100 solution the no3 n ranged from 0 0 to 5 9mg l in reed run 6 from 17 3 to 19 1mg l in japanese cedar run 7 from 0 0 to 11 2mg l in moso bamboo run 8 and from 9 0 to 16 7mg l in l eduilis run 9 in those of the np500 solutions the no3 n concentrations ranged from 0 0 to 10 2mg l in reed run 10 from 18 4 to 19 5mg l in japanese cedar run 11 from 4 6 to 15 0mg l in moso bamboo run 12 and from 15 4 to 17 7mg l in l eduilis run 13 overall the lowest and highest nitrate concentrations were found in the effluents from reed and japanese cedar respectively that is the nitrate removal efficiencies largely differed among the plant chips moreover in japanese cedar the nitrate removal efficiency was insensitive to n p ratio fig 2 in the effluents from the reed column no2 n was detected at 0 4 1 0mg l on days 13 25 and 29 in run 2 at 0 2mg l on day 9 in run 6 and at 0 5mg l on day 9 in run 10 in the effluents from the japanese cedar column the no2 n ranged from 0 3 to 1 0mg l from the beginning until day 13 in run 3 from 0 2 to 0 3mg l until day 9 in run 7 and from 0 2 to 0 5mg l throughout the experiment in run 11 in the effluents from the moso bamboo column no no2 n was detected in run 4 but the no2 n concentration ranged from 0 2 to 4 6mg l from the beginning until day 13 in run 8 and from 0 3 to 6 7mg l throughout the whole experiment in run 12 the no2 n concentrations of the effluents from the l eduilis column were approximately 2 1mg l or less in runs 5 and 9 and ranged from 0 1 to 1 2mg l in run 13 in the column effluents from reed the dissolved n2o n concentrations remained below 0 15mg l in runs 6 and 10 but were detected at high values on days 25 and 29 1 06 and 2 08mg l respectively in run 2 in the column effluents from japanese cedar the average dissolved n2o n concentration was as low as 0 04mg l in run 11 but was approximately 10 times higher in runs 3 and 7 in the effluents from moso bamboo it remained below 0 19mg l in the effluents from l eduilis the dissolved no2 n concentrations remained below 0 05mg l in run 5 rising to 0 34mg l on day 17 in run 9 they remained at 0 40mg l from the beginning until day 9 then fell to below 0 03mg l in run 13 they remained below 0 13mg l with little changes throughout the experimental period 3 4 carbon species and phosphate p concentration fig 3 shows the variations of hco3 c co2 aq c doc and phosphate p in the influents np50 np100 and np500 and effluents runs 1 13 throughout the experimental period the phosphate p concentrations in the influents of np50 np100 and np500 were 0 40mg l 0 20mg l and 0 04mg l respectively meanwhile the influent hco3 c co2 aq c and doc concentrations were approximately 28 9mg l 2 3mg l and 2 3mg l respectively in the gravel effluent run 1 the effluent concentrations 29 3mg l hco3 c 2 7mg l co2 aq c and 3 1mg l doc were similar to the influent concentrations however the phosphate p concentration in the gravel effluent run 1 was approximately 0 20mg l on day 5 rising to 0 35mg l on day 29 this indicates that some phosphate p was absorbed by the gravel in reed the effluent hco3 c concentrations ranged from 42 0 to 46 8mg l run 2 from 39 0 to 46 8mg l run 6 and from 37 2 to 45 6mg l run 10 in moso bamboo they ranged from 36 0 to 45 6mg l run 4 from 35 4 to 43 2mg l run 8 and from 33 6 to 36 0mg l run 12 in japanese cedar they ranged from 27 6 to 34 8mg l run 3 and from 28 8 to 31 2mg l runs 7 and 11 in the l eduilis effluents the hco3 c concentrations were lower than the influent values over the first 5days then varied from 32 4 to 44 4mg l in run 5 from 33 6 to 38 4mg l in run 9 and from 30 0 to 34 8mg l in run 13 among the four types of plant chips the hco3 c concentrations were highest in reed and lowest in japanese cedar fig 3 regardless of phosphate p content the effluent co2 aq c concentrations ranged from 5 3 to 12 9mg l in reed 2 4 to 9 6mg l in japanese cedar and 5 4 to 14 0mg l in moso bamboo in the effluents from l eduilis the co2 aq c concentrations ranged from 6 0 to 14 4mg l with three exceptions 20 4mg l on day 5 and 18 2mg l on day 13 in run 5 and 32 8mg l on day 5 in run 9 the doc concentrations in the effluents from all plant chips were highest during the first 5days and decreased thereafter the average doc concentrations were 16 3mg l in reed 6 1mg l in japanese cedar 17 0mg l in moso bamboo and 12 3mg l in l eduilis in the effluents from the np50 solutions of reed and moso bamboo the phosphate p concentration was below 0 04mg l throughout the first 13days thereafter it increased to around 0 14mg l in reed run 2 in moso bamboo it increased to 0 19mg l on day 21 then decreased to 0 08mg l on day 29 run 4 in the effluents from the l eduilis column run 5 the phosphate p concentration was as high as 0 29mg l during the first 5days then decreased to 0 02mg l on day 13 and partially recovered to 0 20mg l thereafter the phosphate p concentration was higher in japanese cedar than in the other plant chips exceeding 0 30mg l after day 17 over the experimental period the average phosphate p concentrations in the effluents from the np100 solutions were 0 01mg l in reed run 6 0 13mg l in japanese cedar run 7 0 01mg l in moso bamboo run 8 and 0 03mg l in l eduilis run 9 the phosphate p concentrations in all effluents of the np500 solutions were below 0 01mg l therefore the fluctuations in the effluent phosphate p concentrations from each plant chip reduced with increasing n p ratio i e with decreasing inlet phosphate in the experimental solutions fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of phosphate p on denitrification as the concentrations of both do and no3 n decreased in the effluents see figs 1 and 2 the microorganisms likely utilized doc for aerobic respiration in the first part of the column and for denitrification in the remainder of the column in the aerobic phase the microorganisms decompose the organic carbon reducing the do and increasing the dissolved inorganic carbon dic at sufficiently low do concentrations the column environment became anaerobic or o2 limited in the anaerobic phase the denitrifiers predominantly reduced no3 n to n2 gas with production of dic hco3 co2 aq in fact no2 n and n2o n were the intermediate products of denitrification fig 2 the influent phosphate p concentration did not affect the do concentrations of the effluents from the plant chip columns but largely influenced the change of nitrogen budget in each column table 3 to estimate the nitrogen budgets the nitrate removal ratios were calculated as the quotients of the amounts of no3 n removed differences between the inflow and outflow no3 n and the no3 n inflows obviously the no3 n was reduced to no2 n n2o n or n2 within the column depending on the denitrifying processes the amounts of no2 n and n2o n were estimated from the measured data and the n2 n2 cal was calculated by subtracting the sum of no2 n and n2o n from the amount of no3 n removed a high n2 cal value indicates that the intermediate products no2 n and n2o n were not rapidly reduced to n2 gas during the denitrification with increasing phosphate p in the influent the nitrate removal ratio increased from 61 6 to 86 1 in reed from 37 0 to 73 6 in moso bamboo and from 19 2 to 50 5 in l eduilis the change in japanese cedar 7 2 to 12 6 was smaller than in the other plant chips also owing to the no2 n or n2o n products the n2 cal ratio in the japanese cedar column was below 77 7 in contrast the n2 cal ratio was 96 in reed and 89 in l eduilis suggesting that denitrification was almost completed in these columns in the moso bamboo columns the n2 cal ratio was 99 8 in run 4 and 92 6 in run 8 but decreased to 74 3 in run 12 when the no2 n ratio reached 25 0 a similar phenomenon was reported in column experiments of soybean oil emulsion as an organic carbon source hunter 2003 probably because the nitrite reductase synthesis was restricted relative to the nitrate reductase synthesis blaszczyk 1993 the nitrate removal efficiency obviously decreased with increasing n p ratio in the experimental solutions to maintain high denitrification performance the phosphate p concentration in the influent must exceed 0 2mg l i e the n p ratio must be below 100 however the phosphate p concentration of groundwater is below 0 2mg l in most agricultural regions burkart et al 2004 carlyle and hill 2001 domagalski and johnson 2011 flores lopez et al 2013 piao et al 2016 therefore phosphate p should be regarded as the limiting factor in the performance of groundwater nitrate treatment by plant chip based bioreactors 4 2 relationship between nitrate removal efficiency and decomposition characteristics of the plant chips among the four types of plant chips the nitrate removal efficiency decreased in the order reed moso bamboo lithocarpus eduilis japanese cedar table 3 most microorganisms cannot directly access the carbon in the polymeric organic compounds of plant chips instead they utilize the low molecular weight organic carbon produced by hydrolyzing microorganisms primarily fungi in the plant chips throughout the experiments the doc concentrations were higher in the effluents of plant chips than in the influents indicating that hydrolysis reactions occurred within the plant chip columns fig 3 we may also reasonably consider that the variations in doc concentration largely depend on the decomposition characteristics of the plant chips the total carbon content in all plant chips was almost constant 50drywt throughout the experiments so was clearly uninvolved in the decomposition rate and nitrate removal efficiency in contrast the adf and adsom contents differed among the plant chips table 2 in general the adf accounts for the sum of cellulose and lignin and the adsom corresponds to the organic matter containing hemicelluloses other than adf fujiwara et al 2009 as is well known the hemicellulose in plant chips is more easily hydrolyzed than cellulose and lignin p√©rez et al 2002 consequently the nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing adsom and its standard deviation which varied from 0 17 to 0 44 depended on phosphate p concentration fig 4a this suggests that the adsom is a useful indicator of nitrate removal efficiency and the supply of organic carbon available for denitrification to calculate the average decomposition rate of the plant chips the change in the sum of the generated doc and dic is divided by the total amount of organic carbon consumed per unit time the average decomposition rates were 0 031 0 036mg g h in reed 0 007 0 01mg g h in japanese cedar 0 014 0 02mg g h in moso bamboo and 0 011 0 016mg g h in l eduilis the average decomposition rate clearly increased with increasing adsom content fig 4b interestingly the coefficient of variation of the decomposition rate in each plant chip was relatively small 0 08 0 22 suggesting that the phosphate p in the influents little affected the plant chip decomposition according to the adsom results reed exhibited the highest nitrate removal efficiency whereas japanese cedar had a longer durability than the other plant chips therefore the plant chip should be appropriately selected to suit the availability cost and reaction rate of the treatment schipper et al 2010b 4 3 effect of phosphate p and doc concentration on denitrification rate in previous column experiments of solid organic substrates the denitrification rates nitrate removal rates ranged from 0 3 to 11 5mg n l h table 4 this diversity has been predominantly attributed to differences in temperature nitrate inlet concentration and water velocity residence time the effect of phosphate p in the influent has been ignored overall the denitrification rate is higher in bioreactors using herbaceous plant chips than in bioreactors using woody plant chips schipper et al 2010b probably due to differences in the plant decomposition rate which supplies the doc as discussed above in our experiments the final denitrification rates were 1 0 1 9mg n l h in reed 0 2mg n l h in japanese cedar 0 6 1 5mg n l h in moso bamboo and 0 5 1 3mg n l h in l eduilis similar tendencies have been reported in previous studies however phosphorus has been a neglected element in denitrification studies despite its importance and low concentration in groundwater the michaelis menten model effectively describes the overall microbial kinetics especially those related to denitrification in the michaelis menten formulation the heterotrophic denitrification rate v is upper bounded by oxygen inhibition nitrate limitation and carbon limitation gu et al 2007 halaburka et al 2017 as described above the denitrification rates of plant chips v also depend on the available phosphate p therefore the conventional michaelis menten equation was modified by adding a phosphate limitation term 3 v v max p k p p c k c c n k n n k i k i o where v max is the maximum denitrification rate mg n l h p c n and o are the concentrations of phosphate p doc nitrate n and do respectively mg l and k p k c and k n are the half saturation constants of phosphate p doc and nitrate n respectively mg l k i is the inhibition constant of do mg l microspores in the plant chips create anaerobic environments for denitrification within the columns denitrification in plant chip columns is uninhibited at do concentrations between 1 7 and 3 7mg l healy et al 2006 seitzinger et al 2006 warneke et al 2011a in this experiment the do concentration in the column effluents was approximately 1mg l from the literature on denitrification the k n was determined as 0 05 1 0mg l halaburka et al 2017 because the nitrate n concentration in this experiment 20mg l was much higher than the suggested k n the nitrate limitation should be neglected robertson 2010 removing the do and the nitrate terms from eq 3 the denitrification rates of plant chips were calculated as 4 v v max p k p p c k c c in previous works the fitting ranges of v max and k c were 0 05 7 1mg n l h and 0 1 3 0mg l respectively ghane et al 2015 halaburka et al 2017 in the present study k p was fitted over a much wider range of 0 001 1 000mg l the fitted values of v max k p and k c for each plant chip column were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis and are presented in table 5 fig 5 shows the relationships between the denitrification rate and doc at different phosphate p concentrations the k p was determined as 0 035mg l for reed and 0 067mg l for l eduilis but the k c 0 1mg l was identical in both chips this suggests that the denitrification rate is limited by phosphate p rather than by doc the k p and k c for moso bamboo were 0 083mg l and 3 0mg l respectively the denitrification rate in this material is probably limited by both phosphate p and doc in contrast the k p and k c in japanese cedar were 0 001mg l and 3 0mg l respectively indicating that japanese cedar is more limited by doc than phosphate p furthermore the v max of japanese cedar was only 0 3mg l h significantly lower than in reed 2 1mg l h moso bamboo 2 1mg l h and l eduilis 1 5mg l h in fact the v max reflects the heterotrophic denitrifier concentration in steady state halaburka et al 2017 therefore it was speculated that japanese cedar is not favored by denitrifiers 5 conclusions the denitrification processes and nitrate removal efficiencies in groundwaters with different phosphate p concentrations were evaluated in laboratory column experiments of various plant chips reed japanese cedar moso bamboo and lithocarpus eduilis in the first part of each column most of the do was consumed by aerobic reactions leaving a reduced environment for denitrification in the second part various carbon and nitrogen species were produced in the columns and the doc controlled both the aerobic reaction and denitrification despite the similar total carbon contents in the four types of plant chips the nitrate removal efficiency was highest in reed and lowest in japanese cedar the order of nitrate removal efficiency reed moso bamboo l eduilis japanese cedar well matched the adsom results of each chip along with the doc which is associated with the adsom in plant chips phosphorus controls the denitrification rate and the nitrogen species produced consequently the nitrate removal efficiency decreased with decreasing phosphate p concentration in the system in the moso bamboo column the reduction of no2 n to n2 was restricted by the low phosphate p according to the modified michaelis menten equation the denitrification rate was largely limited by the doc in japanese cedar and by phosphate p in reed and l eduilis in moso bamboo the denitrification rate was limited by both phosphate p and doc acknowledgments the authors
