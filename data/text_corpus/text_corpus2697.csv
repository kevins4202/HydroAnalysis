13485,arsenite as iii was removed via oxidation and adsorption coprocesses in fixed bed columns a manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve k oms2 and iron iii trimesate fe btc were applied as oxidizer and adsorbent respectively before use in the column k oms2 and fe btc powders were coated on ceramic balls with k oms2 and fe btc to ceramic ball ratios of 1 to 50 the as iii and arsenate as v removal efficiencies for single fixed bed columns of k oms2 and fe btc respectively as well as for the two columns combined were determined from the single column run results k oms2 maintained notable efficiency in oxidizing as iii to as v during a three round use cycle with leached mn and k concentrations below the groundwater standard the average as iii oxidation percentages in k oms2 column for 600 min in the 1st 2nd and 3rd rounds were 95 92 and 93 respectively in the fe btc single column run the yoon nelson model was found to represent the adsorption kinetics model of the run with a maximum as v adsorption capacity of 52 60 mg g and more than 75 of as v was removed for 600 min maximum fe leaching from fe btc column was 0 23 mg l which was lower than fe concentration range found in natural freshwater the adsorption behavior can be explained by the fact that the adsorption rate decreased depending on the as v breakthrough and fe btc proportion in the case of two columns combined more than 62 of the total as was removed over 2200 min of operation time under optimal experimental conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords arsenic arsenite adsorption oxidation fixed bed column 1 introduction water contamination by arsenic as poses a major risk to human health due to two types of toxicity acute and subacute acute as poisoning usually occurs via the ingestion of as contaminated food or water subacute as toxicity primarily involves the gastrointestinal respiratory cardiovascular hematopoietic and nervous systems 1 in addition as can cause kidney disease diabetes and skin cancer 2 3 in southeast asia many countries including vietnam laos cambodia myanmar and thailand still face problems with as contamination in water 4 despite the drinking water standard of the world health organization who setting a limit of 10 μg l 5 remediation of as contamination can be achieved by several methods including adsorption coagulation flocculation ion exchange oxidation etc 6 11 however the degree of as mobility in water is controlled by the oxidation state of as and the water ph 12 trivalent arsenite as iii and pentavalent arsenate as v are commonly found in natural waters among all possible oxidation states of as e g 3 0 3 and 5 13 14 because of their relatively slow redox transformation kinetics as iii and as v can be found under both oxic and anoxic conditions 15 in addition the varieties of as iii e g h3aso3 h2aso3 1 and haso3 2 and as v e g h3aso4 h2aso4 1 and haso4 2 that occur are dependent on the water ph 16 and lead to neutrally charged h3aso3 which is the type of as iii present at common groundwater ph levels therefore removal of the neutral charge variety of as iii is more difficult than that of as v via conventional methods such as ion exchange and adsorption which is governed mostly by electrostatic attraction force between as iii and a material s surface 6 11 17 in addition as iii in groundwater causes arduous precipitation with other minerals 18 and is more toxic than as v 11 most as iii removal treatments rely initially on oxidation by converting as iii to as v using an oxidizing agent followed by precipitation ion exchange or the adsorption of as v 13 19 22 however one step removal in a batch system of as iii using femn binary oxide powder as an adsorbent found higher as iii uptake than as v 23 the removal mechanism of femn oxide based material was revealed when the mno2 content in femn binary oxide inhibited its oxidizing capacity by a na2so3 reducing agent this regulation showed a decrease in as iii removal and an increase in as v adsorption with an as iii removal test the as3d spectrum of femn binary oxide from the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps technique confirmed the presence of only as v on femn binary oxide and as iii and as v on the na2so3 pretreatment type this indicates that mno2 is mainly associated with oxidizing as iii thus the oxidation and sorption mechanism of as iii over femn binary oxide was concluded and fe oxide was more favorable for adsorbing as v transformed from as iii 23 however the different roles of fe and mn oxides are considered in terms of potentially different service life according to our previous study of a batch system with individual mn and fe based materials as iii was successfully treated by using a manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve k oms2 and one type of iron based metal organic framework iron iii trimesate fe btc in powder form 20 k oms2 can robustly oxidize as iii to as v at 30 60 c at the same time fe btc provides a maximum as v adsorption capacity level of 76 3 mg g as explained by the langmuir isotherm model the retire removal process of 5 mg l as iii was completed 60 min after simultaneous introduction of the k oms2 and fe btc powders into the same batch solution which indicated the excellent cooperation between these two materials k oms2 plays a significant role in the catalytic oxidation of as iii transformation k oms2 contains mixed oxidation states of mn2 mn3 and mn4 ions with 2 2 tunnels in mno6 octahedral chains in a one dimensional 4 6 å 4 6 å structure this material is highly porous has a variety of pore structures and is nontoxic as well as environmentally friendly 11 20 24 26 k oms2 has a mixture of mn2o3 and mno2 with a higher mn3 mn4 ratio which tends to enhance oxidative activity due to lattice oxygen increase 26 however mno2 in k oms2 not only plays a role as an oxidizer but is also able to adsorb heavy metal ions with strong affinity 27 as adsorption is a step prior to the oxidation reaction occurring at the solid liquid interface 28 the presence of mno2 tends to accelerate oxidation at the same time fe btc contains fe ions that act as coordination centers and links with organic bridging ligands because fe btc exhibits a high surface area and porosity attention has been given to its application for removing pollutants from aqueous solutions 29 33 although k oms2 and fe btc powders demonstrate favorable performance they are inconvenient for use in a continuous flow system for water treatment due to clogging and pressure drop therefore the authors of the current study perform continuous fixed bed column studies of as iii removal via the oxidation and adsorption coprocesses of k oms2 and fe btc coated on ceramic balls some characteristics such as the crystallinity and oxidation states of the materials coated on ceramic balls were reported in this study in addition the dynamic behavior of continuous fixed bed columns was described in terms of breakthrough curves the reuse of the oxidation column was tested the thomas and yoon nelson models were applied to estimate performance in the adsorption columns a combination of an oxidation column and adsorption column for total as removal was also tested as well as the leaching of manganese mn potassium k and iron fe 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the as v source in this study was disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o 98 sigma aldrich india the as iii used in this study was sodium arsenite naaso2 98 kemaus australia manganese ii acetate tetrahydrate mn ch3coo 2 4h2o 99 acros organics usa potassium permanganate kmno4 99 8 ajax finechem australia and acetic acid ch3cooh 99 8 qrëc new zealand were used as starting materials for k oms2 powder synthesis iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 qrëc new zealand and 1 3 5 benzene tricarboxylic acid c9h6o6 95 sigma aldrich usa were used as starting materials for fe btc powder synthesis ceramic balls with a 4 mm diameter al2o3 68 50 sio2 28 and others 3 5 bpf 05 thailand were used as the supporting material in the coating process a strong base anion exchange resin amberjet 4200 chloride form aldrich chemistry usa was used for as iii and as v separation 34 all other chemicals used in this study were laboratory grade 2 2 preparation and characterization of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated the k oms2 and fe btc powders were prepared using the methods described in our previous report 20 for k oms2 powder synthesis a kmno4 solution 0 25 m 40 ml was mixed with mn ch3coo 2 4h2o solution 0 33 m 40 ml the solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 by using ch3cooh and the solution was stirred well for 1 h the mixture was placed into an autoclave for hydrothermal processing at 100 c for 3 h then the black slurry obtained was washed with deionized di water to achieve ph 7 after which it was dried at 100 c for 3 h finally a black k oms2 powder was obtained for fe btc powder synthesis a fecl3 6h2o solution 1 m 75 ml was mixed with a c9h6o6 solution 1 m in ethanol 75 ml the mixture underwent hydrothermal processing at 100 c for 24 h then an orange jelly like substance was obtained and washed using di water to achieve ph 7 the orange precursor was dried at 120 c for 4 h finally an orange fe btc powder was obtained to prepare k oms2 and fe btc coated on ceramic balls referred to as k oms2 coated and fe btc coated respectively the preparation procedure was guided by the optimal coating conditions determined from our previous work first the starting materials at 1 to 50 weight ratios of k oms2 powder or fe btc powder to ceramic balls were placed in a 2000 ml beaker these mixtures were then transferred and placed on an orbital shaker to accomplish coating via the mechanical orbital shaking technique at 160 rpm for 24 h the coated materials were then dried at 120 c for 24 h finally the k oms2 coated and fe btc coated materials were ready for characterization and packing in continuous fixed bed columns the k oms2 powder fe btc powder k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were characterized to determine their crystallinity using x ray diffraction xrd bruker axs d8 discover germany cu kα radiation 0 1514 nm at 40 ma 0 02 step increment scan speed of 0 1 s step and 40 kv were used the scan range was 10 80 for k oms2 and 1 40 for fe btc at 25 c the specific surface area of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder was measured using a nitrogen adsorption desorption instrument quantachrome instrument autosorb 1 usa before analysis 0 1000 0 3000 g of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder was degassed at 150 c for 3 6 h 35 the samples were then tested for nitrogen gas adsorption desorption at 196 c data was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method to obtain a specific surface area in addition x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy was conducted over the spent k oms2 powder and the standards of as iii from naaso2 and as v from na2haso4 7h2o xanes was performed at beamline 1 1 multiple x ray techniques the synchrotron light research institute public organization located in nakhon ratchasima thailand the xanes spectra of the spent k oms2 powder and standards were analyzed using athena software 2 3 continuous fixed bed column experiment the continuous fixed bed column experiment was divided into three parts 1 as iii oxidation over k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column 2 as v adsorption over fe btc coated in a single continuous fixed bed column and 3 total as removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns fig 1 first the continuous fixed bed columns for k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were vertically oriented by using a 35 cm long borosilicate glass tube with an inner diameter of 2 cm after which they were connected at both ends to silicone tubes the inlet at the bottom of the column was driven by a peristaltic pump to maintain flow rates of 5 and 10 ml min and the outlet was at the top of the column their configurations were intended to retain the water level in close contact with the cross section of the material in the column and avoid flows due to gravity then k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were separately loaded into the individual columns at bed lengths of 10 15 and 20 cm by closing the tops and bottoms of the packed columns with 2 cm bed lengths of cotton wool and glass beads as shown in fig 1 a and 1 b at the same time 1 mg l sodium arsenite solution for the k oms2 coated column inlet and 1 mg l disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate solution for the fe btc coated column inlet were prepared next a working efficiency test in each column was performed at room temperature approximately 27 1 c under the experimental conditions shown in table 1 the concentrations of as iii and as v and leaching elements namely manganese mn potassium k and iron fe were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes plasmaquant pq 9000 elite analytik jena germany the strong base anion exchange resin amberjet 4200 was used to separate as iii and as v before measuring the as iii remaining after passing through the k oms2 coated column 34 in addition a three round use cycle of the k oms2 coated column was examined to observe reusable oxidizing ability as the adsorbent reach maximum as v adsorption at a certain time the breakthrough capacity was calculated for only the fe btc coated single column using eq 1 1 breakthrough capacity mg g initial concentration mg l breakthrough time min flow rate ml min 10 3 adsorbent weight g the reason for the column separation was brought by the different roles between k oms2 and fe btc to study overall as iii removal efficiency by these two columns the combined columns of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated fig 1 c were performed with a 1 mg l sodium arsenite solution inlet the operation followed experimental condition ii at room temperature approximately 27 1 c the concentrations of as iii total as and leaching of mn and k from the k oms2 coated column outlet were monitored using icp oes while as v concentration was obtained by calculation from as v total as as iii in addition the total as and leaching of mn k and fe from the fe btc coated column outlet were analyzed using icp oes 2 4 sorption kinetic calculation using the thomas model and yoon nelson model in literature the thomas model and yoon nelson model have been proposed for calculating adsorption efficiencies modeling adsorption breakthrough curves and describing adsorption behaviors in columns 36 based on experimental conditions i ii and iii breakthrough curve data of as v adsorption over fe btc coated in the single continuous fixed bed column were fitted with the linear equations of the thomas model and yoon nelson model as given in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 ln c c 0 1 k t q 0 m q k t c 0 v q where c0 is the as v initial or inlet concentration mg l c is the as v final or effluent concentration mg l kt is the thomas rate constant ml min mg q is the flow rate ml min q0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g v is the effluent volume ml and m

constant l min t is the sampling time min τ is the time required for adsorbate breakthrough at 50 min and q0 is the adsorption capacity mg g the linearized equation plots were ln c c0 c versus t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated xrd was used in this study to determine the crystalline structures and phases of the coated materials compared to the bare powders since they were probably modified after coating via mechanical orbital shaking the xrd patterns of the k oms2 powder and k oms2 coated are shown in fig 2 a which revealed identical xrd peaks for the powder with cryptomelane kmn8o16 jcpds 29 1020 and manganese dioxide mn2o jcpds 44 0141 which are similar to our earlier report and those of other reports 20 37 40 peaks were observed at 12 6 18 1 28 7 37 5 41 8 49 7 56 0 60 2 65 4 and 69 5 which correspond to the 110 200 310 211 301 411 600 521 002 and 741 reflection planes respectively 20 25 40 this crystallinity was formed during the hydrothermal process 41 in addition k oms2 presented a broad xrd peak which indicated lower crystallinity and larger crystalline sizes 42 for k oms2 coated the identical xrd peaks were quite unclear with very low intensities for planes 200 211 411 and 521 but they remained along with the identical peak of the corundum phase al2o3 jcpds 83 2080 from the ceramic ball used as the support these results may be due to the thin layer used as well as the nonuniform distribution of the k oms2 coating on the ceramic ball which resulted in the low peak intensities and appearance of the corundum phase from x ray penetration the xrd patterns of fe btc and fe btc coated are shown in fig 2 b these patterns revealed the crystalline structure of the fe btc powder at 10 7 23 5 and 27 4 as observed in other studies 20 29 43 while the xrd peaks of fe btc coated were difficult to identify however it was expected that fe btc coated would still be able to adsorb as v in the case of an amorphous structure in addition xrd peaks indicating the phases of akaganeite fe 3o oh jcpds 34 1266 hematite fe2o3 jcpds 85 0987 and corundum al2o3 jcpds 83 2080 were found for fe btc coated the specific surface area from the bet method of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder were 270 7 and 0 6 m2 g respectively the k oms2 powder had a much higher specific surface area compared to other studies 20 39 40 42 45 however synthesis conditions such as aging time aging temperature 26 46 etc play an important role in morphological properties and consequently on oxidation activity on the other hand the fe btc powder provided a lower specific surface area compared to result from other studies 43 47 the xanes spectra for the spent k oms2 powder and the as iii and as v standards are shown in fig 3 this investigation focused on the mechanisms related to as iii removal over k oms2 coated it is notable that the spent k oms2 powder was used instead of spent k oms2 coated due to the limitations of sample preparation for the xanes measurements the absorption edge shapes varied between the spent k oms2 powder as an experimental sample and as iii and as v as reference compounds and showed various oxidation states of as the absorption edge of the xanes spectrum of as iii was at 11 869 0 ev 48 while that of as v was at 11 872 8 ev 13 which was similar to the absorption edge of the spent k oms powder therefore a partial amount of as v was likely adsorbed on the spent k oms2 surface after as iii oxidation which led to a loss of some active sites on the k oms2 surface with a consequent decrease in oxidation efficiency in the working column and the reuse cycle number 3 2 arsenite oxidation over k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves of as iii oxidation by k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column under different experimental conditions i bed length 10 cm flow rate 10 ml min ii bed length 15 cm flow rate 5 ml min and iii bed length 20 cm flow rate 5 ml min also presented are the breakthrough curves of total as and calculated as v using the equation astotal as iii as v it was found that the as iii concentrations in the effluents for all three experimental conditions exhibited slight decreases during the first 120 min with fluctuations which were subsequently quite stable until 600 min moreover the as iii concentrations for the experimental condition i were higher than those of experimental conditions ii and iii the similar breakthroughs of as iii under experimental conditions ii and iii demonstrated the undifferentiated oxidizing ability to transform as iii to as v for 600 min however the highest calculated oxidation percentages of experimental conditions i ii and iii were 88 51 130 40 and 114 91 at 60 120 and 200 min respectively percentages greater than 100 were probably due to the adsorption of the oxidized as iii on k oms2 coated as described in a previous report 20 and found in the xanes results of this study next the oxidized as iii was released after 120 and 200 min of experimental conditions ii and iii respectively therefore the mechanism occurring on the k oms2 coated surface is oxidation adsorption experimental condition ii was also chosen as the best condition for further study because it required a shorter bed length when considering the amount of k oms2 needed although the oxidation adsorption process occurred on the k oms2 coated surface the oxidation route was still the major mechanism of k oms2 thus k oms2 coated is largely considered to be an oxidizing agent that can be reused several times as iii oxidation by the three round use cycle of k oms2 coated in the continuous fixed bed column under experimental condition ii is shown in fig 5 the appearances of fresh and spent columns are shown in fig 5 a along with their c c0 versus time plots in fig 5 b after 600 min of three rounds of use partial amounts of the k oms2 coated surfaces in the column revealed the white surfaces of the ceramic balls due to peel off of k oms2 three round as iii oxidation efficiency decreased slightly based on the number of cycles but could not be significantly distinguished the average as iii oxidation percentages in k oms2 coated column for 600 min in the 1st 2nd and 3rd rounds were 95 92 and 93 respectively therefore it was concluded that the k oms2 coated column could be used repeatedly while maintaining the effective stable oxidizing efficiency of as iii throughout the test runs mn and k leaching during three rounds of as iii oxidation over k oms2 coated in a continuous fixed bed column under experimental condition ii was also investigated the results are shown in fig 5 c d the mn concentrations were 0 01 0 07 mg l for the 1st round 0 00 0 02 mg l for the 2nd round and 0 00 0 03 mg l for the 3rd round the mn leaching concentrations from the 2nd and 3rd rounds were probably consistent with but lower than that from the 1st round the mn leaching concentrations were also lower than the who drinking water standard which is defined as less than 0 1 mg l 49 for k leaching the concentrations were quite high for the 1st round especially during the first 110 min with a range of 0 55 5 42 mg l the k leaching concentrations were then low and stable even in the 2nd and 3rd rounds when using the k oms2 coated column the high k leaching concentrations were probably due to the position of k in the k oms2 chemical structure k is located in the cavity with a weak bond relative to mn due to the covalent bond between mn and o which is stronger 50 however k is not addressed by the who when establishing health based guidelines for drinking water 49 3 3 arsenate adsorption over fe btc coated in a single continuous fixed bed column fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves of as v adsorption by fe btc coated in the continuous fixed bed column under experimental conditions i bed length 10 cm flow rate 10 ml min ii bed length 15 cm flow rate 5 ml min and iii bed length 20 cm flow rate 5 ml min experimental condition i produced a steeper slope in the breakthrough curve than experimental conditions ii and iii as shown in fig 6 b d the fe btc coated column was able to adsorb as v and control the effluent concentrations at less than 0 01 mg l which is the as concentration limit in the drinking water standards established by the who 5 the breakthrough capacities were determined to be 1 16 0 31 and 0 28 mg g within the first 40 30 and 40 min for experimental conditions i ii and iii respectively the thomas and yoon nelson models were used to explicate the kinetic adsorption behavior and estimate the breakthrough curves in the column the equation obtained from a suitable model can be used further to illustrate fixed bed column behavior and scale up the treatment system for industrial purposes 36 the calculation results obtained by applying the linear equations of the thomas and yoon nelson models are presented in table 2 it was determined that the standard deviation s d values obtained from the yoon nelson model were lower than those from the thomas model for all experimental conditions thus the yoon nelson model was used to explain the adsorption behavior as well as for simulation in the case of the fe btc coated column in this study which determined that the adsorption rate decreased depending on the as v breakthrough and fe btc coated proportion 36 51 moreover the experimental condition i yielded the highest square of the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9206 for both models but the highest maximum adsorption capacity q0 occurred under experimental condition ii therefore as v adsorption over fe btc coated under experimental condition ii relying on the yoon nelson model was used for further study of fe leaching and the combined continuous fixed bed column fig 7 shows that the amounts in the fe leaching study from one round of use of the fe btc coated columns were in the range of 0 0 7 0 23 mg l although there is no guideline from the who for iron in drinking water as fe is found in natural freshwater at a range of 0 5 50 mg l because it is an abundant metal in the earth s crust 49 3 4 total arsenic removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns the breakthrough curves of total as removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns under experimental condition ii are presented in fig 8 a the first column with k oms2 coated provided a decrease in as iii concentrations and was relatively stable after 120 min the oxidizing ability of k oms2 coated to convert as iii to as v in the first 600 min corresponded to the results from the single continuous fixed bed column and single column study of k oms2 coated under experimental condition ii as reported in a previous section of this study after 120 min of the k oms2 coated test run with more than 95 of as iii having been oxidized the second column with fe btc coated was immediately connected to the k oms2 coated column then the fe btc coated column served the as v released from the first column and treated the as v via the adsorption process the total as in the effluent from the second column was monitored as a representation of the entire as treatment working system the total as slowly broke through from the second column and remained higher than 62 of the as treatment throughout the 2200 min of the test run as a result there is a high possibility of combining k oms2 coated and fe btc coated continuous fixed bed columns for as iii removal which may be investigated in a future study table 3 presents previous studies on as iii removal through continuous column applications 52 58 adsorption over modified materials is the most common technique 52 56 the remaining minority is based on the oxidation techniques using oxidizer 57 58 together with the co precipitation 58 or adsorption processes in our study the as iii removal efficiencies in the column tests ranged in 62 100 depending on factors in particular column configuration bed size and operation conditions which required relative optimization to as iii water solution and material s properties moreover coating of k oms2 and fe btc on ceramic ball supports facilitates and expands the use in a continuous flow in the columns 52 52 56 58 resulting in operation ease and possibility mn and k leaching from the first k oms2 coated column and mn k and fe leaching from the second fe btc coated column in the effluents were monitored repeatedly as shown in fig 8 b c slight mn leaching from the first column occurred while k leaching was not observed in addition k was leached from the second column in only the first 40 min at 0 06 1 76 mg l before becoming undetectable while mn concentrations were indistinguishable from the effluent in the first k oms2 coated column additionally fe was slightly dissolved and leached since fe binds to btc with a strong covalent bond in the structure 59 based on available as iii treatment under 2200 min there is the interesting possibility of utilizing the findings for further study as a pretreatment of as iii and as v connected with point of use water purification in household units which is experiencing increased use nowadays 60 from this laboratory scale research the costs of k oms coated and fe btc coated preparation based on direct material cost calculation were approximately 35 and 288 baht 50 g respectively the material preparation cost related to the cost of as iii removal following experimental condition ii in combined continuous fixed bed columns within 2200 min was 43 baht l of treated water it should be noted that this cost provided for the range of 62 98 total as removal efficiency the cost of as iii contaminated water treatment will probably be lower in upscale operations however other parameters require further study such as the effect of ions in natural water as initial concentration unit operation condition unit configuration upscale of k oms2 and fe btc synthesis and coating other safety parameters of outlet water and cost benefit analysis 4 conclusions to enhance the performance of total arsenic removal a combination of oxidation and adsorption processes was proposed k oms2 coated was used for oxidation of as iii to as v while the transformed as v was adsorbed on fe btc coated in the continuous fixed bed column study the k oms2 coated column remained stable after 120 min and greatly oxidized as iii to as v during 600 min of the test run moreover the xanes results revealed that partial as v can be adsorbed on the k oms2 surface which may cause loss of its active sites additionally the k oms2 coated column can be used for at least three rounds in which the oxidizing capacity slightly decreases based on the number of cycles with very low mn and k leaching in the fe btc column as v was highly adsorbed by fe btc coated and fe leaching was quite low the experimental data were explained by the yoon nelson model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 52 60 mg g r2 0 8704 and s d 6 22 with the k oms2 coated and fe btc coated continuous fixed bed columns combined under the optimal experimental conditions more than 62 of the total as iii was removed throughout the 2200 min of the test run the coating techniques for k oms2 and fe btc in this study were determined to have the potential for practical applications in upscaled as treatment approaches funding this work was supported by the thailand research fund grant numbers mrg6180196 2019 and center

13485,arsenite as iii was removed via oxidation and adsorption coprocesses in fixed bed columns a manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve k oms2 and iron iii trimesate fe btc were applied as oxidizer and adsorbent respectively before use in the column k oms2 and fe btc powders were coated on ceramic balls with k oms2 and fe btc to ceramic ball ratios of 1 to 50 the as iii and arsenate as v removal efficiencies for single fixed bed columns of k oms2 and fe btc respectively as well as for the two columns combined were determined from the single column run results k oms2 maintained notable efficiency in oxidizing as iii to as v during a three round use cycle with leached mn and k concentrations below the groundwater standard the average as iii oxidation percentages in k oms2 column for 600 min in the 1st 2nd and 3rd rounds were 95 92 and 93 respectively in the fe btc single column run the yoon nelson model was found to represent the adsorption kinetics model of the run with a maximum as v adsorption capacity of 52 60 mg g and more than 75 of as v was removed for 600 min maximum fe leaching from fe btc column was 0 23 mg l which was lower than fe concentration range found in natural freshwater the adsorption behavior can be explained by the fact that the adsorption rate decreased depending on the as v breakthrough and fe btc proportion in the case of two columns combined more than 62 of the total as was removed over 2200 min of operation time under optimal experimental conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords arsenic arsenite adsorption oxidation fixed bed column 1 introduction water contamination by arsenic as poses a major risk to human health due to two types of toxicity acute and subacute acute as poisoning usually occurs via the ingestion of as contaminated food or water subacute as toxicity primarily involves the gastrointestinal respiratory cardiovascular hematopoietic and nervous systems 1 in addition as can cause kidney disease diabetes and skin cancer 2 3 in southeast asia many countries including vietnam laos cambodia myanmar and thailand still face problems with as contamination in water 4 despite the drinking water standard of the world health organization who setting a limit of 10 μg l 5 remediation of as contamination can be achieved by several methods including adsorption coagulation flocculation ion exchange oxidation etc 6 11 however the degree of as mobility in water is controlled by the oxidation state of as and the water ph 12 trivalent arsenite as iii and pentavalent arsenate as v are commonly found in natural waters among all possible oxidation states of as e g 3 0 3 and 5 13 14 because of their relatively slow redox transformation kinetics as iii and as v can be found under both oxic and anoxic conditions 15 in addition the varieties of as iii e g h3aso3 h2aso3 1 and haso3 2 and as v e g h3aso4 h2aso4 1 and haso4 2 that occur are dependent on the water ph 16 and lead to neutrally charged h3aso3 which is the type of as iii present at common groundwater ph levels therefore removal of the neutral charge variety of as iii is more difficult than that of as v via conventional methods such as ion exchange and adsorption which is governed mostly by electrostatic attraction force between as iii and a material s surface 6 11 17 in addition as iii in groundwater causes arduous precipitation with other minerals 18 and is more toxic than as v 11 most as iii removal treatments rely initially on oxidation by converting as iii to as v using an oxidizing agent followed by precipitation ion exchange or the adsorption of as v 13 19 22 however one step removal in a batch system of as iii using femn binary oxide powder as an adsorbent found higher as iii uptake than as v 23 the removal mechanism of femn oxide based material was revealed when the mno2 content in femn binary oxide inhibited its oxidizing capacity by a na2so3 reducing agent this regulation showed a decrease in as iii removal and an increase in as v adsorption with an as iii removal test the as3d spectrum of femn binary oxide from the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps technique confirmed the presence of only as v on femn binary oxide and as iii and as v on the na2so3 pretreatment type this indicates that mno2 is mainly associated with oxidizing as iii thus the oxidation and sorption mechanism of as iii over femn binary oxide was concluded and fe oxide was more favorable for adsorbing as v transformed from as iii 23 however the different roles of fe and mn oxides are considered in terms of potentially different service life according to our previous study of a batch system with individual mn and fe based materials as iii was successfully treated by using a manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve k oms2 and one type of iron based metal organic framework iron iii trimesate fe btc in powder form 20 k oms2 can robustly oxidize as iii to as v at 30 60 c at the same time fe btc provides a maximum as v adsorption capacity level of 76 3 mg g as explained by the langmuir isotherm model the retire removal process of 5 mg l as iii was completed 60 min after simultaneous introduction of the k oms2 and fe btc powders into the same batch solution which indicated the excellent cooperation between these two materials k oms2 plays a significant role in the catalytic oxidation of as iii transformation k oms2 contains mixed oxidation states of mn2 mn3 and mn4 ions with 2 2 tunnels in mno6 octahedral chains in a one dimensional 4 6 å 4 6 å structure this material is highly porous has a variety of pore structures and is nontoxic as well as environmentally friendly 11 20 24 26 k oms2 has a mixture of mn2o3 and mno2 with a higher mn3 mn4 ratio which tends to enhance oxidative activity due to lattice oxygen increase 26 however mno2 in k oms2 not only plays a role as an oxidizer but is also able to adsorb heavy metal ions with strong affinity 27 as adsorption is a step prior to the oxidation reaction occurring at the solid liquid interface 28 the presence of mno2 tends to accelerate oxidation at the same time fe btc contains fe ions that act as coordination centers and links with organic bridging ligands because fe btc exhibits a high surface area and porosity attention has been given to its application for removing pollutants from aqueous solutions 29 33 although k oms2 and fe btc powders demonstrate favorable performance they are inconvenient for use in a continuous flow system for water treatment due to clogging and pressure drop therefore the authors of the current study perform continuous fixed bed column studies of as iii removal via the oxidation and adsorption coprocesses of k oms2 and fe btc coated on ceramic balls some characteristics such as the crystallinity and oxidation states of the materials coated on ceramic balls were reported in this study in addition the dynamic behavior of continuous fixed bed columns was described in terms of breakthrough curves the reuse of the oxidation column was tested the thomas and yoon nelson models were applied to estimate performance in the adsorption columns a combination of an oxidation column and adsorption column for total as removal was also tested as well as the leaching of manganese mn potassium k and iron fe 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the as v source in this study was disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o 98 sigma aldrich india the as iii used in this study was sodium arsenite naaso2 98 kemaus australia manganese ii acetate tetrahydrate mn ch3coo 2 4h2o 99 acros organics usa potassium permanganate kmno4 99 8 ajax finechem australia and acetic acid ch3cooh 99 8 qrëc new zealand were used as starting materials for k oms2 powder synthesis iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 qrëc new zealand and 1 3 5 benzene tricarboxylic acid c9h6o6 95 sigma aldrich usa were used as starting materials for fe btc powder synthesis ceramic balls with a 4 mm diameter al2o3 68 50 sio2 28 and others 3 5 bpf 05 thailand were used as the supporting material in the coating process a strong base anion exchange resin amberjet 4200 chloride form aldrich chemistry usa was used for as iii and as v separation 34 all other chemicals used in this study were laboratory grade 2 2 preparation and characterization of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated the k oms2 and fe btc powders were prepared using the methods described in our previous report 20 for k oms2 powder synthesis a kmno4 solution 0 25 m 40 ml was mixed with mn ch3coo 2 4h2o solution 0 33 m 40 ml the solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 by using ch3cooh and the solution was stirred well for 1 h the mixture was placed into an autoclave for hydrothermal processing at 100 c for 3 h then the black slurry obtained was washed with deionized di water to achieve ph 7 after which it was dried at 100 c for 3 h finally a black k oms2 powder was obtained for fe btc powder synthesis a fecl3 6h2o solution 1 m 75 ml was mixed with a c9h6o6 solution 1 m in ethanol 75 ml the mixture underwent hydrothermal processing at 100 c for 24 h then an orange jelly like substance was obtained and washed using di water to achieve ph 7 the orange precursor was dried at 120 c for 4 h finally an orange fe btc powder was obtained to prepare k oms2 and fe btc coated on ceramic balls referred to as k oms2 coated and fe btc coated respectively the preparation procedure was guided by the optimal coating conditions determined from our previous work first the starting materials at 1 to 50 weight ratios of k oms2 powder or fe btc powder to ceramic balls were placed in a 2000 ml beaker these mixtures were then transferred and placed on an orbital shaker to accomplish coating via the mechanical orbital shaking technique at 160 rpm for 24 h the coated materials were then dried at 120 c for 24 h finally the k oms2 coated and fe btc coated materials were ready for characterization and packing in continuous fixed bed columns the k oms2 powder fe btc powder k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were characterized to determine their crystallinity using x ray diffraction xrd bruker axs d8 discover germany cu kα radiation 0 1514 nm at 40 ma 0 02 step increment scan speed of 0 1 s step and 40 kv were used the scan range was 10 80 for k oms2 and 1 40 for fe btc at 25 c the specific surface area of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder was measured using a nitrogen adsorption desorption instrument quantachrome instrument autosorb 1 usa before analysis 0 1000 0 3000 g of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder was degassed at 150 c for 3 6 h 35 the samples were then tested for nitrogen gas adsorption desorption at 196 c data was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method to obtain a specific surface area in addition x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy was conducted over the spent k oms2 powder and the standards of as iii from naaso2 and as v from na2haso4 7h2o xanes was performed at beamline 1 1 multiple x ray techniques the synchrotron light research institute public organization located in nakhon ratchasima thailand the xanes spectra of the spent k oms2 powder and standards were analyzed using athena software 2 3 continuous fixed bed column experiment the continuous fixed bed column experiment was divided into three parts 1 as iii oxidation over k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column 2 as v adsorption over fe btc coated in a single continuous fixed bed column and 3 total as removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns fig 1 first the continuous fixed bed columns for k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were vertically oriented by using a 35 cm long borosilicate glass tube with an inner diameter of 2 cm after which they were connected at both ends to silicone tubes the inlet at the bottom of the column was driven by a peristaltic pump to maintain flow rates of 5 and 10 ml min and the outlet was at the top of the column their configurations were intended to retain the water level in close contact with the cross section of the material in the column and avoid flows due to gravity then k oms2 coated and fe btc coated were separately loaded into the individual columns at bed lengths of 10 15 and 20 cm by closing the tops and bottoms of the packed columns with 2 cm bed lengths of cotton wool and glass beads as shown in fig 1 a and 1 b at the same time 1 mg l sodium arsenite solution for the k oms2 coated column inlet and 1 mg l disodium hydrogen arsenate heptahydrate solution for the fe btc coated column inlet were prepared next a working efficiency test in each column was performed at room temperature approximately 27 1 c under the experimental conditions shown in table 1 the concentrations of as iii and as v and leaching elements namely manganese mn potassium k and iron fe were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes plasmaquant pq 9000 elite analytik jena germany the strong base anion exchange resin amberjet 4200 was used to separate as iii and as v before measuring the as iii remaining after passing through the k oms2 coated column 34 in addition a three round use cycle of the k oms2 coated column was examined to observe reusable oxidizing ability as the adsorbent reach maximum as v adsorption at a certain time the breakthrough capacity was calculated for only the fe btc coated single column using eq 1 1 breakthrough capacity mg g initial concentration mg l breakthrough time min flow rate ml min 10 3 adsorbent weight g the reason for the column separation was brought by the different roles between k oms2 and fe btc to study overall as iii removal efficiency by these two columns the combined columns of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated fig 1 c were performed with a 1 mg l sodium arsenite solution inlet the operation followed experimental condition ii at room temperature approximately 27 1 c the concentrations of as iii total as and leaching of mn and k from the k oms2 coated column outlet were monitored using icp oes while as v concentration was obtained by calculation from as v total as as iii in addition the total as and leaching of mn k and fe from the fe btc coated column outlet were analyzed using icp oes 2 4 sorption kinetic calculation using the thomas model and yoon nelson model in literature the thomas model and yoon nelson model have been proposed for calculating adsorption efficiencies modeling adsorption breakthrough curves and describing adsorption behaviors in columns 36 based on experimental conditions i ii and iii breakthrough curve data of as v adsorption over fe btc coated in the single continuous fixed bed column were fitted with the linear equations of the thomas model and yoon nelson model as given in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 ln c c 0 1 k t q 0 m q k t c 0 v q where c0 is the as v initial or inlet concentration mg l c is the as v final or effluent concentration mg l kt is the thomas rate constant ml min mg q is the flow rate ml min q0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g v is the effluent volume ml and m

constant l min t is the sampling time min τ is the time required for adsorbate breakthrough at 50 min and q0 is the adsorption capacity mg g the linearized equation plots were ln c c0 c versus t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of k oms2 coated and fe btc coated xrd was used in this study to determine the crystalline structures and phases of the coated materials compared to the bare powders since they were probably modified after coating via mechanical orbital shaking the xrd patterns of the k oms2 powder and k oms2 coated are shown in fig 2 a which revealed identical xrd peaks for the powder with cryptomelane kmn8o16 jcpds 29 1020 and manganese dioxide mn2o jcpds 44 0141 which are similar to our earlier report and those of other reports 20 37 40 peaks were observed at 12 6 18 1 28 7 37 5 41 8 49 7 56 0 60 2 65 4 and 69 5 which correspond to the 110 200 310 211 301 411 600 521 002 and 741 reflection planes respectively 20 25 40 this crystallinity was formed during the hydrothermal process 41 in addition k oms2 presented a broad xrd peak which indicated lower crystallinity and larger crystalline sizes 42 for k oms2 coated the identical xrd peaks were quite unclear with very low intensities for planes 200 211 411 and 521 but they remained along with the identical peak of the corundum phase al2o3 jcpds 83 2080 from the ceramic ball used as the support these results may be due to the thin layer used as well as the nonuniform distribution of the k oms2 coating on the ceramic ball which resulted in the low peak intensities and appearance of the corundum phase from x ray penetration the xrd patterns of fe btc and fe btc coated are shown in fig 2 b these patterns revealed the crystalline structure of the fe btc powder at 10 7 23 5 and 27 4 as observed in other studies 20 29 43 while the xrd peaks of fe btc coated were difficult to identify however it was expected that fe btc coated would still be able to adsorb as v in the case of an amorphous structure in addition xrd peaks indicating the phases of akaganeite fe 3o oh jcpds 34 1266 hematite fe2o3 jcpds 85 0987 and corundum al2o3 jcpds 83 2080 were found for fe btc coated the specific surface area from the bet method of k oms2 powder and fe btc powder were 270 7 and 0 6 m2 g respectively the k oms2 powder had a much higher specific surface area compared to other studies 20 39 40 42 45 however synthesis conditions such as aging time aging temperature 26 46 etc play an important role in morphological properties and consequently on oxidation activity on the other hand the fe btc powder provided a lower specific surface area compared to result from other studies 43 47 the xanes spectra for the spent k oms2 powder and the as iii and as v standards are shown in fig 3 this investigation focused on the mechanisms related to as iii removal over k oms2 coated it is notable that the spent k oms2 powder was used instead of spent k oms2 coated due to the limitations of sample preparation for the xanes measurements the absorption edge shapes varied between the spent k oms2 powder as an experimental sample and as iii and as v as reference compounds and showed various oxidation states of as the absorption edge of the xanes spectrum of as iii was at 11 869 0 ev 48 while that of as v was at 11 872 8 ev 13 which was similar to the absorption edge of the spent k oms powder therefore a partial amount of as v was likely adsorbed on the spent k oms2 surface after as iii oxidation which led to a loss of some active sites on the k oms2 surface with a consequent decrease in oxidation efficiency in the working column and the reuse cycle number 3 2 arsenite oxidation over k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves of as iii oxidation by k oms2 coated in a single continuous fixed bed column under different experimental conditions i bed length 10 cm flow rate 10 ml min ii bed length 15 cm flow rate 5 ml min and iii bed length 20 cm flow rate 5 ml min also presented are the breakthrough curves of total as and calculated as v using the equation astotal as iii as v it was found that the as iii concentrations in the effluents for all three experimental conditions exhibited slight decreases during the first 120 min with fluctuations which were subsequently quite stable until 600 min moreover the as iii concentrations for the experimental condition i were higher than those of experimental conditions ii and iii the similar breakthroughs of as iii under experimental conditions ii and iii demonstrated the undifferentiated oxidizing ability to transform as iii to as v for 600 min however the highest calculated oxidation percentages of experimental conditions i ii and iii were 88 51 130 40 and 114 91 at 60 120 and 200 min respectively percentages greater than 100 were probably due to the adsorption of the oxidized as iii on k oms2 coated as described in a previous report 20 and found in the xanes results of this study next the oxidized as iii was released after 120 and 200 min of experimental conditions ii and iii respectively therefore the mechanism occurring on the k oms2 coated surface is oxidation adsorption experimental condition ii was also chosen as the best condition for further study because it required a shorter bed length when considering the amount of k oms2 needed although the oxidation adsorption process occurred on the k oms2 coated surface the oxidation route was still the major mechanism of k oms2 thus k oms2 coated is largely considered to be an oxidizing agent that can be reused several times as iii oxidation by the three round use cycle of k oms2 coated in the continuous fixed bed column under experimental condition ii is shown in fig 5 the appearances of fresh and spent columns are shown in fig 5 a along with their c c0 versus time plots in fig 5 b after 600 min of three rounds of use partial amounts of the k oms2 coated surfaces in the column revealed the white surfaces of the ceramic balls due to peel off of k oms2 three round as iii oxidation efficiency decreased slightly based on the number of cycles but could not be significantly distinguished the average as iii oxidation percentages in k oms2 coated column for 600 min in the 1st 2nd and 3rd rounds were 95 92 and 93 respectively therefore it was concluded that the k oms2 coated column could be used repeatedly while maintaining the effective stable oxidizing efficiency of as iii throughout the test runs mn and k leaching during three rounds of as iii oxidation over k oms2 coated in a continuous fixed bed column under experimental condition ii was also investigated the results are shown in fig 5 c d the mn concentrations were 0 01 0 07 mg l for the 1st round 0 00 0 02 mg l for the 2nd round and 0 00 0 03 mg l for the 3rd round the mn leaching concentrations from the 2nd and 3rd rounds were probably consistent with but lower than that from the 1st round the mn leaching concentrations were also lower than the who drinking water standard which is defined as less than 0 1 mg l 49 for k leaching the concentrations were quite high for the 1st round especially during the first 110 min with a range of 0 55 5 42 mg l the k leaching concentrations were then low and stable even in the 2nd and 3rd rounds when using the k oms2 coated column the high k leaching concentrations were probably due to the position of k in the k oms2 chemical structure k is located in the cavity with a weak bond relative to mn due to the covalent bond between mn and o which is stronger 50 however k is not addressed by the who when establishing health based guidelines for drinking water 49 3 3 arsenate adsorption over fe btc coated in a single continuous fixed bed column fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves of as v adsorption by fe btc coated in the continuous fixed bed column under experimental conditions i bed length 10 cm flow rate 10 ml min ii bed length 15 cm flow rate 5 ml min and iii bed length 20 cm flow rate 5 ml min experimental condition i produced a steeper slope in the breakthrough curve than experimental conditions ii and iii as shown in fig 6 b d the fe btc coated column was able to adsorb as v and control the effluent concentrations at less than 0 01 mg l which is the as concentration limit in the drinking water standards established by the who 5 the breakthrough capacities were determined to be 1 16 0 31 and 0 28 mg g within the first 40 30 and 40 min for experimental conditions i ii and iii respectively the thomas and yoon nelson models were used to explicate the kinetic adsorption behavior and estimate the breakthrough curves in the column the equation obtained from a suitable model can be used further to illustrate fixed bed column behavior and scale up the treatment system for industrial purposes 36 the calculation results obtained by applying the linear equations of the thomas and yoon nelson models are presented in table 2 it was determined that the standard deviation s d values obtained from the yoon nelson model were lower than those from the thomas model for all experimental conditions thus the yoon nelson model was used to explain the adsorption behavior as well as for simulation in the case of the fe btc coated column in this study which determined that the adsorption rate decreased depending on the as v breakthrough and fe btc coated proportion 36 51 moreover the experimental condition i yielded the highest square of the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9206 for both models but the highest maximum adsorption capacity q0 occurred under experimental condition ii therefore as v adsorption over fe btc coated under experimental condition ii relying on the yoon nelson model was used for further study of fe leaching and the combined continuous fixed bed column fig 7 shows that the amounts in the fe leaching study from one round of use of the fe btc coated columns were in the range of 0 0 7 0 23 mg l although there is no guideline from the who for iron in drinking water as fe is found in natural freshwater at a range of 0 5 50 mg l because it is an abundant metal in the earth s crust 49 3 4 total arsenic removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns the breakthrough curves of total as removal over k oms2 coated and fe btc coated in combined continuous fixed bed columns under experimental condition ii are presented in fig 8 a the first column with k oms2 coated provided a decrease in as iii concentrations and was relatively stable after 120 min the oxidizing ability of k oms2 coated to convert as iii to as v in the first 600 min corresponded to the results from the single continuous fixed bed column and single column study of k oms2 coated under experimental condition ii as reported in a previous section of this study after 120 min of the k oms2 coated test run with more than 95 of as iii having been oxidized the second column with fe btc coated was immediately connected to the k oms2 coated column then the fe btc coated column served the as v released from the first column and treated the as v via the adsorption process the total as in the effluent from the second column was monitored as a representation of the entire as treatment working system the total as slowly broke through from the second column and remained higher than 62 of the as treatment throughout the 2200 min of the test run as a result there is a high possibility of combining k oms2 coated and fe btc coated continuous fixed bed columns for as iii removal which may be investigated in a future study table 3 presents previous studies on as iii removal through continuous column applications 52 58 adsorption over modified materials is the most common technique 52 56 the remaining minority is based on the oxidation techniques using oxidizer 57 58 together with the co precipitation 58 or adsorption processes in our study the as iii removal efficiencies in the column tests ranged in 62 100 depending on factors in particular column configuration bed size and operation conditions which required relative optimization to as iii water solution and material s properties moreover coating of k oms2 and fe btc on ceramic ball supports facilitates and expands the use in a continuous flow in the columns 52 52 56 58 resulting in operation ease and possibility mn and k leaching from the first k oms2 coated column and mn k and fe leaching from the second fe btc coated column in the effluents were monitored repeatedly as shown in fig 8 b c slight mn leaching from the first column occurred while k leaching was not observed in addition k was leached from the second column in only the first 40 min at 0 06 1 76 mg l before becoming undetectable while mn concentrations were indistinguishable from the effluent in the first k oms2 coated column additionally fe was slightly dissolved and leached since fe binds to btc with a strong covalent bond in the structure 59 based on available as iii treatment under 2200 min there is the interesting possibility of utilizing the findings for further study as a pretreatment of as iii and as v connected with point of use water purification in household units which is experiencing increased use nowadays 60 from this laboratory scale research the costs of k oms coated and fe btc coated preparation based on direct material cost calculation were approximately 35 and 288 baht 50 g respectively the material preparation cost related to the cost of as iii removal following experimental condition ii in combined continuous fixed bed columns within 2200 min was 43 baht l of treated water it should be noted that this cost provided for the range of 62 98 total as removal efficiency the cost of as iii contaminated water treatment will probably be lower in upscale operations however other parameters require further study such as the effect of ions in natural water as initial concentration unit operation condition unit configuration upscale of k oms2 and fe btc synthesis and coating other safety parameters of outlet water and cost benefit analysis 4 conclusions to enhance the performance of total arsenic removal a combination of oxidation and adsorption processes was proposed k oms2 coated was used for oxidation of as iii to as v while the transformed as v was adsorbed on fe btc coated in the continuous fixed bed column study the k oms2 coated column remained stable after 120 min and greatly oxidized as iii to as v during 600 min of the test run moreover the xanes results revealed that partial as v can be adsorbed on the k oms2 surface which may cause loss of its active sites additionally the k oms2 coated column can be used for at least three rounds in which the oxidizing capacity slightly decreases based on the number of cycles with very low mn and k leaching in the fe btc column as v was highly adsorbed by fe btc coated and fe leaching was quite low the experimental data were explained by the yoon nelson model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 52 60 mg g r2 0 8704 and s d 6 22 with the k oms2 coated and fe btc coated continuous fixed bed columns combined under the optimal experimental conditions more than 62 of the total as iii was removed throughout the 2200 min of the test run the coating techniques for k oms2 and fe btc in this study were determined to have the potential for practical applications in upscaled as treatment approaches funding this work was supported by the thailand research fund grant numbers mrg6180196 2019 and center

13486,we developed a novel fiber filtration system which allows the filter bed packing density to be adjusted to treat raw water of differing turbidities without coagulants a bench scale fiber filter is used to remove 5 20 μm poly methyl methacrylate particles with high efficiency without the use of coagulants the obtained data are analyzed using yao s model and regression models the first filtration cycle achieved a benchmark removal efficiency of 90 of 5 μm particles for 71 min with a darcy velocity of 38 2 m h each cycle included a backwash process but the filtration time gradually decreased to about 46 min by the 5th cycle however pressure loss did not increase significantly during the filtration cycles the shortening duration of filtration over operating successive cycles was postulated as residual particles remaining in the bed after backwash and rinsing we measured pressure loss at various darcy velocities for fiber filters with different packing densities and found that the square term of darcy velocity in ergun s model was significant by the regression analysis based on the experimental results of the novel fiber filtration system we compare the performance and running cost of a conventional fiber filtration system and a rapid sand filtration system the novel fiber filtration system comprising 940 mm fiber filter elements at a packing density of 110 g l removed 96 of 5 μm particles at a darcy velocity about four times greater than that of the rapid sand filter the running cost of the novel fiber filter was estimated to be approximately one sixth that of the conventional fiber filter using poly aluminum chloride and less than approximately 30 of the sand filter keywords fiber filtration particle removal backwashing pressure loss 1 introduction solid liquid separation is a fundamental process in raw water wastewater and industrial water treatment sand filtration is most often used as the first step in various solid liquid separation processes to remove suspended particles 1 5 in typical rapid sand filtration systems for raw water treatment sand grains of 0 4 0 8 mm effective size are used as the filter bed media 3 6 suspended particles are filtered from raw water by the sand grains in the filter bed particles are continuously removed as the water passes through gaps between sand grains this is known as the depth filtration process the phenomenological equation as a first order rate equation for particle removal was experimentally found in an early study 7 since then many studies on particle removal using sand granular media have been performed to better understand the mechanism of depth filtration 8 12 the mechanisms of straining interception inertia sedimentation and diffusion are all known to contribute to particle trapping in sand bed filters 3 8 9 11 12 during filtration particles gradually accumulate in the sand bed clogging the filter and increasing hydraulic head loss pressure loss therefore all sand filter operating cycles inevitably include a backwash process to restore the particle removal efficiency and minimize hydraulic head loss 3 4 6 the sand bed is backwashed in the expanded state fluidized bed to more effectively remove particles attached to sand grains a fluidized bed requires sufficient uplift force to resuspend every sand grain in the bed 3 13 it requires a high flow rate for the backwashing water therefore if the backwash of sand filtration is performed for a sufficient period of time to completely restore the filtration performance the energy consumption cannot be ignored in addition once the filtered water is used for backwashing high flow and long backwashing processes reduce water recovery efficiency for sand filters these are typical problems with sand filters that require improvement fiber filtration has been developed to overcome disadvantages of sand filtration in particular sand filtration has limitations with respect to the design of compact sand filtration systems because the typical porosity of sand filtration beds is approximately 0 45 which can result in high head loss when operated at high filtration rates 3 on the one hand fiber filtration has a high porosity of around 0 9 resulting in smaller head losses and higher flow rates 14 23 therefore the fiber filtration system is more compact than the sand filtration system however it is difficult to remove particles smaller than 10 μm using a conventional fiber filter therefore coagulants are applied to remove such small particles in all studies nakamura et al investigated the performance of 2000 mm long poly propylene fibers of 30 40 μm diameter at a packing density of 60 85 g l as the filter unit 16 that fiber filtration system successfully removed kaolin clay particles and kanto loam particles with poly aluminum chloride pac as a coagulant in addition they found the removal performance was 10 times higher when pac with the final concentration of 5 mg l was added as a coagulant lee et al evaluated the performance of a filter made with 1500 mm u shaped poly amide fibers of 30 μm diameter at a packing density of 80 g l to filter river water contained particles averaging 8 μm in diameter 17 they found that the filter removed at least 90 of the particles when pac was used as coagulant but the removal rate fell to 65 without pac in particular only 25 of particles with diameter of 5 10 μm could be removed importantly they reported that the fiber filter efficiently removed particles larger than 5 μm at a pac concentration of 1 mg l actually in realistic fiber treatment systems coagulants are usually added to guarantee the adequate removal of suspended particles on the other hand we know commercial water treatment operators would prefer not to add coagulants in the water treatment process to avoid the cost of these chemicals in particular if possible the preference is to employ a low cost particle removal system that does not require a coagulant in the water reuse process in addition there is concern by japanese waterwork managers about using a filtration system that can be operated without coagulants based on this information we decided that it would be highly practical and decided to start research and development of a new compact fiber filtration that does not require the use of a coagulant the goal of our development is to achieve more than 90 removal of fine particles larger than 5 μm in less than 10 μm for this purpose we sought to test fiber filters with higher packing densities using finer fibers the mean distance between the closest fibers in a fiber filter is proportional to the diameter of the fiber as shown later see eq 3 therefore if the packing densities are the same fiber filters made of finer fibers may be able to remove smaller particles for example in one study lee et al used a fiber bed with a packing density of 80 g l using 30 μm fibers 17 we decided to use a finer fiber to test a filter bed with a higher packing density than their study a simple high packing density fiber filter bed can be easily created by pressure filling the fibers however if the fibers are tightly packed it is very difficult to completely backwash the fibers therefore we developed a unique device called a bed compression cap bcc that can compress fibers during filtration to achieve a high packing density 24 during the backwashing step of the filtration cycle aeration of the bed lifts the bcc within the filtration tower and expands the filter bed to more easily remove particles and contaminants adhering to the fibers we expect that backwashing via this mechanism will be quicker and more efficient than in a conventional rapid sand filter the filtration of high precision can be maintained we had previously verified the reliability of the system hardware including the new bcc mechanism by operating a prototype for one year graphical illustration for demonstration system of the novel fiber filtration with the bcc are presented in appendix fig a1 the test results show that the bcc device has been stable for a year and has no serious problems in particular we initially feared that the fiber bcc connection point would break or unravel owing to frequent bending movements but the test results showed no such problems this test revealed that our bcc mounted fiber filtration device is mechanically durable for practical use however the test has not yet revealed basic filter characteristics such as particle removal performance therefore this paper reports on the characterization of a novel fiber filtration system this report is divided into four parts in the first part we examine the filtering performance using mono dispersed 5 20 μm model particles without coagulants the purpose was to evaluate the effect of flow rate and fiber packing density on the removal rate of particles that have different diameters in part 2 we evaluate the performance of backwashing using the bcc device to restore filtration performance in the next part we study the mechanism of pressure loss characteristics using different configurations of fiber elements because the pressure loss across the filter bed is directly related to energy consumption 3 finally we evaluate the feasibility of a novel fiber filtration system in particular we used the experimental results of the novel fiber filtration system to compare the performance with another fiber filtration system proposed by lee et al 17 and a typical sand filtration system furthermore in this study we used conventional models for flow and particle removal transport in porous media as frequently applied to depth filtration or other flow analysis in porous media such as groundwater flow to analyze the data understand the processes and further improve the operations of this novel filtration system 3 8 9 11 12 2 material and methods 2 1 fiber elements each fiber bundle in the fiber filter were made from 288 poly ethylene terephthalate fibers of 19 μm diameter sumitron suminoe techno co ltd shiga japan the fiber bundle was folded 125 times to form a single filter element fig 1 we tested filter elements of three different lengths 620 940 and 1200 mm in the experiments 2 2 particle suspension for filtration test water single dispersed pmma particles mx 500 mx 1000 mx 1500 mx 2000 soken chemical engineering co ltd tokyo japan were suspended in particle free water pra 0015 001 organo corporation tokyo japan the nominal diameters of mx 500 mx 1000 mx 1000 mx 1500 mx 2000 are 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm and 20 μm respectively from manufacturer s catalogue we measured water turbidity with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach colorado usa to rapidly quantify the particle density in the filtration tests we prepared standard curves of turbidity versus tss using each tss standard solution for each particle size the coefficient of variation cv of 5 replicated turbidity measurements was 2 4 since the linear regression of turbidity and tss for each particle size was sufficiently accurate r2 0 994 0 999 we estimated particle density mg l from turbidity in all experiments 2 3 structure and operation of the novel fiber filtration system ten filter elements were packed in a transparent acrylic cylinder or filtration tower inner diameter 100 mm height 1500 mm to form the filter bed as shown in fig 2 the effective capacity of the cylinder is approximately 12 l the top of each filter element was tied to the bed compression cap bcc as shown in fig 2 d a water flow check valve was attached to the inner side of the top of the bcc and a poly ethylene ring seal was attached to the rim of the bcc the total weight of the bcc including the check valve and the seal ring was 1 4 kg since the diameter of the seal ring was slightly less than the inner diameter of the filtration tower the bcc could slide smoothly inside the filtration tower whilst preventing water leakage between the bcc and the wall of the filtration tower all fiber elements were prewashed for 10 min with tap water to remove contaminants on the fibers in all experiments and the residual water in the filtration tower was completely discharged after the wash during filtration a feed pump model scd horizontal centrifugal pump ebara corporation tokyo japan pumped test water into the filtration tower by opening and closing appropriate valves as illustrated by the thick black line in fig 2a when feed water was pumped into the top of the filtration tower the flow forced the bcc downwards so it compressed the filter elements the degree of compression and the depth of the filter bed was fixed for each experiment by adjusting the length of plastic ropes which attached the bcc to the top of the filtration tower ropes not shown in fig 2 appendix fig a2 illustrates the filter bed depths packing densities and fiber lengths used in the experiments the packing density pd g l of fibers in the filter bed during filtration was calculated as follows 1 p d w f v f where vf is the volume of the filter bed when under compression by the bcc and wf is the total weight of the fiber elements the porosity ε of the filter bed was calculated using the following formula 2 ε 1 p d ρ where pd g l is the packing density and ρ g l is the density of the fiber material in this study the density ρ of poly ethylene terephthalate fiber was 1 34 10 3 g l furthermore the mean distance ds between the closest fibers was evaluated using the porosity ε as follows 3 d s d c 1 2 π 1 ε 1 where dc is the diameter of the fiber see appendix c during the backwashing step tap water for washing was pumped into the bottom of the filter tower as shown by the thick black line in fig 2b air was supplied from a stainless diffuser at the bottom of the filtration tower aeration and the up flowing backwash were sufficient to lift the bcc to the top of the filter tower the upward movement of the bcc expanded the bed providing space between the fiber elements for effective washing of the fiber elements after backwash the wash water was discharged as illustrated by the thick lines in fig 2c then the filter bed was rinsed with tap water before the next filtration cycle 2 4 experimental protocols 2 4 1 estimation of particle removal efficiency ten new filter elements were installed in the filtration tower for each experiment the feed water tank was filled with each particle suspension water containing pmma particles of 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm or 20 μm where each particle concentration was adjusted to around 120 20 mg l using pure water a water temperature of 25 1 c was maintained in all experiments the operation of the filtration system was as described in section 2 2 the filtration flow rates were 3 5 and 8 l min samples of influent and treated water were collected after 30 l had passed the filter particle concentrations in the water samples were calculated from the sample turbidity as described in section 2 2 the particle removal rate r was evaluated using the following formula 4 r 100 1 t s s t r t s s i n where tsstr mg l and tssin mg l are tss concentrations of the treated water and influent water respectively 2 4 2 temporal change in particle removal over repeated filtration cycles the effect of backwashing the fiber filter system was run continuously for five operational cycles to determine the changes in filtration efficiency over time the filter bed comprised 10 940 mm long fiber elements at packing density of 110 g l each complete operational cycle comprised filtration 90 min backwashing 6 min and rinsing 3 min for a total duration of 99 min feed water flow rate during the filtration step was 5 l min darcy velocity 38 2 m h during the filtration step samples of the influent and treated water were collected at 1 min intervals until 14 min from the beginning of the run to 14 min and then at 5 min intervals the particle concentration of the water samples was measured as described in section 2 2 the particle removal rate r was evaluated using eq 4 the influent pressure pin and the effluent pressure peff were measured by pressure gauges at points pia and pi respectively fig 2 to avoid pressure differences due to hydraulic head both the pressure gauges were placed at exactly the same height thus pressure loss δ p was calculated as follows 5 δ p p a p i n p a p e f f p a the backwashing step was as described in section 2 3 the backwash water flow rate was 10 l min darcy velocity 76 4 m h and the air flow rate was 75 l min darcy velocity 572 m h for 6 min after backwash residual water was discharged from the filtration tower then it was rinsed with tap water at a flow rate of 5 l min for 3 min this complete operational cycle was repeated five times 2 4 3 experiments on the pressure loss across the filter bed at different flow rates to analyze the pressure loss characteristics we prepared a filter tower packed with 10 940 mm long fiber elements the packing density was adjusted to 80 110 and 140 g l by changing the depth of the filter bed and the filtration flow rate q was varied from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 l min the influent pressure pin and the effluent pressure peff was measured for each flow rate to determine the hydraulic properties of the filter bed under the different filter bed conditions described above we applied eq 6 forchheimer extended darcy s law 3 to analyze the relationship between pressure loss calculated by eq 5 and darcy velocity 6 δ p a u b u 2 where u m s is darcy velocity defined as u m s q s where s m2 is the cross sectional area of the filtration tower and q m3 s is flow rate 2 4 4 data analysis all linear regression analyses were performed using statistical software r ver 3 4 on gui environment of rstudio ver 1 2 in a multivariate linear regression significant explanatory variables were identified based on the p value for the determined coefficient 25 then a model selection method with aic akaike s information criteria was applied to the linear regression analysis to choose statistical significant explanatory variables for a better descriptive model of the measured data where a smaller aic means a better model in the model comparison 25 in quadratic regression since the squared term can be treated as an independent explanatory variable from the first order term we applied a multivariate linear regression model 25 a significance level of p 0 05 for rejecting the null hypothesis was adopted for all statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle removal performance of novel fiber filtration system high packing density conditions were selected to achieve the research objective of developing a novel fiber filter capable of removing small particles as small as 5 μm with no addition of coagulants this is because we expected a high packing density filter bed to efficiently remove small particles lee et al used a fiber filter with an 80 g l packing density and a nylon fiber 30 μm in diameter with a porosity of 0 93 the mean distance ds between the closest fibers was estimated to be 70 μm using eq 3 their results showed that around 60 70 of the 10 20 μm particle could be removed without the coagulant pac although the removal ratio for the 5 10 μm particles was around 25 17 considering a simple scaling concept we expected that a fiber filter with a mean distance of 35 μm could achieve a particle removal ratio of 60 70 for 5 10 μm particles according to eqs 2 and 3 the mean distance of a fiber filter with a packing density of 130 g l using fibers with a diameter of 19 μm is 35 μm therefore we prepared fiber filter beds with four different packing densities 130 150 180 and 210 g l in order to evaluate the particle removal performance the packing density of 210 g l is the upper limit value that can be achieved with current bcc devices porosity values of 0 90 0 89 0 87 and 0 84 were obtained for each packing density using eq 2 respectively the three different fiber lengths selected 620 940 and 1200 mm were determined by considering the fiber lengths used in the actual design of the filtration tower and other studies 16 18 19 22 24 in this experiment four different suspensions of pmma particles with nominal diameters of 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm and 20 μm were run through the system each suspension was tested at three different flow rates 3 5 and 8 l min here the flow rates correspond to darcy velocities of 22 9 m h 550 m day 38 2 m h 917 m day and 61 1 m h 1467 m day respectively which are typical flow rates in fiber filtration systems 16 23 but are higher than used in rapid sand filters 2 4 we analyzed the experimental results using statistical regression models and interpreted the results based on the yao model for particle removal or particle transport in porous media for the characterization of the fiber filter 3 3 1 1 results the 1200 mm long fibers had particle removal efficiency of 100 for all particle sizes at all flow rates and at all packing densities table 1 the 940 mm long fibers removed 100 of the 15 μm and 20 μm particles under all flow and packing conditions and removed 97 or more of all particles under all other conditions except for the case of the smallest particles 5 μm at the highest flow rate and lowest packing density which removed 92 of the particles these data were measured as initial stable values after 30 l had flowed through the system however we think these results are superior to the performance of conventional rapid sand filtration in terms of filtration rate and removal of fine particle without coagulants 8 15 the darcy velocities in this experiment were set at several times faster than that of sand filtration 2 4 the filter bed porosity of 0 90 calculated using eq 2 is also around double that of a typical sand filter 3 26 therefore higher flow rate darcy velocity can be achieved with minimal pressure loss pressure losses recorded in this experiment were between 5 kpa and 16 kpa more details of pressure loss in this novel fiber filter will be provided later other fiber filtration systems have removed of fine particles at higher flow rates than sand filters 17 18 22 23 for instance lee et al 17 used a fiber filter system to treat river water with suspended solid particles of 8 μm average diameter and reported the removal efficiency was 65 without coagulant and 90 or more with coagulant pac that study used darcy velocity of 80 m h to the filter bed which was faster than the highest rate in our study however they needed to add pac niu et al used a nylon fiber filter with packing density of 112 140 g l and a filter bed depth of 30 cm 20 they tested the removal clay particles 5 μm or less in diameter mixed in tap water and obtained removal efficiencies of 93 8 91 7 83 0 and 79 8 with darcy velocities of 41 7 m h 62 5 m h 83 3 m h and 104 2 m h respectively but they also added pac at 0 5 mg l to achieve this performance although pac is a popular and cost effective coagulant our information is that managers of commercial water treatment facilities want to reduce the use of coagulants whenever possible therefore the capability to remove 5 μm particles is an important benchmark for improving filtration systems for practical use even though the pmma particles we used are only surrogates for naturally occurring suspended solids in raw water our fiber filtration system succeeded in achieving a removal rate of 100 for 5 and 10 μm particles at all packing densities and flow rates when using 1200 mm long fibers as shown in table 1 for fibers that are 940 mm in length 98 100 of 10 μm particles were removed and 92 100 of 5 μm particles were removed in addition the lower the packing density and the higher the flow rate the lower is the removal efficiency we also showed that the removal rate of the 5 μm particles was less than 10 μm however when using 620 mm fibers the removal ratio of 5 μm particles was found to be higher than 10 μm under some conditions in particular the conditions with higher flow rates and lower packing densities showed this tendency a fiber filter with a packing density of 130 g l showed a 64 44 removal with 5 μm particles and 48 38 removal with 10 μm particles at a flow rate condition of 5 l min 8 l min at a fiber packing density of 150 g l the removal rate of 5 μm particles was slightly higher than 10 μm under both 5 l min and 8 l min flow conditions for 180 g l and 210 g l the same results were obtained at a flow rate condition of 8 l min as shown in table 1 these unexpected experimental facts are very interesting because we initially predicted that 5 μm particles would be less efficient than 10 μm particles under all conditions 3 1 2 analysis and discussion we chose the shortest fiber 620 mm length to analyze the bed characteristics affecting the removal of 5 μm and 10 μm particles in detail because there was a broad range of removal efficiencies for these particles whereas the longer fibers had very high removal efficiencies for small particles under all bed conditions as shown table 1 and fig 3 note that 100 removal efficiency meant the effluent turbidity was below the instrument detection limit so those data were not useful for analyzing a range of operating conditions based on the four packing densities used in the experiments we estimated the mean distances ds between nearest fibers ranged from 24 35 μm from eqs 2 and 3 these values suggest the spaces between fibers were sufficiently wide to allow passage of all particles up to 20 μm 11 however the actual spacing between fibers in the filter bed must be randomly distributed with a certain probability that spacings smaller than the smallest particle size exist of course this probability increases with increasing particle diameter thus high removal for 15 μm and 20 μm particles at high packing densities could be due to straining by the fibers on the other hand a feature of this effect is that smaller particles and lower packing density conditions are less likely to capture smaller particles by fiber sieving however when 5 μm and 10 μm particles were removed with a fiber filter bed that has a low packing density of 130 g l the removal efficiency of the 5 μm particles was higher than that of the 10 μm particles as shown in table 1 therefore it was believed that the fiber filter removed small particles by other mechanisms according to the filtration model for granular filtration proposed by yao et al with the exception of the straining effect interception gravitational sedimentation and diffusion are the main mechanisms that enable a granular filter bed such as a sand filter to trap particles 8 in the mechanistic studies of fiber filters for aerosol removal three mechanisms of interception gravitational sedimentation and diffusion have also been applied 27 29 in particular logan used the yao model to analyze the filtration of particles in water such as planktons by fiber filters 30 considering these application examples we consider the yao model to be a suitable model for fiber filter analysis in the yao model the transport efficiency η is defined as the ratio of particles contacting the collector and particles approaching the collector this η is a parameter proportional to the collection probability at a layer of a filter bed assuming first order kinetics for particle trapping namely the following equation was assumed 3 7 c o u t c i n e x p 3 1 ε α η l 2 d c where cin out are the particle concentrations of the influent and effluent of the filter bed l is the filter bed depth or length ε is porosity α is the attachment efficiency of a particle thus α η is the deposition efficiency and dc is the fiber diameter the parameter dc is considered to be the characteristic length of an object placed in the stream similar to that used to calculate the reynolds number 29 for sand filtration applications the diameter of the sand particles is used for dc 8 in this study the fiber diameter could be used for dc which was 19 μm in the experimental system 30 this η is the transport efficiency which is calculated by particles contacting the collector particles approaching the collector it is the summation of the interception η i gravitational sedimentation η g and diffusion η d and these are calculated using the following equations 3 8 8 η i 3 2 d p d c 2 9 η g v s v f g ρ p ρ w d p 2 18 μ v f 10 η d 4 p e 2 3 11 p e 3 π μ d p d c v k b t where d p is the particle diameter m v s is the stokes settling velocity m s v f is the filtration rate m s pe is the peclet number k b is the boltzmann constant 1 381 10 23 j k and t is the absolute temperature k we calculated the values of η i η g and η d for our experimental conditions and it is apparent from those results that interception η i has the major effect on particle capture as shown in table 2 since the density of the pmma particle is only 1 19 g cm3 sedimentation can t have a major influence diffusion η d will mainly affect particles less than 1 μm in diameter 3 8 so η g and η d are negligible compared to η i as shown in table 2 therefore the approximation η η i 3 2 d p d c 2 is satisfied where d p is particle diameter although this formula qualitatively explains why particle removal increases as particle size increases η i is apparently independent of flow rate or darcy velocity however fig 3 shows there is a clear relationship between particle removal and flow rate an advanced theory by rajagopalan and tien rt model 10 takes van der waals interaction and hydrodynamic forces into account more exactly as a result their rt model included darcy velocity to the power of 1 8th which reduces the particle removal effect at high flow rate 3 10 however this effect seems too weak to explain our experimental data in addition all removal efficiencies calculated from η in table 2 were 100 but the observed removal efficiencies for 5 μm and 10 μm particles were less than 100 this result remains the same even if the rt model is used 10 therefore to explain these results the model of particle removal from water by fiber filters needs to be revisited for this purpose we think that fiber filter models used to study aerosol filtration would be helpful 31 33 eq 7 includes the packing density pd because 1 ε is equal to p d ρ see eq 2 furthermore according to the definition of pd 12 p d m l s where m is the total mass of fibers in the filter bed l is the filter bed depth and s is the cross sectional area of the filter bed tower therefore the expression 3 1 ε α η l 2 d c in the exponential function of eq 7 is equal to 3 m α η 2 ρ s d c eq 7 can be rewritten as 7 c o u t c i n exp γ m α η γ 3 2 ρ s d c in this experiment the total mass m of the fibers did not change because pd was changed by compressing the same fiber elements using a bcc device m depended only on the fiber length of the fiber elements as expected the ρ values of s and dc were the same for all experiments in this study therefore the equation in the exponential function of eq 7 did not change even if the packing density of the fiber filter bed having the same fiber length is changed by the bcc device we measured the removal of 5 μm and 10 μm diameter particles when the packing density of the filter bed was changed under the same fiber length conditions then the flow rate darcy velocity was also changed as well as the former experimental condition these results are summarized in table 3 considering the effects of flow rate and packing density the empirical formulas of η in eqs 7 and 7 were respectively prepared as eqs 13 and 14 and were used to analyze the experimental data in table 3 13 α η a p d b 1 q c 14 log α η a l o g p d b l o g q c α η e x p c p d a q b where a b and c are constants and q is the flow rate l min the regression model 13 assumed the reciprocal of the flow rate q as an explanatory variable with reference to the theoretical solution c out c in exp kv q of a pipe flow reactor capacity v with a first order rate k 3 the regression model 14 is a power function form that is often used in chemical engineering empirical formulas in order to calculate the response variable αη of the regression models of 13 and 14 eq 7 is transformed as follows 15 α η l o g c o u t c i n γ m where cin and cout can be obtained from table 3 the value of γ is 7 502 g 1 and the total weight m of the 620 mm fiber bed is 170 5 g we assumed that the attachment efficiency α related to the interaction force between particles and fibers was a constant value because particles and fibers with the same material were used the results of the regressions are summarized in table 4 in the case of the 5 μm particle removal the estimated coefficient b for the flow rate in both models 13 1 and 14 1 is statistically significant p 0 05 but the p values of the coefficient a for pd and log pd have a significance level that is larger than 0 05 therefore because it was considered that the particle removal did not depend on the packing density we again calculated the regression models 13 2 and 14 2 without the explanatory variables of pd or log pd according to the model selection method for multivariate regression analysis we should select a model with a small akaike s information criterion aic as a regression model to better explain the results 25 in other words in this case model selection refers to the selection of explanatory variables however it is not possible to compare models with different response variables such as models 13 1 and 14 1 models 13 2 and 14 2 had smaller aic values than models 13 1 and 14 1 respectively therefore we concluded that packing density did not affect the particle removal at 5 μm because the pd free models 13 2 and 14 2 were selected by aic on the other hand for the 10 μm particle the coefficients a and b in both models 13 1 and 14 1 were both statistically significant p 0 05 in addition the aic values of models 13 1 and 14 1 were smaller than the aic values of 13 2 and 14 2 respectively this result indicated that packing density affected the removal of 10 μm particles as we estimated the average distance between fibers was 35 μm at packing densities of 130 g l and 24 μm at packing density of 210 g l from eq 3 more 10 μm particles may be trapped by straining in filter beds with higher packing densities the probability of smaller spacing between fibers less than 10 μm particles can increase due to the heterogeneity of the fiber filter bed therefore the negative value of coefficient a in regression models 13 1 and 14 1 indicates that the particle concentration in the effluent decreased as the packing density increased however we believed that the spacing may be sufficiently wide for 5 μm particles to pass because the packing density did not affect the removal efficiency for 5 μm particles as previously mentioned on the other hand the interception mechanism mainly determined the removal efficiency as already mentioned according to eqs 7 and 8 because the transport efficiency η i is proportional to the square of the particle diameter dp larger particles can be removed with higher efficiency however the results in table 1 show the opposite tendency under a higher flow rate and a lower packing density this result may be related to the effect of the flow velocity in the filter bed media the regression analysis clearly revealed that at higher flow rate darcy velocity the concentration of 5 μm and 10 μm particles in the effluent increased imagine if 5 or 10 μm particles are adhering to a 19 μm diameter fiber it is not surprising that increasing the flow rate would be likely to increase particle detachment and reduce particle retention in the bed in particular 10 μm particles that are attached to fibers are subject to higher fluid forces than 5 μm particles and 10 μm particles can detach more frequently this may explain the result that the 10 μm particles had a lower removal rate than the 5 μm particles as shown in table 1 when the detachment rate increases at high flow rate and low packing density it is considered that the net deposition rate decreases a study by niu et al showed that high flow rates in fiber filter beds reduced turbidity removal as in our experiments 20 guerra et al also found that as the flow rate increased the turbidity in the effluent from their fiber filtration system increased 19 moreover niu et al clearly showed that particle turbidity removal increased at higher packing density in their fiber filter beds in those experiments the porosity of fiber filter bed was around 0 90 to 0 95 which was similar to our fiber filters we suppose that the hydrodynamic character and the particle transport in fiber filters with porosity greater than 0 9 and darcy velocities from 20 m h to 100 m h will differ from that is conventional rapid sand filters with porosity between 0 4 and 0 5 and darcy velocity between 5 15 m h 3 in addition the transport property is apparently isotropic in a filter bed of spherical granules but can be anisotropic in a fiber filter bed as it will be affected by the orientation of each fiber to the water flow direction we did not determine exactly the distribution of orientation of the fibers thus more detailed mechanistic studies will be required to adapt conventional sand filter theory to the fiber filter 3 2 temporal change in filtration efficiency and recovery after backwashing it is known that the filtration efficiency of the fiber filter usually decreases in a relatively short time after each backwash as the filtration progresses owing to the high flow rate and high loading of turbidity so the fiber filter should be backwashed at an appropriate time to restore filtration performance 16 17 19 23 in particular it is necessary to determine the filtration time considering the decrement of the removal ratio during the filtration period because the time ratio between filtration and backwashing is related to not only the average particle removal but also the water recovery rate our aim in developing this fiber filter system was to remove fine particles without the use of coagulants so we examined the temporal change in the removal efficiency of 5 μm pmma particles and the recovery of filtration performance after backwashing the backwash conditions described in section 2 4 2 were selected in consideration of the conditions frequently used in other studies at the same time we also monitored the temporal change in pressure loss during the filtration process because the increment of pressure loss is one of the criteria to start the backwashing in this experiment we used a fiber filter bed with a lower packing density value of 110 g l because the lower pressure loss due to the lower packing density has an advantage in practical applications furthermore based on the result that packing density did not significantly affect the removal of 5 μm particles obtained in section 3 1 the good removal performance of 5 μm particles was expected even with a fiber filter with a lower packing density in order to optimize the filtration and backwashing operations for commercialization of products it is necessary to carry out long term tests for more than six months however because it is difficult to perform such long term experiments using pmma particles a field test is suitable therefore in future research field experiments are planned to obtain the long term performance of the novel fiber filtration system 3 2 1 results in this experiment the apparent increase of pressure loss in the filter bed was never found in each filtration period as shown in fig 4 in the first filtration period 7 kpa was maintained under a constant flow rate condition with a flow rate of 5 l min darcy velocity of 38 2 m h if anything there were some cases that pressure loss was slightly increased after backwashing the reason for the increase is that the folded state of the fiber element can change by recompression by bcc after backwashing effective backwashing is commonly performed in sand filtration systems before pressure loss reaches a threshold level to recover the pressure 3 6 13 on the other hand in the fiber filtration system we found particle removal efficiency decreased significantly before pressure loss increased as shown in fig 4 particle removal efficiency was 100 for 30 min after the start of the first period of filtration then removal efficiency decreased to 90 at 71 min and 86 at 90 min after the first backwash this pattern was repeated the duration of the period of 100 particle removal efficiency in the 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th filtration cycles was 25 min 14 min 14 min and 14 min and the period of 90 removal was 62 min 40 min 35 min and 46 min in each filtration step as shown in fig 4 thus the particle removal efficiency decreased over the first three operational after which the performance stabilized this result suggests that residual particles progressively accumulated on the fibers until a steady state was reached 3 2 2 analysis and discussion according to the particle removal mechanism discussed in the previous section a particle is mainly trapped by the interception mechanism and it then adheres to the fiber surface thus the surface of the fiber is gradually occupied by adhering particles conventional sand filtration theory explains that there are two opposing effects of particle deposition on the filter media 3 the first effect is the trapped particles gradually increase the media grain size thus increasing the probability of particle trapping and increasing the removal efficiency of the filtration process this effect assumes that new particles can adhere to previously deposited particles the faster flow conditions that can apply in fiber filters may cause particles to detach from other particles only permitting particles to deposit as single layer in such case the adhesion probability gradually decreases as the available adhesion sites are gradually occupied by deposited particles therefore the particle removal efficiency decreases as the result in this experiment since only pmma particles of a known size were presented to the fiber filter we can calculate the percentage of sites on the fiber surface that were occupied by adhering particles the total mass of captured particles until the breakthrough point of 90 removal in each filtration period was 40 3 g 37 6 g 28 2 g 22 6 g and 25 0 g respectively by using the values of the captured particle mass the nominal particle diameter of 5 μm the nominal fiber diameter of 19 μm the total fiber length of 940 mm and the density 1 19 g cm3 of pmma the percentage of fiber surface occupied by pmma particles was 25 2 23 5 17 6 14 1 and 15 6 then during each 90 min filtration period we estimated the percentage of surface occupied as 29 6 32 3 29 0 27 9 and 29 5 respectively then we can estimate the temporal change in bed porosity due to the deposition of particles through the filtration period from these results the porosity was constant at 0 918 throughout the filtration period and this result is consistent with no pressure loss during the filtration period assuming that particle removal decreases linearly during each filtration period we can estimate the time to reach 0 removal for each period this time was then used to estimate the total mass of particles removable by the fiber filter namely the particle removal capacity of the fiber filter bed this value estimated for each period was 229 g 0 884 g g fiber 225 g 0 871 g g fiber 140 g 0 541 g g fiber 110 g 0 424 g g fiber and 175 g 0 676 g g fiber these values correspond to high occupation percentage of 143 141 87 69 and 109 respectively considering the calculation accuracy of this estimation method it is acceptable that the occupation percentage value valid greatly and there are cases where it exceeds 100 therefore it suggests that the effective use of surface of the fibers can be expected if the filtration is continued until 0 removal however this is not a realistic operation for a filter system normally it is necessary to maintain a specific removal efficiency for practical use of the filtrate in this filter system we expect 90 removal or larger the filtration period for 90 removal or better was 40 min and 45 min after three operational cycles as the backwashing and rinsing steps took a total of 9 min the backwashing time is 9 1 of the total operational cycle we need to reduce the time spent backwashing to improve filtration capacity however we thought that the current backwashing protocol was not sufficient to washout all particles on the fiber actually the occupation percentage was 25 2 at 90 removal efficiency in the first filtration period this decreased to 14 1 and 15 6 in the 4th and 5th filtration periods the difference may be due to residual particles on the fiber other researchers have tested the efficiency of backwashing of fiber filters 16 21 nakamura et al used a longer backwash time of 30 min with 50 m h of water flow and 250 m h air flow they reported that 54 of the particles in the fiber filter were washed out 16 the backwash protocol for our study used stronger water flow 76 m h and air flow 572 m h but for a shorter duration lee et al succeeded in washing out at least 99 of the retained particles by repeating a washing sequence 14 times with air flow of 7 s water flow of 15 s and rinse of 35 s 17 other researchers also found repeated washing sequences improved the recovery of particle removal performance and pressure loss 17 19 20 such repeats and combinations of short backwashing may be effective for our filtration system so we need to optimize the backwashing conditions in future studies 3 3 pressure loss and filtration velocity the pressure loss of the filter bed is a fundamental specification of the filtration system in the previous section we obtained a result on the pressure loss of 7 kpa for the 940 mm fiber length and 110 g l packing density with a darcy velocity of 38 2 m h flow rate 5 l min the design of a good filtration system requires the basic characteristics of pressure loss that has to be obtained under a practical range of conditions the hydrodynamic theory of porous media such as darcy s law or forchheimer extended darcy s law can be applied to the analysis of flow in a filter bed using sand grains or fibers 3 34 37 in this experiment we set the three different packing densities 80 110 and 140 g l a packing density of 80 g l is the minimum packing density for bcc devices to function in our filtration systems considering the results in sections 3 1 and 3 2 high packing densities greater than 150 g l are not required to remove 5 μm and 10 μm particles however in order to perform a better regression analysis the flow rate was changed significantly beyond the actual set range of a practical fiber filtration system 3 3 1 results pressure losses in a filter bed using 940 mm length fibers were measured at flow rates of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 l min darcy velocities of 7 6 15 3 22 9 30 6 38 2 45 8 53 5 61 1 68 8 and 76 4 m h three packing densities were tested 80 110 and 140 g l by changing the bcc position fig 5 shows the pressure loss measurements at the packing density of 140 g l the plot of the relation shows a downward convex tendency this result clearly differs from darcy s law which shows a linear relationship between pressure loss and flow rate on the other hand the minimum sensitivity of the pressure sensor was 1 kpa so pressure loss at lower flow rates with packing densities of 80 g l and 110 g l was recorded as 1 kpa therefore it is not clear whether there was a proportional relationship between darcy velocity and pressure loss for the packing density of 80 g l and 110 g l it is necessary to use the forchheimer extended darcy s law of eq 6 to analyze the relationship between the pressure loss and the flow rate darcy velocity 3 3 2 analysis and discussion before the regression analysis the pressure loss is estimated using ergun s equation for porous filter media 9 34 16 δ p k v 1 ε 2 ε 3 μ l u d 2 k i 1 ε ε 3 ρ w l u 2 d where ε is porosity μ is water viscosity 1 002 mpa sec at 20 u is darcy velocity ρ w is water density 998 kg m3 at 20 and l is the filter bed depth the first term of eq 16 means the energy loss process by fluid viscosity and the second term means the energy loss process of kinetic energy 34 the non dimensional coefficients kv and ki correspond to the two energy loss processes according to ergun s study kv 150 and ki 1 75 estimated from the sand depth filtration 3 34 we consider that kv 150 and ki 1 75 for eq 16 are applicable for the estimation of the pressure loss of the fiber filter to calculate eq 16 porosity ε of 0 896 0 918 and 0 940 by eq 2 and l of 0 411 0 298 and 0 235 m from packing densities were applied for the calculation of eq 16 the eq 16 includes the square of darcy velocity however the calculation results of pressure loss are drawn with the three lines that are almost straight as shown in fig 5 the calculated values at 70 m h for three packing densities are very close to the experiment values therefore we considered that ergun s formula was able to estimate pressure loss in the fiber filter system however the measured values of pressure loss are mostly less than each line thus we speculate that the square term in eq 6 or eq 16 is more significant namely the coefficient ki must be larger than the value 1 75 from sand filtration in order to evaluate the magnitude of kv and ki from experiment data the coefficients a and b in eq 6 were estimated using linear regression analysis the results are summarized in table 5 for the packing density of 80 g l the estimation of coefficient a was a negative value and the p value of 0 615 is greater than 0 05 the aic value is compared equation δp b u 2 and δp a u b u 2 to select a better model of smaller aic values the aic of the model δp b u 2 is slightly smaller considering the physical meaning of the terms as energy dispersion term the coefficients a and b kv and ki must be positive because negative dispersion means energy generation therefore the model δp b u 2 is selected then ki of 28 3 is estimated for the packing density of 110 g l the equation δp b u 2 is also selected and ki of 34 7 is estimated on the other hand δp a u b u 2 is selected as the better model at a packing density of 140 g l by aic in this case it includes linear part of u as a significant term then kv of 68 3 and ki of 24 7 are estimated we considered the parameters ki and kv in eq 16 to have already compensated for the porosity effect therefore we need to consider whether the major difference in the characteristics of this flow lies in the difference in the specific structural properties of the filter media as a porous material including the form of the material actually it is known that the parameters kv and ki for rapid filtration using anthracite granules are different from sand grains therefore ergun s model is a semi empirical model and kv and ki have to be determined by experiment if we assume a simple cylindrical geometry for the filter media structure as seen in the sem images of the filter fibers in fig 1 we can consider the pressure loss as a problem of fluid flowing between distributed cylinders s kuwabara achieved an analytical solution for small reynolds number 35 lloyd spielman and s l goren used flow between randomly orientated and randomly distributed cylinders as model of a fiber air filter 36 they obtained theoretical relations between the volume fraction 1 porosity of the fiber media and the pressure gradient in their models the inertia term in the fluid equation was not considered therefore their results provide a linear relation between pressure loss drop and fluid velocity as well as darcy s law robinson and franklin treated the inertia term to explain non darcy flow in fiber filtration 37 this idea was the same as what was reported in ergun s study 3 34 this kind of research continues for the fiber filtration of aerosols 38 39 moreover numerical studies have been performed on the pressure loss and filtration efficiency of aerosol fiber filters 40 41 for aqueous solution particle removal processes have been simulated for a single fiber 42 although there is not much recent work on the hydrodynamic properties of fiber filters for water treatment studies of air filters or aerosols can be informative for flows at similar reynolds numbers darcy s law can describe flow in porous media with reynolds numbers less than one 43 so flow in a fiber filter must follow darcy s law when reynolds number is less than one this statement is not only based on a vast number of empirical facts but as mentioned above is a general fact based on theoretical and simulation studies of porous media containing fiber filters on the other hand it is considered that the square term in the forchheimer eq 6 relates to the drag force by inertia term in the navier stokes equation 44 in our study we estimated a reynolds number of 0 38 0 70 at 20 for water velocity of 0 01 to 0 02 m s in the fiber filter and a characteristic distance of 24 35 μm between fibers from eq 3 this means that darcy s law should be observed as shown in fig 5 to explain our result that the square term in the forchheimer eq 6 or in ergun s eq 7 was significant needs a reynolds number larger than one 43 the only possible way to explain the experimental results for the square term is to adjust the characteristic length in the formula of reynolds number 43 for example if the characteristic length increases 10 times the reynolds number also increases 10 times there is an observation that cannot be overlooked when considering the flow characteristics of the fiber filter bed during filtration the fiber bundles were intricately folded under compression by the bcc in the compressed fiber bed a narrow gap slit like gap with a width of several mm and a length of several tens of mm was frequently observed from the surface of the acrylic cylinder if such gaps also form within the filter bed they could play a role as channels through the filter bed the reynolds number of water flows in such a gap is estimated to be 1 100 or less in this case the square term in forchheimer equation becomes significant 43 of course to evaluate the effect of such gaps we need to solve the problems of water flow in a mixture media with a regular porosity and narrow gaps in fact such problems are much studied for fractured porous media relating to groundwater flow 45 46 non darcy flow in fractures was analyzed in several studies 47 48 we think that we can further investigate the hydrodynamic properties of the fiber filter based on such research 3 4 comparison of fiber filtration and rapid sand filtration performance finally it is important to compare the performance of our fiber filtration system and conventional filtration systems in particular the advantage of the developed fiber filtration system is its ability to remove fine particles smaller than 10 μm in diameter without the addition of coagulants management engineers such as those at water purification plants have sought a new filtration system that can filter fine particles without coagulants this study revealed that our fiber filtration system with bcc devices can remove 5 μm particles without coagulants as already mentioned most previous experiments on fiber filters used coagulants because other fiber filters cannot remove such particles without the addition of coagulants however as an experimental study by lee et al directly compared the fiber filtration efficiency with and without the coagulant 17 we can compare the performance of our proposed fiber filter system with their results in addition most rapid sand filtration systems in water purification plants also use coagulants to remove fine particles but the application of a sand filtration system for industrial water production using fine sand particles enables the removal of fine particles without the use of coagulants therefore it is necessary to compare the developed fiber filtration system with an industrial water sand filtration system without the addition of a coagulant in fact our goal is to replace such a sand filtration system with this newly developed fiber filtration unfortunately to the best of our knowledge there is no available test data for such industrial water and sand filtration so we used the rt models to estimate its ability to remove fine particles 3 4 1 evaluation of the performances of conventional fiber filter and rapid sand filter for comparison with our fiber filters we first briefly summarize the fiber filters used by lee et al and their experimental results 17 lee s fiber filter had a packing density of 80 g l treated river water with an average tss concentration of 11 5 mg l and had a productivity of 24 2 m3 h 581 m3 d to compare the filtration performance of lee s fiber filter a sand filter and our novel fiber filter we assume a tss concentration of 11 5 mg l in raw water under the same conditions as lee s filters darcy velocities in the fiber filter bed during the filtration period were set to 60 80 and 100 m h here 80 m h is selected for the performance evaluation the exact dimensions of the fiber filter bed have not been reported so the inner diameter of the filter tower i e 650 mm as described in the paper was considered as the diameter of the filter bed in addition the true direction of water flow in the filter bed was not well identified therefore because the authors assumed that the flow in the filter bed was a simple upward flow it is believed that the darcy velocity of 80 m h was calculated by dividing the inflow velocity of 26 5 m3 h by a cross sectional area of 0 3317 m2 the cross sectional area of the fiber filter in addition 2 3 m3 h 26 5 24 2 m3 h can be considered as the amount of water consumed per hour during the washing period the height of the filter is 1500 mm which is considered to be the height of the filtration chamber not the filter bed according to fig 1 in the paper by lee et al 17 the time for the turbidity removal ratio to fall below 90 was 100 min after the start of the filtration period the total washing time including the backwashing and the rinse was 5 min and 43 s the water recovery ratio rrec is defined by the following equation 17 r r e c 100 v n v t where v t 24 q f t f t v n 24 q f t f t q w t w t t t f t w vt m3 d is the total volume of treated water per day vn m3 d is the net volume of treated water per day qf m3 h is the flow rate of filtration tf h is the duration of filtration qw m3 h is the flow rate of washing tw h is the duration of washing and t h is the duration of one cycle when a darcy velocity of 80 m h a filtration time of 100 min and a washing time of 5 min and 43 s were set as operating conditions a water recovery ratio of 96 5 was estimated using 3 here the water recovery is defined as the ratio between the net and total water quantity of the filtrated water and we assume that the filtrated water is used for the washing water 3 the pressure loss increased from 13 8 kpa to 18 2 kpa increase of 32 during the filtration time of 100 min with the darcy velocity of 80 m h the average pressure loss of 15 7 kpa was estimated for the 100 min filtration time the pressure loss is directly related to the power consumption of a water feed pump which is given as follows 18 p o w e r w q δ p e f where q m3 h is the flow rate and δp pa is the differential pressure which is the sum of the pressure loss of the filter bed the pressure loss due to the pipe flow and the water head difference the pressure loss in pipes and the water head difference will vary for each filtration system design but a common value should be used for comparisons among filtration systems this common value is assumed to be 50 kpa with reference to our fiber filter design criteria the parameter e f is the total energy efficiency including a pump transmission and motor 49 because e f 0 7 is applied to our fiber filter design we used the same value to evaluate lee s fiber filter system and rapid sand filtration system this calculation should take into account the total energy consumption of the filtration and washing processes however because lee s report has no information the backwash pressure loss of 40 kpa is expected to be the same as the novel fiber filter as mentioned later finally we estimate the electricity cost of us 0 434 for producing 100 m3 of filtered water as shown in table 6 the details of the cost estimation are shown in appendix d lee et al also found that 65 tss removal was obtained without a coagulant pac and about 90 was obtained with the addition of pac at a dose of 1 mg l in addition the particle removal ratios of 5 μm can be read from the plot of the particle size distribution of raw water and filtered water as shown in fig 3 of the paper by lee et al 17 the removal ratio of 5 μm particles was estimated to be 28 4 without pac with the addition of pac the removal rate increased to 78 4 however the addition of pac incurred a significant additional cost of us 1 97 per 100 m3 of water as shown in table 6 see appendix d as a result the total running cost per 100 m3 is estimated at us 2 404 as previously mentioned pac may not be used in the rapid sand filtration of industrial water to remove fine particulates for this purpose it was assumed that the grain size of sand had an effective size es of 0 6 mm the porosity was 0 48 the length of the sand bed was 1200 mm and the darcy velocity was 10 m h these numbers refer to the design of a traditional sand filtration system 3 then the rajagopalan and tien models were applied to estimate the removal efficiency of 5 μm particles for a rapid sand filter 3 in addition 7 1 kpa with 10 m h is calculated as the initial pressure loss using ergun s eq 16 with kv of 150 and ki of 1 75 the increment of the pressure loss in the sand filter bed can be estimated by considering the deposition of particles in the filter bed when we set the maximum pressure loss for the sand filter to 50 kpa to start the washing the filtration time of 844 min is determined using the calculation method explained in example 11 7 pages 921 922 in the reference book water treatment principles and design principles and design 3 then we set the backwashing flow rate of 72 8 m h to cause a 30 expansion of the filter bed and an adequate washing duration time of 30 min using a known method described in examples 11 3 5 pages 895 901 of in the reference book water treatment principles and design principles and design 3 using the duration of filtration the duration of washing and these flow rates the water recovery is calculated using eq 17 in addition eq 18 is applied to estimate the power consumption in the same way as for lee s fiber filtration system as shown in table 6 the electricity cost of producing 100 m3 of filtered water using a rapid sand filter is estimated to be us 0 597 see appendix d 3 4 2 performance comparison of the novel fiber filter conventional fiber filter and rapid sand filter as case 1 for our fiber filter we assumed a filtration tower with a fiber length of 940 mm a packing density of 110 g l a filter bed length of 0 299 m and a darcy velocity of 40 m h for the evaluation of our novel fiber filter because the results in section 3 2 showed good performance for the filtration of 5 μm particles under such conditions when 5 μm particles of raw water with a tss of 120 mg l were supplied to the fiber filter at 5 l min darcy velocity 38 2 m h the average time required for the removal efficiency to drop to 90 was 51 min after the start of filtration as shown in fig 4 the average particle removal ratio for 51 min was 96 and the total mass of particles deposited on the fiber filter bed during this period was 30 7 g an appropriate time to start the wash period is the time at which 30 7 g of particles will be deposited in the fiber filtration bed this time is estimated to be 531 min if the tss concentration in the raw water is 11 5 mg l and a 96 removal is expected at a darcy velocity of 40 m h after filtration the fiber washing period was continued for 9 min with a darcy velocity of 76 4 m h 10 l min by adopting a filtration tower with an inner diameter of 0 919 m filtered water of 626 m3 vt can be obtained each day and a net product water of 613 m3 per day vn which is calculated considering a filtration time of 531 min at a darcy velocity of 40 m h and a washing time of 9 min at a darcy velocity of 76 4 m h the water recovery was calculated as 97 9 100 vn vt using eq 17 using b 5 76 107 for a packing density of 110 g l in table 5 the equation δp bu 2 in table 5 estimates a pressure drop of 7 1 kpa as shown in fig 4 when filtering 5 μm pmma particles of 120 mg l tss the pressure loss of the fiber filter did not increase significantly during the filtration period however because lee s results show that the pressure loss increases by approximately 32 during the filtration time filtering the same river water is expected to increase the pressure loss to the same extent as our fiber filter therefore we estimate the increase in pressure loss for the worst case and assume that our fiber filter is twice the incremental ratio of the pressure loss increase in lee s experiment when the pressure loss of 7 1 kpa at the start increases to 11 6 kpa at the end of the filtration period the average pressure loss will be 9 4 kpa as previously mentioned an additional 50 kpa pressure loss was considered as pipe flow pressure loss and head loss to evaluate the power consumption taking into account the running cost of the washing process the cost of electricity per 100 m3 of product water is estimated at us 0 412 table 6 presents these results table 6 also shows the evaluation results of case 2 assuming a darcy velocity of 80 m h a packing density of 110 g l a fiber length of 940 mm a filter bed length of 0 299 m and a filtration tower with an inner diameter of 0 65 m the pressure loss can be estimated to be higher than in case 1 with an average of 37 5 kpa the high pressure loss is due to the square relation with the darcy velocity however the higher darcy velocity basically involves lower removal as shown in table 1 we assume the same removal ratio of 96 as in the case of 40 m h darcy velocity in case 1 because we believe that a further improvement of our novel fiber filter will achieve sufficient removal efficiency the electricity cost is estimated at us 0 548 which is higher than at 40 m h owing to high pressure loss however because the diameter of the filtration tower is slim it is possible to construct a filtration system with a small installation area so the filtration system in case 2 has the advantage in that it can be installed in a small factory space lee s fiber filter can be a slim filter tower but this traditional type of fiber filter requires coagulants such as pac to adequately remove 5 μm particles the operational cost is very high at us 2 404 per 100 m3 of filtered water with pac accounting for the majority of the cost if the conventional fiber filter lee s fiber filter using pac is installed in a factory with an annual water demand of 900 000 m3 3 000 m3 per day and operating 300 days a year the annual running cost of water production will be about us 22 000 however if our novel fiber filter is adopted in the factory the annual running cost will be about us 3 700 which is around one sixth that of the conventional fiber filter therefore owing to the high cost of this coagulant water purification facility managers prefer to avoid the use of the coagulant as much as possible as shown in table 6 a conventional rapid sand filter can achieve an estimated removal efficiency of 78 2 for 5 μm particles without coagulants in addition rapid sand filtration is a well proven filtration system that can be used with confidence in purification facilities therefore rapid sand filters are still in use today however because the porosity of the sand filter is approximately 0 5 which is lower than the porosity of the fiber filter bed the pressure loss increases as the flow rate increases and it is not possible to set a high filtration rate such as a fiber filter therefore sand filtration systems inevitably require filtration towers with larger sizes to obtain the same water treatment capacity this means that the sand filtration system requires a greater footprint than the fiber filter system however the backwashing of sand filters requires a high flow rate for the large footprint of the filtration tower as a result the sand filter has a lower water recovery rate because of the use of backwash water in addition backwashing requires a high pressure for the fluidization and expansion of the sand filter bed 3 therefore the pressure loss in the backwashing process must be higher than the backwashing of fiber filters in addition the washing time of the sand filter needs to be longer than that of the fiber filter 3 for these reasons the electricity consumption is larger than that of the fiber filter therefore the running cost us 0 597 of the sand filtration system is 1 45 times that of the novel fiber filtration systems case 1 as shown in table 6 the difference in the operational costs of the two filtration systems for an annual water demand of 900 000 m3 is about us 1 700 in particular when a rapid sand filter treats highly turbid raw water a pac dose of approximately 5 mg l or more is always required to obtain sufficiently clean water the cost of pac for the annual water demand of 900 000 m3 will be about us 43 000 in addition to its low operational costs its compact size is also an important advantage of the new fiber filtration system therefore we consider that there is sufficient motivation to replace a conventional sand filtration system with our novel fiber filter for this purpose in future research sufficient experimental data should be obtained to optimize the filtration and backwash process using real raw water for further improvement 4 conclusions we have developed a novel fiber filtration system that uses a unique bed compression cap bcc structure which compresses the pet polymer fiber elements and maintains the filter bed at a constant depth and packing density the aim was to develop a system for filtering low or high turbidity water without using coagulants as an alternative to rapid sand filtration we investigated the properties of fiber filters with respect to particle removal backwashing effect and pressure loss the fiber filter removed 92 100 of 5 μm pmma particles and 98 100 of 10 μm pmma particles using a 940 mm fiber element at a packing density of 130 210 g l and a flow rate of 3 8 l min darcy velocity of 22 9 61 1 m h these flow rates are several times faster than conventional rapid sand filtration when we applied yao s particle removal model to the fiber filter we speculated that the interception is the main mechanism to capture particles however the model could not explain the actual particle removal properties in particular the model did not show the observed reduction in 5 and 10 μm particle removal at higher darcy velocities or the increased removal of 10 μm particles at higher packing densities we investigated the temporal change in particle removal and recovery after backwashing the 5 μm particles were 90 removable for about 71 min in the first filtration period then gradually shortened to 35 and 46 min in the 4th and 5th periods however no significant increase in pressure loss was observed during each filtration period next the coverage of the fiber with the particles was evaluated as a single layer deposition at the breakthrough point defined as 90 removal 25 2 of the fiber surface was covered with particles which gradually decreased with repeated backwashing this effect was interpreted as inefficient backwash leading to the buildup of residual particles pressure loss at various darcy velocities was measured for fiber filters with packing densities of 80 110 and 140 g l using a fiber length of 940 mm using the porosity calculated from ergun s model and particle size of the fiber filter the pressure loss characteristics showed almost darcy s law of linear relation to the flow rate and the predicted value was relatively close to the experimental value however we found that the square term of darcy velocity in the forchheimer equation was significant from the regression analysis of the measured data this was evidence that the predominant pressure loss with drag force at reynolds numbers greater than 1 was more pronounced in the fiber filter bed than in the sand filter bed we speculated that narrow gaps of millimeter scale observed at the fiber filter surface bed could also occur within the bed and create areas with larger reynolds number assuming that river water tss 11 5 mg l is treated at approximately 600 m3 day the novel fiber filtration system fiber length 940 mm and packing density 110 g l was compared with a conventional fiber filtration system and a rapid sand filtration system the novel fiber filter was estimated to remove 96 of 5 μm particles without using pac at approximately one sixth of the operational cost of a conventional fiber filter using pac owing to the low pressure loss and high water recovery of the novel fiber filter the operational cost without pac was estimated to be less than approximately 30 of that of the sand filter in addition because the low pressure loss of the novel fiber filter allows a high filtration flow rate the smaller footprint is an advantage of the novel fiber filtration system acknowledgements pmma particles were kindly supplied from soken chemical engineering co ltd japan

13486,we developed a novel fiber filtration system which allows the filter bed packing density to be adjusted to treat raw water of differing turbidities without coagulants a bench scale fiber filter is used to remove 5 20 μm poly methyl methacrylate particles with high efficiency without the use of coagulants the obtained data are analyzed using yao s model and regression models the first filtration cycle achieved a benchmark removal efficiency of 90 of 5 μm particles for 71 min with a darcy velocity of 38 2 m h each cycle included a backwash process but the filtration time gradually decreased to about 46 min by the 5th cycle however pressure loss did not increase significantly during the filtration cycles the shortening duration of filtration over operating successive cycles was postulated as residual particles remaining in the bed after backwash and rinsing we measured pressure loss at various darcy velocities for fiber filters with different packing densities and found that the square term of darcy velocity in ergun s model was significant by the regression analysis based on the experimental results of the novel fiber filtration system we compare the performance and running cost of a conventional fiber filtration system and a rapid sand filtration system the novel fiber filtration system comprising 940 mm fiber filter elements at a packing density of 110 g l removed 96 of 5 μm particles at a darcy velocity about four times greater than that of the rapid sand filter the running cost of the novel fiber filter was estimated to be approximately one sixth that of the conventional fiber filter using poly aluminum chloride and less than approximately 30 of the sand filter keywords fiber filtration particle removal backwashing pressure loss 1 introduction

particles are filtered from raw water by the sand grains in the filter bed particles are continuously removed as the water passes through gaps between sand grains this is known as the depth filtration process the phenomenological equation as a first order rate equation for particle removal was experimentally found in an early study 7 since then many studies on particle removal using sand granular media have been performed to better understand the mechanism of depth filtration 8 12 the mechanisms of straining interception inertia sedimentation and diffusion are all known to contribute to particle trapping in sand bed filters 3 8 9 11 12 during filtration particles gradually accumulate in the sand bed clogging the filter and increasing hydraulic head loss pressure loss therefore all sand filter operating cycles inevitably include a backwash process to restore the particle removal efficiency and minimize hydraulic head loss 3 4 6 the sand bed is backwashed in the expanded state fluidized bed to more effectively remove particles attached to sand grains a fluidized bed requires sufficient uplift force to resuspend every sand grain in the bed 3 13 it requires a high flow rate for the backwashing water therefore if the backwash of sand filtration is performed for a sufficient period of time to completely restore the filtration performance the energy consumption cannot be ignored in addition once the filtered water is used for backwashing high flow and long backwashing processes reduce water recovery efficiency for sand filters these are typical problems with sand filters that require improvement fiber filtration has been developed to overcome disadvantages of sand filtration in particular sand filtration has limitations with respect to the design of compact sand filtration systems because the typical porosity of sand filtration beds is approximately 0 45 which can result in high head loss when operated at high filtration rates 3 on the one hand fiber filtration has a high porosity of around 0 9 resulting in smaller head losses and higher flow rates 14 23 therefore the fiber filtration system is more compact than the sand filtration system however it is difficult to remove particles smaller than 10 μm using a conventional fiber filter therefore coagulants are applied to remove such small particles in all studies nakamura et al investigated the performance of 2000 mm long poly propylene fibers of 30 40 μm diameter at a packing density of 60 85 g l as the filter unit 16 that fiber filtration system successfully removed kaolin clay particles and kanto loam particles with poly aluminum chloride pac as a coagulant in addition they found the removal performance was 10 times higher when pac with the final concentration of 5 mg l was added as a coagulant lee et al evaluated the performance of a filter made with 1500 mm u shaped poly amide fibers of 30 μm diameter at a packing density of 80 g l to filter river water contained particles averaging 8 μm in diameter 17 they found that the filter removed at least 90 of the particles when pac was used as coagulant but the removal rate fell to 65 without pac in particular only 25 of particles with diameter of 5 10 μm could be removed importantly they reported that the fiber filter efficiently removed particles larger than 5 μm at a pac concentration of 1 mg l actually in realistic fiber treatment systems coagulants are usually added to guarantee the adequate removal of suspended particles on the other hand we know commercial water treatment operators would prefer not to add coagulants in the water treatment process to avoid the cost of these chemicals in particular if possible the preference is to employ a low cost particle removal system that does not require a coagulant in the water reuse process in addition there is concern by japanese waterwork managers about using a filtration system that can be operated without coagulants based on this information we decided that it would be highly practical and decided to start research and development of a new compact fiber filtration that does not require the use of a coagulant the goal of our development is to achieve more than 90 removal of fine particles larger than 5 μm in less than 10 μm for this purpose we sought to test fiber filters with higher packing densities using finer fibers the mean distance between the closest fibers in a fiber filter is proportional to the diameter of the fiber as shown later see eq 3 therefore if the packing densities are the same fiber filters made of finer fibers may be able to remove smaller particles for example in one study lee et al used a fiber bed with a packing density of 80 g l using 30 μm fibers 17 we decided to use a finer fiber to test a filter bed with a higher packing density than their study a simple high packing density fiber filter bed can be easily created by pressure filling the fibers however if the fibers are tightly packed it is very difficult to completely backwash the fibers therefore we developed a unique device called a bed compression cap bcc that can compress fibers during filtration to achieve a high packing density 24 during the backwashing step of the filtration cycle aeration of the bed lifts the bcc within the filtration tower and expands the filter bed to more easily remove particles and contaminants adhering to the fibers we expect that backwashing via this mechanism will be quicker and more efficient than in a conventional rapid sand filter the filtration of high precision can be maintained we had previously verified the reliability of the system hardware including the new bcc mechanism by operating a prototype for one year graphical illustration for demonstration system of the novel fiber filtration with the bcc are presented in appendix fig a1 the test results show that the bcc device has been stable for a year and has no serious problems in particular we initially feared that the fiber bcc connection point would break or unravel owing to frequent bending movements but the test results showed no such problems this test revealed that our bcc mounted fiber filtration device is mechanically durable for practical use however the test has not yet revealed basic filter characteristics such as particle removal performance therefore this paper reports on the characterization of a novel fiber filtration system this report is divided into four parts in the first part we examine the filtering performance using mono dispersed 5 20 μm model particles without coagulants the purpose was to evaluate the effect of flow rate and fiber packing density on the removal rate of particles that have different diameters in part 2 we evaluate the performance of backwashing using the bcc device to restore filtration performance in the next part we study the mechanism of pressure loss characteristics using different configurations of fiber elements because the pressure loss across the filter bed is directly related to energy consumption 3 finally we evaluate the feasibility of a novel fiber filtration system in particular we used the experimental results of the novel fiber filtration system to compare the performance with another fiber filtration system proposed by lee et al 17 and a typical sand filtration system furthermore in this study we used conventional models for flow and particle removal transport in porous media as frequently applied to depth filtration or other flow analysis in porous media such as groundwater flow to analyze the data understand the processes and further improve the operations of this novel filtration system 3 8 9 11 12 2 material and methods 2 1 fiber elements each fiber bundle in the fiber filter were made from 288 poly ethylene terephthalate fibers of 19 μm diameter sumitron suminoe techno co ltd shiga japan the fiber bundle was folded 125 times to form a single filter element fig 1 we tested filter elements of three different lengths 620 940 and 1200 mm in the experiments 2 2 particle suspension for filtration test water single dispersed pmma particles mx 500 mx 1000 mx 1500 mx 2000 soken chemical engineering co ltd tokyo japan were suspended in particle free water pra 0015 001 organo corporation tokyo japan the nominal diameters of mx 500 mx 1000 mx 1000 mx 1500 mx 2000 are 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm and 20 μm respectively from manufacturer s catalogue we measured water turbidity with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach colorado usa to rapidly quantify the particle density in the filtration tests we prepared standard curves of turbidity versus tss using each tss standard solution for each particle size the coefficient of variation cv of 5 replicated turbidity measurements was 2 4 since the linear regression of turbidity and tss for each particle size was sufficiently accurate r2 0 994 0 999 we estimated particle density mg l from turbidity in all experiments 2 3 structure and operation of the novel fiber filtration system ten filter elements were packed in a transparent acrylic cylinder or filtration tower inner diameter 100 mm height 1500 mm to form the filter bed as shown in fig 2 the effective capacity of the cylinder is approximately 12 l the top of each filter element was tied to the bed compression cap bcc as shown in fig 2 d a water flow check valve was attached to the inner side of the top of the bcc and a poly ethylene ring seal was attached to the rim of the bcc the total weight of the bcc including the check valve and the seal ring was 1 4 kg since the diameter of the seal ring was slightly less than the inner diameter of the filtration tower the bcc could slide smoothly inside the filtration tower whilst preventing water leakage between the bcc and the wall of the filtration tower all fiber elements were prewashed for 10 min with tap water to remove contaminants on the fibers in all experiments and the residual water in the filtration tower was completely discharged after the wash during filtration a feed pump model scd horizontal centrifugal pump ebara corporation tokyo japan pumped test water into the filtration tower by opening and closing appropriate valves as illustrated by the thick black line in fig 2a when feed water was pumped into the top of the filtration tower the flow forced the bcc downwards so it compressed the filter elements the degree of compression and the depth of the filter bed was fixed for each experiment by adjusting the length of plastic ropes which attached the bcc to the top of the filtration tower ropes not shown in fig 2 appendix fig a2 illustrates the filter bed depths packing densities and fiber lengths used in the experiments the packing density pd g l of fibers in the filter bed during filtration was calculated as follows 1 p d w f v f where vf is the volume of the filter bed when under compression by the bcc and wf is the total weight of the fiber elements the porosity ε of the filter bed was calculated using the following formula 2 ε 1 p d ρ where pd g l is the packing density and ρ g l is the density of the fiber material in this study the density ρ of poly ethylene terephthalate fiber was 1 34 10 3 g l furthermore the mean distance ds between the closest fibers was evaluated using the porosity ε as follows 3 d s d c 1 2 π 1 ε 1 where dc is the diameter of the fiber see appendix c during the backwashing step tap water for washing was pumped into the bottom of the filter tower as shown by the thick black line in fig 2b air was supplied from a stainless diffuser at the bottom of the filtration tower aeration and the up flowing backwash were sufficient to lift the bcc to the top of the filter tower the upward movement of the bcc expanded the bed providing space between the fiber elements for effective washing of the fiber elements after backwash the wash water was discharged as illustrated by the thick lines in fig 2c then the filter bed was rinsed with tap water before the next filtration cycle 2 4 experimental protocols 2 4 1 estimation of particle removal efficiency ten new filter elements were installed in the filtration tower for each experiment the feed water tank was filled with each particle suspension water containing pmma particles of 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm or 20 μm where each particle concentration was adjusted to around 120 20 mg l using pure water a water temperature of 25 1 c was maintained in all experiments the operation of the filtration system was as described in section 2 2 the filtration flow rates were 3 5 and 8 l min samples of influent and treated water were collected after 30 l had passed the filter particle concentrations in the water samples were calculated from the sample turbidity as described in section 2 2 the particle removal rate r was evaluated using the following formula 4 r 100 1 t s s t r t s s i n where tsstr mg l and tssin mg l are tss concentrations of the treated water and influent water respectively 2 4 2 temporal change in particle removal over repeated filtration cycles the effect of backwashing the fiber filter system was run continuously for five operational cycles to determine the changes in filtration efficiency over time the filter bed comprised 10 940 mm long fiber elements at packing density of 110 g l each complete operational cycle comprised filtration 90 min backwashing 6 min and rinsing 3 min for a total duration of 99 min feed water flow rate during the filtration step was 5 l min darcy velocity 38 2 m h during the filtration step samples of the influent and treated water were collected at 1 min intervals until 14 min from the beginning of the run to 14 min and then at 5 min intervals the particle concentration of the water samples was measured as described in section 2 2 the particle removal rate r was evaluated using eq 4 the influent pressure pin and the effluent pressure peff were measured by pressure gauges at points pia and pi respectively fig 2 to avoid pressure differences due to hydraulic head both the pressure gauges were placed at exactly the same height thus pressure loss δ p was calculated as follows 5 δ p p a p i n p a p e f f p a the backwashing step was as described in section 2 3 the backwash water flow rate was 10 l min darcy velocity 76 4 m h and the air flow rate was 75 l min darcy velocity 572 m h for 6 min after backwash residual water was discharged from the filtration tower then it was rinsed with tap water at a flow rate of 5 l min for 3 min this complete operational cycle was repeated five times 2 4 3 experiments on the pressure loss across the filter bed at different flow rates to analyze the pressure loss characteristics we prepared a filter tower packed with 10 940 mm long fiber elements the packing density was adjusted to 80 110 and 140 g l by changing the depth of the filter bed and the filtration flow rate q was varied from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 l min the influent pressure pin and the effluent pressure peff was measured for each flow rate to determine the hydraulic properties of the filter bed under the different filter bed conditions described above we applied eq 6 forchheimer extended darcy s law 3 to analyze the relationship between pressure loss calculated by eq 5 and darcy velocity 6 δ p a u b u 2 where u m s is darcy velocity defined as u m s q s where s m2 is the cross sectional area of the filtration tower and q m3 s is flow rate 2 4 4 data analysis all linear regression analyses were performed using statistical software r ver 3 4 on gui environment of rstudio ver 1 2 in a multivariate linear regression significant explanatory variables were identified based on the p value for the determined coefficient 25 then a model selection method with aic akaike s information criteria was applied to the linear regression analysis to choose statistical significant explanatory variables for a better descriptive model of the measured data where a smaller aic means a better model in the model comparison 25 in quadratic regression since the squared term can be treated as an independent explanatory variable from the first order term we applied a multivariate linear regression model 25 a significance level of p 0 05 for rejecting the null hypothesis was adopted for all statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle removal performance of novel fiber filtration system high packing density conditions were selected to achieve the research objective of developing a novel fiber filter capable of removing small particles as small as 5 μm with no addition of coagulants this is because we expected a high packing density filter bed to efficiently remove small particles lee et al used a fiber filter with an 80 g l packing density and a nylon fiber 30 μm in diameter with a porosity of 0 93 the mean distance ds between the closest fibers was estimated to be 70 μm using eq 3 their results showed that around 60 70 of the 10 20 μm particle could be removed without the coagulant pac although the removal ratio for the 5 10 μm particles was around 25 17 considering a simple scaling concept we expected that a fiber filter with a mean distance of 35 μm could achieve a particle removal ratio of 60 70 for 5 10 μm particles according to eqs 2 and 3 the mean distance of a fiber filter with a packing density of 130 g l using fibers with a diameter of 19 μm is 35 μm therefore we prepared fiber filter beds with four different packing densities 130 150 180 and 210 g l in order to evaluate the particle removal performance the packing density of 210 g l is the upper limit value that can be achieved with current bcc devices porosity values of 0 90 0 89 0 87 and 0 84 were obtained for each packing density using eq 2 respectively the three different fiber lengths selected 620 940 and 1200 mm were determined by considering the fiber lengths used in the actual design of the filtration tower and other studies 16 18 19 22 24 in this experiment four different suspensions of pmma particles with nominal diameters of 5 μm 10 μm 15 μm and 20 μm were run through the system each suspension was tested at three different flow rates 3 5 and 8 l min here the flow rates correspond to darcy velocities of 22 9 m h 550 m day 38 2 m h 917 m day and 61 1 m h 1467 m day respectively which are typical flow rates in fiber filtration systems 16 23 but are higher than used in rapid sand filters 2 4 we analyzed the experimental results using statistical regression models and interpreted the results based on the yao model for particle removal or particle transport in porous media for the characterization of the fiber filter 3 3 1 1 results the 1200 mm long fibers had particle removal efficiency of 100 for all particle sizes at all flow rates and at all packing densities table 1 the 940 mm long fibers removed 100 of the 15 μm and 20 μm particles under all flow and packing conditions and removed 97 or more of all particles under all other conditions except for the case of the smallest particles 5 μm at the highest flow rate and lowest packing density which removed 92 of the particles these data were measured as initial stable values after 30 l had flowed through the system however we think these results are superior to the performance of conventional rapid sand filtration in terms of filtration rate and removal of fine particle without coagulants 8 15 the darcy velocities in this experiment were set at several times faster than that of sand filtration 2 4 the filter bed porosity of 0 90 calculated using eq 2 is also around double that of a typical sand filter 3 26 therefore higher flow rate darcy velocity can be achieved with minimal pressure loss pressure losses recorded in this experiment were between 5 kpa and 16 kpa more details of pressure loss in this novel fiber filter will be provided later other fiber filtration systems have removed of fine particles at higher flow rates than sand filters 17 18 22 23 for instance lee et al 17 used a fiber filter system to treat river water with suspended solid particles of 8 μm average diameter and reported the removal efficiency was 65 without coagulant and 90 or more with coagulant pac that study used darcy velocity of 80 m h to the filter bed which was faster than the highest rate in our study however they needed to add pac niu et al used a nylon fiber filter with packing density of 112 140 g l and a filter bed depth of 30 cm 20 they tested the removal clay particles 5 μm or less in diameter mixed in tap water and obtained removal efficiencies of 93 8 91 7 83 0 and 79 8 with darcy velocities of 41 7 m h 62 5 m h 83 3 m h and 104 2 m h respectively but they also added pac at 0 5 mg l to achieve this performance although pac is a popular and cost effective coagulant our information is that managers of commercial water treatment facilities want to reduce the use of coagulants whenever possible therefore the capability to remove 5 μm particles is an important benchmark for improving filtration systems for practical use even though the pmma particles we used are only surrogates for naturally occurring suspended solids in raw water our fiber filtration system succeeded in achieving a removal rate of 100 for 5 and 10 μm particles at all packing densities and flow rates when using 1200 mm long fibers as shown in table 1 for fibers that are 940 mm in length 98 100 of 10 μm particles were removed and 92 100 of 5 μm particles were removed in addition the lower the packing density and the higher the flow rate the lower is the removal efficiency we also showed that the removal rate of the 5 μm particles was less than 10 μm however when using 620 mm fibers the removal ratio of 5 μm particles was found to be higher than 10 μm under some conditions in particular the conditions with higher flow rates and lower packing densities showed this tendency a fiber filter with a packing density of 130 g l showed a 64 44 removal with 5 μm particles and 48 38 removal with 10 μm particles at a flow rate condition of 5 l min 8 l min at a fiber packing density of 150 g l the removal rate of 5 μm particles was slightly higher than 10 μm under both 5 l min and 8 l min flow conditions for 180 g l and 210 g l the same results were obtained at a flow rate condition of 8 l min as shown in table 1 these unexpected experimental facts are very interesting because we initially predicted that 5 μm particles would be less efficient than 10 μm particles under all conditions 3 1 2 analysis and discussion we chose the shortest fiber 620 mm length to analyze the bed characteristics affecting the removal of 5 μm and 10 μm particles in detail because there was a broad range of removal efficiencies for these particles whereas the longer fibers had very high removal efficiencies for small particles under all bed conditions as shown table 1 and fig 3 note that 100 removal efficiency meant the effluent turbidity was below the instrument detection limit so those data were not useful for analyzing a range of operating conditions based on the four packing densities used in the experiments we estimated the mean distances ds between nearest fibers ranged from 24 35 μm from eqs 2 and 3 these values suggest the spaces between fibers were sufficiently wide to allow passage of all particles up to 20 μm 11 however the actual spacing between fibers in the filter bed must be randomly distributed with a certain probability that spacings smaller than the smallest particle size exist of course this probability increases with increasing particle diameter thus high removal for 15 μm and 20 μm particles at high packing densities could be due to straining by the fibers on the other hand a feature of this effect is that smaller particles and lower packing density conditions are less likely to capture smaller particles by fiber sieving however when 5 μm and 10 μm particles were removed with a fiber filter bed that has a low packing density of 130 g l the removal efficiency of the 5 μm particles was higher than that of the 10 μm particles as shown in table 1 therefore it was believed that the fiber filter removed small particles by other mechanisms according to the filtration model for granular filtration proposed by yao et al with the exception of the straining effect interception gravitational sedimentation and diffusion are the main mechanisms that enable a granular filter bed such as a sand filter to trap particles 8 in the mechanistic studies of fiber filters for aerosol removal three mechanisms of interception gravitational sedimentation and diffusion have also been applied 27 29 in particular logan used the yao model to analyze the filtration of particles in water such as planktons by fiber filters 30 considering these application examples we consider the yao model to be a suitable model for fiber filter analysis in the yao model the transport efficiency η is defined as the ratio of particles contacting the collector and particles approaching the collector this η is a parameter proportional to the collection probability at a layer of a filter bed assuming first order kinetics for particle trapping namely the following equation was assumed 3 7 c o u t c i n e x p 3 1 ε α η l 2 d c where cin out are the particle concentrations of the influent and effluent of the filter bed l is the filter bed depth or length ε is porosity α is the attachment efficiency of a particle thus α η is the deposition efficiency and dc is the fiber diameter the parameter dc is considered to be the characteristic length of an object placed in the stream similar to that used to calculate the reynolds number 29 for sand filtration applications the diameter of the sand particles is used for dc 8 in this study the fiber diameter could be used for dc which was 19 μm in the experimental system 30 this η is the transport efficiency which is calculated by particles contacting the collector particles approaching the collector it is the summation of the interception η i gravitational sedimentation η g and diffusion η d and these are calculated using the following equations 3 8 8 η i 3 2 d p d c 2 9 η g v s v f g ρ p ρ w d p 2 18 μ v f 10 η d 4 p e 2 3 11 p e 3 π μ d p d c v k b t where d p is the particle diameter m v s is the stokes settling velocity m s v f is the filtration rate m s pe is the peclet number k b is the boltzmann constant 1 381 10 23 j k and t is the absolute temperature k we calculated the values of η i η g and η d for our experimental conditions and it is apparent from those results that interception η i has the major effect on particle capture as shown in table 2 since the density of the pmma particle is only 1 19 g cm3 sedimentation can t have a major influence diffusion η d will mainly affect particles less than 1 μm in diameter 3 8 so η g and η d are negligible compared to η i as shown in table 2 therefore the approximation η η i 3 2 d p d c 2 is satisfied where d p is particle diameter although this formula qualitatively explains why particle removal increases as particle size increases η i is apparently independent of flow rate or darcy velocity however fig 3 shows there is a clear relationship between particle removal and flow rate an advanced theory by rajagopalan and tien rt model 10 takes van der waals interaction and hydrodynamic forces into account more exactly as a result their rt model included darcy velocity to the power of 1 8th which reduces the particle removal effect at high flow rate 3 10 however this effect seems too weak to explain our experimental data in addition all removal efficiencies calculated from η in table 2 were 100 but the observed removal efficiencies for 5 μm and 10 μm particles were less than 100 this result remains the same even if the rt model is used 10 therefore to explain these results the model of particle removal from water by fiber filters needs to be revisited for this purpose we think that fiber filter models used to study aerosol filtration would be helpful 31 33 eq 7 includes the packing density pd because 1 ε is equal to p d ρ see eq 2 furthermore according to the definition of pd 12 p d m l s where m is the total mass of fibers in the filter bed l is the filter bed depth and s is the cross sectional area of the filter bed tower therefore the expression 3 1 ε α η l 2 d c in the exponential function of eq 7 is equal to 3 m α η 2 ρ s d c eq 7 can be rewritten as 7 c o u t c i n exp γ m α η γ 3 2 ρ s d c in this experiment the total mass m of the fibers did not change because pd was changed by compressing the same fiber elements using a bcc device m depended only on the fiber length of the fiber elements as expected the ρ values of s and dc were the same for all experiments in this study therefore the equation in the exponential function of eq 7 did not change even if the packing density of the fiber filter bed having the same fiber length is changed by the bcc device we measured the removal of 5 μm and 10 μm diameter particles when the packing density of the filter bed was changed under the same fiber length conditions then the flow rate darcy velocity was also changed as well as the former experimental condition these results are summarized in table 3 considering the effects of flow rate and packing density the empirical formulas of η in eqs 7 and 7 were respectively prepared as eqs 13 and 14 and were used to analyze the experimental data in table 3 13 α η a p d b 1 q c 14 log α η a l o g p d b l o g q c α η e x p c p d a q b where a b and c are constants and q is the flow rate l min the regression model 13 assumed the reciprocal of the flow rate q as an explanatory variable with reference to the theoretical solution c out c in exp kv q of a pipe flow reactor capacity v with a first order rate k 3 the regression model 14 is a power function form that is often used in chemical engineering empirical formulas in order to calculate the response variable αη of the regression models of 13 and 14 eq 7 is transformed as follows 15 α η l o g c o u t c i n γ m where cin and cout can be obtained from table 3 the value of γ is 7 502 g 1 and the total weight m of the 620 mm fiber bed is 170 5 g we assumed that the attachment efficiency α related to the interaction force between particles and fibers was a constant value because particles and fibers with the same material were used the results of the regressions are summarized in table 4 in the case of the 5 μm particle removal the estimated coefficient b for the flow rate in both models 13 1 and 14 1 is statistically significant p 0 05 but the p values of the coefficient a for pd and log pd have a significance level that is larger than 0 05 therefore because it was considered that the particle removal did not depend on the packing density we again calculated the regression models 13 2 and 14 2 without the explanatory variables of pd or log pd according to the model selection method for multivariate regression analysis we should select a model with a small akaike s information criterion aic as a regression model to better explain the results 25 in other words in this case model selection refers to the selection of explanatory variables however it is not possible to compare models with different response variables such as models 13 1 and 14 1 models 13 2 and 14 2 had smaller aic values than models 13 1 and 14 1 respectively therefore we concluded that packing density did not affect the particle removal at 5 μm because the pd free models 13 2 and 14 2 were selected by aic on the other hand for the 10 μm particle the coefficients a and b in both models 13 1 and 14 1 were both statistically significant p 0 05 in addition the aic values of models 13 1 and 14 1 were smaller than the aic values of 13 2 and 14 2 respectively this result indicated that packing density affected the removal of 10 μm particles as we estimated the average distance between fibers was 35 μm at packing densities of 130 g l and 24 μm at packing density of 210 g l from eq 3 more 10 μm particles may be trapped by straining in filter beds with higher packing densities the probability of smaller spacing between fibers less than 10 μm particles can increase due to the heterogeneity of the fiber filter bed therefore the negative value of coefficient a in regression models 13 1 and 14 1 indicates that the particle concentration in the effluent decreased as the packing density increased however we believed that the spacing may be sufficiently wide for 5 μm particles to pass because the packing density did not affect the removal efficiency for 5 μm particles as previously mentioned on the other hand the interception mechanism mainly determined the removal efficiency as already mentioned according to eqs 7 and 8 because the transport efficiency η i is proportional to the square of the particle diameter dp larger particles can be removed with higher efficiency however the results in table 1 show the opposite tendency under a higher flow rate and a lower packing density this result may be related to the effect of the flow velocity in the filter bed media the regression analysis clearly revealed that at higher flow rate darcy velocity the concentration of 5 μm and 10 μm particles in the effluent increased imagine if 5 or 10 μm particles are adhering to a 19 μm diameter fiber it is not surprising that increasing the flow rate would be likely to increase particle detachment and reduce particle retention in the bed in particular 10 μm particles that are attached to fibers are subject to higher fluid forces than 5 μm particles and 10 μm particles can detach more frequently this may explain the result that the 10 μm particles had a lower removal rate than the 5 μm particles as shown in table 1 when the detachment rate increases at high flow rate and low packing density it is considered that the net deposition rate decreases a study by niu et al showed that high flow rates in fiber filter beds reduced turbidity removal as in our experiments 20 guerra et al also found that as the flow rate increased the turbidity in the effluent from their fiber filtration system increased 19 moreover niu et al clearly showed that particle turbidity removal increased at higher packing density in their fiber filter beds in those experiments the porosity of fiber filter bed was around 0 90 to 0 95 which was similar to our fiber filters we suppose that the hydrodynamic character and the particle transport in fiber filters with porosity greater than 0 9 and darcy velocities from 20 m h to 100 m h will differ from that is conventional rapid sand filters with porosity between 0 4 and 0 5 and darcy velocity between 5 15 m h 3 in addition the transport property is apparently isotropic in a filter bed of spherical granules but can be anisotropic in a fiber filter bed as it will be affected by the orientation of each fiber to the water flow direction we did not determine exactly the distribution of orientation of the fibers thus more detailed mechanistic studies will be required to adapt conventional sand filter theory to the fiber filter 3 2 temporal change in filtration efficiency and recovery after backwashing it is known that the filtration efficiency of the fiber filter usually decreases in a relatively short time after each backwash as the filtration progresses owing to the high flow rate and high loading of turbidity so the fiber filter should be backwashed at an appropriate time to restore filtration performance 16 17 19 23 in particular it is necessary to determine the filtration time considering the decrement of the removal ratio during the filtration period because the time ratio between filtration and backwashing is related to not only the average particle removal but also the water recovery rate our aim in developing this fiber filter system was to remove fine particles without the use of coagulants so we examined the temporal change in the removal efficiency of 5 μm pmma particles and the recovery of filtration performance after backwashing the backwash conditions described in section 2 4 2 were selected in consideration of the conditions frequently used in other studies at the same time we also monitored the temporal change in pressure loss during the filtration process because the increment of pressure loss is one of the criteria to start the backwashing in this experiment we used a fiber filter bed with a lower packing density value of 110 g l because the lower pressure loss due to the lower packing density has an advantage in practical applications furthermore based on the result that packing density did not significantly affect the removal of 5 μm particles obtained in section 3 1 the good removal performance of 5 μm particles was expected even with a fiber filter with a lower packing density in order to optimize the filtration and backwashing operations for commercialization of products it is necessary to carry out long term tests for more than six months however because it is difficult to perform such long term experiments using pmma particles a field test is suitable therefore in future research field experiments are planned to obtain the long term performance of the novel fiber filtration system 3 2 1 results in this experiment the apparent increase of pressure loss in the filter bed was never found in each filtration period as shown in fig 4 in the first filtration period 7 kpa was maintained under a constant flow rate condition with a flow rate of 5 l min darcy velocity of 38 2 m h if anything there were some cases that pressure loss was slightly increased after backwashing the reason for the increase is that the folded state of the fiber element can change by recompression by bcc after backwashing effective backwashing is commonly performed in sand filtration systems before pressure loss reaches a threshold level to recover the pressure 3 6 13 on the other hand in the fiber filtration system we found particle removal efficiency decreased significantly before pressure loss increased as shown in fig 4 particle removal efficiency was 100 for 30 min after the start of the first period of filtration then removal efficiency decreased to 90 at 71 min and 86 at 90 min after the first backwash this pattern was repeated the duration of the period of 100 particle removal efficiency in the 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th filtration cycles was 25 min 14 min 14 min and 14 min and the period of 90 removal was 62 min 40 min 35 min and 46 min in each filtration step as shown in fig 4 thus the particle removal efficiency decreased over the first three operational after which the performance stabilized this result suggests that residual particles progressively accumulated on the fibers until a steady state was reached 3 2 2 analysis and discussion according to the particle removal mechanism discussed in the previous section a particle is mainly trapped by the interception mechanism and it then adheres to the fiber surface thus the surface of the fiber is gradually occupied by adhering particles conventional sand filtration theory explains that there are two opposing effects of particle deposition on the filter media 3 the first effect is the trapped particles gradually increase the media grain size thus increasing the probability of particle trapping and increasing the removal efficiency of the filtration process this effect assumes that new particles can adhere to previously deposited particles the faster flow conditions that can apply in fiber filters may cause particles to detach from other particles only permitting particles to deposit as single layer in such case the adhesion probability gradually decreases as the available adhesion sites are gradually occupied by deposited particles therefore the particle removal efficiency decreases as the result in this experiment since only pmma particles of a known size were presented to the fiber filter we can calculate the percentage of sites on the fiber surface that were occupied by adhering particles the total mass of captured particles until the breakthrough point of 90 removal in each filtration period was 40 3 g 37 6 g 28 2 g 22 6 g and 25 0 g respectively by using the values of the captured particle mass the nominal particle diameter of 5 μm the nominal fiber diameter of 19 μm the total fiber length of 940 mm and the density 1 19 g cm3 of pmma the percentage of fiber surface occupied by pmma particles was 25 2 23 5 17 6 14 1 and 15 6 then during each 90 min filtration period we estimated the percentage of surface occupied as 29 6 32 3 29 0 27 9 and 29 5 respectively then we can estimate the temporal change in bed porosity due to the deposition of particles through the filtration period from these results the porosity was constant at 0 918 throughout the filtration period and this result is consistent with no pressure loss during the filtration period assuming that particle removal decreases linearly during each filtration period we can estimate the time to reach 0 removal for each period this time was then used to estimate the total mass of particles removable by the fiber filter namely the particle removal capacity of the fiber filter bed this value estimated for each period was 229 g 0 884 g g fiber 225 g 0 871 g g fiber 140 g 0 541 g g fiber 110 g 0 424 g g fiber and 175 g 0 676 g g fiber these values correspond to high occupation percentage of 143 141 87 69 and 109 respectively considering the calculation accuracy of this estimation method it is acceptable that the occupation percentage value valid greatly and there are cases where it exceeds 100 therefore it suggests that the effective use of surface of the fibers can be expected if the filtration is continued until 0 removal however this is not a realistic operation for a filter system normally it is necessary to maintain a specific removal efficiency for practical use of the filtrate in this filter system we expect 90 removal or larger the filtration period for 90 removal or better was 40 min and 45 min after three operational cycles as the backwashing and rinsing steps took a total of 9 min the backwashing time is 9 1 of the total operational cycle we need to reduce the time spent backwashing to improve filtration capacity however we thought that the current backwashing protocol was not sufficient to washout all particles on the fiber actually the occupation percentage was 25 2 at 90 removal efficiency in the first filtration period this decreased to 14 1 and 15 6 in the 4th and 5th filtration periods the difference may be due to residual particles on the fiber other researchers have tested the efficiency of backwashing of fiber filters 16 21 nakamura et al used a longer backwash time of 30 min with 50 m h of water flow and 250 m h air flow they reported that 54 of the particles in the fiber filter were washed out 16 the backwash protocol for our study used stronger water flow 76 m h and air flow 572 m h but for a shorter duration lee et al succeeded in washing out at least 99 of the retained particles by repeating a washing sequence 14 times with air flow of 7 s water flow of 15 s and rinse of 35 s 17 other researchers also found repeated washing sequences improved the recovery of particle removal performance and pressure loss 17 19 20 such repeats and combinations of short backwashing may be effective for our filtration system so we need to optimize the backwashing conditions in future studies 3 3 pressure loss and filtration velocity the pressure loss of the filter bed is a fundamental specification of the filtration system in the previous section we obtained a result on the pressure loss of 7 kpa for the 940 mm fiber length and 110 g l packing density with a darcy velocity of 38 2 m h flow rate 5 l min the design of a good filtration system requires the basic characteristics of pressure loss that has to be obtained under a practical range of conditions the hydrodynamic theory of porous media such as darcy s law or forchheimer extended darcy s law can be applied to the analysis of flow in a filter bed using sand grains or fibers 3 34 37 in this experiment we set the three different packing densities 80 110 and 140 g l a packing density of 80 g l is the minimum packing density for bcc devices to function in our filtration systems considering the results in sections 3 1 and 3 2 high packing densities greater than 150 g l are not required to remove 5 μm and 10 μm particles however in order to perform a better regression analysis the flow rate was changed significantly beyond the actual set range of a practical fiber filtration system 3 3 1 results pressure losses in a filter bed using 940 mm length fibers were measured at flow rates of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 l min darcy velocities of 7 6 15 3 22 9 30 6 38 2 45 8 53 5 61 1 68 8 and 76 4 m h three packing densities were tested 80 110 and 140 g l by changing the bcc position fig 5 shows the pressure loss measurements at the packing density of 140 g l the plot of the relation shows a downward convex tendency this result clearly differs from darcy s law which shows a linear relationship between pressure loss and flow rate on the other hand the minimum sensitivity of the pressure sensor was 1 kpa so pressure loss at lower flow rates with packing densities of 80 g l and 110 g l was recorded as 1 kpa therefore it is not clear whether there was a proportional relationship between darcy velocity and pressure loss for the packing density of 80 g l and 110 g l it is necessary to use the forchheimer extended darcy s law of eq 6 to analyze the relationship between the pressure loss and the flow rate darcy velocity 3 3 2 analysis and discussion before the regression analysis the pressure loss is estimated using ergun s equation for porous filter media 9 34 16 δ p k v 1 ε 2 ε 3 μ l u d 2 k i 1 ε ε 3 ρ w l u 2 d where ε is porosity μ is water viscosity 1 002 mpa sec at 20 u is darcy velocity ρ w is water density 998 kg m3 at 20 and l is the filter bed depth the first term of eq 16 means the energy loss process by fluid viscosity and the second term means the energy loss process of kinetic energy 34 the non dimensional coefficients kv and ki correspond to the two energy loss processes according to ergun s study kv 150 and ki 1 75 estimated from the sand depth filtration 3 34 we consider that kv 150 and ki 1 75 for eq 16 are applicable for the estimation of the pressure loss of the fiber filter to calculate eq 16 porosity ε of 0 896 0 918 and 0 940 by eq 2 and l of 0 411 0 298 and 0 235 m from packing densities were applied for the calculation of eq 16 the eq 16 includes the square of darcy velocity however the calculation results of pressure loss are drawn with the three lines that are almost straight as shown in fig 5 the calculated values at 70 m h for three packing densities are very close to the experiment values therefore we considered that ergun s formula was able to estimate pressure loss in the fiber filter system however the measured values of pressure loss are mostly less than each line thus we speculate that the square term in eq 6 or eq 16 is more significant namely the coefficient ki must be larger than the value 1 75 from sand filtration in order to evaluate the magnitude of kv and ki from experiment data the coefficients a and b in eq 6 were estimated using linear regression analysis the results are summarized in table 5 for the packing density of 80 g l the estimation of coefficient a was a negative value and the p value of 0 615 is greater than 0 05 the aic value is compared equation δp b u 2 and δp a u b u 2 to select a better model of smaller aic values the aic of the model δp b u 2 is slightly smaller considering the physical meaning of the terms as energy dispersion term the coefficients a and b kv and ki must be positive because negative dispersion means energy generation therefore the model δp b u 2 is selected then ki of 28 3 is estimated for the packing density of 110 g l the equation δp b u 2 is also selected and ki of 34 7 is estimated on the other hand δp a u b u 2 is selected as the better model at a packing density of 140 g l by aic in this case it includes linear part of u as a significant term then kv of 68 3 and ki of 24 7 are estimated we considered the parameters ki and kv in eq 16 to have already compensated for the porosity effect therefore we need to consider whether the major difference in the characteristics of this flow lies in the difference in the specific structural properties of the filter media as a porous material including the form of the material actually it is known that the parameters kv and ki for rapid filtration using anthracite granules are different from sand grains therefore ergun s model is a semi empirical model and kv and ki have to be determined by experiment if we assume a simple cylindrical geometry for the filter media structure as seen in the sem images of the filter fibers in fig 1 we can consider the pressure loss as a problem of fluid flowing between distributed cylinders s kuwabara achieved an analytical solution for small reynolds number 35 lloyd spielman and s l goren used flow between randomly orientated and randomly distributed cylinders as model of a fiber air filter 36 they obtained theoretical relations between the volume fraction 1 porosity of the fiber media and the pressure gradient in their models the inertia term in the fluid equation was not considered therefore their results provide a linear relation between pressure loss drop and fluid velocity as well as darcy s law robinson and franklin treated the inertia term to explain non darcy flow in fiber filtration 37 this idea was the same as what was reported in ergun s study 3 34 this kind of research continues for the fiber filtration of aerosols 38 39 moreover numerical studies have been performed on the pressure loss and filtration efficiency of aerosol fiber filters 40 41 for aqueous solution particle removal processes have been simulated for a single fiber 42 although there is not much recent work on the hydrodynamic properties of fiber filters for water treatment studies of air filters or aerosols can be informative for flows at similar reynolds numbers darcy s law can describe flow in porous media with reynolds numbers less than one 43 so flow in a fiber filter must follow darcy s law when reynolds number is less than one this statement is not only based on a vast number of empirical facts but as mentioned above is a general fact based on theoretical and simulation studies of porous media containing fiber filters on the other hand it is considered that the square term in the forchheimer eq 6 relates to the drag force by inertia term in the navier stokes equation 44 in our study we estimated a reynolds number of 0 38 0 70 at 20 for water velocity of 0 01 to 0 02 m s in the fiber filter and a characteristic distance of 24 35 μm between fibers from eq 3 this means that darcy s law should be observed as shown in fig 5 to explain our result that the square term in the forchheimer eq 6 or in ergun s eq 7 was significant needs a reynolds number larger than one 43 the only possible way to explain the experimental results for the square term is to adjust the characteristic length in the formula of reynolds number 43 for example if the characteristic length increases 10 times the reynolds number also increases 10 times there is an observation that cannot be overlooked when considering the flow characteristics of the fiber filter bed during filtration the fiber bundles were intricately folded under compression by the bcc in the compressed fiber bed a narrow gap slit like gap with a width of several mm and a length of several tens of mm was frequently observed from the surface of the acrylic cylinder if such gaps also form within the filter bed they could play a role as channels through the filter bed the reynolds number of water flows in such a gap is estimated to be 1 100 or less in this case the square term in forchheimer equation becomes significant 43 of course to evaluate the effect of such gaps we need to solve the problems of water flow in a mixture media with a regular porosity and narrow gaps in fact such problems are much studied for fractured porous media relating to groundwater flow 45 46 non darcy flow in fractures was analyzed in several studies 47 48 we think that we can further investigate the hydrodynamic properties of the fiber filter based on such research 3 4 comparison of fiber filtration and rapid sand filtration performance finally it is important to compare the performance of our fiber filtration system and conventional filtration systems in particular the advantage of the developed fiber filtration system is its ability to remove fine particles smaller than 10 μm in diameter without the addition of coagulants management engineers such as those at water purification plants have sought a new filtration system that can filter fine particles without coagulants this study revealed that our fiber filtration system with bcc devices can remove 5 μm particles without coagulants as already mentioned most previous experiments on fiber filters used coagulants because other fiber filters cannot remove such particles without the addition of coagulants however as an experimental study by lee et al directly compared the fiber filtration efficiency with and without the coagulant 17 we can compare the performance of our proposed fiber filter system with their results in addition most rapid sand filtration systems in water purification plants also use coagulants to remove fine particles but the application of a sand filtration system for industrial water production using fine sand particles enables the removal of fine particles without the use of coagulants therefore it is necessary to compare the developed fiber filtration system with an industrial water sand filtration system without the addition of a coagulant in fact our goal is to replace such a sand filtration system with this newly developed fiber filtration unfortunately to the best of our knowledge there is no available test data for such industrial water and sand filtration so we used the rt models to estimate its ability to remove fine particles 3 4 1 evaluation of the performances of conventional fiber filter and rapid sand filter for comparison with our fiber filters we first briefly summarize the fiber filters used by lee et al and their experimental results 17 lee s fiber filter had a packing density of 80 g l treated river water with an average tss concentration of 11 5 mg l and had a productivity of 24 2 m3 h 581 m3 d to compare the filtration performance of lee s fiber filter a sand filter and our novel fiber filter we assume a tss concentration of 11 5 mg l in raw water under the same conditions as lee s filters darcy velocities in the fiber filter bed during the filtration period were set to 60 80 and 100 m h here 80 m h is selected for the performance evaluation the exact dimensions of the fiber filter bed have not been reported so the inner diameter of the filter tower i e 650 mm as described in the paper was considered as the diameter of the filter bed in addition the true direction of water flow in the filter bed was not well identified therefore because the authors assumed that the flow in the filter bed was a simple upward flow it is believed that the darcy velocity of 80 m h was calculated by dividing the inflow velocity of 26 5 m3 h by a cross sectional area of 0 3317 m2 the cross sectional area of the fiber filter in addition 2 3 m3 h 26 5 24 2 m3 h can be considered as the amount of water consumed per hour during the washing period the height of the filter is 1500 mm which is considered to be the height of the filtration chamber not the filter bed according to fig 1 in the paper by lee et al 17 the time for the turbidity removal ratio to fall below 90 was 100 min after the start of the filtration period the total washing time including the backwashing and the rinse was 5 min and 43 s the water recovery ratio rrec is defined by the following equation 17 r r e c 100 v n v t where v t 24 q f t f t v n 24 q f t f t q w t w t t t f t w vt m3 d is the total volume of treated water per day vn m3 d is the net volume of treated water per day qf m3 h is the flow rate of filtration tf h is the duration of filtration qw m3 h is the flow rate of washing tw h is the duration of washing and t h is the duration of one cycle when a darcy velocity of 80 m h a filtration time of 100 min and a washing time of 5 min and 43 s were set as operating conditions a water recovery ratio of 96 5 was estimated using 3 here the water recovery is defined as the ratio between the net and total water quantity of the filtrated water and we assume that the filtrated water is used for the washing water 3 the pressure loss increased from 13 8 kpa to 18 2 kpa increase of 32 during the filtration time of 100 min with the darcy velocity of 80 m h the average pressure loss of 15 7 kpa was estimated for the 100 min filtration time the pressure loss is directly related to the power consumption of a water feed pump which is given as follows 18 p o w e r w q δ p e f where q m3 h is the flow rate and δp pa is the differential pressure which is the sum of the pressure loss of the filter bed the pressure loss due to the pipe flow and the water head difference the pressure loss in pipes and the water head difference will vary for each filtration system design but a common value should be used for comparisons among filtration systems this common value is assumed to be 50 kpa with reference to our fiber filter design criteria the parameter e f is the total energy efficiency including a pump transmission and motor 49 because e f 0 7 is applied to our fiber filter design we used the same value to evaluate lee s fiber filter system and rapid sand filtration system this calculation should take into account the total energy consumption of the filtration and washing processes however because lee s report has no information the backwash pressure loss of 40 kpa is expected to be the same as the novel fiber filter as mentioned later finally we estimate the electricity cost of us 0 434 for producing 100 m3 of filtered water as shown in table 6 the details of the cost estimation are shown in appendix d lee et al also found that 65 tss removal was obtained without a coagulant pac and about 90 was obtained with the addition of pac at a dose of 1 mg l in addition the particle removal ratios of 5 μm can be read from the plot of the particle size distribution of raw water and filtered water as shown in fig 3 of the paper by lee et al 17 the removal ratio of 5 μm particles was estimated to be 28 4 without pac with the addition of pac the removal rate increased to 78 4 however the addition of pac incurred a significant additional cost of us 1 97 per 100 m3 of water as shown in table 6 see appendix d as a result the total running cost per 100 m3 is estimated at us 2 404 as previously mentioned pac may not be used in the rapid sand filtration of industrial water to remove fine particulates for this purpose it was assumed that the grain size of sand had an effective size es of 0 6 mm the porosity was 0 48 the length of the sand bed was 1200 mm and the darcy velocity was 10 m h these numbers refer to the design of a traditional sand filtration system 3 then the rajagopalan and tien models were applied to estimate the removal efficiency of 5 μm particles for a rapid sand filter 3 in addition 7 1 kpa with 10 m h is calculated as the initial pressure loss using ergun s eq 16 with kv of 150 and ki of 1 75 the increment of the pressure loss in the sand filter bed can be estimated by considering the deposition of particles in the filter bed when we set the maximum pressure loss for the sand filter to 50 kpa to start the washing the filtration time of 844 min is determined using the calculation method explained in example 11 7 pages 921 922 in the reference book water treatment principles and design principles and design 3 then we set the backwashing flow rate of 72 8 m h to cause a 30 expansion of the filter bed and an adequate washing duration time of 30 min using a known method described in examples 11 3 5 pages 895 901 of in the reference book water treatment principles and design principles and design 3 using the duration of filtration the duration of washing and these flow rates the water recovery is calculated using eq 17 in addition eq 18 is applied to estimate the power consumption in the same way as for lee s fiber filtration system as shown in table 6 the electricity cost of producing 100 m3 of filtered water using a rapid sand filter is estimated to be us 0 597 see appendix d 3 4 2 performance comparison of the novel fiber filter conventional fiber filter and rapid sand filter as case 1 for our fiber filter we assumed a filtration tower with a fiber length of 940 mm a packing density of 110 g l a filter bed length of 0 299 m and a darcy velocity of 40 m h for the evaluation of our novel fiber filter because the results in section 3 2 showed good performance for the filtration of 5 μm particles under such conditions when 5 μm particles of raw water with a tss of 120 mg l were supplied to the fiber filter at 5 l min darcy velocity 38 2 m h the average time required for the removal efficiency to drop to 90 was 51 min after the start of filtration as shown in fig 4 the average particle removal ratio for 51 min was 96 and the total mass of particles deposited on the fiber filter bed during this period was 30 7 g an appropriate time to start the wash period is the time at which 30 7 g of particles will be deposited in the fiber filtration bed this time is estimated to be 531 min if the tss concentration in the raw water is 11 5 mg l and a 96 removal is expected at a darcy velocity of 40 m h after filtration the fiber washing period was continued for 9 min with a darcy velocity of 76 4 m h 10 l min by adopting a filtration tower with an inner diameter of 0 919 m filtered water of 626 m3 vt can be obtained each day and a net product water of 613 m3 per day vn which is calculated considering a filtration time of 531 min at a darcy velocity of 40 m h and a washing time of 9 min at a darcy velocity of 76 4 m h the water recovery was calculated as 97 9 100 vn vt using eq 17 using b 5 76 107 for a packing density of 110 g l in table 5 the equation δp bu 2 in table 5 estimates a pressure drop of 7 1 kpa as shown in fig 4 when filtering 5 μm pmma particles of 120 mg l tss the pressure loss of the fiber filter did not increase significantly during the filtration period however because lee s results show that the pressure loss increases by approximately 32 during the filtration time filtering the same river water is expected to increase the pressure loss to the same extent as our fiber filter therefore we estimate the increase in pressure loss for the worst case and assume that our fiber filter is twice the incremental ratio of the pressure loss increase in lee s experiment when the pressure loss of 7 1 kpa at the start increases to 11 6 kpa at the end of the filtration period the average pressure loss will be 9 4 kpa as previously mentioned an additional 50 kpa pressure loss was considered as pipe flow pressure loss and head loss to evaluate the power consumption taking into account the running cost of the washing process the cost of electricity per 100 m3 of product water is estimated at us 0 412 table 6 presents these results table 6 also shows the evaluation results of case 2 assuming a darcy velocity of 80 m h a packing density of 110 g l a fiber length of 940 mm a filter bed length of 0 299 m and a filtration tower with an inner diameter of 0 65 m the pressure loss can be estimated to be higher than in case 1 with an average of 37 5 kpa the high pressure loss is due to the square relation with the darcy velocity however the higher darcy velocity basically involves lower removal as shown in table 1 we assume the same removal ratio of 96 as in the case of 40 m h darcy velocity in case 1 because we believe that a further improvement of our novel fiber filter will achieve sufficient removal efficiency the electricity cost is estimated at us 0 548 which is higher than at 40 m h owing to high pressure loss however because the diameter of the filtration tower is slim it is possible to construct a filtration system with a small installation area so the filtration system in case 2 has the advantage in that it can be installed in a small factory space lee s fiber filter can be a slim filter tower but this traditional type of fiber filter requires coagulants such as pac to adequately remove 5 μm particles the operational cost is very high at us 2 404 per 100 m3 of filtered water with pac accounting for the majority of the cost if the conventional fiber filter lee s fiber filter using pac is installed in a factory with an annual water demand of 900 000 m3 3 000 m3 per day and operating 300 days a year the annual running cost of water production will be about us 22 000 however if our novel fiber filter is adopted in the factory the annual running cost will be about us 3 700 which is around one sixth that of the conventional fiber filter therefore owing to the high cost of this coagulant water purification facility managers prefer to avoid the use of the coagulant as much as possible as shown in table 6 a conventional rapid sand filter can achieve an estimated removal efficiency of 78 2 for 5 μm particles without coagulants in addition rapid sand filtration is a well proven filtration system that can be used with confidence in purification facilities therefore rapid sand filters are still in use today however because the porosity of the sand filter is approximately 0 5 which is lower than the porosity of the fiber filter bed the pressure loss increases as the flow rate increases and it is not possible to set a high filtration rate such as a fiber filter therefore sand filtration systems inevitably require filtration towers with larger sizes to obtain the same water treatment capacity this means that the sand filtration system requires a greater footprint than the fiber filter system however the backwashing of sand filters requires a high flow rate for the large footprint of the filtration tower as a result the sand filter has a lower water recovery rate because of the use of backwash water in addition backwashing requires a high pressure for the fluidization and expansion of the sand filter bed 3 therefore the pressure loss in the backwashing process must be higher than the backwashing of fiber filters in addition the washing time of the sand filter needs to be longer than that of the fiber filter 3 for these reasons the electricity consumption is larger than that of the fiber filter therefore the running cost us 0 597 of the sand filtration system is 1 45 times that of the novel fiber filtration systems case 1 as shown in table 6 the difference in the operational costs of the two filtration systems for an annual water demand of 900 000 m3 is about us 1 700 in particular when a rapid sand filter treats highly turbid raw water a pac dose of approximately 5 mg l or more is always required to obtain sufficiently clean water the cost of pac for the annual water demand of 900 000 m3 will be about us 43 000 in addition to its low operational costs its compact size is also an important advantage of the new fiber filtration system therefore we consider that there is sufficient motivation to replace a conventional sand filtration system with our novel fiber filter for this purpose in future research sufficient experimental data should be obtained to optimize the filtration and backwash process using real raw water for further improvement 4 conclusions we have developed a novel fiber filtration system that uses a unique bed compression cap bcc structure which compresses the pet polymer fiber elements and maintains the filter bed at a constant depth and packing density the aim was to develop a system for filtering low or high turbidity water without using coagulants as an alternative to rapid sand filtration we investigated the properties of fiber filters with respect to particle removal backwashing effect and pressure loss the fiber filter removed 92 100 of 5 μm pmma particles and 98 100 of 10 μm pmma particles using a 940 mm fiber element at a packing density of 130 210 g l and a flow rate of 3 8 l min darcy velocity of 22 9 61 1 m h these flow rates are several times faster than conventional rapid sand filtration when we applied yao s particle removal model to the fiber filter we speculated that the interception is the main mechanism to capture particles however the model could not explain the actual particle removal properties in particular the model did not show the observed reduction in 5 and 10 μm particle removal at higher darcy velocities or the increased removal of 10 μm particles at higher packing densities we investigated the temporal change in particle removal and recovery after backwashing the 5 μm particles were 90 removable for about 71 min in the first filtration period then gradually shortened to 35 and 46 min in the 4th and 5th periods however no significant increase in pressure loss was observed during each filtration period next the coverage of the fiber with the particles was evaluated as a single layer deposition at the breakthrough point defined as 90 removal 25 2 of the fiber surface was covered with particles which gradually decreased with repeated backwashing this effect was interpreted as inefficient backwash leading to the buildup of residual particles pressure loss at various darcy velocities was measured for fiber filters with packing densities of 80 110 and 140 g l using a fiber length of 940 mm using the porosity calculated from ergun s model and particle size of the fiber filter the pressure loss characteristics showed almost darcy s law of linear relation to the flow rate and the predicted value was relatively close to the experimental value however we found that the square term of darcy velocity in the forchheimer equation was significant from the regression analysis of the measured data this was evidence that the predominant pressure loss with drag force at reynolds numbers greater than 1 was more pronounced in the fiber filter bed than in the sand filter bed we speculated that narrow gaps of millimeter scale observed at the fiber filter surface bed could also occur within the bed and create areas with larger reynolds number assuming that river water tss 11 5 mg l is treated at approximately 600 m3 day the novel fiber filtration system fiber length 940 mm and packing density 110 g l was compared with a conventional fiber filtration system and a rapid sand filtration system the novel fiber filter was estimated to remove 96 of 5 μm particles without using pac at approximately one sixth of the operational cost of a conventional fiber filter using pac owing to the low pressure loss and high water recovery of the novel fiber filter the operational cost without pac was estimated to be less than approximately 30 of that of the sand filter in addition because the low pressure loss of the novel fiber filter allows a high filtration flow rate the smaller footprint is an advantage of the novel fiber filtration system acknowledgements pmma particles were kindly supplied from soken chemical engineering co ltd japan

13487,the fluoride removal capability of a new industrial based chemical coagulant formula a in one and two stage coagulation treatments was investigated in present study three main controlling factors the coagulant concentration reaction time and the initial ph of formula a were studied on the fluoride removal accordingly with the aid of other coagulants ecogent f loc potassium ferrate k2feo4 and sodium aluminate naalo2 response surface methodology rsm was adopted to analyse the controlling factors on the fluoride removal efficiency r using box behnken designs bbd the coagulant concentration of formula a shows the most significant effect on r and better fluoride removal capability at an initial ph 12 nevertheless the r has been shown to be independent of reaction time response optimisation revealed the highest r 70 12 can be achieved at 1000 ppm 10 min of reaction time and initial ph of 2 furthermore k2feo4 has a better r in low ph regions of 2 to 4 additionally k2feo4 achieved the highest r 84 at 1190 ppm and ph 9 with 8 5 min of reaction time in a single coagulation stage the use of formula a or k2feo4 are not able to meet environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 with discharge standard b as specified by department of environment malaysia while a two stage coagulation process can meet standard a specifically the combined formulation of using ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 formula a 2 were able to achieve treated water with less than 2 ppm fluoride moreover recycling treated water also plays a major role in helping industries meet the strict treatment standards keywords fluoride two stage processes optimization chemical coagulant response surface methodology box behnken design 1 introduction about 30 of the industrial waste from semiconductor plants is fluorine containing waste 1 kim et al 2 studied the flow analysis of hydrofluoric acid which showed that in 2014 220 tons of hydrofluoric acid were exported to malaysia 59 of the exported hydrofluoric acid were for the purpose of semiconductor manufacturing the main applications of fluorine compounds in semiconductor manufacturing are to etch or remove silicon and clean reaction chambers other industrial activities such as the production of aluminium steel and oil phosphate fertilizer productions and the burning of fluoride rich coal to the environment involve fluorine containing waste in 2009 department of environment doe malaysia enforced a new regulation environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 by providing standards to control the concentrations of chemicals discharged from industries there are two standards for maximum fluoride discharge concentration which are 2 0 ppm for standard a and 5 0 ppm for standard b the industries in malaysia must at least meet the requirement of standard b before discharging effluent to the environment in the current state of industries there are many types of fluoride removal technologies being used such as coagulation flocculation cf electrocoagulation adsorption reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane a comparison table between different types of fluoride removal technologies is shown in table 1 there are very scarce research findings on using electrocoagulation adsorption reverse osmosis or nanofiltration for the application of treating high fluoride content wastewater from the industries these methods are more suitable in treating low fluoride content wastewater for drinking water further to that it is not economical to use expensive methods resulting many industries would prefer to use cf method which is more economical and easier to operate however cf methods also pose a slight disadvantage of sludge production as a secondary pollution therefore recent research aims to explore green chemicals that produce less sludge which can reduce the cost of sludge treatment high or low fluoride content may be present in wastewater in general wastewater with low fluoride content is usually found in the household area while high fluoride content is usually found in the effluent discharge from the industries especially in the semiconductor industries wastewater discharges from the industries usually have very high content of fluoride ranging from 250 to 11 000 ppm 16 by far coagulation is the most conventional method used in the industries to reduce high fluoride content due to cost effectiveness as compared to other technologies thus a coagulation method is selected in this research to help industries which use one or two stages coagulation methods with the aid of new industry based chemicals to meet the malaysia doe standards in fact the modern use of coagulants for water treatment started approximately 100 years ago 17 in the coagulation process chemical coagulants with positive charge are added to neutralize the negative charges fluoride ions in wastewater to form precipitate the precipitate will enter a second stage where flocculants are added which causes the precipitate to agglomerate settle down and collect as sludge despite the fluoride standard enforced by doe the existing conventional wastewater treatment coagulation method practice by the industries in malaysia was not able to meet the doe standards many studies have been previously investigated on chemical coagulants used in the industry such as calcium salts aluminium salts and ferrous salts chemical coagulants such as aluminium sulphate 6 18 calcium chloride 19 calcium hydroxide 19 ferric sulphate 18 ferric chloride 20 and magnesium chloride 21 were studied in the reduction of fluoride concentration see table 2 as elucidated in table 2 most of the chemical coagulants used in a single stage of coagulation process cannot meet at least 5 ppm of standard b aoudj et al 2012 studied the effect of initial fluoride concentration on aluminium sulphate coagulant and shown that at initial fluoride concentration of 60 ppm the final fluoride concentration is about 5 5 ppm which still exceeded standard b 18 additionally high fluoride concentration is usually found in wastewater produced by the industry such as semiconductor and the fluoride can only be reduced to a range between 25 and 60 ppm 23 after a single stage coagulation process in fact aluminium calcium and ferric based coagulants have been studied for many years but there are no new metal coagulants that have been explored and studied for the removal of fluoride which lead to slow advancement in recent years potassium ferrate k2feo4 has been investigated due to its unique properties and green chemical it can be used as a coagulant disinfectant and oxidant 24 rahman et al 25 showed that k2feo4 can achieve a removal rate of ammonia turbidity and total coliform by 92 2 82 1 99 99 respectively which showed higher efficiency than using both alum coagulant and chlorine furthermore k2feo4 is able to reduce 40 of the amount of sludge produced by alum chlorine these potentials have proved that k2feo4 can be selected for both coagulation and disinfection processes in a wastewater treatment plant furthermore it become as our intention to further investigate the fluoride removal capability of k2feo4 aside from k2feo4 a new industrial based coagulant formula a was also investigated as formula a ions has higher charge of 4 as compare to calcium and aluminium which have charge of 2 and 3 respectively it is expected that this new industrial based coagulant will show a better fluoride removal capability in addition formula a is rather well known in the enhancement of photocatalytic water treatment studies more importantly formula a is non toxic and rather safe to human compare to conventional coagulants such as aluminium salts which is harmful to human health in this study formula a was studied on the fluoride removal accordingly with the aid of other coagulants ecogent f loc k2feo4 and naalo2 response surface methodology was adopted to analyse the three main controlling factors on fluoride removal efficiency r and final ph using box behnken designs bbd different chemical formulations are study in two stages coagulation process ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 naalo2 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 k2feo4 2 in addition recycling treated water in two stages coagulation process is studied as well to observe if there is any improvement increase in r this study would greatly help the industries to explore new chemicals with better r environmentally friendly and consider upgrading their coagulation treatment process into two stage coagulation process and might add recycling stream in the future revamp previous studies have reported on various coagulant recovery methods from sludge such as acidification alkalization and ion exchange membranes 26 28 however it is costly to recover coagulant from sludge studies have reported that water works sludge contains 39 aluminium by weight after coagulation 29 instead of recovering the coagulant from the sludge stage this paper studied the recycling of treated water which may still contain excess coagulant ions species therefore this study hypothesise that excess coagulant ions species remain in treated water after the coagulation stage thus recycling the treated water into bk1 or bk2 might help improve the overall r of the two stage coagulation stage 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials formula a ecogent f loc 10 30 aluminium hydroxide 1 10 polyelectrolyte 55 hydrofluoric acid solution poly aluminium chloride pac and sodium aluminate consist of 92 alnao2

spadns2 reagent for fluoride arsenic free arachem m sdn bhd malaysia were purchased from respective suppliers 2 2 coagulants flocculants preparation four chemical based coagulants formula a k2feo4 naalo2 and ecogent f loc are selected in present studies three formula a solution concentrations 1000 ppm 3500 ppm 6000 ppm were prepared by dissolving various dosages of formula a with 50 sulphuric acid solution as shown in fig 1 different concentrations of k2feo4 solution ranging from 600 ppm to1400 ppm were prepared by dissolving various dosages of k2feo4 with distilled water respectively naalo2 solution was prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of naalo2 in 50 ml of 10 sodium hydroxide solution before adding 200 ml of distilled water ecogent f loc was used for coagulations without further dilution flocculants were added after the coagulation process for every experiment conducted poly aluminium chloride was selected as the flocculant poly aluminium chloride 15 pac solution was prepared based on the method demonstrated by winston et al 30 by dissolving poly aluminium chloride in distilled water 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 jar test the experiment was carried out using jar test et 740 interscience sdn bhd malaysia based on the method of winston et al 30 to ensure uniform mixing when coagulants or flocculants were added into beakers of synthetic fluoride aqueous solution 100 ppm synthetic fluoride aqueous solution was prepared by diluting 55 hydrofluoric acid with distilled water beakers with a capacity of 500 ml were used to contain synthetic fluoride aqueous solution 2 3 2 single stage coagulation process in this study a 400 ml of synthetic fluoride aqueous solution was prepared in a 500 ml beaker the experiments were conducted according to the experiment designed by rsm shown in tables 5 and 6 each run of experiments will utilise one beaker there were a total of 30 experiments the initial ph ph 2 7 12 of beakers containing synthetic fluoride aqueous solution were adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid while measuring the ph of the solution with a ph meter next 10 ml of prepared chemical coagulants was added into the beaker the beakers were placed on jar test et 470 stirred at a speed of 120 rpm with their respective reaction time 2 min 6 min 10 min after that 3 0 ml of prepared pac solutions was added and stirred at a speed of 20 rpm for 5 min finally the beakers were placed on a flat surface to allow precipitate to settle for 30 min samples were collected from the beaker and analysed by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach malaysia to measure the final fluoride concentration 2 5 ml of samples was collected from beaker and diluted 100 times with distilled water because the limitation of uv vis spectrophotometer can only analyse fluoride concentration up to 2 ppm the samples were inserted into the uv vis spectrophotometer for analysis these steps were repeated for each run of experiments 2 3 3 two stage coagulation process the experimental setup of the two stage coagulation process shown in fig 2 was based on vendittia et al 16 based on table 3 a volume of 10 ml coagulant 1 was initially poured into the first beaker with 400 ml synthetic fluoride aqueous solution and continuously stirred at 120 rpm for 2 min next 300 ml of the samples was extracted and poured into the second beaker before the addition of coagulant 2 then the solution was also stirred at 120 rpm for 2 min 100 ml of treated water before the flocculating stage is recycled into beaker 1 or beaker 2 each after flocculating agent has been added samples were collected to analyse by uv vis spectrophotometer to measure the final fluoride concentration this is to mimic the process of recycling treated water in a water treatment process the experiment was repeated with different chemical formulations shown in table 3 2 4 experimental design and response analysis response surface methodology rsm was adopted to design the experiments analyse the response collected and obtain the optimum fluoride concentrations with box behnken design bbd bbd was used over central composite design ccd because ferreira et al 31 revealed that bbd is slightly more efficient than ccd this is because all factors analysed by bbd are simultaneously at their highest or lowest levels unlike ccd which perform experiments under extreme conditions which may affect its efficiency 32 moreover bbd conducts fewer experiments as compared to ccd thus this can reduce the amount of wastewater produced in this research while obtaining optimised results a minimum of three factors is required and the range of each factor has to be decided range can be divided into three levels 1 0 1 as shown in table 4 the experiments designed by bbd have a total of 15 experiments each as shown in tables 5 and 6 therefore a total of 30 experiments were conducted to study the effects of concentration initial ph and reaction time on r and final ph both formula a and k2feo4 the experimental data for the responses can be fitted into a second order polynomial model represented by eq 1 1 y β o i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 j i 2 k β ij x i x j where y is the response xi and xj are the independent variables i and j range from 1 to k βo is constant βi βii and βij are the regression coefficients of linear quadratic and interactive terms respectively k is the number of factors 33 there are three controlling factors in this study which are coagulants concentration initial ph and reaction time the bbd approach serves the purpose of reducing the number of experiments conducted to minimise wastewater produced to the environment while maintaining an efficient and economic approach 33 fluoride removal efficiency r of each test conducted was calculated based on the formula below 2 fluoride removal efficiency r c i c f c i 100 where ci initial fluoride concentration cf final fluoride concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 formula a single stage coagulation analysis 3 1 1 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on r coagulant formula a concentration has the most significant effect p 0 05 on r as the concentration of formula a increases the r decreases as shown in fig 3 this could be due to excess dosage of coagulants resulting in charge reversal and restabilisaiton of colloids 34 35 as the formula a concentration increases the negative charge of colloidal particles decreases the positive charge becomes more dominant which leads to electrostatic repulsion between positively charged particles as shown in fig 4 we can conclude that the investigated concentration range of 1000 to 6000 ppm has passed the isoelectric point of formula a which leads to this trend isoelectric point is the point where the concentration of positive charge is equal to the concentration of negative charge achieving optimum charge neutralisation 35 thus it can be expected that a higher r can be achieved with a lower coagulant concentration further research is required to investigate the zeta potential of formula a to find out the optimum concentration isoelectric point of formula a that can be added in sfw to achieve its highest r reaction time is the time for rapid mixing when coagulant is added into sfw this study investigates the reaction time from 2 to 10 min when 10 ml of formula a coagulant is added into sfw domínguez et al 36 studied the mixing time from 5 to 30 min of aluminium sulphate coagulant results shown increasing mixing time lead to reduction in cod removal efficiency thus this research investigated a lower range of reaction time from 2 to 10 min conversely reaction time has no significant effect p 0 05 on r as the reaction time increases from 2 to 10 min the r is between 59 to 60 as shown in fig 3 however studies on alum and pacl have reported that the reaction time has a significant impact on charge neutralisation and sweep coagulation 37 38 kan et al 32 recorded the reduction of residual turbidity ntu against mixing time from 0 to 400 s when 1 5 ppm of alum was added into synthetic stock suspension of clay the residual turbidity shows a drastic decrease from 0 to 50 s residual turbidity remains constant at 5 ntu from 50 to 300 s this can explain the insignificant effect p 0 05 of reaction time on r formula a coagulant could have destabilised colloidal particles in less than 2 min of rapid mixing therefore reaction time shows no significant effect on r 3 ao 2 2h ao 2 h 2 o finally initial ph has no significant effect p 0 05 on r as the initial ph increases from 2 to 12 the r is between 60 and 62 as shown in fig 3 this could be due to the addition of 10 ml of formula a coagulant which has reduced the ph of prepared sfw for example although sfw might have been adjusted to initial ph 12 but after adding formula a coagulant the ph measured of sfw after adding formula a coagulant was found to be less than ph 2 eq 3 shows the dissociation of formula a when it dissolves in sulphuric acid sulphuric acid will dissociate to produce h hso4 and so4 2 ions as shown in eqs 4 and 5 two h ions are dissociated per molecule of h2so4 therefore h2so4 is a strong diprotic acid based on eq 3 although one molecule of formula a requires 2h ions formula a was prepared with excess 50 sulphuric acid solution therefore there may be excess h ions presence that causes the ph of sfw with initial ph of 7 to 12 to decrease after dosing formula a into sfw consequently all experiments conducted with formula a coagulants have ph less than 2 despite adjusting the initial ph of sfw to ph 7 or ph 12 resulting initial ph to have no significant effect p 0 05 on r 4 h 2 so 4 h hso 4 5 hso 4 h so 4 2 3 1 2 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on final ph final ph is the ph measured after coagulation and flocculation stage this response is important to determine if the coagulant used requires ph adjustment after coagulation and flocculation stage in a wastewater treatment process however the main effects coagulant concentration reaction time and initial ph have no significant effect p 0 05 on final ph the final ph response is between 1 15 and 1 40 shown in fig 5 this finding further supports the significant effect of initial ph on r as discussed in the previous section due to the excess use of 50 h2so4 in the preparation formula a coagulants the treated sfw of all experiments conducted resulted in a final ph less than ph 2 therefore based on the formula a preparation method used in this research for coagulation treatment there is a requirement of ph adjustment at the end of the wastewater treatment process due to the acidity ph 2 of treated sfw according to doe malaysia environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 the ph of industrial effluent must meet standard a or standard b of ph 6 0 9 0 and ph 5 5 9 0 respectively thus it is expected the final ph of the acidity of treated sfw must be adjusted to between ph 5 5 9 0 3 2 potassium ferrate single stage analysis 3 2 1 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on r coagulant concentration shows a significant effect p 0 05 on r shown in fig 6 the r of k2feo4 increases with increasing coagulant concentration 600 to 1400 ppm shown in fig 6 further to that reaction time shows no significant effect p 0 05 on r as reported by jiang and lloyd 34 k2feo4 can destabilise the colloidal particles within 1 min while conventional coagulants such as ferric and ferrous salts can only achieve the destabilisation after 30 min mixing therefore it supports the finding that reaction time shows no significant effect on r in this research initial ph shows the most significant effect p 0 05 on r the trend shows that r decreases with increase of initial ph shown in fig 6 further to that k2feo4 achieves more than 80 of r in the range of initial ph 2 to 6 as shown in the contour plot fig 7 studies have also reported that k2feo4 coagulation activity works well under acidic conditions 40 41 this is because k2feo4 is a powerful oxidising agent under acidic conditions the redox potential e 2 20 v of ferrate iv ions feo4 2 is higher than that of molecular ozone and it is potentially the strongest of all the oxidants realistically applicable to water and wastewater treatment 39 42 eqs 5 and 6 show the reduction potential reaction of k2feo4 in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively 43 45 6 feo 4 2 8h 3e fe 3 4h 2 o e 2 20 v 7 feo 4 2 4h 2 o 3e fe oh 3 5oh e 0 72 v the overall decomposition of k2feo4 in aqueous solution generating hydroxide ions and molecular oxygen can be represented by eq 7 43 45 8 feo 4 2 5h 2 o fe 3 3 2 o 2 10 oh when k2feo4 was added into sfw initial ph 2 under acidic conditions feo4 2 ions is dissociated in the sfw while some feo4 2 ions undergoes reduction producing fe3 ions which also contributes to the coagulation activity in reducing the fluoride concentration however the r of k2feo4 under alkaline condition with initial ph 12 was 0 the fluoride concentration of sfw was not reduced this is because the decomposition rate of k2feo4 is strongly dependent on ph ferrate iv is most stable in strong bases with two regions of maximum stability one at ph 10 11 and the other in solutions greater than 3 m in base 45 therefore due to the stability of k2feo4 in alkaline condition less ferrate iv ions is dissociated and eq 6 is favour in alkaline condition producing fe oh 3 instead of feo4 2 or fe3 ions resulting in poor coagulation activity 3 2 2 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on final ph concentration and reaction time have no significant effect p 0 05 on final ph only initial ph shows the most significant effect p 0 05 on final ph the final ph increases with increasing initial ph 2 to 12 shown in fig 8 further to that if we analyse the responses shown in table 6 the experiments conducted with initial ph 2 have a higher final ph this can be explained by eq 7 the overall decomposition of k2feo4 produces oh ions which may have neutralize h ions resulting in a higher final ph of about 4 this finding is important for treating wastewater which are acidic k2feo4 can be used to treat acidic wastewater and act as a preliminary ph adjustment jiang et al 41 studied pilot scale field tests with low ferrate vi doses for drinking water treatment achieved average particle removal percentage of 93 raw water and 97 for ozonised water in terms of particle counting data no ph neutralisation was required after dosing ferrate vi further to that responses of the k2feo4 experiment were optimised by rsm fig 10 showing that at initial ph 9 the final ph of treated sfw might achieve ph 7 further research and experiments is needed to compare with the optimised solution provided by rsm 3 3 response optimisation of formula a k2feo4 the responses collected in tables 5 and 6 were optimised by rsm to obtain the highest r of both formula a and k2feo4 achieved in this study the optimised condition of formula a shown in fig 9 achieved the highest r of 70 the optimised solution proposed by rsm is 1000 ppm formula a concentration 10 mins of reaction time and an initial ph of 2 final ph was not optimised because there were no significant effects p 0 05 on final ph all experiments conducted with formula a coagulants resulted in final ph less than 2 shown in table 5 further to that the optimised condition of k2feo4 shown in fig 10 achieved the highest r of 84 and final ph 7 the optimised solution proposed by rsm was 1190 ppm k2feo4 concentration 8 5 min of reaction time and an initial ph of 9 in summary the highest r achieved by formula a and k2feo4 is 70 and 84 respectively the final fluoride concentration of both formula a and k2feo4 were 30 ppm and 16 ppm respectively therefore single stage coagulation by using these chemical coagulants cannot meet standard b despite the fact that formula a and k2feo4 cannot reduce the fluoride concentration in a single coagulation stage to meet standard b the coagulant concentration is greatly reduced as compared to conventional chemical coagulants such as sodium aluminate and calcite chee et al 47 studied the fluoride removal by adding sodium aluminate it is reported that the r achieved by sodium aluminate was 45 with coagulant concentration of 6000 ppm moreover wang et al 21 studied the removal of fluoride by calcite results showed that 12 000 ppm of calcite achieved a 97 r with initial fluoride concentration of 310 ppm further to that the r of formula a 70 and k2feo4 84 is higher compared to sodium aluminate while calcite shows the highest r of 97 however calcite needs a relatively high coagulant concentration 12 000 ppm to achieve 97 of r balik and aydin 48 revealed that sludge quantity increases with coagulant concentration both formula a and k2feo4 coagulants can achieve relatively high r 70 84 at low coagulant concentration 1000 1190 ppm as compared to sodium aluminate and calcite which uses 6000 ppm and 12 000 ppm respectively this will reduce chemical demand and sludge production resulting in low operating cost and generate substantial cost saving in treating sewage 46 3 4 multistage removal of fluoride single stage coagulation cannot meet standard b therefore a two stage coagulation was studied and investigated here three chemical formulations have been formulated as cf1 cf2 and cf3 are shown in table 7 both cf1 and cf2 can meet standard a but cf3 cannot meet at least standard b cf1 the combination of ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 in table 7 shows that recycling treated water does improve the fluoride removal efficiency the final fluoride concentration of test 1 without recycling treated water was 1 99 ppm when treated water is recycled into bk1 or bk2 the final fluoride concentration of test 2 and test 3 is 1 48 ppm and 1 83 ppm respectively the final fluoride concentration was lower compared to test 1 without recycling treated water this could be due to excess coagulant ions species remaining in the treated water when treated water was recycled back into bk1 or bk2 the excess coagulant ions species might have contributed to the coagulation activities resulting in overall improvement of r test 2 test 3 as compared to without recycling of treated water test 1 the combination of naalo2 1 formula a 2 does not show improvement in fluoride final fluoride concentration when treated water is recycled into bk1 or bk2 the final fluoride concentration of test 5 and test 6 with recycled treated water was 1 85 ppm and 1 93 ppm respectively both test 5 and test 6 had a slightly higher final fluoride concentration compared to test 4 without recycled treated water which was 1 81 ppm this could have been caused by re stabilisation of colloid particles when treated water is recycled back into bk1 or bk2 coagulant ions species which are positive charge particles dominate resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the particles despite the conflict of recycling treated water having improves the r between cf1 and cf2 it is certain both formulations were able to achieve standard a 49 studied the isoelectric point of aluminium sulphate and pacl was 014 mm and 0 03 mm respectively in one stage coagulation stage du et al 46 dose 0 10 mm of aluminium sulphate in the first coagulation stage and 0 10 mm of pacl in the second coagulation stage the residual turbidity shown to increase from 1 0 to 4 0 ntu this is because the dose of pacl in the second coagulation stage has exceeded the isoelectric point of 0 03 mm resulting in re stabilisation of particles in this study the isoelectric point of formula a and k2feo4 is not studied therefore further research is required to study the coagulation mechanism and zeta potential of each coagulant to further optimise the dose of coagulants in two stage coagulation the combination of naalo2 1 k2feo4 2 cf3 cannot meet standard b this can be explained by the preparation of naalo2 naalo2 solution was prepared by dissolving naalo2 in 10 sodium hydroxide solution before adding distilled water as discussed in the previous section k2feo4 coagulation activity does not function well in alkaline conditions 40 41 because ferrate iv ions are most stable in ph range 10 to 11 45 due to the stability of k2feo4 in alkaline condition less ferrate iv ions is dissociated and eq 6 is favour in alkaline condition producing fe oh 3 instead of feo4 2 or fe3 ions resulting in poor coagulation activity the presence of sodium hydroxide hindered the coagulation activity of k2feo4 thus experiments conducted with cf3 resulted in low r of 41 49 the reduction of fluoride concentration was probably due to sodium aluminate only as reported by chee et al 47 the r of sodium aluminate was 45 it supports the results of test 7 to 9 4 conclusion the controlling factors are coagulant concentration reaction time and initial ph of formula a and k2feo4 used in determining fluoride removal efficiency formula a and k2feo4 are able to reduce fluoride concentration with efficiency of 70 and 84 respectively formula a requires further research at lower coagulant concentration as it has potential in achieving higher fluoride removal efficiency k2feo4 shows better coagulation activity under acidic conditions and can act as a preliminary ph adjustment although both chemical coagulants did not meet standard b a two stage coagulation process can act as an alternative solution to current industries compared to a single stage coagulation process the combination of ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 formula a 2 has successfully met standard a with an r of 98 this research has shown the potential of exploring new industrial chemicals with higher fluoride removal capability in low coagulant concentration and coagulation process strategy in meeting the environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 with discharge standard a declaration of competing interest

13487,the fluoride removal capability of a new industrial based chemical coagulant formula a in one and two stage coagulation treatments was investigated in present study three main controlling factors the coagulant concentration reaction time and the initial ph of formula a were studied on the fluoride removal accordingly with the aid of other coagulants ecogent f loc potassium ferrate k2feo4 and sodium aluminate naalo2 response surface methodology rsm was adopted to analyse the controlling factors on the fluoride removal efficiency r using box behnken designs bbd the coagulant concentration of formula a shows the most significant effect on r and better fluoride removal capability at an initial ph 12 nevertheless the r has been shown to be independent of reaction time response optimisation revealed the highest r 70 12 can be achieved at 1000 ppm 10 min of reaction time and initial ph of 2 furthermore k2feo4 has a better r in low ph regions of 2 to 4 additionally k2feo4 achieved the highest r 84 at 1190 ppm and ph 9 with 8 5 min of reaction time in a single coagulation stage the use of formula a or k2feo4 are not able to meet environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 with discharge standard b as specified by department of environment malaysia while a two stage coagulation process can meet standard a specifically the combined formulation of using ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 formula a 2 were able to achieve treated water with less than 2 ppm fluoride moreover recycling treated water also plays a major role in helping industries meet the strict treatment standards keywords fluoride two stage processes optimization chemical coagulant response surface methodology box behnken design 1 introduction about 30 of the industrial waste from semiconductor plants is fluorine containing waste 1 kim et al 2 studied the flow analysis of hydrofluoric acid which showed that in 2014 220 tons of hydrofluoric acid were exported to malaysia 59 of the exported hydrofluoric acid were for the purpose of semiconductor manufacturing the main applications of fluorine compounds in semiconductor manufacturing are to etch or remove silicon and clean reaction chambers other industrial activities such as the production of aluminium steel and oil phosphate fertilizer productions and the burning of fluoride rich coal to the environment involve fluorine containing waste in 2009 department of environment doe malaysia enforced a new regulation environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 by providing standards to control the concentrations of chemicals discharged from industries there are two standards for maximum fluoride discharge concentration which are 2 0 ppm for standard a and 5 0 ppm for standard b the industries in malaysia must at least meet the requirement of standard b before discharging effluent to the environment in the current state of industries there are many types of fluoride removal technologies being used such as coagulation flocculation cf electrocoagulation adsorption reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane a comparison table between different types of fluoride removal technologies is shown in table 1 there are very scarce research findings on using electrocoagulation adsorption reverse osmosis or nanofiltration for the application of treating high fluoride content wastewater from the industries these methods are more suitable in treating low fluoride content wastewater for drinking water further to that it is not economical to use expensive methods resulting many industries would prefer to use cf method which is more economical and easier to operate however cf methods also pose a slight disadvantage of sludge production as a secondary pollution therefore recent research aims to explore green chemicals that produce less sludge which can reduce the cost of sludge treatment high or low fluoride content may be present in wastewater in general wastewater with low fluoride content is usually found in the household area while high fluoride content is usually found in the effluent discharge from the industries especially in the semiconductor industries wastewater discharges from the industries usually have very high content of fluoride ranging from 250 to 11 000 ppm 16 by far coagulation is the most conventional method used in the industries to reduce high fluoride content due to cost effectiveness as compared to other technologies thus a coagulation method is selected in this research to help industries which use one or two stages coagulation methods with the aid of new industry based chemicals to meet the malaysia doe standards in fact the modern use of coagulants for water treatment started approximately 100 years ago 17 in the coagulation process chemical coagulants with positive charge are added to neutralize the negative charges fluoride ions in wastewater to form precipitate the precipitate will enter a second stage where flocculants are added which causes the precipitate to agglomerate settle down and collect as sludge despite the fluoride standard enforced by doe the existing conventional wastewater treatment coagulation method practice by the industries in malaysia was not able to meet the doe standards many studies have been previously investigated on chemical coagulants used in the industry such as calcium salts aluminium salts and ferrous salts chemical coagulants such as aluminium sulphate 6 18 calcium chloride 19 calcium hydroxide 19 ferric sulphate 18 ferric chloride 20 and magnesium chloride 21 were studied in the reduction of fluoride concentration see table 2 as elucidated in table 2 most of the chemical coagulants used in a single stage of coagulation process cannot meet at least 5 ppm of standard b aoudj et al 2012 studied the effect of initial fluoride concentration on aluminium sulphate coagulant and shown that at initial fluoride concentration of 60 ppm the final fluoride concentration is about 5 5 ppm which still exceeded standard b 18 additionally high fluoride concentration is usually found in wastewater produced by the industry such as semiconductor and the fluoride can only be reduced to a range between 25 and 60 ppm 23 after a single stage coagulation process in fact aluminium calcium and ferric based coagulants have been studied for many years but there are no new metal coagulants that have been explored and studied for the removal of fluoride which lead to slow advancement in recent years potassium ferrate k2feo4 has been investigated due to its unique properties and green chemical it can be used as a coagulant disinfectant and oxidant 24 rahman et al 25 showed that k2feo4 can achieve a removal rate of ammonia turbidity and total coliform by 92 2 82 1 99 99 respectively which showed higher efficiency than using both alum coagulant and chlorine furthermore k2feo4 is able to reduce 40 of the amount of sludge produced by alum chlorine these potentials have proved that k2feo4 can be selected for both coagulation and disinfection processes in a wastewater treatment plant furthermore it become as our intention to further investigate the fluoride removal capability of k2feo4 aside from k2feo4 a new industrial based coagulant formula a was also investigated as formula a ions has higher charge of 4 as compare to calcium and aluminium which have charge of 2 and 3 respectively it is expected that this new industrial based coagulant will show a better fluoride removal capability in addition formula a is rather well known in the enhancement of photocatalytic water treatment studies more importantly formula a is non toxic and rather safe to human compare to conventional coagulants such as aluminium salts which is harmful to human health in this study formula a was studied on the fluoride removal accordingly with the aid of other coagulants ecogent f loc k2feo4 and naalo2 response surface methodology was adopted to analyse the three main controlling factors on fluoride removal efficiency r and final ph using box behnken designs bbd different chemical formulations are study in two stages coagulation process ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 naalo2 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 k2feo4 2 in addition recycling treated water in two stages coagulation process is studied as well to observe if there is any improvement increase in r this study would greatly help the industries to explore new chemicals with better r environmentally friendly and consider upgrading their coagulation treatment process into two stage coagulation process and might add recycling stream in the future revamp previous studies have reported on various coagulant recovery methods from sludge such as acidification alkalization and ion exchange membranes 26 28 however it is costly to recover coagulant from sludge studies have reported that water works sludge contains 39 aluminium by weight after coagulation 29 instead of recovering the coagulant from the sludge stage this paper studied the recycling of treated water which may still contain excess coagulant ions species therefore this study hypothesise that excess coagulant ions species remain in treated water after the coagulation stage thus recycling the treated water into bk1 or bk2 might help improve the overall r of the two stage coagulation stage 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials formula a ecogent f loc 10 30 aluminium hydroxide 1 10 polyelectrolyte 55 hydrofluoric acid solution poly aluminium chloride pac and sodium aluminate consist of 92 alnao2

spadns2 reagent for fluoride arsenic free arachem m sdn bhd malaysia were purchased from respective suppliers 2 2 coagulants flocculants preparation four chemical based coagulants formula a k2feo4 naalo2 and ecogent f loc are selected in present studies three formula a solution concentrations 1000 ppm 3500 ppm 6000 ppm were prepared by dissolving various dosages of formula a with 50 sulphuric acid solution as shown in fig 1 different concentrations of k2feo4 solution ranging from 600 ppm to1400 ppm were prepared by dissolving various dosages of k2feo4 with distilled water respectively naalo2 solution was prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of naalo2 in 50 ml of 10 sodium hydroxide solution before adding 200 ml of distilled water ecogent f loc was used for coagulations without further dilution flocculants were added after the coagulation process for every experiment conducted poly aluminium chloride was selected as the flocculant poly aluminium chloride 15 pac solution was prepared based on the method demonstrated by winston et al 30 by dissolving poly aluminium chloride in distilled water 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 jar test the experiment was carried out using jar test et 740 interscience sdn bhd malaysia based on the method of winston et al 30 to ensure uniform mixing when coagulants or flocculants were added into beakers of synthetic fluoride aqueous solution 100 ppm synthetic fluoride aqueous solution was prepared by diluting 55 hydrofluoric acid with distilled water beakers with a capacity of 500 ml were used to contain synthetic fluoride aqueous solution 2 3 2 single stage coagulation process in this study a 400 ml of synthetic fluoride aqueous solution was prepared in a 500 ml beaker the experiments were conducted according to the experiment designed by rsm shown in tables 5 and 6 each run of experiments will utilise one beaker there were a total of 30 experiments the initial ph ph 2 7 12 of beakers containing synthetic fluoride aqueous solution were adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid while measuring the ph of the solution with a ph meter next 10 ml of prepared chemical coagulants was added into the beaker the beakers were placed on jar test et 470 stirred at a speed of 120 rpm with their respective reaction time 2 min 6 min 10 min after that 3 0 ml of prepared pac solutions was added and stirred at a speed of 20 rpm for 5 min finally the beakers were placed on a flat surface to allow precipitate to settle for 30 min samples were collected from the beaker and analysed by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach malaysia to measure the final fluoride concentration 2 5 ml of samples was collected from beaker and diluted 100 times with distilled water because the limitation of uv vis spectrophotometer can only analyse fluoride concentration up to 2 ppm the samples were inserted into the uv vis spectrophotometer for analysis these steps were repeated for each run of experiments 2 3 3 two stage coagulation process the experimental setup of the two stage coagulation process shown in fig 2 was based on vendittia et al 16 based on table 3 a volume of 10 ml coagulant 1 was initially poured into the first beaker with 400 ml synthetic fluoride aqueous solution and continuously stirred at 120 rpm for 2 min next 300 ml of the samples was extracted and poured into the second beaker before the addition of coagulant 2 then the solution was also stirred at 120 rpm for 2 min 100 ml of treated water before the flocculating stage is recycled into beaker 1 or beaker 2 each after flocculating agent has been added samples were collected to analyse by uv vis spectrophotometer to measure the final fluoride concentration this is to mimic the process of recycling treated water in a water treatment process the experiment was repeated with different chemical formulations shown in table 3 2 4 experimental design and response analysis response surface methodology rsm was adopted to design the experiments analyse the response collected and obtain the optimum fluoride concentrations with box behnken design bbd bbd was used over central composite design ccd because ferreira et al 31 revealed that bbd is slightly more efficient than ccd this is because all factors analysed by bbd are simultaneously at their highest or lowest levels unlike ccd which perform experiments under extreme conditions which may affect its efficiency 32 moreover bbd conducts fewer experiments as compared to ccd thus this can reduce the amount of wastewater produced in this research while obtaining optimised results a minimum of three factors is required and the range of each factor has to be decided range can be divided into three levels 1 0 1 as shown in table 4 the experiments designed by bbd have a total of 15 experiments each as shown in tables 5 and 6 therefore a total of 30 experiments were conducted to study the effects of concentration initial ph and reaction time on r and final ph both formula a and k2feo4 the experimental data for the responses can be fitted into a second order polynomial model represented by eq 1 1 y β o i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 j i 2 k β ij x i x j where y is the response xi and xj are the independent variables i and j range from 1 to k βo is constant βi βii and βij are the regression coefficients of linear quadratic and interactive terms respectively k is the number of factors 33 there are three controlling factors in this study which are coagulants concentration initial ph and reaction time the bbd approach serves the purpose of reducing the number of experiments conducted to minimise wastewater produced to the environment while maintaining an efficient and economic approach 33 fluoride removal efficiency r of each test conducted was calculated based on the formula below 2 fluoride removal efficiency r c i c f c i 100 where ci initial fluoride concentration cf final fluoride concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 formula a single stage coagulation analysis 3 1 1 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on r coagulant formula a concentration has the most significant effect p 0 05 on r as the concentration of formula a increases the r decreases as shown in fig 3 this could be due to excess dosage of coagulants resulting in charge reversal and restabilisaiton of colloids 34 35 as the formula a concentration increases the negative charge of colloidal particles decreases the positive charge becomes more dominant which leads to electrostatic repulsion between positively charged particles as shown in fig 4 we can conclude that the investigated concentration range of 1000 to 6000 ppm has passed the isoelectric point of formula a which leads to this trend isoelectric point is the point where the concentration of positive charge is equal to the concentration of negative charge achieving optimum charge neutralisation 35 thus it can be expected that a higher r can be achieved with a lower coagulant concentration further research is required to investigate the zeta potential of formula a to find out the optimum concentration isoelectric point of formula a that can be added in sfw to achieve its highest r reaction time is the time for rapid mixing when coagulant is added into sfw this study investigates the reaction time from 2 to 10 min when 10 ml of formula a coagulant is added into sfw domínguez et al 36 studied the mixing time from 5 to 30 min of aluminium sulphate coagulant results shown increasing mixing time lead to reduction in cod removal efficiency thus this research investigated a lower range of reaction time from 2 to 10 min conversely reaction time has no significant effect p 0 05 on r as the reaction time increases from 2 to 10 min the r is between 59 to 60 as shown in fig 3 however studies on alum and pacl have reported that the reaction time has a significant impact on charge neutralisation and sweep coagulation 37 38 kan et al 32 recorded the reduction of residual turbidity ntu against mixing time from 0 to 400 s when 1 5 ppm of alum was added into synthetic stock suspension of clay the residual turbidity shows a drastic decrease from 0 to 50 s residual turbidity remains constant at 5 ntu from 50 to 300 s this can explain the insignificant effect p 0 05 of reaction time on r formula a coagulant could have destabilised colloidal particles in less than 2 min of rapid mixing therefore reaction time shows no significant effect on r 3 ao 2 2h ao 2 h 2 o finally initial ph has no significant effect p 0 05 on r as the initial ph increases from 2 to 12 the r is between 60 and 62 as shown in fig 3 this could be due to the addition of 10 ml of formula a coagulant which has reduced the ph of prepared sfw for example although sfw might have been adjusted to initial ph 12 but after adding formula a coagulant the ph measured of sfw after adding formula a coagulant was found to be less than ph 2 eq 3 shows the dissociation of formula a when it dissolves in sulphuric acid sulphuric acid will dissociate to produce h hso4 and so4 2 ions as shown in eqs 4 and 5 two h ions are dissociated per molecule of h2so4 therefore h2so4 is a strong diprotic acid based on eq 3 although one molecule of formula a requires 2h ions formula a was prepared with excess 50 sulphuric acid solution therefore there may be excess h ions presence that causes the ph of sfw with initial ph of 7 to 12 to decrease after dosing formula a into sfw consequently all experiments conducted with formula a coagulants have ph less than 2 despite adjusting the initial ph of sfw to ph 7 or ph 12 resulting initial ph to have no significant effect p 0 05 on r 4 h 2 so 4 h hso 4 5 hso 4 h so 4 2 3 1 2 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on final ph final ph is the ph measured after coagulation and flocculation stage this response is important to determine if the coagulant used requires ph adjustment after coagulation and flocculation stage in a wastewater treatment process however the main effects coagulant concentration reaction time and initial ph have no significant effect p 0 05 on final ph the final ph response is between 1 15 and 1 40 shown in fig 5 this finding further supports the significant effect of initial ph on r as discussed in the previous section due to the excess use of 50 h2so4 in the preparation formula a coagulants the treated sfw of all experiments conducted resulted in a final ph less than ph 2 therefore based on the formula a preparation method used in this research for coagulation treatment there is a requirement of ph adjustment at the end of the wastewater treatment process due to the acidity ph 2 of treated sfw according to doe malaysia environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 the ph of industrial effluent must meet standard a or standard b of ph 6 0 9 0 and ph 5 5 9 0 respectively thus it is expected the final ph of the acidity of treated sfw must be adjusted to between ph 5 5 9 0 3 2 potassium ferrate single stage analysis 3 2 1 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on r coagulant concentration shows a significant effect p 0 05 on r shown in fig 6 the r of k2feo4 increases with increasing coagulant concentration 600 to 1400 ppm shown in fig 6 further to that reaction time shows no significant effect p 0 05 on r as reported by jiang and lloyd 34 k2feo4 can destabilise the colloidal particles within 1 min while conventional coagulants such as ferric and ferrous salts can only achieve the destabilisation after 30 min mixing therefore it supports the finding that reaction time shows no significant effect on r in this research initial ph shows the most significant effect p 0 05 on r the trend shows that r decreases with increase of initial ph shown in fig 6 further to that k2feo4 achieves more than 80 of r in the range of initial ph 2 to 6 as shown in the contour plot fig 7 studies have also reported that k2feo4 coagulation activity works well under acidic conditions 40 41 this is because k2feo4 is a powerful oxidising agent under acidic conditions the redox potential e 2 20 v of ferrate iv ions feo4 2 is higher than that of molecular ozone and it is potentially the strongest of all the oxidants realistically applicable to water and wastewater treatment 39 42 eqs 5 and 6 show the reduction potential reaction of k2feo4 in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively 43 45 6 feo 4 2 8h 3e fe 3 4h 2 o e 2 20 v 7 feo 4 2 4h 2 o 3e fe oh 3 5oh e 0 72 v the overall decomposition of k2feo4 in aqueous solution generating hydroxide ions and molecular oxygen can be represented by eq 7 43 45 8 feo 4 2 5h 2 o fe 3 3 2 o 2 10 oh when k2feo4 was added into sfw initial ph 2 under acidic conditions feo4 2 ions is dissociated in the sfw while some feo4 2 ions undergoes reduction producing fe3 ions which also contributes to the coagulation activity in reducing the fluoride concentration however the r of k2feo4 under alkaline condition with initial ph 12 was 0 the fluoride concentration of sfw was not reduced this is because the decomposition rate of k2feo4 is strongly dependent on ph ferrate iv is most stable in strong bases with two regions of maximum stability one at ph 10 11 and the other in solutions greater than 3 m in base 45 therefore due to the stability of k2feo4 in alkaline condition less ferrate iv ions is dissociated and eq 6 is favour in alkaline condition producing fe oh 3 instead of feo4 2 or fe3 ions resulting in poor coagulation activity 3 2 2 effects of concentration reaction time initial ph on final ph concentration and reaction time have no significant effect p 0 05 on final ph only initial ph shows the most significant effect p 0 05 on final ph the final ph increases with increasing initial ph 2 to 12 shown in fig 8 further to that if we analyse the responses shown in table 6 the experiments conducted with initial ph 2 have a higher final ph this can be explained by eq 7 the overall decomposition of k2feo4 produces oh ions which may have neutralize h ions resulting in a higher final ph of about 4 this finding is important for treating wastewater which are acidic k2feo4 can be used to treat acidic wastewater and act as a preliminary ph adjustment jiang et al 41 studied pilot scale field tests with low ferrate vi doses for drinking water treatment achieved average particle removal percentage of 93 raw water and 97 for ozonised water in terms of particle counting data no ph neutralisation was required after dosing ferrate vi further to that responses of the k2feo4 experiment were optimised by rsm fig 10 showing that at initial ph 9 the final ph of treated sfw might achieve ph 7 further research and experiments is needed to compare with the optimised solution provided by rsm 3 3 response optimisation of formula a k2feo4 the responses collected in tables 5 and 6 were optimised by rsm to obtain the highest r of both formula a and k2feo4 achieved in this study the optimised condition of formula a shown in fig 9 achieved the highest r of 70 the optimised solution proposed by rsm is 1000 ppm formula a concentration 10 mins of reaction time and an initial ph of 2 final ph was not optimised because there were no significant effects p 0 05 on final ph all experiments conducted with formula a coagulants resulted in final ph less than 2 shown in table 5 further to that the optimised condition of k2feo4 shown in fig 10 achieved the highest r of 84 and final ph 7 the optimised solution proposed by rsm was 1190 ppm k2feo4 concentration 8 5 min of reaction time and an initial ph of 9 in summary the highest r achieved by formula a and k2feo4 is 70 and 84 respectively the final fluoride concentration of both formula a and k2feo4 were 30 ppm and 16 ppm respectively therefore single stage coagulation by using these chemical coagulants cannot meet standard b despite the fact that formula a and k2feo4 cannot reduce the fluoride concentration in a single coagulation stage to meet standard b the coagulant concentration is greatly reduced as compared to conventional chemical coagulants such as sodium aluminate and calcite chee et al 47 studied the fluoride removal by adding sodium aluminate it is reported that the r achieved by sodium aluminate was 45 with coagulant concentration of 6000 ppm moreover wang et al 21 studied the removal of fluoride by calcite results showed that 12 000 ppm of calcite achieved a 97 r with initial fluoride concentration of 310 ppm further to that the r of formula a 70 and k2feo4 84 is higher compared to sodium aluminate while calcite shows the highest r of 97 however calcite needs a relatively high coagulant concentration 12 000 ppm to achieve 97 of r balik and aydin 48 revealed that sludge quantity increases with coagulant concentration both formula a and k2feo4 coagulants can achieve relatively high r 70 84 at low coagulant concentration 1000 1190 ppm as compared to sodium aluminate and calcite which uses 6000 ppm and 12 000 ppm respectively this will reduce chemical demand and sludge production resulting in low operating cost and generate substantial cost saving in treating sewage 46 3 4 multistage removal of fluoride single stage coagulation cannot meet standard b therefore a two stage coagulation was studied and investigated here three chemical formulations have been formulated as cf1 cf2 and cf3 are shown in table 7 both cf1 and cf2 can meet standard a but cf3 cannot meet at least standard b cf1 the combination of ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 in table 7 shows that recycling treated water does improve the fluoride removal efficiency the final fluoride concentration of test 1 without recycling treated water was 1 99 ppm when treated water is recycled into bk1 or bk2 the final fluoride concentration of test 2 and test 3 is 1 48 ppm and 1 83 ppm respectively the final fluoride concentration was lower compared to test 1 without recycling treated water this could be due to excess coagulant ions species remaining in the treated water when treated water was recycled back into bk1 or bk2 the excess coagulant ions species might have contributed to the coagulation activities resulting in overall improvement of r test 2 test 3 as compared to without recycling of treated water test 1 the combination of naalo2 1 formula a 2 does not show improvement in fluoride final fluoride concentration when treated water is recycled into bk1 or bk2 the final fluoride concentration of test 5 and test 6 with recycled treated water was 1 85 ppm and 1 93 ppm respectively both test 5 and test 6 had a slightly higher final fluoride concentration compared to test 4 without recycled treated water which was 1 81 ppm this could have been caused by re stabilisation of colloid particles when treated water is recycled back into bk1 or bk2 coagulant ions species which are positive charge particles dominate resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the particles despite the conflict of recycling treated water having improves the r between cf1 and cf2 it is certain both formulations were able to achieve standard a 49 studied the isoelectric point of aluminium sulphate and pacl was 014 mm and 0 03 mm respectively in one stage coagulation stage du et al 46 dose 0 10 mm of aluminium sulphate in the first coagulation stage and 0 10 mm of pacl in the second coagulation stage the residual turbidity shown to increase from 1 0 to 4 0 ntu this is because the dose of pacl in the second coagulation stage has exceeded the isoelectric point of 0 03 mm resulting in re stabilisation of particles in this study the isoelectric point of formula a and k2feo4 is not studied therefore further research is required to study the coagulation mechanism and zeta potential of each coagulant to further optimise the dose of coagulants in two stage coagulation the combination of naalo2 1 k2feo4 2 cf3 cannot meet standard b this can be explained by the preparation of naalo2 naalo2 solution was prepared by dissolving naalo2 in 10 sodium hydroxide solution before adding distilled water as discussed in the previous section k2feo4 coagulation activity does not function well in alkaline conditions 40 41 because ferrate iv ions are most stable in ph range 10 to 11 45 due to the stability of k2feo4 in alkaline condition less ferrate iv ions is dissociated and eq 6 is favour in alkaline condition producing fe oh 3 instead of feo4 2 or fe3 ions resulting in poor coagulation activity the presence of sodium hydroxide hindered the coagulation activity of k2feo4 thus experiments conducted with cf3 resulted in low r of 41 49 the reduction of fluoride concentration was probably due to sodium aluminate only as reported by chee et al 47 the r of sodium aluminate was 45 it supports the results of test 7 to 9 4 conclusion the controlling factors are coagulant concentration reaction time and initial ph of formula a and k2feo4 used in determining fluoride removal efficiency formula a and k2feo4 are able to reduce fluoride concentration with efficiency of 70 and 84 respectively formula a requires further research at lower coagulant concentration as it has potential in achieving higher fluoride removal efficiency k2feo4 shows better coagulation activity under acidic conditions and can act as a preliminary ph adjustment although both chemical coagulants did not meet standard b a two stage coagulation process can act as an alternative solution to current industries compared to a single stage coagulation process the combination of ecogent f loc 1 formula a 2 and naalo2 1 formula a 2 has successfully met standard a with an r of 98 this research has shown the potential of exploring new industrial chemicals with higher fluoride removal capability in low coagulant concentration and coagulation process strategy in meeting the environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 with discharge standard a declaration of competing interest

13488,glucocorticoids gcs in the environment have been an increasing concern most recently gcs have been shown to be an effective remedy to manage septic shock in patients infected with covid 19 in this study a self made dielectric barrier discharge reactor integrating microbubbles and peroxymonosulfate dbd mb pms was used to degrade the gcs in water at neutral ph and ambient temperature hydrocortisone hc betamethasone bt and fluocinolone acetonide fa were degraded effectively by the dbd mb pms system with the 90 min degradation efficiencies of 77 80 and 82 respectively discharge power 83 5 w pms gc ratio 20 1 in comparison the 90 min degradation efficiencies for hc bt and fa by dbd mb system discharge power 83 5 w ph unadjusted flow rate 40 mg l were only 49 54 and 60 respectively and the efficiencies by heat activated pms 90 c were only 24 12 and 16 respectively hence dbd mb is an efficient approach for pms activation which resulted in increased removal efficiencies and energy yields for gcs degradation the rate constants for gcs degradation also increased with the increase of pms dosage and initial solution ph both so4 and oh were prominent species for gcs degradation based on the results of scavenging experiment the contributions of so4 for hc bt and fa degradation were roughly estimated to be 51 59 and 60 respectively and the contributions of oh were 30 29 and 27 respectively this work not only provides a novel approach in dealing with gcs contaminated water but also highlights the synergistic effect of plasma mb and pms graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dielectric barrier discharge peroxymonosulfate microbubbles glucocorticoids degradation 1 introduction the emergence of micro pollutants particularly pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps has raised worldwide concern 1 among these ppcps are glucocorticoids gcs a class of steroid hormones capable of disturbing the immune system and the metabolism of vertebrates 2 synthetic gcs are often prescribed against various conditions such as rheumatism asthma and inflammation 1 most recently glucocorticoids particularly dexamethasone were found to be life saving drugs for critically ill covid 19 patients 3 in the absence of dexamethasone alternative glucocorticoids such as prednisone methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone hc can be used 4 hc can be used to manage septic shock in patients infected with covid 19 4 due to colossal use increased discharge into the environment via raw and partially treated wastewater has been reported 5 6 dexamethasone at a concentration of 10 μg l in river water has been reported 7 and prednisolone at the concentrations of 0 25 μg l and 2 μg l was found in hospital and industrial wastewaters respectively 8 exposure to exogenous gcs has been linked with increases in obesity type 2 diabates and autoimmune disorders 9 they have also been shown to adversely affect aquatic life even at low concentration levels of ng l 1 studies have revealed overreliance on the traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps for treatment of gcs 7 10 however wwtps have limited effectiveness in gcs removal as some gcs are stable and resistant to biodegradation 11 12 in some cases higher concentrations of fluocinolone acetonide fa were found in effluent than in influent 13 non thermal plasma based water treatment is an emerging technique to deal with such pollutants plasma in contact with liquid water generates a host of reactive species including strong oxidants oh o2 h2o2 o3 and reductants e eaq h 14 15 these reactive species have high oxidation or reduction reactivity towards organic pollutants 16 the interaction primarily takes place in the boundary layer of the plasma liquid interface 17 non thermal plasma ntp is now gaining momentum in the treatment of micro polluted municipal pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters due to its high efficiency and broad applicability 18 20 dielectric barrier discharge dbd a classical ntp technique features high removal rates large treatment area and simple operation procedures 21 during dbd treatment a variety of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns are generated through collision between the energetic electrons and the matrix molecules 22 in addition physico chemical effects such as ultraviolet light uv heat and shockwaves are simultaneously generated during the dbd process 21 fig s1 si illustrates the overview of the optical emission spectra and generation of reactive species during dbd process a detailed description of dbd working principles is shown in text s1 si despite the merits of ntp a few challenges need to be addressed in order to realize its full potential one of the salient obstacles is the limited energy efficiency of dbd treatment 23 several strategies combining plasma with various oxidants such as h2o2 24 cao2 25 o3 23 catalysts 26 or adsorbents 27 have been shown to be effective in further increasing the energy efficiency of dbd treatment this study investigated the combination of dbd with peroxymonosulfate pms pms is an asymmetrical oxidant with a redox potential of 1 82 ev eq 1 28 1 hs o 5 2 h 2 e hs o 4 h 2 o even though pms is a thermodynamically strong oxidant its reaction with most pollutants is quite slow activation is required to release s o 4 and oh radicals 28 thus enabling strong interactions with the pollutants commonly used activators include transition metals carbon catalysts ultrasound us ultraviolet uv heat conduction band electrons etc 28 since uv heat and solvated electrons are the hallmarks of dbd this study banked on the possibility of pms activation by plasma discharge and the resultant potential synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs another dbd obstacle is the low mass transfer efficiency of the generated reactive species from the plasma discharge gas phase to the pollutant existing aqueous phase therefore microbubbles mb are introduced in order to enhance the mass transfer 29 31 mb are tiny bubbles with a diameter of 10 50 μm which tend to gradually decrease in size and ultimately collapse with the interior gases dissolved into the surrounding water 32 due to the pyrolytic decomposition that takes place within the collapsing bubbles free radicals such as oh radical and shock waves can be generated at the gas liquid interface 32 now mb have been applied in many fields of science and technology however studies on the combined use of ntp and mb are limited thus the main objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect arising from the dbd mb pms system on the degradation of gcs the prominent species responsible for gcs degradation were identified by scavenging experiments effects of experimental parameters including pms dosage and ph and influences of co existing ions as well as water matrices were also investigated we therefore anticipated that our findings would provide some theoretical and technical

apparatus the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the system consists of a high voltage power supply ctp 2000 k nanjing suman electronics china voltage regulator mb generator nano lf100 xingheng china and a novel self made dbd reactor the voltage regulator enabled the supply of alternating voltages ranging from 0 to 90 v the peak to peak voltage and current were measured using a 500 mhz digital oscilloscope tds 2012b tektronix usa detailed description of the dbd reactor is available in the text s2 a hydrodynamic cavitation apparatus was used to generate mb enriched water the mb rich water was pumped through the dbd reactor at a flow rate of 40 ml min throughout the treatment period creating a continuous flow system 2 3 experimental procedures batch experiments explored the influences of input power gas flow initial ph pms dosage non targeted ions and water matrices on the gcs degradation in the dbd mb and dbd mb pms systems each batch experiment involved a total volume of 300 ml the initial concentrations of gcs in ultrapure water were 20 mg l about 2 5 ml aliquot was sampled at fixed time intervals and filtered through millipore filters 0 45 μm for analysis the optimum gas intake capacity of the mb generator was 40 ml min but mb sizes could be regulated by changing the air pump pressure the relationship between the bubble size and air pressure is shown in fig s2 33 the control experiments of mb alone pms alone and dbd mb were conducted with the same experimental set up and conditions however for mb alone there was neither pms nor high voltage supply while for pms alone a beaker magnetic stirrer and a temperature regulated water bath heating system were used the discharge power was adjusted by changing the applied voltage voltages of 40 v 60 v 80 v and 90 v corresponding to discharge powers of 37 4 w 52 6 w 83 5 w and 87 5 w respectively were used the pms dose was set as oxidant pms to contaminant gc molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 and 30 1 this optimized the pms dosage for gcs degradation some of the main reactions in pms decomposition are as shown in eqs 2 9 2 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 oh s o 4 hs o 5 4 oh oh h 2 o 2 5 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h

current a tektronix tds 2012b digital oscilloscope and tektronix p6015a voltage probe with an attenuation of 1000 1 were used to measure the current and voltage respectively of the discharge electrode in the dbd reactor a voltage probe with attenuation of 10 1 was used to measure the voltage of the ground electrode the discharge parameters and waveforms are shown in fig s3 the discharge power was calculated using the lissajous figure method as shown in eqs 10 and 11 25 34 10 i a c r d v r dt 11 p w 1 t 0 t pdt c r t 0 t v dv dt dt f c r s where i is the discharge current a cr is the capacitance f vr is the voltage across the capacitance cr p is the discharge power w f is the frequency hz and s is the area of the lissajous figure m2 obtained from the oscilloscope the energy efficiency ee was defined as the discharge power p used to degrade contaminants divided by the input power p0 which was calculated from the input current a0 and input voltage v0 as displayed on the high voltage power supply the calculation is as illustrated by eq 12 12 ee p p 0 100 the energy yield ey of the gcs degradation was defined as the mass of the contaminant removed per unit of electrical energy consumed as shown in eq 13 13 ey mg kw h c mg l v l re p kw t h 100 where c is the initial concentration of the target contaminant v is the solution volume re is the removal

were carried out in duplicate with the average data and standard deviation reported analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and synergistic effects of dbd mb pms 3 1 1 dbd alone mb alone and pms alone the degradation of gcs by dbd alone under the conditions of various discharge powers is shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa after 90 min treatment at 83 5 w were 49 54 and 60 respectively the gcs degradation all fitted pseudo first order kinetic the rate constants at various discharge powers and the corresponding r2 values 0 9 are shown in table s2 as depicted in fig 2 the removal efficiencies of gcs increased significantly with the increasing discharge power from 37 4 w to 83 5 w the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa rose from 21 k 0 17 h 1 to 49 k 0 44 h 1 from 19 k 0 14 h 1 to 54 k 0 54 h 1 and from 13 k 0 09 h 1 to 60 k 0 64 h 1 respectively the increase in dbd discharge power resulted in increased electric field intensity which in turn led to a higher electron density and higher amounts of free radicals 18 in addition the increased discharge power promoted dissociation ionization and excitation of gaseous molecules resulting in more generation of reactive species 36 uv intensity also increases with the increase in discharge power thus producing more oh 37 however as the discharge power further increased from 83 5 w to 87 5 w the removal efficiencies of gcs decreased on the contrary fig 2 this is because further increase in discharge power gave rise to growing energy waste in the form of heat which lowered the energy efficiency as a consequence table s3 the highest removal efficiencies and rate constants for three gcs were all obtained at the discharge power of 83 5 w fig 2 table s2 therefore 83 5 w was used as the optimal discharge power in the subsequent dbd based treatments the contribution of microbubbles to the degradation of gcs was investigated as mb alone at a gas flow of 40 ml min and pressure of 0 6 mpa mb alone can also degrade gcs however the removal efficiencies were low fig 2d the degradation ratios of hc bt and fa by mb alone after 90 min were only 19 21 and 25 respectively this is because the mb collapse could not lead to sufficient generation of oh 33 the limited gcs removal was largely attributed to the drastic elevated chemical potential caused by the instantaneous extinction of the gas water interface and the subsequent radical generation and dispersion 33 pms alone trials under various activation temperatures were also investigated to identify the effect of dbd in pms activation and their synergistic effect in accelerating gcs degradation the pms activation temperatures ranged from 40 c to 90 c and the ph values were adjusted to circumneutral as is shown in fig s4 there was only a slight increase in the removal efficiency as temperature increased meanwhile the gcs removal by heat activated pms was much lower than by dbd mb pms system for instance the 90 min degradation ratios of hc bt and fa by 90 c activated pms treatment were only 24 12 and 15 respectively in contrast with the values of 77 80 and 82 respectively in dbd mb pms system fig 4 this implies that dbd mb has a much higher efficiency in pms activation than heat yang et al 38 also observed that heat was less effective in pms activation than in persulfate ps activation hc responded relatively better to heat activated pms treatment compared to bt and fa this may be ascribed to the presence of cf bonds in bt and fa which makes the molecules more recalcitrant to ros attack 3 1 2 dbd mb the dbd mb treatment apart from the individual contribution of reactive species by the mb system also enhances the production of reactive species through dissolution of gas air 39 thus providing a synergistic effect for the contaminant degradation compared with mb alone the 90 min degradation ratios of hc bt and fa in dbd mb system increased by 29 33 and 34 respectively fig 3a as pointed out earlier during dbd treatment a host of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns fig s1 in combination with the physical effects such as uv heat and shockwaves are generated which are believed to be responsible for the degradation of contaminants the dbd mb combination can enhance the dissolution and mass transfer of plasma generated active species from the gas phase to liquid phase as mb collapses thus increasing the production of reactive radicals and promoting gcs degradation wu et al reported that the concentrations of chemical species in plasma activated microbubble water are twice to three times as high as in plasma activated water 40 to be noted hc degraded faster than bt and fa in heat activated pms treatment fig s4 however fa and bt had higher degradation rates than hc in the dbd mb system fig 3 therefore the overall degradation efficiency depends on the structure of the gcs as well as the treatments we conjectured that the more halogenated compound s attracted more of the reactive species which in this case was the aqueous electrons 41 generated in the dbd system hence fa with two fluorine substituents is more easily degraded furthermore fig 3 shows the time courses of hc bt and fa removal with the gas flow rate ranging from 10 ml min to 60 ml min while the discharge power was kept at 83 5 w the 90 min removal efficiencies for hc bt and fa increased by 2 82 2 84 and 2 95 fold respectively when the gas flow increased from 10 ml min to 40 ml min this result further confirms the enhanced gas liquid mass transfer in the presence of more microbubbles 39 however a further increase in the gas flow rate from 40 ml min to 60 ml min on the contrary resulted in a decline in the gcs degradation efficiencies this could be ascribed to the increase in mb size according to henry s law at a certain pressure the amount of dissolved gas in water is constant at a gas flow rate of 40 ml min the gas in the solution is saturated and a further increase only increases the bubble size rather than the bubbles quantity the increase in bubble size decreases the specific interfacial area and inner pressure of the mb 42 thus decreasing the concentrations of reactive species therefore gas flow rates higher than 40 ml min conversely decreased the amount of active species which in turn decreased the gcs removal efficiencies based on the observations herein the optimal gas flow rate for the dbd mb system in the present study was 40 ml min which was used in the subsequent mb involved experiments 3 1 3 dbd mb pms the time profiles of the gcs degradation were monitored in the dbd mb system in the presence of pms as is shown in fig 4 the integrated system of dbd mb pms showed a remarkable synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs the overall removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa under the dbd mb pms system after 90 min were 77 80 and 82 respectively which were 1 60 1 48 and 1 39 fold respectively higher than the dbd mb system these results imply that pms can be effectively activated by the plasma irradiation with the potential generation of highly reactive species such as so4 and oh 43 the bimolecular reaction rate constants of these radicals with most organic compounds are in the range of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 44 a detailed discussion on mechanism is available in section 3 3 3 2 effects of operational conditions in dbd mb pms system 3 2 1 pms dose the effects of initial pms concentration on the removal of gcs were studied at an initial ph value of 7 and gc concentration of 20 mg l the gas flow rate was 40 ml min while the discharge power was 83 5 w different concentrations of pms measured as pms to gc molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 and 30 1 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 5 the gcs removal efficiencies increased with the increase in the initial pms concentration without pms the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa were 49 54 and 60 respectively while the values increased to 70 64 and 66 respectively with 10 1 pms gcs as the pms gc molar ratio increased to 20 1 the observed 90 min removal efficiencies for hc bt and fa increased to 77 80 and 82 respectively the reason is in that more s o 4 and oh radicals eq 14 can be produced at higher pms dose thus favoring the degradation of gcs 45 46 however a further increase in pms gc molar ratio to 30 1 led to a decline in the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa by 19 12 and 9 respectively fig 5 this is because excess pms resulted in secondary reactions in which pms scavenges the reactive radicals as shown in eqs 15 16 47 thus decreasing the overall removal efficiencies of gcs the scavenging effect of pms on so4 and oh radicals led to the formation of peroxomonosufate radical s o 5 which is a much weaker oxidant this phenomenon which is akin to the h2o2 involved aops was also observed in other pms based aops 48 50 in addition excess s o 4 and s o 5 would also undergo self scavenging as is shown in eqs 17 18 51 thus reducing the amount of reactive species in the present study 20 1 was the optimal pms gcs molar ratio for the degradation of gcs which was used in the subsequent experiments 14 hs o 5 s o 4 oh 15 s o 4 hs o 5 s o 5 s o 4 2 h 16 oh hs o 5 s o 5 h 2 o 17 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 18 s o 5 s o 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 3 2 2 ph ph is one of the most important factors that affect the degradation of pollutants and also affects the activation of oxidants and the generation of free radicals in this study the effect of the initial solution ph on the degradation of gcs was examined in the ph range of 3 to 9 with the pms to gcs molar ratio of 20 1 gas flow rate of 40 ml min and discharge power of 83 5 w as shown in fig 6 the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa at unadjusted initial ph of 3 were 54 63 and 61 respectively no significant enhancement was observed in dbd mb pms system compared with dbd mb system at ph 3 this result means that at lower ph values the enhancement effect of pms was negligible a plausible reason is the scavenging effect of h on so4 and oh at low ph ph 5 according to eqs 19 20 48 19 oh h e h 2 o 20 s o 4 h e hs o 4 in addition guan et al 51 indicated that the apparent molar absorption coefficient of pms at λ 254 nm increased significantly with the increase of ph which enhanced pms activation and in turn the generation of so4 and oh 52 consequently a remarkable increase in gcs removal efficiencies was observed as the initial ph increased from 3 to 9 fig 6a b and c however it could be observed that the degradation rate of fa slightly decreased at ph 9 compared with ph 7 this is possibly ascribed to the fact that s o 4 radicals which have high reactivity towards halogenated compounds are converted to nonselective oh under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 53 considering that satisfactory efficiencies can be obtained at neutral ph conditions and that the ph for actual wastewaters are circumneutral neutral ph was used in the experiments 3 3 mechanism analysis 3 3 1 reactive species in order to clarify the role of various reactive species involved in the gcs degradation scavenging experiments were conducted in the dbd mb treatment addition of t buoh a typical scavenger of oh with the reaction rate constant of 3 8 108 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constant of t buoh with so4 is only 4 0 105 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 showed an obvious inhibition in gcs removal as shown in fig 7 for instance the 90 min removal efficiency of hc decreased from 49 to 27 18 and 11 respectively upon the addition of 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm t buoh fig 7a similarly the removal efficiencies also decreased obviously for bt and fa fig 7b c these results indicate that oh is the dominant reactive species for gcs degradation in the dbd mb system however addition of t buoh to the dbd mb pms system did not result in such remarkable inhibitory effect fig s5 for instance in the presence of 10 mm t buoh the 90 min degradation efficiencies of hc bt and fa just dropped from 77 80 and 82 to 54 57 and 60 respectively these results thereby imply the existence of other active species in the dbd mb pms system to verify this speculation etoh a scavenger of both oh and so4 with their respective reaction rate constants of 1 2 109 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 6 107 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 was added to the dbd mb pms system and significant inhibitory effects in gcs degradation were observed fig 7 the 90 min degradation ratio of hc decreased from 77 to 21 18 and 15 respectively with the addition of 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm etoh fig 7d the 90 min degradation ratio of bt also decreased from 80 to 15 13 and 10 respectively fig 7e and for fa the value decreased from 82 to 19 16 and 11 respectively fig 7f therefore we can conclude from the above observations that both oh and so4 played important roles in gcs degradation in the dbd mb pms system based on the results of the scavenging experiments with 10 mm t buoh and 10 mm etoh we calculated the contributions of oh and so4 for gcs degradation according to previous literatures 54 55 the contributions of oh were roughly estimated to be 30 29 and 27 respectively for hc bt and fa degradation and the contributions of so4 were 51 59 and 60 respectively the remaining efficiency may be ascribed to other reactive species and or physico chemical effects generated in the dbd process 56 therefore in order to evaluate the effects of other species separate experiments with o3 h2o2 or uv alone were carried out the detailed experimental procedures are shown in text s6 in the si the results are shown in fig s6 o3 h2o2 and uv all had certain effects in degrading gcs and their efficiencies differed for different gc the sum efficiency of o3 h2o2 and uv for hc degradation seems higher than those for bt and fa this is in accordance with the results of oh and so4 contribution that oh and so4 contributed more in bt and fa degradation however to be noted due to the complex chain reactions and interactions between various reactive species and physico chemical effects it is rather difficult to quantify all the contributors and precisely calculate their contributions the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 and the uv intensity we used in the separate experiments were much higher than those generated in the actual dbd system 57 58 therefore the contributions of oh and s o 4 we calculated in the present study are roughly estimated values based on the results of the scavenging experiments anyhow in comparison with the dominance of oh in the dbd mb treatment the combined effect of oh and s o 4 was confirmed in the dbd mb pms treatment 3 3 2 synergistic mechanism of dbd mb and pms in order to clearly manifest the effect of dbd mb pms system we compared the gcs degradation efficiencies and rates under different systems pms alone mb alone dbd alone and dbd mb pms as is shown in fig s7 the combination of dbd mb and pms brought about a significant synergistic effect on degradation of gcs for instance the 90 min degradation efficiencies of gcs were remarkably increased in the dbd mb pms system compared with the pms alone mb alone and dbd alone systems the enhancement effect of dbd mb pms system was more obvious with regard to the gcs degradation rates the k values of gcs degradation obtained in the dbd mb pms system 0 91 h 1 0 96 h 1 and 0 96 h 1 respectively for hc bt and fa were even higher than the sum of those obtained in the pms alone mb alone and dbd alone systems 0 63 h 1 0 76 h 1 and 0 87 h 1 respectively for hc bt and fa additionally by incorporating mb and pms into the dbd system the energy yields for hc bt and fa degradation also increased obviously from 23 3 26 0 and 28 7 mg kwh respectively to 36 9 37 6 and 39 3 mg kwh the synergistic effect of dbd mb pms system can be largely attributed to the strong interactions between dbd mb and pms for instance dbd generates a number of reactive species upon the dissociation of gas molecules and formation of high energy electrons while by combining dbd and mb plasma can be ignited inside the mb where the electron avalanche breakdown occurs with short lived species generated and sustained until the mb collapse 34 mb on the other hand improve the mass transfer efficiency for the reactive species from the gas phase to the liquid phase and thus enhance the removal of organic pollutants 29 31 pms in the presence of activators such as heat uv plasma electrons etc dissociates and generates oh and so4 which have high reactivity towards gcs these activators are the typical reactive species and physico chemical effects produced in the plasma system therefore dbd can be a highly efficient approach for pms activation furthermore the products of pms dissociation i e oh and so4 can also be involved in the chain reactions to enhance the production of other radicals eqs 21 23 in conclusion the enhancement effect of dbd md pms system was evident in the overall removal efficiencies of gcs affirming the synergy that existed among dbd mb and pms 21 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 22 so4 h2o2 so4 2 ho2 23 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 3 4 dbd mb pms application in actual water matrices 3 4 1 effect of co existing ions in actual water matrices coexists a number of inorganic ions usually in concentrations ranging from 0 05 mm to 5 mm 59 in this study the effects of so4 2 cl and hc o 3 on the degradation of gcs were investigated as shown in fig 8 these ions inhibited gc removal during the dbd mb pms treatment this decrease was mainly due to competition between the ions and the target gcs for the reactive species namely so4 and oh 28 for instance hc o 3 ions react with so4 and oh as shown in eqs 24 25 respectively which in turn reduces the amount of the reactive species available for the target gcs as for the cl ion although cl can activate pms 38 it seems not able to offset the adverse effect of the competing reactions between cl and gcs for the active species this is because so4 and oh can be scavenged by cl to generate a suite of reactive chlorine species such as cl2 ocl2 cl2 hocl etc as shown in eqs 26 27 however these chlorine species are more selective than so4 and ho that they only have a relatively high susceptibility of electron rich structure 60 yin et al indicated that the reactive chlorine species had small contributions for prednisolone degradation in the uv chlorine process 61 therefore cl exhibited a net inhibitory effect on gcs degradation in the present study 24 hc o 3 s o 4 c o 3 s o 4 2 h k 3 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 hc o 3 oh h 2 o c o 3 k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 26 cl s o 4 cl s o 4 2 k 2 6 108 m 1 s 1 27 cl oh cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 4 2 water matrices the effectiveness of dbd mb pms in the treatment of gcs in actual water matrices was assessed as shown in fig 9a the 90 min removal efficiencies for hc in surface water tap water secondary effluent and ground water were 63 61 53 and 50 respectively which decreased by 14 16 24 and 27 respectively compared to that in ultrapure water similarly the removal efficiencies for bt decreased by 21 25 30 and 35 respectively fig 9b and those for fa decreased by 27 31 35 and 49 respectively fig 9c the decrease in gcs removal efficiencies corresponded with the order of increase in conductivities which was ultrapure water surface water tap water secondary effluent ground water table s1 as discussed in section 3 4 1 the coexisting ions imposed high inhibition primarily via lowering the amount of reactive species available for the reactions with target gcs especially for the secondary effluent and ground waters which have high concentrations of ions table s1 obvious negative influences were observed nonetheless the gcs removal efficiencies were around 50 in most actual water matrices implying that the dbd mb pms is a feasible technique for the practical remediation of gcs contaminated waters 3 4 3 energy consumption of dbd mb pms system the energy yields ey of gcs removal by the dbd mb pms treatment were calculated and shown in table s3 the ey values for hc bt and fa degradation were 36 9 37 6 and 39 3 mg kwh respectively in the dbd mb pms treatment at the discharge power of 83 5 w while the values were only 23 0 25 9 and 28 3 mg kwh respectively in the dbd mb system these results indicate that coupling dbd mb process with pms not only enhanced gcs degradation fig 4 but also greatly increased the energy yield in addition the ey obtained in the dbd mb pms system were also higher than those reported in the dbd system 6 mg kwh and in the dbd cao2 system 7 5 mg kwh table s3 therefore the combination of dbd mb and pms resulted in a potent synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs according to the ey values the energy consumption of dbd mb pms treatment was calculated and compared with other treatment processes as is shown in table s5 dbd mb pms has a higher gc degradation efficiency than photolysis photocatalysis photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation meanwhile its energy consumption is much lower than that of the photocatalytic process and that of the photocatalytic oxidation process miklos et al indicated that plasma has a median energy consumption which is lower than uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops but higher than o3 o3 uv uv persulfate and uv chlorine 16 blossom et al found that plasma presented potential advantages on perfluoroalkyl substances removal due to its relatively low energy demand compared with other aops such as sonolysis photochemical oxidation and electrochemical oxidation 62 therefore plasma treatment can provide attractive solutions for specific challenges 4 conclusion degradation of glucocorticoids gcs in water was studied using a self made dbd reactor integrated with mb and pms dbd mb pms influential factors including discharge power gas flow rate initial ph pms dosage and water matrices were evaluated at neutral ph ambient temperature and 83 5 w discharge power and with 40 ml min microbubbles and 1 0 mm pms the overall removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa after 90 min could reach 77 80 and 82 respectively with the corresponding pseudo first order rate constants of 0 91 h 1 0 96 h 1 and 0 96 h 1 respectively compared with the dbd alone mb alone pms alone heat activated pms at 90 c and dbd mb systems a significant synergistic effect on gcs degradation was observed in the dbd mb pms system mb enhances mass transfer while pms increases the amount of reactive species for gcs degradation the scavenging experiments clarified that oh was the dominant reactive species in dbd mb treatment while both s o 4 and oh radicals were effective in dbd mb pms treatment co existing anions so4 2 cl and hc o 3 and water matrices affected gcs removal nevertheless the dbd mb pms system can basically attain removal efficiencies of gcs higher than 50 in various water matrices within 90 min therefore dbd mb pms can be a feasible and promising technique for the treatment of gcs containing hospital and

13488,glucocorticoids gcs in the environment have been an increasing concern most recently gcs have been shown to be an effective remedy to manage septic shock in patients infected with covid 19 in this study a self made dielectric barrier discharge reactor integrating microbubbles and peroxymonosulfate dbd mb pms was used to degrade the gcs in water at neutral ph and ambient temperature hydrocortisone hc betamethasone bt and fluocinolone acetonide fa were degraded effectively by the dbd mb pms system with the 90 min degradation efficiencies of 77 80 and 82 respectively discharge power 83 5 w pms gc ratio 20 1 in comparison the 90 min degradation efficiencies for hc bt and fa by dbd mb system discharge power 83 5 w ph unadjusted flow rate 40 mg l were only 49 54 and 60 respectively and the efficiencies by heat activated pms 90 c were only 24 12 and 16 respectively hence dbd mb is an efficient approach for pms activation which resulted in increased removal efficiencies and energy yields for gcs degradation the rate constants for gcs degradation also increased with the increase of pms dosage and initial solution ph both so4 and oh were prominent species for gcs degradation based on the results of scavenging experiment the contributions of so4 for hc bt and fa degradation were roughly estimated to be 51 59 and 60 respectively and the contributions of oh were 30 29 and 27 respectively this work not only provides a novel approach in dealing with gcs contaminated water but also highlights the synergistic effect of plasma mb and pms graphical abstract

saving drugs for critically ill covid 19 patients 3 in the absence of dexamethasone alternative glucocorticoids such as prednisone methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone hc can be used 4 hc can be used to manage septic shock in patients infected with covid 19 4 due to colossal use increased discharge into the environment via raw and partially treated wastewater has been reported 5 6 dexamethasone at a concentration of 10 μg l in river water has been reported 7 and prednisolone at the concentrations of 0 25 μg l and 2 μg l was found in hospital and industrial wastewaters respectively 8 exposure to exogenous gcs has been linked with increases in obesity type 2 diabates and autoimmune disorders 9 they have also been shown to adversely affect aquatic life even at low concentration levels of ng l 1 studies have revealed overreliance on the traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps for treatment of gcs 7 10 however wwtps have limited effectiveness in gcs removal as some gcs are stable and resistant to biodegradation 11 12 in some cases higher concentrations of fluocinolone acetonide fa were found in effluent than in influent 13 non thermal plasma based water treatment is an emerging technique to deal with such pollutants plasma in contact with liquid water generates a host of reactive species including strong oxidants oh o2 h2o2 o3 and reductants e eaq h 14 15 these reactive species have high oxidation or reduction reactivity towards organic pollutants 16 the interaction primarily takes place in the boundary layer of the plasma liquid interface 17 non thermal plasma ntp is now gaining momentum in the treatment of micro polluted municipal pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters due to its high efficiency and broad applicability 18 20 dielectric barrier discharge dbd a classical ntp technique features high removal rates large treatment area and simple operation procedures 21 during dbd treatment a variety of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns are generated through collision between the energetic electrons and the matrix molecules 22 in addition physico chemical effects such as ultraviolet light uv heat and shockwaves are simultaneously generated during the dbd process 21 fig s1 si illustrates the overview of the optical emission spectra and generation of reactive species during dbd process a detailed description of dbd working principles is shown in text s1 si despite the merits of ntp a few challenges need to be addressed in order to realize its full potential one of the salient obstacles is the limited energy efficiency of dbd treatment 23 several strategies combining plasma with various oxidants such as h2o2 24 cao2 25 o3 23 catalysts 26 or adsorbents 27 have been shown to be effective in further increasing the energy efficiency of dbd treatment this study investigated the combination of dbd with peroxymonosulfate pms pms is an asymmetrical oxidant with a redox potential of 1 82 ev eq 1 28 1 hs o 5 2 h 2 e hs o 4 h 2 o even though pms is a thermodynamically strong oxidant its reaction with most pollutants is quite slow activation is required to release s o 4 and oh radicals 28 thus enabling strong interactions with the pollutants commonly used activators include transition metals carbon catalysts ultrasound us ultraviolet uv heat conduction band electrons etc 28 since uv heat and solvated electrons are the hallmarks of dbd this study banked on the possibility of pms activation by plasma discharge and the resultant potential synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs another dbd obstacle is the low mass transfer efficiency of the generated reactive species from the plasma discharge gas phase to the pollutant existing aqueous phase therefore microbubbles mb are introduced in order to enhance the mass transfer 29 31 mb are tiny bubbles with a diameter of 10 50 μm which tend to gradually decrease in size and ultimately collapse with the interior gases dissolved into the surrounding water 32 due to the pyrolytic decomposition that takes place within the collapsing bubbles free radicals such as oh radical and shock waves can be generated at the gas liquid interface 32 now mb have been applied in many fields of science and technology however studies on the combined use of ntp and mb are limited thus the main objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect arising from the dbd mb pms system on the degradation of gcs the prominent species responsible for gcs degradation were identified by scavenging experiments effects of experimental parameters including pms dosage and ph and influences of co existing ions as well as water matrices were also investigated we therefore anticipated that our findings would provide some theoretical and technical references for gcs control in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the target contaminants hydrocortisone hc betamethasone bt and fluocinolone acetonide fa purity 99 were purchased

apparatus the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the system consists of a high voltage power supply ctp 2000 k nanjing suman electronics china voltage regulator mb generator nano lf100 xingheng china and a novel self made dbd reactor the voltage regulator enabled the supply of alternating voltages ranging from 0 to 90 v the peak to peak voltage and current were measured using a 500 mhz digital oscilloscope tds 2012b tektronix usa detailed description of the dbd reactor is available in the text s2 a hydrodynamic cavitation apparatus was used to generate mb enriched water the mb rich water was pumped through the dbd reactor at a flow rate of 40 ml min throughout the treatment period creating a continuous flow system 2 3 experimental procedures batch experiments explored the influences of input power gas flow initial ph pms dosage non targeted ions and water matrices on the gcs degradation in the dbd mb and dbd mb pms systems each batch experiment involved a total volume of 300 ml the initial concentrations of gcs in ultrapure water were 20 mg l about 2 5 ml aliquot was sampled at fixed time intervals and filtered through millipore filters 0 45 μm for analysis the optimum gas intake capacity of the mb generator was 40 ml min but mb sizes could be regulated by changing the air pump pressure the relationship between the bubble size and air pressure is shown in fig s2 33 the control experiments of mb alone pms alone and dbd mb were conducted with the same experimental set up and conditions however for mb alone there was neither pms nor high voltage supply while for pms alone a beaker magnetic stirrer and a temperature regulated water bath heating system were used the discharge power was adjusted by changing the applied voltage voltages of 40 v 60 v 80 v and 90 v corresponding to discharge powers of 37 4 w 52 6 w 83 5 w and 87 5 w respectively were used the pms dose was set as oxidant pms to contaminant gc molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 and 30 1 this optimized the pms dosage for gcs degradation some of the main reactions in pms decomposition are as shown in eqs 2 9 2 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 oh s o 4 hs o 5 4 oh oh h 2 o 2 5 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h

and the evaluation of the effects of h2o2 o3 and uv were shown in text s3 s6 si 2 4 analytical methods analyses of energy efficiency and energy yield were done by measuring the discharge voltage and current a tektronix tds 2012b digital oscilloscope and tektronix p6015a voltage probe with an attenuation of 1000 1 were used to measure the current and voltage respectively of the discharge electrode in the dbd reactor a voltage probe with attenuation of 10 1 was used to measure the voltage of the ground electrode the discharge parameters and waveforms are shown in fig s3 the discharge power was calculated using the lissajous figure method as shown in eqs 10 and 11 25 34 10 i a c r d v r dt 11 p w 1 t 0 t pdt c r t 0 t v dv dt dt f c r s where i is the discharge current a cr is the capacitance f vr is the voltage across the capacitance cr p is the discharge power w f is the frequency hz and s is the area of the lissajous figure m2 obtained from the oscilloscope the energy efficiency ee was defined as the discharge power p used to degrade contaminants divided by the input power p0 which was calculated from the input current a0 and input voltage v0 as displayed on the high voltage power supply the calculation is as illustrated by eq 12 12 ee p p 0 100 the energy yield ey of the gcs degradation was defined as the mass of the contaminant removed per unit of electrical energy consumed as shown in eq 13 13 ey mg kw h c mg l v l re p kw t h 100 where c is the initial concentration of the target contaminant v is the solution volume re is the removal

wavelength detector was used to quantify gcs details are in text s7 properties of the water matrices were analysed and the results are provided in text s8 2 5 statistical analysis all the experiments were carried out in duplicate with the average data and standard deviation reported analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and synergistic effects of dbd mb pms 3 1 1 dbd alone mb alone and pms alone the degradation of gcs by dbd alone under the conditions of various discharge powers is shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa after 90 min treatment at 83 5 w were 49 54 and 60 respectively the gcs degradation all fitted pseudo first order kinetic the rate constants at various discharge powers and the corresponding r2 values 0 9 are shown in table s2 as depicted in fig 2 the removal efficiencies of gcs increased significantly with the increasing discharge power from 37 4 w to 83 5 w the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa rose from 21 k 0 17 h 1 to 49 k 0 44 h 1 from 19 k 0 14 h 1 to 54 k 0 54 h 1 and from 13 k 0 09 h 1 to 60 k 0 64 h 1 respectively the increase in dbd discharge power resulted in increased electric field intensity which in turn led to a higher electron density and higher amounts of free radicals 18 in addition the increased discharge power promoted dissociation ionization and excitation of gaseous molecules resulting in more generation of reactive species 36 uv intensity also increases with the increase in discharge power thus producing more oh 37 however as the discharge power further increased from 83 5 w to 87 5 w the removal efficiencies of gcs decreased on the contrary fig 2 this is because further increase in discharge power gave rise to growing energy waste in the form of heat which lowered the energy efficiency as a consequence table s3 the highest removal efficiencies and rate constants for three gcs were all obtained at the discharge power of 83 5 w fig 2 table s2 therefore 83 5 w was used as the optimal discharge power in the subsequent dbd based treatments the contribution of microbubbles to the degradation of gcs was investigated as mb alone at a gas flow of 40 ml min and pressure of 0 6 mpa mb alone can also degrade gcs however the removal efficiencies were low fig 2d the degradation ratios of hc bt and fa by mb alone after 90 min were only 19 21 and 25 respectively this is because the mb collapse could not lead to sufficient generation of oh 33 the limited gcs removal was largely attributed to the drastic elevated chemical potential caused by the instantaneous extinction of the gas water interface and the subsequent radical generation and dispersion 33 pms alone trials under various activation temperatures were also investigated to identify the effect of dbd in pms activation and their synergistic effect in accelerating gcs degradation the pms activation temperatures ranged from 40 c to 90 c and the ph values were adjusted to circumneutral as is shown in fig s4 there was only a slight increase in the removal efficiency as temperature increased meanwhile the gcs removal by heat activated pms was much lower than by dbd mb pms system for instance the 90 min degradation ratios of hc bt and fa by 90 c activated pms treatment were only 24 12 and 15 respectively in contrast with the values of 77 80 and 82 respectively in dbd mb pms system fig 4 this implies that dbd mb has a much higher efficiency in pms activation than heat yang et al 38 also observed that heat was less effective in pms activation than in persulfate ps activation hc responded relatively better to heat activated pms treatment compared to bt and fa this may be ascribed to the presence of cf bonds in bt and fa which makes the molecules more recalcitrant to ros attack 3 1 2 dbd mb the dbd mb treatment apart from the individual contribution of reactive species by the mb system also enhances the production of reactive species through dissolution of gas air 39 thus providing a synergistic effect for the contaminant degradation compared with mb alone the 90 min degradation ratios of hc bt and fa in dbd mb system increased by 29 33 and 34 respectively fig 3a as pointed out earlier during dbd treatment a host of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns fig s1 in combination with the physical effects such as uv heat and shockwaves are generated which are believed to be responsible for the degradation of contaminants the dbd mb combination can enhance the dissolution and mass transfer of plasma generated active species from the gas phase to liquid phase as mb collapses thus increasing the production of reactive radicals and promoting gcs degradation wu et al reported that the concentrations of chemical species in plasma activated microbubble water are twice to three times as high as in plasma activated water 40 to be noted hc degraded faster than bt and fa in heat activated pms treatment fig s4 however fa and bt had higher degradation rates than hc in the dbd mb system fig 3 therefore the overall degradation efficiency depends on the structure of the gcs as well as the treatments we conjectured that the more halogenated compound s attracted more of the reactive species which in this case was the aqueous electrons 41 generated in the dbd system hence fa with two fluorine substituents is more easily degraded furthermore fig 3 shows the time courses of hc bt and fa removal with the gas flow rate ranging from 10 ml min to 60 ml min while the discharge power was kept at 83 5 w the 90 min removal efficiencies for hc bt and fa increased by 2 82 2 84 and 2 95 fold respectively when the gas flow increased from 10 ml min to 40 ml min this result further confirms the enhanced gas liquid mass transfer in the presence of more microbubbles 39 however a further increase in the gas flow rate from 40 ml min to 60 ml min on the contrary resulted in a decline in the gcs degradation efficiencies this could be ascribed to the increase in mb size according to henry s law at a certain pressure the amount of dissolved gas in water is constant at a gas flow rate of 40 ml min the gas in the solution is saturated and a further increase only increases the bubble size rather than the bubbles quantity the increase in bubble size decreases the specific interfacial area and inner pressure of the mb 42 thus decreasing the concentrations of reactive species therefore gas flow rates higher than 40 ml min conversely decreased the amount of active species which in turn decreased the gcs removal efficiencies based on the observations herein the optimal gas flow rate for the dbd mb system in the present study was 40 ml min which was used in the subsequent mb involved experiments 3 1 3 dbd mb pms the time profiles of the gcs degradation were monitored in the dbd mb system in the presence of pms as is shown in fig 4 the integrated system of dbd mb pms showed a remarkable synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs the overall removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa under the dbd mb pms system after 90 min were 77 80 and 82 respectively which were 1 60 1 48 and 1 39 fold respectively higher than the dbd mb system these results imply that pms can be effectively activated by the plasma irradiation with the potential generation of highly reactive species such as so4 and oh 43 the bimolecular reaction rate constants of these radicals with most organic compounds are in the range of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 44 a detailed discussion on mechanism is available in section 3 3 3 2 effects of operational conditions in dbd mb pms system 3 2 1 pms dose the effects of initial pms concentration on the removal of gcs were studied at an initial ph value of 7 and gc concentration of 20 mg l the gas flow rate was 40 ml min while the discharge power was 83 5 w different concentrations of pms measured as pms to gc molar ratios of 10 1 20 1 and 30 1 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 5 the gcs removal efficiencies increased with the increase in the initial pms concentration without pms the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa were 49 54 and 60 respectively while the values increased to 70 64 and 66 respectively with 10 1 pms gcs as the pms gc molar ratio increased to 20 1 the observed 90 min removal efficiencies for hc bt and fa increased to 77 80 and 82 respectively the reason is in that more s o 4 and oh radicals eq 14 can be produced at higher pms dose thus favoring the degradation of gcs 45 46 however a further increase in pms gc molar ratio to 30 1 led to a decline in the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa by 19 12 and 9 respectively fig 5 this is because excess pms resulted in secondary reactions in which pms scavenges the reactive radicals as shown in eqs 15 16 47 thus decreasing the overall removal efficiencies of gcs the scavenging effect of pms on so4 and oh radicals led to the formation of peroxomonosufate radical s o 5 which is a much weaker oxidant this phenomenon which is akin to the h2o2 involved aops was also observed in other pms based aops 48 50 in addition excess s o 4 and s o 5 would also undergo self scavenging as is shown in eqs 17 18 51 thus reducing the amount of reactive species in the present study 20 1 was the optimal pms gcs molar ratio for the degradation of gcs which was used in the subsequent experiments 14 hs o 5 s o 4 oh 15 s o 4 hs o 5 s o 5 s o 4 2 h 16 oh hs o 5 s o 5 h 2 o 17 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 18 s o 5 s o 5 s 2 o 8 2 o 2 3 2 2 ph ph is one of the most important factors that affect the degradation of pollutants and also affects the activation of oxidants and the generation of free radicals in this study the effect of the initial solution ph on the degradation of gcs was examined in the ph range of 3 to 9 with the pms to gcs molar ratio of 20 1 gas flow rate of 40 ml min and discharge power of 83 5 w as shown in fig 6 the 90 min removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa at unadjusted initial ph of 3 were 54 63 and 61 respectively no significant enhancement was observed in dbd mb pms system compared with dbd mb system at ph 3 this result means that at lower ph values the enhancement effect of pms was negligible a plausible reason is the scavenging effect of h on so4 and oh at low ph ph 5 according to eqs 19 20 48 19 oh h e h 2 o 20 s o 4 h e hs o 4 in addition guan et al 51 indicated that the apparent molar absorption coefficient of pms at λ 254 nm increased significantly with the increase of ph which enhanced pms activation and in turn the generation of so4 and oh 52 consequently a remarkable increase in gcs removal efficiencies was observed as the initial ph increased from 3 to 9 fig 6a b and c however it could be observed that the degradation rate of fa slightly decreased at ph 9 compared with ph 7 this is possibly ascribed to the fact that s o 4 radicals which have high reactivity towards halogenated compounds are converted to nonselective oh under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 53 considering that satisfactory efficiencies can be obtained at neutral ph conditions and that the ph for actual wastewaters are circumneutral neutral ph was used in the experiments 3 3 mechanism analysis 3 3 1 reactive species in order to clarify the role of various reactive species involved in the gcs degradation scavenging experiments were conducted in the dbd mb treatment addition of t buoh a typical scavenger of oh with the reaction rate constant of 3 8 108 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constant of t buoh with so4 is only 4 0 105 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 showed an obvious inhibition in gcs removal as shown in fig 7 for instance the 90 min removal efficiency of hc decreased from 49 to 27 18 and 11 respectively upon the addition of 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm t buoh fig 7a similarly the removal efficiencies also decreased obviously for bt and fa fig 7b c these results indicate that oh is the dominant reactive species for gcs degradation in the dbd mb system however addition of t buoh to the dbd mb pms system did not result in such remarkable inhibitory effect fig s5 for instance in the presence of 10 mm t buoh the 90 min degradation efficiencies of hc bt and fa just dropped from 77 80 and 82 to 54 57 and 60 respectively these results thereby imply the existence of other active species in the dbd mb pms system to verify this speculation etoh a scavenger of both oh and so4 with their respective reaction rate constants of 1 2 109 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 6 107 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 was added to the dbd mb pms system and significant inhibitory effects in gcs degradation were observed fig 7 the 90 min degradation ratio of hc decreased from 77 to 21 18 and 15 respectively with the addition of 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm etoh fig 7d the 90 min degradation ratio of bt also decreased from 80 to 15 13 and 10 respectively fig 7e and for fa the value decreased from 82 to 19 16 and 11 respectively fig 7f therefore we can conclude from the above observations that both oh and so4 played important roles in gcs degradation in the dbd mb pms system based on the results of the scavenging experiments with 10 mm t buoh and 10 mm etoh we calculated the contributions of oh and so4 for gcs degradation according to previous literatures 54 55 the contributions of oh were roughly estimated to be 30 29 and 27 respectively for hc bt and fa degradation and the contributions of so4 were 51 59 and 60 respectively the remaining efficiency may be ascribed to other reactive species and or physico chemical effects generated in the dbd process 56 therefore in order to evaluate the effects of other species separate experiments with o3 h2o2 or uv alone were carried out the detailed experimental procedures are shown in text s6 in the si the results are shown in fig s6 o3 h2o2 and uv all had certain effects in degrading gcs and their efficiencies differed for different gc the sum efficiency of o3 h2o2 and uv for hc degradation seems higher than those for bt and fa this is in accordance with the results of oh and so4 contribution that oh and so4 contributed more in bt and fa degradation however to be noted due to the complex chain reactions and interactions between various reactive species and physico chemical effects it is rather difficult to quantify all the contributors and precisely calculate their contributions the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 and the uv intensity we used in the separate experiments were much higher than those generated in the actual dbd system 57 58 therefore the contributions of oh and s o 4 we calculated in the present study are roughly estimated values based on the results of the scavenging experiments anyhow in comparison with the dominance of oh in the dbd mb treatment the combined effect of oh and s o 4 was confirmed in the dbd mb pms treatment 3 3 2 synergistic mechanism of dbd mb and pms in order to clearly manifest the effect of dbd mb pms system we compared the gcs degradation efficiencies and rates under different systems pms alone mb alone dbd alone and dbd mb pms as is shown in fig s7 the combination of dbd mb and pms brought about a significant synergistic effect on degradation of gcs for instance the 90 min degradation efficiencies of gcs were remarkably increased in the dbd mb pms system compared with the pms alone mb alone and dbd alone systems the enhancement effect of dbd mb pms system was more obvious with regard to the gcs degradation rates the k values of gcs degradation obtained in the dbd mb pms system 0 91 h 1 0 96 h 1 and 0 96 h 1 respectively for hc bt and fa were even higher than the sum of those obtained in the pms alone mb alone and dbd alone systems 0 63 h 1 0 76 h 1 and 0 87 h 1 respectively for hc bt and fa additionally by incorporating mb and pms into the dbd system the energy yields for hc bt and fa degradation also increased obviously from 23 3 26 0 and 28 7 mg kwh respectively to 36 9 37 6 and 39 3 mg kwh the synergistic effect of dbd mb pms system can be largely attributed to the strong interactions between dbd mb and pms for instance dbd generates a number of reactive species upon the dissociation of gas molecules and formation of high energy electrons while by combining dbd and mb plasma can be ignited inside the mb where the electron avalanche breakdown occurs with short lived species generated and sustained until the mb collapse 34 mb on the other hand improve the mass transfer efficiency for the reactive species from the gas phase to the liquid phase and thus enhance the removal of organic pollutants 29 31 pms in the presence of activators such as heat uv plasma electrons etc dissociates and generates oh and so4 which have high reactivity towards gcs these activators are the typical reactive species and physico chemical effects produced in the plasma system therefore dbd can be a highly efficient approach for pms activation furthermore the products of pms dissociation i e oh and so4 can also be involved in the chain reactions to enhance the production of other radicals eqs 21 23 in conclusion the enhancement effect of dbd md pms system was evident in the overall removal efficiencies of gcs affirming the synergy that existed among dbd mb and pms 21 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 22 so4 h2o2 so4 2 ho2 23 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 3 4 dbd mb pms application in actual water matrices 3 4 1 effect of co existing ions in actual water matrices coexists a number of inorganic ions usually in concentrations ranging from 0 05 mm to 5 mm 59 in this study the effects of so4 2 cl and hc o 3 on the degradation of gcs were investigated as shown in fig 8 these ions inhibited gc removal during the dbd mb pms treatment this decrease was mainly due to competition between the ions and the target gcs for the reactive species namely so4 and oh 28 for instance hc o 3 ions react with so4 and oh as shown in eqs 24 25 respectively which in turn reduces the amount of the reactive species available for the target gcs as for the cl ion although cl can activate pms 38 it seems not able to offset the adverse effect of the competing reactions between cl and gcs for the active species this is because so4 and oh can be scavenged by cl to generate a suite of reactive chlorine species such as cl2 ocl2 cl2 hocl etc as shown in eqs 26 27 however these chlorine species are more selective than so4 and ho that they only have a relatively high susceptibility of electron rich structure 60 yin et al indicated that the reactive chlorine species had small contributions for prednisolone degradation in the uv chlorine process 61 therefore cl exhibited a net inhibitory effect on gcs degradation in the present study 24 hc o 3 s o 4 c o 3 s o 4 2 h k 3 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 hc o 3 oh h 2 o c o 3 k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 26 cl s o 4 cl s o 4 2 k 2 6 108 m 1 s 1 27 cl oh cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 4 2 water matrices the effectiveness of dbd mb pms in the treatment of gcs in actual water matrices was assessed as shown in fig 9a the 90 min removal efficiencies for hc in surface water tap water secondary effluent and ground water were 63 61 53 and 50 respectively which decreased by 14 16 24 and 27 respectively compared to that in ultrapure water similarly the removal efficiencies for bt decreased by 21 25 30 and 35 respectively fig 9b and those for fa decreased by 27 31 35 and 49 respectively fig 9c the decrease in gcs removal efficiencies corresponded with the order of increase in conductivities which was ultrapure water surface water tap water secondary effluent ground water table s1 as discussed in section 3 4 1 the coexisting ions imposed high inhibition primarily via lowering the amount of reactive species available for the reactions with target gcs especially for the secondary effluent and ground waters which have high concentrations of ions table s1 obvious negative influences were observed nonetheless the gcs removal efficiencies were around 50 in most actual water matrices implying that the dbd mb pms is a feasible technique for the practical remediation of gcs contaminated waters 3 4 3 energy consumption of dbd mb pms system the energy yields ey of gcs removal by the dbd mb pms treatment were calculated and shown in table s3 the ey values for hc bt and fa degradation were 36 9 37 6 and 39 3 mg kwh respectively in the dbd mb pms treatment at the discharge power of 83 5 w while the values were only 23 0 25 9 and 28 3 mg kwh respectively in the dbd mb system these results indicate that coupling dbd mb process with pms not only enhanced gcs degradation fig 4 but also greatly increased the energy yield in addition the ey obtained in the dbd mb pms system were also higher than those reported in the dbd system 6 mg kwh and in the dbd cao2 system 7 5 mg kwh table s3 therefore the combination of dbd mb and pms resulted in a potent synergistic effect on the degradation of gcs according to the ey values the energy consumption of dbd mb pms treatment was calculated and compared with other treatment processes as is shown in table s5 dbd mb pms has a higher gc degradation efficiency than photolysis photocatalysis photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical oxidation meanwhile its energy consumption is much lower than that of the photocatalytic process and that of the photocatalytic oxidation process miklos et al indicated that plasma has a median energy consumption which is lower than uv based photocatalysis ultrasound and microwave based aops but higher than o3 o3 uv uv persulfate and uv chlorine 16 blossom et al found that plasma presented potential advantages on perfluoroalkyl substances removal due to its relatively low energy demand compared with other aops such as sonolysis photochemical oxidation and electrochemical oxidation 62 therefore plasma treatment can provide attractive solutions for specific challenges 4 conclusion degradation of glucocorticoids gcs in water was studied using a self made dbd reactor integrated with mb and pms dbd mb pms influential factors including discharge power gas flow rate initial ph pms dosage and water matrices were evaluated at neutral ph ambient temperature and 83 5 w discharge power and with 40 ml min microbubbles and 1 0 mm pms the overall removal efficiencies of hc bt and fa after 90 min could reach 77 80 and 82 respectively with the corresponding pseudo first order rate constants of 0 91 h 1 0 96 h 1 and 0 96 h 1 respectively compared with the dbd alone mb alone pms alone heat activated pms at 90 c and dbd mb systems a significant synergistic effect on gcs degradation was observed in the dbd mb pms system mb enhances mass transfer

13489,in this work a new methodology has been developed for the elimination of cobalt nickel and a mixture of both metals from synthetic wastewater in a continuous way this methodology consists of the electrochemical formation of ferrites of these metals through the oxidation of iron sheets and the reduction of water two critical process parameters current densities and initial pollutant concentration were analysed an initial batch prototype resulted in efficiencies on the order of 98 under conditions of applied densities of 50 ma cm2 and concentrations of both metals of until 100 ppm of the ions the obtained particles have been characterized by x ray diffraction to determine the formation of ferrites without the appearance of secondary phases the formed particle sizes are approximately 30 nm with hemispherical or flower like shapes a flow system prototype was designed for the recirculation of the solution with 100 ppm of both contaminating metals obtaining approximately 90 recovery with an easy magnetic harvesting keywords cobalt nickel wastewater removal environmental remediation pollutant 1 introduction heavy metals are a serious problem when dissolved in wastewater and have been the subject of research for decades cobalt and nickel in water are usually at low concentrations in ranges of 0 1 5 μg l and 5 10 μg l respectively however the concentration can be hundreds or thousands of times higher in areas with minerals or near mines or smelters to reduce the toxicity associated with such metals it is desirable to treat industrial effluents to decrease co ii and ni ii concentrations and decrease them to within permissible limits before being discharged into water bodies there are many techniques to eliminate or reduce the amount of these metals in water chemical precipitation 1 ion exchange 2 3 and adsorption 4 7 are the most commonly used techniques in practical applications for wastewater treatment one of the chemical methods used is the precipitation of ferrites of these metals 8 9 the procedure is simple and based on the addition of a fe3 salt and basic medium to water contaminated with metal ions allowing the formation of metal ferrite the reactions that occur are shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 m 2 2 fe 3 8 oh m oh 2 2 fe oh 3 2 m oh 2 2 fe oh 3 aeration mfe 2 o 4 4 h 2 o in general this methodology has been utilized for high concentrations of metal ions as a result the ferrites produced by this methodology contain impurities and there is no control of the obtained material properties a similar process can be produced using an electrochemical methodology c huang et al 10 explored this process to remove co2 ions from simulated liquid radioactive waste in a nuclear power plant the method consisted of the oxidation of an iron sheet producing fe3 ions in the medium and a cathode of iron where the generation of oh was produced by water reduction the overall reaction is essentially the same as in the previous method but the production of fe3 and oh ions is controlled by the current applied to the electrodes in addition to the current the electrochemical method makes it possible to eliminate smaller amounts of ions from the medium and it is possible to generate ferrites with tunable properties metal extraction by electrochemical method is considered a green and safe production strategy to reduce the environmental charge compared to traditional methods 11 ferrites find applications in many fields they are used in biomedicine in magnetic resonance imaging 12 drug delivery 13 hyperthermia 14 or sensors 15 16 however their applications in wastewater treatment can be extended to photodegradation and heterogeneous fenton like degradation of dyes pesticides and pharmaceuticals 17 18 adsorption removal of inorganic contaminant such as as cd co cr pb uo2 2 among others 19 21 and pathogen disinfection 22 23 the properties of ferrites depend on their composition cation substitution preparation technique and cation distribution in the spinel structure 24 25 in general methods such as coprecipitation hydrothermal methods sol gel etc have been employed to synthesize ferrites of desired composition and structure the methodology used here has two advantages contamination elimination from the medium and ferrites production of different compositions and morphologies and therefore different properties in this work we explored the formation of nickel cobalt and nickel cobalt ferrites by in situ electrochemical synthesis employing different amounts of pollutants and analysing the amount of metal eliminated from the media in addition the ferrites obtained have been structurally and magnetically characterized using different techniques to scale up this methodology a flow cell was used for the elimination of the metal and formed ferrites 26 2 experimental 2 1 materials cobalt chloride cocl2 6h2o and nickel chloride nicl2 6h2o both with purity 99 5 were supplied by sigma aldrich chemical co germany sodium chloride nacl 99 5 was purchased from merck kgaa germany the iron sheets purity 99 9 used as electrodes in the batch and the low carbon still sheets 99 8 wt iron purity used as electrodes in the flow reactor were supplied by goodfellow inc united kingdom 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 batch pollutant removal simulated wastewater solutions with cobalt and nickel ii ions at different concentrations were prepared by dilution of a 1000 ppm concentrated stock solution a supporting electrolyte of 40 mm nacl was used to increase the ionic strength of the solution a cylindrical cathode of iron 120 cm2 was used allocating inside an anode of 2 cm2 of iron foil a magnetic stirrer was placed inside the batch cell the temperature was maintained at 25 c using an amel electrochemistry galvanostat model 549 italy a constant current was applied to the electrodes for 30 min the iron anode was oxidized producing iron ions and while in the cathode the water was reduced to hydroxyl ions therefore in the solution cobalt nickel iron and hydroxyl ions reacted and formed fe y 2 m x 2 fe 3 x y 3 o 4 after this time the solution was placed over a magnet to collect the product which was thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried in vacuum the supernatants were analysed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes to obtain the removal rate the effectiveness in removing these metals was evaluated using different concentrations of metallic ions co2 ni2 and a mixture of co2 ni2 in a concentration range of 50 400 ppm furthermore the influence of the current density applied on the removal efficiency was studied 2 2 2 flow reactor in this reactor 8 plates 100 mm 45 mm were used as electrodes and were machined out of low carbon steel sheets of 1 mm thickness and 99 8 wt iron purity and arranged in a parallel monopolar configuration a small 5 mm section protruded from the edge of each of the electrodes to use as an electrical connection and a 10 mm separation was kept between electrodes in all chambers two litre solutions of 100 ppm m2 and 40 mm nacl were used as simulated pollutant solutions the cell s total volume was 460 ml direct current of 0 7 a was supplied using a dosban industrial afx3333c dc spain power supply and a multimeter connected in series to confirm the total current value the solution continuously flowed using a heidolph pumpdrive 5201 germany peristaltic pump operating at 30 ml min 26 aliquots of the supernatant were analysed with an optima 2100 dv perkinelmer icp oes equipment the magnetically collected sample at the end of the experiment was washed several times with distilled water and the co and ni content were measured by icp oes a scheme of the process is shown in fig 1 2 3 characterization techniques transmission electron microscopy tem samples were prepared by dispersing a minimal amount of nanoparticles 1 mg in an aqueous solution placing a single drop onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film and letting it dry the tem analysis was then carried out in a jeol jem 1010 operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kv stem haadf scanning transmission imaging with a high angle annular dark field detector results were obtained using a tecnai f30 fei electron microscope operated at 300 kv chemical analysis of the nanoparticles was performed by energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx phase identification and crystal structure of the magnetic materials were analysed by x ray diffraction xrd performed in a philips x pert pro theta theta diffractometer cukα radiation λ 1 5406 å with a secondary graphite monochromator that discriminates the fluorescence the patterns were collected within 10 and 80 in 2θ with an angular increment of 0 04 and incremental time of 4 s the field dependent magnetization curves were measured at room temperature by applying a maximum magnetic field of 5 t on dried powder samples using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm mlvsm9 maglab 9 t oxford instrument from the magnetization curves the saturation magnetization ms the remanence mr and the coercivity hc were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments 3 1 1 pollutant concentration and current density effect fig 2a depicts the ni and co removal efficiency determined from the icp oes quantification of the remaining metal ion concentration in the supernatant after 30 min of the experiment a clear tendency is observed when the initial concentration increases the efficiency decreases for both pollutants for an initial concentration of 50 ppm the elimination of co and ni ions is close to 100 with values of 98 and 95 respectively when the concentration increases the removal efficiency of co ions drastically decreases to 78 when the initial concentration is 200 ppm nevertheless in the case of ni ions this decrease does not occur maintaining a stable efficiency value of approximately 95 over the entire range of studied concentrations this behaviour can be explained by the smaller atomic ratio of ni ions compared to cobalt ions the magnetic recovery of the resulting samples represents an important advantage of the methodology nevertheless when working in the presence of 200 ppm pollutant either nickel or cobalt the magnetic recovery of the obtained product is slow to understand this phenomenon tem analysis of these samples was performed observing that in these two cases we obtained laminar structures typical of oxyhydroxides such as lepidocrocite ϒ feooh fig 2b and c to recover as much pollutant as possible and produce ferrites with good magnetic properties the current density was doubled from 50 ma cm2 to 100 ma cm2 starting at 200 ppm a significant increase mainly in cobalt recovery was observed under such conditions fig 2a stars in contrast the nickel improvement removal efficiency was smaller under these conditions the current density increase favoured the oxidation rate of the iron foil and the delivery of fe ions throughout the solution for that reason the formation of a ferrite structure is favoured the tem images of the obtained ferrites showed polydisperse nanoparticles with quasi spherical shapes with an average size of 30 8 nm for the cobalt sample and 26 9 for the nickel sample fig 2d and e these samples were easily removed with a magnet although an increase in the current density showed a marked improvement in the recovery efficiency and promotes the formation of mixed ferrites nanoparticles it is a limiting parameter because a high current density can cause rapid degradation of the iron electrode and the appearance of metallic iron in the ferrite structure or solution the compounds obtained under 100 ppm and a 50 ma cm2 current density showed a typical spinel crystal structure whose reflections can be attributed to the fd 3m 227 space group fig 3a the nanoparticles obtained showed flower like shapes with average nanoparticle sizes of 30 10 nm and 27 7 nm for cobalt ferrite and nickel ferrite respectively fig 3b c d the two samples described above obtained under optimal conditions had enough strong magnetic properties to be recovered by a magnet to confirm this behaviour the hysteresis cycles were measured at room temperature fig 4 the collected magnetic parameters are summarized in table 1 the presence of cobalt atoms in the spinel structure results in the aperture of the hysteresis cycle with a coercivity hc of 225 oe on the other hand nickel ferrite results in a narrower cycle indicating that the material is magnetically softer with a coercivity equal to 59 oe at room temperature the remanences of the cobalt and nickel samples were 12 emu g and 6 emu g respectively the higher remanence agrees with cobalt ferrite formation given that for similar sizes iron oxide and nickel ferrite usually presents lower remanence values the cobalt nickel and iron contents in the two ferrites were quantified by icp oes to estimate the stoichiometry of the compounds formed the following values were obtained co0 20fe2 80o4 and ni0 44fe2 56o4 the mr ms squareness ratio showed in table 1 for cobalt ferrite sample agrees with some values reported for cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with same stoichiometry and similar sizes 27 in addition the ms is lower than the bulk value and close to other values reported with the same inversion degree and similar sizes 27 the higher ni concentration in the nickel sample in comparison with the cobalt sample was consistent with the higher removal percentage obtained with ni pollutant fig 2a the icp oes analysis provided useful evidence about the presence of cations in the bulk material however it did not provide information about the location of the different atoms in the particles to analyse this stem haadf coupled with edx was used to measure the presence of co ni and fe along the isolated particles fig 5 results indicated a homogenous distribution of the ni and co within the particles also all the particles tested showed the presence of fe o and the corresponding metal discarding the formation of other type of compositions being formed 3 1 2 temperature effect in the removal efficiency another key factor which affects the oxidation rate of the iron foil and the removal efficiency is the temperature of the solution higher temperatures imply higher oxidation rates and a greater concentration of fe to be recombined with co or ni ions to form the ferrite samples preliminary results shown that if the temperature is increased from 25 c up to 60 c for the conditions 200co i50 the percentage removal increased from 78 up to 89 the xrd pattern and the tem micrography are represented in fig 6 xrd analysis reveals a cleaner pattern compared with the 25 c sample fig 6a with the main presence of cubic reflexions attributed to ferrite sample but also an important presence of cubic iron phase space group im 3m 229 jcpds 01 087 0721 formed either by the degradation of the iron foil or by the reduction of iron ions in cathode by the temperature effect in contrast the xrd obtained for the sample of the experience conducted at 25 c shown the presence of iron oxyhydroxides jcpds 01 070 0713 but also the presence of cobalt ferrite in low percentage is not discarded the nps formed at 60 c are bigger with a mean diameter of 38 10 nm 3 1 3 batch experiment in mixed pollutant solution after testing the recovery efficiencies of both co and ni elements individually the following stage consisted of putting both ions into the same vessel and evaluating the effectiveness of the process here the current density and temperature were fixed at 50 ma cm2 and 25 c respectively to compare with the results obtained above and avoid the degradation of iron metal the total pollutant concentrations were 100 200 and 400 ppm divided between co and ni at 50 each for comparison the removal efficiency obtained starting with 100 and 200 ppm of only co and ni is also represented in fig 7 if 100 ppm contaminant was used in the solution namely 50 ppm ni and 50 ppm cobalt the recoveries of both were favoured being 93 and 91 respectively fig 7 in contrast in fig 2a we showed a slightly lower recovery when the contaminant was exclusively 100 ppm co or ni with values of 88 and 92 respectively the same trend was observed with 100 ppm ni 100 ppm co in this case the improvement in cobalt removal efficiency reached 87 78 starting with 200 ppm cobalt while the removal efficiency of ni slightly decreased up to 89 93 starting with 200 ppm nickel the combination of both pollutants seems to improve the total pollutant weight recovered this finding was previously reported with an adsorbent prepared from an electronic waste based material 28 and sodium activated bentonite 29 where the adsorption of co and ni in a binary wastewater metal system is enhanced in comparison with the single metal system it is important to highlight that the material formed with the mixture of both pollutants up to 200 ppm in total results in the formation of almost spherical nanoparticles fig 8a with an average size of 26 9 nm this result was not observed in fig 2b and c when 200 ppm was composed exclusively of either nickel or cobalt the xrd presented also in fig 6 reveals a mixture of different phases for co200 i50 sample this behaviour was also observed for ni200 i50 sample data not shown in contrast in the sample containing both pollutants 100co 100ni i50 the diffractogram showed a purely spinel type structure typical of ferrites and no traces of other iron oxide phases fig 8b the room temperature hysteresis loops confirmed the presence of cobalt within the structure and the magnetic coercivity was approximately 381 oe fig 8c higher than the hc obtained in the cobalt compound 100co i50 fig 4 which was 225 oe at room temperature table 1 this evidence confirmed the presence of cobalt within the structure which was also corroborated by icp oes analysis of the powder the stoichiometric formula obtained was co0 32ni0 25fe2 43o4 the higher cobalt content observed in the icp oes analysis agreed with the higher removal percentage observed when working with the pollutant mixture and with greater values of hc of this sample in comparison with the cobalt ferrite sample 100co i50 a lower content of nickel within the structure was observed which agrees with the decrease in percentage efficiency in comparison with the experiment using only 100 ppm of nickel if we increased the pollutant concentration up to 400 ppm both ions were at a concentration of 200 ppm there was a sharp decrease in efficiency and the compound formed had a non nanoparticulate morphology but in the form of needles images are not shown slightly magnetic material was obtained in this sense the reason for this reduced elimination might be the poor iron ions concentration released into the solution in comparison with the co and ni content in this regard an increment of current density applied to the iron foil promotes an increase in the concentration of released ions and an improved removal percentage as demonstrated in fig 2a when increasing the current density from 50 ma cm2 to 100 macm2 resulted in a significant increase in the of cobalt removed considering these results there was a limitation in the maximum concentration that could be removed with this methodology and with the current density applied an aqueous simulated pollutant solution with 100 ppm co and ni seemed to be the upper limit because under such conditions the formed nanoparticles had enough strong magnetic properties to be recovered with a magnet they had a crystalized structure and in addition the removal efficiency was approximately 90 for both pollutants these results indicate that we have found an easy methodology to remove cobalt ions nickel ions and a mixture of both producing materials with good properties and suitability for use in different applications including fenton degradation process 30 31 and adsorption pollutant removal 32 33 to go one step further the electrochemical module was modified to perform contaminant removal in a continuous way 3 2 flow reactor cell using the flow reactor in fig 1 we tested the removal of pollutants using concentrations of co and ni ions of 100 ppm each in a 2 l vessel applying a current of 0 7 a over 1 h the removal efficiency through this process was approximately 91 and 96 for cobalt and nickel respectively the obtained nanoparticles presented a ferrite structure with no additional phases and only those peaks corresponding to a spinel with cobalt and nickel atoms substituting fe2 atoms in the magnetite structure were found in the xrd diffractogram fig 9a the formula of the material obtained was co0 46ni0 43fe2 1o4 the particles presented a spherical morphology with a diameter size of approximately 25 nm and a standard deviation of 10 nm fig 9b by using this continuous flow system it was possible to remove both ions from 2 l of pollutant solution with good removal efficiency and perform the process in a continuous way this continuous procedure significantly improved the removal of heavy metals opening the way for further studies 4 conclusions this work proposes a new methodology for the recovery of cobalt and nickel ions independently or in the same solution together with the formation of cobalt and nickel or mixed ferrites whose morphological structural and magnetic characteristics may vary with experimental conditions when ion recovery is carried out at current densities of 50 ma cm2 the recovery efficiency is close to 100 for concentrations less than 100 ppm and the particles obtained are quasi spherical with sizes on the order of 27 nm with properties of a ferromagnetic material increasing the concentration to 200 ppm showed a clear decrease in recovery efficiency increasing the current density to 100 ma cm2 or the temperature up to 60 c produces the appearance of metallic iron in the obtained material but also increased the removal efficiencies therefore we can conclude that under the experimental conditions of this work total recovery is not possible for ion concentrations greater than 100 ppm the most important conclusion of this work is the possibility of recovering high amounts of cobalt and nickel ions in a continuous flow cell which allows recovery in much larger volumes of contaminants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

to 78 when the initial concentration is 200 ppm nevertheless in the case of ni ions this decrease does not occur maintaining a stable efficiency value of approximately 95 over the entire range of

with some values reported for cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with same stoichiometry and similar sizes 27 in addition the ms is lower than the bulk value and close to other values reported with the same inversion degree and similar sizes 27 the higher ni concentration in the nickel sample in comparison with the cobalt sample was consistent with the higher removal percentage obtained with ni pollutant fig 2a the icp oes analysis provided useful evidence about the presence of cations in the bulk material however it did not provide information about the location of the different atoms in the particles to analyse this stem haadf coupled with edx was used to measure the presence of co ni and fe along the isolated particles fig 5 results indicated a homogenous distribution of the ni and co within the particles also all the particles tested showed the presence of fe o and the corresponding metal discarding the formation of other type of compositions being formed 3 1 2 temperature effect in the removal efficiency another key factor which affects the oxidation rate of the iron foil and the removal efficiency is the temperature of the solution higher temperatures imply higher oxidation rates and a greater concentration of fe to be recombined with co or ni ions to form the ferrite samples preliminary results shown that if the temperature is increased from 25 c up to 60 c for the conditions 200co i50 the percentage removal increased from 78 up to 89 the xrd pattern and the tem micrography are represented in fig 6 xrd analysis reveals a cleaner pattern compared with the 25 c sample fig 6a with the main presence of cubic reflexions attributed to ferrite sample but also an important presence of cubic iron phase space group im 3m 229 jcpds 01 087 0721 formed either by the degradation of the iron foil or by the reduction of iron ions in cathode by the temperature effect in contrast the xrd obtained for the sample of the experience conducted at 25 c shown the presence of iron oxyhydroxides jcpds 01 070 0713 but also the presence of cobalt ferrite in low percentage is not discarded the nps formed at 60 c are bigger with a mean diameter of 38 10 nm 3 1 3 batch experiment in mixed pollutant solution after testing the recovery efficiencies of both co and ni elements individually the following stage consisted of putting both ions into the same vessel and evaluating the effectiveness of the process here the current density and temperature were fixed at 50 ma cm2 and 25 c respectively to compare with the results obtained above and avoid the degradation of iron metal the total pollutant concentrations were 100 200 and 400 ppm divided between co and ni at 50 each for comparison the removal efficiency obtained starting with 100 and 200 ppm of only co and ni is also represented in fig 7 if 100 ppm contaminant was used in the solution namely 50 ppm ni and 50 ppm cobalt the recoveries of both were favoured being 93 and 91 respectively fig 7 in contrast in fig 2a we showed a slightly lower recovery when the contaminant was exclusively 100 ppm co or ni with values of 88 and 92 respectively the same trend was observed with 100 ppm ni 100 ppm co in this case the improvement in cobalt removal efficiency reached 87 78 starting with 200 ppm cobalt while the removal efficiency of ni slightly decreased up to 89 93 starting with 200 ppm nickel the combination of both pollutants seems to improve the total pollutant weight recovered this finding was previously reported with an adsorbent prepared from an electronic waste based material 28 and sodium activated bentonite 29 where the adsorption of co and ni in a binary wastewater metal system is enhanced in comparison with the single metal system it is important to highlight that the material formed with the mixture of both pollutants up to 200 ppm in total results in the formation of almost spherical nanoparticles fig 8a with an average size of 26 9 nm this result was not observed in fig 2b and c when 200 ppm was composed exclusively of either nickel or cobalt the xrd presented also in fig 6 reveals a mixture of different phases for co200 i50 sample this behaviour was also observed for ni200 i50 sample data not shown in contrast in the sample containing both pollutants 100co 100ni i50 the diffractogram showed a purely spinel type structure typical of ferrites and no traces of other iron oxide phases fig 8b the room temperature hysteresis loops confirmed the presence of cobalt within the structure and the magnetic coercivity was approximately 381 oe fig 8c higher than the hc obtained in the cobalt compound 100co i50 fig 4 which was 225 oe at room temperature table 1 this evidence confirmed the presence of cobalt within the structure which was also corroborated by icp oes analysis of the powder the stoichiometric formula obtained was co0 32ni0 25fe2 43o4 the higher cobalt content observed in the icp oes analysis agreed with the higher removal percentage observed when working with the pollutant mixture and with greater values of hc of this sample in comparison with the cobalt ferrite sample 100co i50 a lower content of nickel within the structure was observed which agrees with the decrease in percentage efficiency in comparison with the experiment using only 100 ppm of nickel if we increased the pollutant concentration up to 400 ppm both ions were at a concentration of 200 ppm there was a sharp decrease in efficiency and the compound formed had a non nanoparticulate morphology but in the form of needles images are not shown slightly magnetic material was obtained in this sense the reason for this reduced elimination might be the poor iron ions concentration released into the solution in comparison with the co and ni content in this regard an increment of current density applied to the iron foil promotes an increase in the concentration of released ions and an improved removal percentage as demonstrated in fig 2a when increasing the current density from 50 ma cm2 to 100 macm2 resulted in a significant increase in the of cobalt removed considering these results there was a limitation in the maximum concentration that could be removed with this methodology and with the current density applied an aqueous simulated pollutant solution with 100 ppm co and ni seemed to be the upper limit because under such conditions the formed nanoparticles had enough strong magnetic properties to be recovered with a magnet they had a crystalized structure and in addition the removal efficiency was approximately 90 for both pollutants these results indicate that we have found an easy methodology to remove cobalt ions nickel ions and a mixture of both producing materials with good properties and suitability for use in different applications including fenton degradation process 30 31 and adsorption pollutant removal 32 33 to go one step further the electrochemical module was modified to perform contaminant removal in a continuous way 3 2 flow reactor cell using the flow reactor in fig 1 we tested the removal of pollutants using concentrations of co and ni ions of 100 ppm each in a 2 l vessel applying a current of 0 7 a over 1 h the removal efficiency through this process was approximately 91 and 96 for cobalt and nickel respectively the obtained nanoparticles presented a ferrite structure with no additional phases and only those peaks corresponding to a spinel with cobalt and nickel atoms substituting fe2 atoms in the magnetite structure were found in the xrd diffractogram fig 9a the formula of the material obtained was co0 46ni0 43fe2 1o4 the particles presented a spherical morphology with a diameter size of approximately 25 nm and a standard deviation of 10 nm fig 9b by using this continuous flow system it was possible to remove both ions from 2 l of pollutant solution with good removal efficiency and perform the process in a continuous way this continuous procedure significantly improved the removal of heavy metals opening the way for further studies 4 conclusions this work proposes a new methodology for the recovery of cobalt and nickel ions independently or in the same solution together with the formation of cobalt and nickel or mixed ferrites whose morphological structural and magnetic characteristics may vary with experimental conditions when ion recovery is carried out at current densities of 50 ma cm2 the recovery efficiency is close to 100 for concentrations less than 100 ppm and the particles obtained are quasi spherical with sizes on the order of 27 nm with properties of a ferromagnetic material increasing the concentration to 200 ppm showed a clear decrease in recovery efficiency increasing the current density to 100 ma cm2 or the temperature up to 60 c produces the appearance of metallic iron in the obtained material but also increased the removal efficiencies therefore we can conclude that under the experimental conditions of this work total recovery is not possible for ion concentrations greater than 100 ppm the most important conclusion of this work is the possibility of recovering high amounts of cobalt and nickel ions in a continuous flow cell which allows recovery in much larger volumes of contaminants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
