focus on the multi modal behaviors free decay tests were conducted for the tlp and semi submersible which showed that the tlp and semi submersible system had complex coupled behaviors with multiple natural mode frequency components to investigate this behavior rigorously an eigenvalue analysis was applied the natural modes and periods of the multi body system were identified from the eigenvalue analysis a selected set of model experiments was compared with corresponding numerical simulations which showed a good agreement keywords tension leg platform tlp tender semi submersible hawser tension multi modal behavior multi body interaction eigenvalue analysis 1 introduction the economic profit against the capital expenditure capex and operating expenditure opex is one of the most important considerations when developing an offshore oil or gas field in case that high capex is anticipated more economical alternatives should be derived to increase the profit of the project the concept of using a tender vessel is one of promising alternatives but additional engineering works should be considered to investigate operability and the safety of the production platform and tender vessel system the odin field 1985 is the first example of the production platform with the tender vessel system in which a tender vessel was attached to a fixed jacket platform smith and dixon 1987 since then many tender support vessels were usually used with the fixed platforms christiansen et al 1994 mathiesen 1989 recently the tension leg platform tlp is regarded as a competitive one to accept tender vessel concept compared with other floating platforms since the tlp is more sensitive to the additional topside weight and undergoes smaller motions in waves it is relatively straightforward to analyze the relative motion of two floating systems botker et al 2001 korloo et al 2004 xia and taghipour 2012 moreover as they are moored with vertical tendons interference between the mooring lines can be avoided tlp and tender semi submersible platform system consists with two floating bodies mooring and hawser system where tlp is taking charge of production through the dry tree while the tender semi submersible supports accommodation and supplies this system reduces the payload and functional requirements on the production platform and makes the dry tree completion system more competitive moreover the residence and helideck on the topside could be moved to the tender vessel to diminish the potential risk by separating such structures from the potentially explosive modules but the utilization of the tender vessel needs more detailed engineering as two floating bodies are connected with hawser lines it gives a complex behavior on the system due to the coupling effect since two bodies are located with close proximity there is a possibility of collision between two bodies which can damage the hawser lines and the mooring lines due to the relative motions of bodies therefore the verification on the coupled system for various environmental condition should be considered to ensure the safety of the tender vessel system xia and taghipour 2012 many pioneering works on the tlp have been conducted with focus on the higher order phenomena which called as springing and ringing chen et al 1991 analyzed the springing loads on the tlp numerically to understand the ringing phenomena of the tlp the third order forces are also needed originally malenica and molin 1995 suggested the third order wave forces acting on the vertical cylinders and teng and kato 2002 suggested the third order force formulation on the axisymmetric body hong and hong 1996 showed that morison s drag force model provides the third order components which is effective to simulate the higher order drag forces on the tlp cho et al 2014 revisited the third order effect by applying morison drag force and model tests but there have not been many of studies on the tlp with tender supported vessel most of researches on the tender supported vessel have been restricted on the risk assessment or hydrodynamic interaction muhammad et al 1996 udoh et al 2014 korloo et al 2004 showed a comprehensive analysis on the tlp with tender semi submersible for west seno field xia and taghipour 2012 conducted a feasibility study on the tlp with tender assisted drilling project and primally introduced the eigenvalue analysis for mooring designs but their analysis was restricted to the longitudinal motions of two bodies only because of the lack of the model experiments and analysis on the tlp with semi submersible the coupling effects of the tlp with tender semi submersible system is left behind unknown in this study the coupling effects of tlp and tender semi submersible system were investigated by conducting both numerical analysis and model tests from a set of free decay tests for the tlp and tender semi submersible system the complex coupled motion behavior was observed from the eigenvalue analysis those complex behavior was identified as a multi modal characteristics to interpret this behavior the eigenvalue analysis for the coupled horizontal motions had been performed the eigenvalue analysis provided the natural periods and modes of the tlp with tender semi submersible system the natural frequencies measured in the model tests showed good agreements with the results of the eigenvalue analysis finally the fully coupled frequency and time domain analyses had been conducted in wave conditions which showed fairly good agreements between results of the model experiments and numerical simulations 2 numerical analysis 2 1 eigenvalue analysis to investigate the characteristics of the tlp with tender semi submersible an eigenvalue analysis was performed with focus on coupled horizontal mode motions e g the surge sway and yaw of the tlp and tender semi submersible the horizontal motion vector for the tlp with tender semi submersible system is given by eq 1 first three components are the horizontal motion components of the tlp and the last three components are those of the semi submersible 1 x ξ t η t ψ t ξ s η s ψ s where x ξ η and ψ represent the horizontal motion vector and the surge sway and yaw motion respectively and the subscript t and s denote the tlp and semi submersible respectively the mass spring

submersible respectively these genuine mass terms do not change but the added mass matrix of the two floating systems involves coupling terms and is a function of wave frequency because the horizontal motions of system have low frequency behaviors the added mass matrix can be approximated as the values at the zero frequency 4 a ω a ω 0 the horizontal motion stiffness matrix is composed of three parts from the tendons mooring lines and hawsers 5 k k t k m k h where k t k m and k h are the stiffness matrices of the tendon mooring lines and the hawsers and those are given by eqs 6 8 derivations on the stiffness of the hawser and mooring lines are included in appendices a and b in this study the linearized stiffness matrix is utilized and the coupled terms between two floating bodies are considered in hawser stiffness matrix 6 k i j t i 1 n t t 0 i l l i n e i i j 1 2 i 1 n t t 0 i l l i n e i l x i 2 l y i 2 i j 3 0 e l s e 7 k m k t m 0 3 3 0 3 3 k s m where k t s m i 1 n t s m k x

stiffness components the system equation of the tlp with tender semi submersible can be obtained the eigenvalue analysis for this system equation can be introduced as eq 9 9 m a ω 1 k x ω 2 i x where i is the identity matrix and eq 9 can be expressed as eq 10 10 a x λ i x where a and λ represent the system matrix and eigenvalues respectively as a results of eigenvalue analysis the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be obtained and these values represent the natural frequencies and modes of the tlp with semi submersible system from this the characteristics of the tlp with semi submersible system can be analyzed 2 2 frequency domain analysis to calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the floating bodies the potential flow is introduced the boundary value problem of the floating body can be expressed as eq 11 11 2 ϕ 0 in fluid domain ϕ n 0 on z h ϕ z ω 2 g ϕ 0 on z 0 ϕ n v n on x s b lim k r k r ϕ r k ϕ 0 where ϕ h ω v n and k are the velocity potential water depth wave frequency body surface velocity normal vector and wave number respectively the velocity potential is decomposed into the incident diffraction and radiation potentials to solve multi floating body dynamics as expressed in eq 12 choi and hong 2002 the concept of the generalized mode of the floating bodies are decomposing the radiation problem as at 6n b degrees of the freedom lee and choi 1998 12 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d

of floating bodies the body boundary conditions for the diffraction and unit radiation potential are expressed as eq 13 13 ϕ d n ϕ i n ϕ r k n n k k 1 6 n b the higher order boundary element method hobem is adopted to solve the boundary value problem in which multi body hydrodynamic interactions is treated as generalized mode approach choi and hong 2002 the wave green function which satisfies both free surface boundary and radiation conditions is used wehausen and laitone 1960 and the boundary integral equation is given by eq 14 14 c r o ϕ r o s b g r o r n ϕ r d s s b g r o r ϕ r n d s where c r 0 r and g are the constant that related to the body surface field point source point and the green function respectively the wave exciting force and the radiation forces are given by eqs 15

respectively thus the equation of motion in frequency domain is expressed by eq 17 in this study the radiation damping is only considered to know the low frequency motion behavior clearly 17 ω 2 m a ω

are axial stiffness of the tendons and relative z position vectors of the tendons from the center of rotation 2 3 time domain simulation 2 3 1 equation of motion it is relatively straightforward to simulate complex nonlinear coupled motions of multi body system with complex mooring arrangement and many other external forces including nonlinear effect when utilizing the time domain simulation the equation of motion in the time domain is given by eq 19 it includes the time memory effect the multi body hydrodynamic interactions and also nonlinear effects cummins 1962 hong et al 2005 19 m a ξ t f

motion vector external forces wave exciting forces wave drift forces the retardation function or time memory function added mass and wave damping respectively the added mass and wave damping can be calculated by solving the frequency domain solution of radiation problem the wave exciting force and wave drift forces are given as eqs 20 and 21 lee 2008 20 f t d i re n 1 n w a v e a n ℒ ω n e i ω t 21 f t d r i f t re n 1 n w a v e m 1 n w a v e a n a m q ω n ω m e i ω n ω m t where asterisk denotes complex conjugate a n and n w a v e are the wave amplitude of irregular waves and the number of irregular waves ℒ ω n is linear transfer function ltf and q ω n ω m are the difference frequency quadratic transfer function qtf respectively pinkster 1980 choi et al 2000 shows that the qtfs of the floating bodies converges with small number of element by using the higher order boundary element method in this study full qtf matrix is used to calculate wave drift forces 2 3 2 mooring line modeling the tendons mooring lines and hawser are modelled as a linear spring in the numerical simulation to compare with model experiment if the motion of the floating body is small and there is no need to consider the bending of the lines it is more convenient and simple to model the mooring lines as the tether the tether is a simple elastic line which only has axial stiffness with its unstretched length the tether force is given by eq 22 oortmenssen 1976 22 f i t e t h e r e a i d i l i t e t h e r l i t e t h e r i f d i l i t e t h e r 0 i f d i l i t e t h e r where f i t e t h e r e a i d i and l i t e t h e r are the tether force axial stiffness distance between mooring point and anchor point and the unstretched length of the tether respectively the connected mooring points of the floating body are simultaneously computed by euler transformation of the each floating body motions with the relative position vector 2 3 3 morison force for the slender cylindrical members of floating platform tendons or riser the diffraction effect can be neglected if the characteristic length of the members are relatively smaller than the wave length the morison force is composed with the inertia terms and drag force term the morison force acting on the hydrodynamic section is expressed by eq 23 23 f m o r i s o n l d f d f c m ρ π d 2 4 u n c a ρ π d 2 4 x n 1 2 ρ c d d u n x n u n x n d l where f m o r i s o n c m c a c d d u n u n x n x n and d l are the morison force the inertia coefficient added mass coefficient morison drag coefficient the characteristic length the acceleration and velocity of fluid normal to structure the velocity and acceleration of the structure normal to fluid and the infinitesimal length of the hydrodynamic section respectively hong and hong 1996 showed the drag contribution of the morison force has odd high and sub harmonic frequency components of wave frequency only the morison drag is accounted in this study those morison force is applied on the tlp members and also the tendon the morison forces are considered as the external forces of the equation of motion in time domain the characteristic diameters in morison forces are set to be same diameters of the tlp column and tendon the drag coefficients are calibrated with the results of free decay test 3 experiments description the specifications of the tlp and semi submersible considered in this study are given in table 1 the tlp consists of four circular columns and a rectangular ring pontoon twelve tendons are installed to provide the pretension and the additional vertical stiffness where each of three tendons are attached to each tlp column the semi submersible has four main rounded rectangular columns with two parallel pontoons and bracing columns between the main columns the scale ratio was 61 25 in the model tests the experiments were conducted in the ocean engineering model basin at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso in daejeon the basin of which dimensions are 68 8 l 37 b 3 2 h m has a pit at the center to provide the deep water condition the pit depth and diameter are 15 0 m and 5 0 m respectively the installed tlp and semi submersible in the model basin are shown in fig 1 the modeling of tendons is considered as the crucial process to achieve the realistic motion characteristics of tlp because it governs not only long period planar motions surge sway and yaw but also vertical wave frequency motions heave roll and pitch in the experiments the tendons were installed to the artificial bottom structure inside the pit to model the water depth the main body of the tendons were made of aluminum tubes and the spring was added to the bottom jig of tendons to match the scaled vertical stiffness of the tendon before testing the tlp with tender semi submersible the performance tests were conducted on the single tlp to confirm its motion characteristics pull out tests were conducted to check its static characteristics and free decay tests were performed to confirm the tendon stiffness tendon pretension and the natural periods of the tlp the motion responses of the tlp in the experiments were compared with those from the frequency domain numerical analysis the tender semi submersible was then installed next to the tlp with the mooring arrangement as shown in fig 2 four soft mooring lines named as from ss1 to ss4 were attached to the semi submersible to keep its position hawser lines denoted as from ph1 to ch4 were installed between the tlp and the semi submersible additional two mooring lines named as from ts1 to ts2 were installed on the other side of the tlp to provide the tension in hawsers so that the distance between the tlp and the semi submersible is maintained the spring stiffness of the mooring lines and hawser lines were assumed to be linear and their values are listed in table 2 in table 2 k k ρ and g represent stiffness of mooring and hawser lines non dimensional stiffness water density and gravitational acceleration respectively the environmental conditions of the experiment are given in table 3 in the experiment the regular waves the white noise waves and the irregular waves conditions were considered the energy spectrum of the white noise waves and irregular waves are given in fig 3 4 results and analysis the experimental results were compared with the results from the numerical analysis to interpret the experimental results both the frequency and time domain analysis were attempted the snapshots of the numerical time domain simulations are shown in fig 4 the numerical time domain simulations were conducted both on the case of tlp only and tlp with semi submersible in the multi body situation the hydrodynamic interaction which includes the coupling terms of the added mass and radiation damping were considered for all numerical analysis 4 1 validations on the tlp to test the static characteristics of the tlp the pullout test was conducted first the applied forces on the tlp during the pullout test were set to be in the same horizontal plane at the vertical position of the center of gravity the horizontal offset with applied forces and the horizontal offset with set down were compared with the results of numerical analysis for the design condition as shown in fig 5 the set down is defined as the vertical submergence when a horizontal offset occurs due to the existence of the tendons the free decay tests were also conducted to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the tlp the time series for the free decay test of the tlp are shown in fig 6 with the results of corresponding numerical time simulation it can be seen from the figures that those results agree well with each other the natural periods of the tlp were also measured and compared with the results from the eigenvalue analysis as shown in table 4 where t and t are non dimensional and measured periods the eigenvalue analysis for the single tlp involved the all six degree freedom of motion namely surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the tendon stiffness terms are given in eq 18 furthermore the motion response amplitude operator rao of the tlp acquired from a regular wave test and the white noise wave test were compared with the results of frequency domain and the numerical time domain simulation as shown in figs 7 9 for head sea in the results the typical responses of the tlp can be observed for the vertical motions heave and pitch showed the resonance at the high frequency and its responses were small relative to horizontal motion the experimental results of the tlp showed good agreements with the results of numerical computations therefore it can be concluded that the frequency and time domain analysis can be regarded as the useful method to predict the motion responses of the tlp system and the validity of such method is confirmed from the experimental results 4 2 system characteristics of tlp with semi submersible the free decay tests on the tlp with tender semi submersible system were conducted to investigate its systematic characteristics the time series and the results of fast fourier transform fft of the tlp yaw free decay are shown in fig 10 with the results of the corresponding numerical time simulation the results showed that tlp with semi submersible system had a complex behavior with various frequency components for example the results of fft on the surge motion of the tlp and semi submersible showed two peaks at the low frequency region to analyze these results an eigenvalue analysis were conducted on the tlp with semi submersible system the eigenvalue analysis for the tlp with tender vessel was primally applied by xia and taghipour 2012 but their study was only restricted to the longitudinal motion of two floating bodies namely surge and they considered the simple spring model in this study the coupled horizontal motions of two floating bodies namely surge sway and yaw were considered and furthermore the motion stiffness induced by the hawser mooring lines and tendons were considered simultaneously the added mass coupling terms were also included hong et al 2005 have demonstrated the accuracy and fast convergence of hobem in hydrodynamic interaction problems with the experimental validation they showed that hobem has quite useful especially for the side by side moored multiple vessels where the distance between two bodies are relatively small we used the same hobem to obtain more accurate coupled hydrodynamic coefficients of the tlp and tender semi submersible the natural modes of the system are shown in fig 11 the natural modes of the tlp with semi submersible can be categorized with the motion direction and the relative motion phase of the two bodies which are in phase and out of phase motion and it can be seen that the yaw related modes are strongly coupled with the sway motion the natural periods of the system obtained from the experiments were compared with the results from the fft analysis and the following results are presented in table 5 good agreements were obtained between the model tests the coupled eigenvalue analysis and the fully coupled time domain simulations it verifies that the eigenvalue analysis predicted the natural periods of the coupled system relatively well compared to the natural periods of the horizontal motions of the single tlp which are given in table 4 the natural periods of the coupled system decreased it means that the natural periods and horizontal mode shapes of two connected floating body system are affected by the design of moorings and hawser systems therefore the design of the mooring and hawser configurations and their stiffness should be verified through the numerical analysis and model tests to avoid resonance and achieve optimal design it can be seen that the sway and yaw motions were strongly coupled and their natural periods were shorter than the natural periods of the surge related modes this implies that all horizontal motion should be considered in the eigenvalue analysis to check the natural periods of multi body system with hawser application furthermore it gives comprehensive understanding on the multi body system that is connected by the hawser as it provides not only natural periods but also mode shapes of the multi body system for all the coupled horizontal motions it is relatively useful to design mooring and hawser system the natural modes and periods of the tlp with semi submersible system were investigated for different values of hawser stiffness as shown in fig 12 and table 6 it can be observed that the natural modes of the system were not affected much by the hawser stiffness but the natural periods of specific modes were considerably affected in particular the natural periods of the yaw modes and the out of phase surge mode noticeably decreased as the hawser stiffness increased therefore it can be said that the stiffness change of hawser lines caused a strong interaction especially on the out of phase surge mode and the in phase yaw modes the importance of those modes is that the resonance of those modes can be excited by wave frequency forces it means that the consideration on the sway and yaw motions in eigenvalue analysis is needed to avoid system resonance to the environmental excitation which has long periods namely swell or vortex induced motion due to the current 4 3 motion and hawser responses the motion responses of the tlp and semi submersible system are compared with the results of the numerical analysis in fig 13 the incident wave has a same direction as the alignment of two floating bodies which called as a tandem arrangement with the semi submersible located at the front in the experiments the regular wave and the white noise wave test are conducted in numerical time simulation the wave height is set to be 1 0 m the numerical analysis well predicted motion responses of the floating bodies the low frequency resonances are observed in motion rao for the tandem arrangement two strong resonance frequencies are observed and they are same with the natural frequencies of the in phase and out of phase surge modes those resonances are induced by the hawser because the pitch is coupled with the surge motion the resonance phenomena is also observed in pitch motion rao because two floating bodies are located with close proximity the relative motion between bodies are imported to avoid the possible collision and to analyze the load on the hawser the relative motion response are shown in fig 14 where rao rm is the relative surge motion rao the horizontal axis is normalized with the distance of the center of gravity cog of two floating bodies divided by the incident wave length the horizontal motion differences of two floating bodies in the same time step are used to calculate the motion rao for experiments and numerical time domain simulation all the results show good agreements with each other in the wave frequency region in the low frequency region two resonance frequencies are also observed in frequency domain those resonances are the surge modes of the two floating bodies and the resonance amplitudes have the high values because the radiation damping are small in low frequency region it means that the low frequency resonance could lead to collision of the two bodies the relative motion rao shows multiple minima points when the distance between two bodies is equal to integer times of the length of incident wave where two floating bodies are located at the same wave phase and have the same motion phase while the hump points exist when the distance is equal to odd number times of the half length of incident wave where two floating bodies are located at the opposite phases the incident wave length which gives minima and hump points of relative motion rao can be expressed as eq 24 24 λ m i n d n and λ h u m p d n 1 2 n 1 2 where λ m i n λ h u m p and d are the incident wave length which gives minima and hump points on the distance rao and the distance of the center of gravity of two floating bodies the tension rao of the hawsers are shown in fig 15 with comparison of experiments and numerical analysis the tension rao of the frequency domain analysis are computed as eq 25 25 r a o t e n s i o n ω k x h a w s e r r a o r m ω where r a o t e n s i o n ω r a o r m ω and k x h a w s e r are the load transfer function of hawser relative motion rao and longitudinal stiffness of the hawser respectively the raos of experiments and numerical time domain simulations were obtained by spectral analysis and zero upcrossing method the results show good agreements with each other the load transfer function of the hawser has a similar behavior of the relative horizontal motion responses of two floating bodies and the parallel hawsers has relatively higher values than the cross hawsers it is understood that the acting tension on the parallel hawsers is higher than the cross hawsers because the longitudinal stiffness of the parallel hawsers are relatively higher and the low frequency resonances are also observed from the results we can see that the frequency domain analysis is quite useful to predict dynamic load on the hawser and the low frequency resonances should be accounted more rigorously in time domain to estimate the load acting on the hawser 4 4 irregular waves typical examples of measured surge time series in irregular wave condition for the ta ndem arrangement are shown in fig 16 which are normalized by the significant wave height h 1 3 the measured surge time series of the tlp and semi submersible can be divided into three parts as eq 26 26 ξ t s ξ w a v e t s ξ ω 1 t s ξ ω 2 t s where ω 1 ω 2 where ξ t s ξ w a v e t s ξ ω 1 t s and ξ ω 2 t s are the original surge motion wave frequency motion and the low frequency motion with frequency component ω 1 ω 2 respectively to investigate the frequency components of measured motions the energy spectra of the surge motion are shown in fig 17 with the results of frequency and time domain simulation in the frequency domain the energy spectrum can be computed as eq 27 see fig 17 27 s r m ω s w a v e ω r a o r m ω 2 where s rm ω s wave ω and rao rm ω are the energy spectrum of the relative motion and the incident waves and rao of the relative motion the spectra shows that the two dominant low frequency motion peaks correspond to in phase and out of phase surge modes and the wave frequency components are shown in the spectra as well the magnitudes of low frequency components are relatively higher than those of the wave frequency to avoid the collision and the load acting on the hawser the relative motion between two floating bodies should be importantly considered the measured relative motion time series in the experiments is shown in fig 17 in the figure the relative motion time series has the components of wave frequency and low frequency but it has an only one dominant low frequency component unlike the results of surge motion of each floating bodies comparing with fig 16 the relative motion can be expressed as eq 28 ξ r ξ w a v e t ξ w a v e s ξ ω 1 t ξ ω 1 s ξ ω 2 t ξ ω 2 t ξ w a v e r ξ ω 1 r ξ ω 2 r 28 ξ w a v e r ξ ω 2 r where ξ r ξ w a v e r ξ ω 1 r and ξ ω 2 r are the relative motions which are the total the frequency of wave and the low frequency motion with frequency component ω 1 ω 2 in this case the motion magnitudes of two floating bodies of the in phase surge mode are similar as shown in fig 16 therefore the low frequency motion ω 1 of the tlp and semi submersible can be canceled out the relative motion spectrum with the results of the frequency and time domain simulation are given in fig 19 the relative motion spectra show that those are composed of wave frequency motion and low frequency motion the energy spectra show good agreements between the numerical simulation and the results of the frequency domain in wave frequency region while noticeable discrepancies in magnitude is observed in the components of the low frequency in phase surge mode the small denominator to calculate the rao in the frequency domain induces these differences the relative motion spectrum compared to the surge motion spectra of two floating bodies are shown in fig 20 the results show that the in phase surge mode doesn t give much effect on the relative motion but the magnitudes of the out of phase surge mode and the wave frequency component increase the increased relative motion could be dangerous because it causes the collision between two bodies and it also increases the load acting on the hawser because the natural frequency of coupled low frequency surge mode is closer to the wave frequency region than the single body surge mode low frequency motion resonance should be checked in a rigorous manner in which the modeling of the hawser and fully coupled low frequency motions are considered the time series of measured tensions of the hawser 1 ph 1 and hawser 3 ch 3 are shown in fig 21 together with the low pass filtered data very similar to the relative motion the tension acting on the hawser is composed of wave frequency components and long period horizontal motion and pretension the energy spectra of the hawser tensions are shown in fig 22 almost same behavior is observed with the relative motion 5 conclusion the complicated coupled motion characteristics of the tlp with tender semi submersible system were investigated by means of experiments and numerical analysis in the numerical approach both frequency and time domain approaches were attempted a fully coupled eigenvalue analysis considering hydrodynamic interactions and the mooring lines tendons and the coupling effect of hawser lines was carried out to identify low frequency coupled planar motion modes in the frequency domain a higher order boundary element method was employed for accurate and efficient calculation of coupled hydrodynamic forces between two floating bodies in close proximity the time domain simulation based on the cummins s method was applied with consideration of fully coupled effects between two bodies hawser tendon and mooring lines with nonlinear wave forces in the model experiments the verification of model set up was made for the single tlp by means of pullout tests and free decay test additional tests were carried out to obtain motion rao which proved numerical analyses and measured motion rao after the successful validation of the single tlp the tender semi submersible was installed placed beside the tlp with hawser then a series of model tests were conducted for the tlp tender semi submersible system coupled free decay tests rao test and irregular wave tests the complex behaviors of the horizontal motions of two floating bodies were identified from model tests eigenvalue analysis frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis in which coupled effects from hydrodynamic interactions hawsers mooring lines and tendons were included from the systematic comparison between model tests eigenvalue analysis numerical analyses both in frequency domain and time domain the following conclusions could be drawn the present coupled eigenvalue analysis model identified natural modes as well as corresponding natural periods this relatively simple approach will be able to provide an efficient tool to predict coupled motion characteristics of a production platform with a tender vessel system which can eventually be applicable to the optimal design of arrangement of tender vessel and hawser mooring system the generalized mode based frequency domain coupled analysis was applied to a tlp tender semi submersible platform system which could be used to provide a useful global performance analysis tool in preliminary design stage the present fully coupled time domain analysis model was proven to give quantitatively accurate results both in low frequency and wave frequency coupled motions which was validated through a series of model tests free decay test rao tests and irregular wave tests this simulation model can be applied to carry out the detail performance verification for the final design stage of the tlp tender semi submersible system meaningful findings from both model tests and numerical analyses are as follows the coupled low frequency motion periods of the tlp tender semi submersible platform are generally shorter than those of single body due to additional hawser and moorings between two bodies out of phase surge in phase and out of phase yaw were found to be more sensitive to hawser stiffness changes among them in phase yaw seems to be critical because the natural period is relatively close to wave frequency which needs special attention to avoid wave frequency resonance out of phase surge is a dominating mode to govern relative motion of the tlp tender semi submersible which should be checked and a design spiral for optimal design of connecting hawser and mooring system is required acknowledgements this work was partially

23455,in this study an experimental and numerical analysis have been carried out to investigate the coupled behavior of a tension leg platform tlp combined with tender semi submersible platform with focus on the multi modal behaviors free decay tests were conducted for the tlp and semi submersible which showed that the tlp and semi submersible system had complex coupled behaviors with multiple natural mode frequency components to investigate this behavior rigorously an eigenvalue analysis was applied the natural modes and periods of the multi body system were identified from the eigenvalue analysis a selected set of model experiments was compared with corresponding numerical simulations which showed a good agreement keywords tension leg platform tlp tender semi submersible hawser tension multi modal behavior multi body interaction eigenvalue analysis 1 introduction the economic profit against the capital expenditure capex and operating expenditure opex is one of the most important considerations when developing an offshore oil or gas field in case that high capex is anticipated more economical alternatives should be derived to increase the profit of the project the concept of using a tender vessel is one of promising alternatives but additional engineering works should be considered to investigate operability and the safety of the production platform and tender vessel system the odin field 1985 is the first example of the production platform with the tender vessel system in which a tender vessel was attached to a fixed jacket platform smith and dixon 1987 since then many tender support vessels were usually used with the fixed platforms christiansen et al 1994 mathiesen 1989 recently the tension leg platform tlp is regarded as a competitive one to accept tender vessel concept compared with other floating platforms since the tlp is more sensitive to the additional topside weight and undergoes smaller motions in waves it is relatively straightforward to analyze the relative motion of two floating systems botker et al 2001 korloo et al 2004 xia and taghipour 2012 moreover as they are moored with vertical tendons interference between the mooring lines can be avoided tlp and tender semi submersible platform system consists with two floating bodies mooring and hawser system where tlp is taking charge of production through the dry tree while the tender semi submersible supports accommodation and supplies this system reduces the payload and functional requirements on the production platform and makes the dry tree completion system more competitive moreover the residence and helideck on the topside could be moved to the tender vessel to diminish the potential risk by separating such structures from the potentially explosive modules but the utilization of the tender vessel needs more detailed engineering as two floating bodies are connected with hawser lines it gives a complex behavior on the system due to the coupling effect since two bodies are located with close proximity there is a possibility of collision between two bodies which can damage the hawser lines and the mooring lines due to the relative motions of bodies therefore the verification on the coupled system for various environmental condition should be considered to ensure the safety of the tender vessel system xia and taghipour 2012 many pioneering works on the tlp have been conducted with focus on the higher order phenomena which called as springing and ringing chen et al 1991 analyzed the springing loads on the tlp numerically to understand the ringing phenomena of the tlp the third order forces are also needed originally malenica and molin 1995 suggested the third order wave forces acting on the vertical cylinders and teng and kato 2002 suggested the third order force formulation on the axisymmetric body hong and hong 1996 showed that morison s drag force model provides the third order components which is effective to simulate the higher order drag forces on the tlp cho et al 2014 revisited the third order effect by applying morison drag force and model tests but there have not been many of studies on the tlp with tender supported vessel most of researches on the tender supported vessel have been restricted on the risk assessment or hydrodynamic interaction muhammad et al 1996 udoh et al 2014 korloo et al 2004 showed a comprehensive analysis on the tlp with tender semi submersible for west seno field xia and taghipour 2012 conducted a feasibility study on the tlp with tender assisted drilling project and primally introduced the eigenvalue analysis for mooring designs but their analysis was restricted to the longitudinal motions of two bodies only because of the lack of the model experiments and analysis on the tlp with semi submersible the coupling effects of the tlp with tender semi submersible system is left behind unknown in this study the coupling effects of tlp and tender semi submersible system were investigated by conducting both numerical analysis and model tests from a set of free decay tests for the tlp and tender semi submersible system the complex coupled motion behavior was observed from the eigenvalue analysis those complex behavior was identified as a multi modal characteristics to interpret this behavior the eigenvalue analysis for the coupled horizontal motions had been performed the eigenvalue analysis provided the natural periods and modes of the tlp with tender semi submersible system the natural frequencies measured in the model tests showed good agreements with the results of the eigenvalue analysis finally the fully coupled frequency and time domain analyses had been conducted in wave conditions which showed fairly good agreements between results of the model experiments and numerical simulations 2 numerical analysis 2 1 eigenvalue analysis to investigate the characteristics of the tlp with tender semi submersible an eigenvalue analysis was performed with focus on coupled horizontal mode motions e g the surge sway and yaw of the tlp and tender semi submersible the horizontal motion vector for the tlp with tender semi submersible system is given by eq 1 first three components are the horizontal motion components of the tlp and the last three components are those of the semi submersible 1 x ξ t η t ψ t ξ s η s ψ s where x ξ η and ψ represent the horizontal motion vector and the surge sway and yaw motion respectively and the subscript t and s denote the tlp and semi submersible respectively the mass spring system equation of the tlp with tender semi submersible in frequency domain can be given by eq 2 2 ω 2 m a ω k x 0 where ω m a ω and k are circular frequency the genuine mass matrix added mass matrix

submersible respectively these genuine mass terms do not change but the added mass matrix of the two floating systems involves coupling terms and is a function of wave frequency because the horizontal motions of system have low frequency behaviors the added mass matrix can be approximated as the values at the zero frequency 4 a ω a ω 0 the horizontal motion stiffness matrix is composed of three parts from the tendons mooring lines and hawsers 5 k k t k m k h where k t k m and k h are the stiffness matrices of the tendon mooring lines and the hawsers and those are given by eqs 6 8 derivations on the stiffness of the hawser and mooring lines are included in appendices a and b in this study the linearized stiffness matrix is utilized and the coupled terms between two floating bodies are

i is the identity matrix and eq 9 can be expressed as eq 10 10 a x λ i x where a and λ represent the system matrix and eigenvalues respectively as a results of eigenvalue analysis the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be obtained and these values represent the natural frequencies and modes of the tlp with semi submersible system from this the characteristics of the tlp with semi submersible system can be analyzed 2 2 frequency domain analysis to calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the floating bodies the potential flow is introduced the boundary value problem of the floating body can be expressed as eq 11 11 2 ϕ 0 in fluid domain ϕ n 0 on z h ϕ z ω 2 g ϕ 0 on z 0 ϕ n v n on x s b lim k r k r ϕ r k ϕ 0 where ϕ h ω v n and k are the velocity potential water depth wave frequency body surface velocity normal vector and wave number respectively the velocity potential is decomposed into the incident diffraction and radiation potentials to solve multi floating body dynamics as

hobem is adopted to solve the boundary value problem in which multi body hydrodynamic interactions is treated as generalized mode approach choi and hong 2002 the wave green function which satisfies both free surface boundary and radiation conditions is used wehausen and laitone 1960 and the boundary integral equation is given by eq 14 14 c r o ϕ r o s b g r o r n ϕ r d s s b g r o r ϕ r n d s where c r 0 r and g are the constant that related to the body surface field point source point and the green function respectively the wave exciting force and the radiation forces are given by eqs 15

simulate complex nonlinear coupled motions of multi body system with complex mooring arrangement and many other external forces including nonlinear effect when utilizing the time domain simulation the equation of motion in the time domain is given by eq 19 it includes the time memory effect the multi body hydrodynamic interactions and also nonlinear effects cummins 1962 hong et al 2005 19 m a ξ t f

floating bodies converges with small number of element by using the higher order boundary element method in this study full qtf matrix is used to calculate wave drift forces 2 3 2 mooring line modeling the tendons mooring lines and hawser are modelled as a linear spring in the numerical simulation to compare with model experiment if the motion of the floating body is small and there is no need to consider the bending of the lines it is more convenient and simple to model the mooring lines as the tether the tether is a simple elastic line which only has axial stiffness with its unstretched length the tether force is given by eq 22 oortmenssen 1976 22 f i t e t h e r e a i d i l i t e t h e r l i t e t h e r i f d i l i t e t h e r 0 i f d i l i t e t h e r where f i t e t h

hong and hong 1996 showed the drag contribution of the morison force has odd high and sub harmonic frequency components of wave frequency only the morison drag is accounted in this study those morison force is applied on the tlp members and also the tendon the morison forces are considered as the external forces of the equation of motion in time domain the characteristic diameters in morison forces are set to be same diameters of the tlp column and tendon the drag coefficients are calibrated with the results of free decay test 3 experiments description the specifications of the tlp and semi submersible considered in this study are given in table 1 the tlp consists of four circular columns and a rectangular ring pontoon twelve tendons are installed to provide the pretension and the additional vertical stiffness where each of three tendons are attached to each tlp column the semi submersible has four main rounded rectangular columns with two parallel pontoons and bracing columns between the main columns the scale ratio was 61 25 in the model tests the experiments were conducted in the ocean engineering model basin at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso in daejeon the basin of which dimensions are 68 8 l 37 b 3 2 h m has a pit at the center to provide the deep water condition the pit depth and diameter are 15 0 m and 5 0 m respectively the installed tlp and semi submersible in the model basin are shown in fig 1 the modeling of tendons is considered as the crucial process to achieve the realistic motion characteristics of tlp because it governs not only long period planar motions surge sway and yaw but also vertical wave frequency motions heave roll and pitch in the experiments the tendons were installed to the artificial bottom structure inside the pit to model the water depth the main body of the tendons were made of aluminum tubes and the spring was added to the bottom jig of tendons to match the scaled vertical stiffness of the tendon before testing the tlp with tender semi submersible the performance tests were conducted on the single tlp to confirm its motion characteristics pull out tests were conducted to check its static characteristics and free decay tests were performed to confirm the tendon stiffness tendon pretension and the natural periods of the tlp the motion responses of the tlp in the experiments were compared with those from the frequency domain numerical analysis the tender semi submersible was then installed next to the tlp with the mooring arrangement as shown in fig 2 four soft mooring lines named as from ss1 to ss4 were attached to the semi submersible to keep its position hawser lines denoted as from ph1 to ch4 were installed between the tlp and the semi submersible additional two mooring lines named as from ts1 to ts2 were installed on the other side of the tlp to provide the tension in hawsers so that the distance between the tlp and the semi submersible is maintained the spring stiffness of the mooring lines and hawser lines were assumed to be linear and their values are listed in table 2 in table 2 k k ρ and g represent stiffness of mooring and hawser lines non dimensional stiffness water density and gravitational acceleration respectively the environmental conditions of the experiment are given in table 3 in the experiment the regular waves the white noise waves and the irregular waves conditions were considered the energy spectrum of the white noise waves and irregular waves are given in fig 3 4 results and analysis the experimental results were compared with the results from the numerical analysis to interpret the experimental results both the frequency and time domain analysis were attempted the snapshots of the numerical time domain simulations are shown in fig 4 the numerical time domain simulations were conducted both on the case of tlp only and tlp with semi submersible in the multi body situation the hydrodynamic interaction which includes the coupling terms of the added mass and radiation damping were considered for all numerical analysis 4 1 validations on the tlp to test the static characteristics of the tlp the pullout test was conducted first the applied forces on the tlp during the pullout test were set to be in the same horizontal plane at the vertical position of the center of gravity the horizontal offset with applied forces and the horizontal offset with set down were compared with the results of numerical analysis for the design condition as shown in fig 5 the set down is defined as the vertical submergence when a horizontal offset occurs due to the existence of the tendons the free decay tests were also conducted to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the tlp the time series for the free decay test of the tlp are shown in fig 6 with the results of corresponding numerical time simulation it can be seen from the figures that those results agree well with each other the natural periods of the tlp were also measured and compared with the results from the eigenvalue analysis as shown in table 4 where t and t are non dimensional and measured periods the eigenvalue analysis for the single tlp involved the all six degree freedom of motion namely surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the tendon stiffness terms are given in eq 18 furthermore the motion response amplitude operator rao of the tlp acquired from a regular wave test and the white noise wave test were compared with the results of frequency domain and the numerical time domain simulation as shown in figs 7 9 for head sea in the results the typical responses of the tlp can be observed for the vertical motions heave and pitch showed the resonance at the high frequency and its responses were small relative to horizontal motion the experimental results of the tlp showed good agreements with the results of numerical computations therefore it can be concluded that the frequency and time domain analysis can be regarded as the useful method to predict the motion responses of the tlp system and the validity of such method is confirmed from the experimental results 4 2 system characteristics of tlp with semi submersible the free decay tests on the tlp with tender semi submersible system were conducted to investigate its systematic characteristics the time series and the results of fast fourier transform fft of the tlp yaw free decay are shown in fig 10 with the results of the corresponding numerical time simulation the results showed that tlp with semi submersible system had a complex behavior with various frequency components for example the results of fft on the surge motion of the tlp and semi submersible showed two peaks at the low frequency region to analyze these results an eigenvalue analysis were conducted on the tlp with semi submersible system the eigenvalue analysis for the tlp with tender vessel was primally applied by xia and taghipour 2012 but their study was only restricted to the longitudinal motion of two floating bodies namely surge and they considered the simple spring model in this study the coupled horizontal motions of two floating bodies namely surge sway and yaw were considered and furthermore the motion stiffness induced by the hawser mooring lines and tendons were considered simultaneously the added mass coupling terms were also included hong et al 2005 have demonstrated the accuracy and fast convergence of hobem in hydrodynamic interaction problems with the experimental validation they showed that hobem has quite useful especially for the side by side moored multiple vessels where the distance between two bodies are relatively small we used the same hobem to obtain more accurate coupled hydrodynamic coefficients of the tlp and tender semi submersible the natural modes of the system are shown in fig 11 the natural modes of the tlp with semi submersible can be categorized with the motion direction and the relative motion phase of the two bodies which are in phase and out of phase motion and it can be seen that the yaw related modes are strongly coupled with the sway motion the natural periods of the system obtained from the experiments were compared with the results from the fft analysis and the following results are presented in table 5 good agreements were obtained between the model tests the coupled eigenvalue analysis and the fully coupled time domain simulations it verifies that the eigenvalue analysis predicted the natural periods of the coupled system relatively well compared to the natural periods of the horizontal motions of the single tlp which are given in table 4 the natural periods of the coupled system decreased it means that the natural periods and horizontal mode shapes of two connected floating body system are affected by the design of moorings and hawser systems therefore the design of the mooring and hawser configurations and their stiffness should be verified through the numerical analysis and model tests to avoid resonance and achieve optimal design it can be seen that the sway and yaw motions were strongly coupled and their natural periods were shorter than the natural periods of the surge related modes this implies that all horizontal motion should be considered in the eigenvalue analysis to check the natural periods of multi body system with hawser application furthermore it gives comprehensive understanding on the multi body system that is connected by the hawser as it provides not only natural periods but also mode shapes of the multi body system for all the coupled horizontal motions it is relatively useful to design mooring and hawser system the natural modes and periods of the tlp with semi submersible system were investigated for different values of hawser stiffness as shown in fig 12 and table 6 it can be observed that the natural modes of the system were not affected much by the hawser stiffness but the natural periods of specific modes were considerably affected in particular the natural periods of the yaw modes and the out of phase surge mode noticeably decreased as the hawser stiffness increased therefore it can be said that the stiffness change of hawser lines caused a strong interaction especially on the out of phase surge mode and the in phase yaw modes the importance of those modes is that the resonance of those modes can be excited by wave frequency forces it means that the consideration on the sway and yaw motions in eigenvalue analysis is needed to avoid system resonance to the environmental excitation which has long periods namely swell or vortex induced motion due to the current 4 3 motion and hawser responses the motion responses of the tlp and semi submersible system are compared with the results of the numerical analysis in fig 13 the incident wave has a same direction as the alignment of two floating bodies which called as a tandem arrangement with the semi submersible located at the front in the experiments the regular wave and the white noise wave test are conducted in numerical time simulation the wave height is set to be 1 0 m the numerical analysis well predicted motion responses of the floating bodies the low frequency resonances are observed in motion rao for the tandem arrangement two strong resonance frequencies are observed and they are same with the natural frequencies of the in phase and out of phase surge modes those resonances are induced by the hawser because the pitch is coupled with the surge motion the resonance phenomena is also observed in pitch motion rao because two floating bodies are located with close proximity the relative motion between bodies are imported to avoid the possible collision and to analyze the load on the hawser the relative motion response are shown in fig 14 where rao rm is the relative surge motion rao the horizontal axis is normalized with the distance of the center of gravity cog of two floating bodies divided by the incident wave length the horizontal motion differences of two floating bodies in the same time step are used to calculate the motion rao for experiments and numerical time domain simulation all the results show good agreements with each other in the wave frequency region in the low frequency region two resonance frequencies are also observed in frequency domain those resonances are the surge modes of the two floating bodies and the resonance amplitudes have the high values because the radiation damping are small in low frequency region it means that the low frequency resonance could lead to collision of the two bodies the relative motion rao shows multiple minima points when the distance between two bodies is equal to integer times of the length of incident wave where two floating bodies are located at the same wave phase and have the same motion phase while the hump points exist when the distance is equal to odd number times of the half length of incident wave where two floating bodies are located at the opposite phases the incident wave length which gives minima and hump points of relative motion rao can be expressed as eq 24 24 λ m i n d n and λ h u m p d n 1 2 n 1 2 where λ m i n λ h u m p and d are the incident wave length which gives minima and hump points on the distance rao and the distance of the center of gravity of two floating bodies the tension rao of the hawsers are shown in fig 15 with comparison of experiments and numerical analysis the tension rao of the frequency domain analysis are computed as eq 25 25 r a o t e n s i o n ω k x h a w s e r r a o r m ω where r a o t e n s i o n ω r a o r m ω and k x h a w s e r are the load transfer function of hawser relative motion rao and longitudinal stiffness of the hawser respectively the raos of experiments and numerical time domain simulations were obtained by spectral analysis and zero upcrossing method the results show good agreements with each other the load transfer function of the hawser has a similar behavior of the relative horizontal motion responses of two floating bodies and the parallel hawsers has relatively higher values than the cross hawsers it is understood that the acting tension on the parallel hawsers is higher than the cross hawsers because the longitudinal stiffness of the parallel hawsers are relatively higher and the low frequency resonances are also observed from the results we can see that the frequency domain analysis is quite useful to predict dynamic load on the hawser and the low frequency resonances should be accounted more rigorously in time domain to estimate the load acting on the hawser 4 4 irregular waves typical examples of measured surge time series in irregular wave condition for the ta ndem arrangement are shown in fig 16 which are normalized by the significant wave height h 1 3 the measured surge time series of the tlp and semi submersible can be divided into three parts as eq 26 26 ξ t s ξ w a v e t s ξ ω 1 t s ξ ω 2 t s where ω 1 ω 2 where ξ t s ξ w a v e t s ξ ω 1 t s and ξ ω 2 t s are the original surge motion wave frequency motion and the low frequency motion with frequency component ω 1 ω 2 respectively to investigate the frequency components of measured motions the energy spectra of the surge motion are shown in fig 17 with the results of frequency and time domain simulation in the frequency domain the energy spectrum can be computed as eq 27 see fig 17 27 s r m ω s w a v e ω r a o r m ω 2 where s rm ω s wave ω and rao rm ω are the energy spectrum of the relative motion and the incident waves and rao of the relative motion the spectra shows that the two dominant low frequency motion peaks correspond to in phase and out of phase surge modes and the wave frequency components are shown in the spectra as well the magnitudes of low frequency components are relatively higher than those of the wave frequency to avoid the collision and the load acting on the hawser the relative motion between two floating bodies should be importantly considered the measured relative motion time series in the experiments is shown in fig 17 in the figure the relative motion time series has the components of wave frequency and low frequency but it has an only one dominant low frequency component unlike the results of surge motion of each floating bodies comparing with fig 16 the relative motion can be expressed as eq 28 ξ r ξ w a v e t ξ w a v e s ξ ω 1 t ξ ω 1 s ξ ω 2 t ξ ω 2 t ξ w a v e r ξ ω 1 r ξ ω 2 r 28 ξ w a v e r ξ ω 2 r where ξ r ξ w a v e r ξ ω 1 r and ξ ω 2 r are the relative motions which are the total the frequency of wave and the low frequency motion with frequency component ω 1 ω 2 in this case the motion magnitudes of two floating bodies of the in phase surge mode are similar as shown in fig 16 therefore the low frequency motion ω 1 of the tlp and semi submersible can be canceled out the relative motion spectrum with the results of the frequency and time domain simulation are given in fig 19 the relative motion spectra show that those are composed of wave frequency motion and low frequency motion the energy spectra show good agreements between the numerical simulation and the results of the frequency domain in wave frequency region while noticeable discrepancies in magnitude is observed in the components of the low frequency in phase surge mode the small denominator to calculate the rao in the frequency domain induces these differences the relative motion spectrum compared to the surge motion spectra of two floating bodies are shown in fig 20 the results show that the in phase surge mode doesn t give much effect on the relative motion but the magnitudes of the out of phase surge mode and the wave frequency component increase the increased relative motion could be dangerous because it causes the collision between two bodies and it also increases the load acting on the hawser because the natural frequency of coupled low frequency surge mode is closer to the wave frequency region than the single body surge mode low frequency motion resonance should be checked in a rigorous manner in which the modeling of the hawser and fully coupled low frequency motions are considered the time series of measured tensions of the hawser 1 ph 1 and hawser 3 ch 3 are shown in fig 21 together with the low pass filtered data very similar to the relative motion the tension acting on the hawser is composed of wave frequency components and long period horizontal motion and pretension the energy spectra of the hawser tensions are shown in fig 22 almost same behavior is observed with the relative motion 5 conclusion the complicated coupled motion characteristics of the tlp with tender semi submersible system were investigated by means of experiments and numerical analysis in the numerical approach both frequency and time domain approaches were attempted a fully coupled eigenvalue analysis considering hydrodynamic interactions and the mooring lines tendons and the coupling effect of hawser lines was carried out to identify low frequency coupled planar motion modes in the frequency domain a higher order boundary element method was employed for accurate and efficient calculation of coupled hydrodynamic forces between two floating bodies in close proximity the time domain simulation based on the cummins s method was applied with consideration of fully coupled effects between two bodies hawser tendon and mooring lines with nonlinear wave forces in the model experiments the verification of model set up was made for the single tlp by means of pullout tests and free decay test additional tests were carried out to obtain motion rao which proved numerical analyses and measured motion rao after the successful validation of the single tlp the tender semi submersible was installed placed beside the tlp with hawser then a series of model tests were conducted for the tlp tender semi submersible system coupled free decay tests rao test and irregular wave tests the complex behaviors of the horizontal motions of two floating bodies were identified from model tests eigenvalue analysis frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis in which coupled effects from hydrodynamic interactions hawsers mooring lines and tendons were included from the systematic comparison between model tests eigenvalue analysis numerical analyses both in frequency domain and time domain the following conclusions could be drawn the present coupled eigenvalue analysis model identified natural modes as well as corresponding natural periods this relatively simple approach will be able to provide an efficient tool to predict coupled motion characteristics of a production platform with a tender vessel system which can eventually be applicable to the optimal design of arrangement of tender vessel and hawser mooring system the generalized mode based frequency domain coupled analysis was applied to a tlp tender semi submersible platform system which could be used to provide a useful global performance analysis tool in preliminary design stage the present fully coupled time domain analysis model was proven to give quantitatively accurate results both in low frequency and wave frequency coupled motions which was validated through a series of model tests free decay test rao tests and irregular wave tests this simulation model can be applied to carry out the detail performance verification for the final design stage of the tlp tender semi submersible system meaningful findings from both model tests and numerical analyses are as follows the coupled low frequency motion periods of the tlp tender semi submersible platform are generally shorter than those of single body due to additional hawser and moorings between two bodies out of phase surge in phase and out of phase yaw were found to be more sensitive to hawser stiffness changes among them in phase yaw seems to be critical because the natural period is relatively close to wave frequency which needs special attention to avoid wave frequency resonance out of phase surge is a dominating mode to govern relative motion of the tlp tender semi submersible which should be checked and a design spiral for optimal design of connecting hawser and mooring system is required acknowledgements this work was partially

from 0 to 10 k n it is thus valuable to make the controllers control the uuv with good performance at such a large range of velocity values in this section the robust h infinity theory and results of the interpolation of the riccati equation solution are combined for the controller to produce a uuv at a large range of velocities 0 10 k n without losing the performance of the controller there are two highlights in our method first the controller is simplified as a function of the interpolation of the riccati equation solution without being influenced by other parameters second the linear parameter variable lpv model is used in our method instead of linearizing each operating points in a nonlinear model to construct the controller the combination of the uuv s lpv model and the interpolation theory provides a simple means of implementation to solve the problem of how to design a uuv controller for operations at a large range of velocities 3 2 2 controller design the assumption lpv model is 13 x a ρ x b ρ u y c ρ x d ρ u where ρ is the velocity of the uuv and its range of velocities is from 0 to 10 k n the uuv s lpv model is used to develop the design of the uuv s models on each operating point and the designed models can be obtain with different velocity we assume the range of velocity is λ v e l and the set of operating point is 14 λ u 0 u 1 u m where u i λ v e l i 0 1 m therefore the uuv model of the selected operating point is 15 x a ρ i x b ρ i u y c ρ i x d ρ i u where ρ i λ v e l the controller of the selected operating point ρ i λ v e l is based on the robust h infinity and the riccati method and the controller essentially depends on the solutions of the riccati equation k i f ℑ i p i is the ith h infinity controller on the set operating point in there ℑ i is the uuv s controlled object model on the ith operating point and p i is the solution of the riccati equation of the h infinity controller the advantage of this method is that through the uuv s lpv model the approximately accurate model on each operating points can be obtained thus the linearization process of the nonlinear model is simple the model ℑ i can be determined by ρ i once ρ i λ v e l is selected ℑ i is determined if ρ j ρ i ρ i 1 the controller k j can be calculated by using the ith controller k i and the i 1 th controller k i 1 by interpolating the solution p i of the riccati equation on ith operating point and the solution p i 1 of the riccati equation on i 1 th operating point the solution of the riccati equation on jth operating point can be obtained 16 p j 1 μ j p i μ j p i 1 μ j ρ j ρ i ρ i 1 ρ j where μ j 0 1 the h infinity controller k j f ℑ j p j on any operating point j can be calculated by p j and the state matrix of ℑ j 4 uuv motion control and simulation 4 1 uuv velocity control 4 1 1 uuv velocity controller model for the uuv longitudinal motion equation the center of gravity can be assumed to be at the origin x g y g and z g are 0 the values of v w p q r are rather small and the rudder s influence is negligible the uuv longitudinal motion model that can be used for designing the controller is 17 m 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 2 x p r o p d u where d u includes the linear approximation error uncertainty and outside interferences if the system input is bounded d u is bounded if the velocity is stable d u can be ignored a taylor series approximation of the first item of the right side of formula 17 is derived with excluding the higher order items resulting in the following 18 m 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u e 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 0 2 ρ

from 0 to 10 k n it is thus valuable to make the controllers control the uuv with good performance at such a large range of velocity values in this section the robust h infinity theory and results of the interpolation of the riccati equation solution are combined for the controller to produce a uuv at a large range of velocities 0 10 k n without losing the performance of the controller there are two highlights in our method first the controller is simplified as a function of the interpolation of the riccati equation solution without being influenced by other parameters second the linear parameter variable lpv model is used in our method instead of linearizing each operating points in a nonlinear model to construct the controller the combination of the uuv s lpv model and the interpolation theory provides a simple means of implementation to solve the problem of how to design a uuv controller for operations at a large range of velocities 3 2 2 controller design the assumption lpv model is 13 x a ρ x b ρ u y c ρ x d ρ u where ρ is the velocity of the uuv and its range of velocities is from 0 to 10 k n the uuv s lpv model is used to develop the design of the uuv s models on each operating point and the designed models can be obtain with different velocity we assume the range of velocity is λ v e l and the set of operating point is 14 λ u 0 u 1 u m where u i λ v e l i 0 1 m therefore the uuv model of the selected operating point is 15 x a ρ i x b ρ i u y c ρ i x d ρ i u where ρ i λ v e l the controller of the selected operating point ρ i λ v e l is based on the robust h infinity and the riccati method and the controller essentially depends on the solutions of the riccati equation k i f ℑ i p i is the ith h infinity controller on the set operating point in there ℑ i is the uuv s controlled object model on the ith operating point and p i is the solution of the riccati equation of the h infinity controller the advantage of this method is that through the uuv s lpv model the approximately accurate model on each operating points can be obtained thus the linearization process of the nonlinear model is simple the model ℑ i can be determined by ρ i once ρ i λ v e l is selected ℑ i is determined if ρ j ρ i ρ i 1 the controller k j can be calculated by using the ith controller k i and the i 1 th controller k i 1 by interpolating the solution p i of the riccati equation on ith operating point and the solution p i 1 of the riccati equation on i 1 th operating point the solution of the riccati equation on jth operating point can be obtained 16 p j 1 μ j p i μ j p i 1 μ j ρ j ρ i ρ i 1 ρ j where μ j 0 1 the h infinity controller k j f ℑ j p j on any operating point j can be calculated by p j and the state matrix of ℑ j 4 uuv motion control and simulation 4 1 uuv velocity control 4 1 1 uuv velocity controller model for the uuv longitudinal motion equation the center of gravity can be assumed to be at the origin x g y g and z g are 0 the values of v w p q r are rather small and the rudder s influence is negligible the uuv longitudinal motion model that can be used for designing the controller is 17 m 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 2 x p r o p d u where d u includes the linear approximation error uncertainty and outside interferences if the system input is bounded d u is bounded if the velocity is stable d u can be ignored a taylor series approximation of the first item of the right side of formula 17 is derived with excluding the higher order items resulting in the following 18 m 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u e 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 0 2 ρ

the controller 5 uuv experiment the uuv in the experiment has up down left and right thrusters two rudders two elevators and four auxiliary thrusters the experiment was conducted in a lake in this experiment the controlling tests of velocity heading and depth were carried out to verify the feasibility of the controllers 5 1 uuv velocity control experiment for the velocity control experiment the left and right thrusters were used to drive the uuv the results for when the velocity was 1kn are presented in figs 11 13 the results for when the velocity was 2kn are presented in figs 14 16 the above results show that when the surge linear velocities of the uuv were 1 k n and 2 k n the stable control accuracies were 0 m s and 0 01 m s respectively these indexes are far better than the control accuracy index of 0 2 k n therefore the designed velocity controller is effective 5 2 uuv heading control experiment for the heading control experiment the heading was controlled by two rudders the results for when the velocity was 2kn are presented in figs 17 19 the results for when the velocity was 3kn are presented in figs 20 22 the above results show that when the velocity is 2 k n the stable control error was 0 9 when the velocity was 3 k n the stable control error was 0 6 these two control errors were smaller than the control accuracy index of 2 therefore the heading controller had good control performance and is thus useful for uuv heading control 5 3 uuv depth experiment for the depth control experiment the velocity of the uuv was 3 k n and the depth was controlled by two elevators the results are presented in figs 23 25 the above results show that when the velocity of the uuv was 3 k n the stable depth control error was 0 9 m this control error was smaller than the control accuracy index of 2 m indicating that the depth controller was effective for controlling the depth of the uuv on the basis of the results from the velocity heading and depth control experiments the developed h infinity controllers which are based on the predicted hydrodynamic coefficients are feasible effective and robust 6 conclusion in this paper the robust h infinity control theory and the interpolation of the riccati equation solution are used to design the velocity heading and depth controllers the simulations and experiments in a lake were conducted to test and

23457,floating offshore wind turbine fowt is always in a more complex environmental condition than onshore horizontal axis wind turbine hawt the platform motions especially pitch and surge motions increase aerodynamic unsteadiness wake interactions and other complex flow phenomena these conditions influence the velocities and accelerations at the rotor sections along the blade in the recent

this phenomenon in detail keywords fowt unsteady aerodynamic characteristics wake performance cfd method 1 introduction in the early wind energy development was concentrated in land however as wind power technology gradually extended from land to sea offshore wind energy development has become the important direction of the global wind power industry floating offshore wind turbine is always in a more complex environmental condition than onshore hawt the unsteady aerodynamic performance of floating offshore wind turbine is associated with platform motions surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw illustrated in fig 1 seen in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate x y z is at cg of the fowt and moving with the floater meanwhile the origin of the coordinate x y z is at the hub center and rotating

oblique flow conditions on a rotor turbine rotor wake interactions and influence the unsteady aerodynamics of the rotor unsteady aerodynamics effects can be split into mainly two parts unsteady profile aerodynamics and dynamic inflow effects second an effective wind shear or gradient across the rotor disk will be occurred due to angular motions what s more as a result of unsteady flows arising from a platform derived effective wind component rapid local velocity changes the platform motion produced an effective velocity contribution with respect to the rotor as shown in equation 1 here i ˆ j ˆ k ˆ are the coordinates of a point in the flow field in the rotor reference frame which means the same direction of x y z in fig 1 1 u p l a t f o r m u s u r g e θ p i t c h z θ y a w y

influence the control system like generator torque or independent blade pitch maybe used to reduce the peak cyclical loads however tuning these systems needs an accurate aerodynamic simulation capability most design and dynamics study of floating offshore wind turbine is to assume that the aerodynamic analysis methods used in the onshore or conventional offshore wind turbine are also suitable for floating offshore wind turbine but this hypothesis may be not accurate they may be in violation of the original formula assumes for example using blade element momentum bem theory and generalized dynamic wake gdw method it supposed potential energy conservation of blades due to the limitation of this method this may not be valid for fowt so the rationality of the results obtained from these assumptions is doubtful additionally modern large blades are of increased flexibility allowing for larger tip deflections the platform motions make the rotor blades precipitous drop in wind speed which leads tip speed ratios increasing as the rotor blade begins to pitch back it interacts with its own wake which develops the turbulent region these contain the normal working state nws the turbulent wake state tws the vortex ring state vbs and the windmill braking state wbs fig 2 illustrates how various flow states occur when the floating platform undergoes pitching motion minu et al 2014 the different aerodynamic performance between fixed and floating wind turbine lead to researching into fowt see for example musial et al 2004 several prototype concepts have been deployed for example hywind a spar design floating wind turbine in this study phase iv of the iea annex xxiii offshore code comparison collaboration jonkman 2010 which considered the spar buoy concept is chosen to show the critical effects of unsteady aerodynamic loads because of platform motion due to the increasing of tower height the slight motion of the floating platform will cause large motion of wind turbine which makes the power of wind turbine fluctuate significantly and aerodynamic characteristics of blade more obvious numerous parameters such as output power and blade load characteristics are key to the performance of fowt and this study also aims at calculating the induction factors with the data obtained from complete cfd simulations than bem the most common aerodynamic characteristic analysis technology and limitation will be outlined and some formulation assumption will be confirmed cfd will be utilized to simulate the response of fowt undergoing various platform motions with different operating conditions these results are used to establish a better understanding of the aerodynamic performance of floating offshore wind turbine and to determine when it may not be right to analyse these assumptions applying a simple method therefore studying the effect of platform motions on power fluctuation and blade load is meaningful to master the specific characteristics of fowt and design the floating platform 2 numerical modelling 2 1 case conditions in this paper we choose three different platform pitching frequencies and angles below rated rated and severe sea state the simulation motion can be identified as a simple harmonic platform motion the simulation of the operating condition is defined by a wind speed of 8 m s and 11 m s and a rotor speed of 9 16 min 1and 12 1 min 1 respectively thanhtoan et al 2014 the inputs are divided into four distinct regions corresponding with four quadrants of the wave phase space for comparison r1 wave crest is at maximum downstream velocity and mean positions r2 mean wave height decreasing is at zero stream wise velocity and maximum downstream platform positions r3 wave trough is at maximum upstream velocity and mean position and r4 mean wave height increasing is at zero stream wise velocity and maximum upstream position the case conditions are shown in table 1 used to set up the cfd simulations is computed by fast code jonkman and buhl 2005 fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence code with aerodyn and hydrodyn is an open comprehensive aero elastic and time based numerical simulation tool capable of modelling the dynamics and performance of a wind turbine system from wind data and the physical properties of two and three bladed horizontal axis wind turbines hawts developed by the national renewable energy laboratory aerodyn uses two modes for calculating the effect of wind turbine wakes the blade element momentum bem theory and the generalized dynamic wake gdw theory bem theory is one of the most commonly used aerodynamic analysis methods for many wind turbine designers to solve tip and hub losses effects of high tip speed ratios dynamic stall and non axisymmetric flow factor corrections are required to modify the bem theory including the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model at wind speeds below 8 m s gdw theory is a more recent model useful for modelling skewed and unsteady wake dynamics for higher wind speed according to the pitt and peters method of dynamic inflow derivatives and is based on a potential flow solution to laplace s equation the induced velocities in the rotor plane are described by a system of first order differential equations jonkman and buhl 2005 in table 1 u ω hs tp means the average velocity of wind speed the rotating speed of the blade the significant wave height and the peak periodic of the wave respectively moreover the case output values are given in table 2 amplitude is mean amplitude of the platform motion aerodynamic performance with different platform motions is compared with fast results pitch surge and pitch surge combined motions are calculated separately to detect the platform motions effect on the rotor blade 2 2 simulation settings the specific profiles of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and spar are open to public jonkman et al 2009 we choose k omega sst turbulence model in this simulation the motion technique called rigid body motion is applied to simulate the moving rotor blade and platform motions the pitching and surging motion of a platform is provided by the following equations

dimension of 1291 630 l d and extends 5 5 and 15 times the rotor diameter in the negative upstream and positive downstream x direction respectively see as fig 3 all regions apply prism layer surface remesher and trimmer mesh methods for blade surface a refine grid is obtained at the leading edge with a maximum and minimum grid size c grid type mesh is inserted into the blade domains figs 4 and 5 show computational meshes for the upwind three bladed turbines which illustrate the grid density around the rotor and steady regions the blade surface mesh resolution near the tip region is illustrated in fig 6 2 3 induction factors with cfd results the axial and tangential induction factors are two most important factors that a bem code calculates iteratively the axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a are defined as follows 4 a 1 u x u 5 a u θ r ω where velocities u x and u θ are the velocities which are intrinsically calculated as part of solution iteration the cfd based approach to calculate the induction factors is a first step towards the verification of these values when complex turbine motions are involved the approach involves the calculation of the forces on the wind turbine blades with high fidelity cfd simulations and extracts the elemental force values these values compare with the forces from the bem equations and the induction factors are derived the two equations used for the above mentioned approach are the thrust and the torque equations elemental torque df and the elemental thrust dt equations used in bem along with the loss factors f are given in equations 6 and 7 respectively here r means the radius of blade rotor ρ means the density of air u means the velocity of wind and ω means the rotor angular speed 6 d t 4 π r 3 d r ρ u f 1 a a 7 d f 4 π r d r ρ u 2 f 1 a a both axial and tangential induction factors a and a can be evaluated using the two equations 4 and 5 the axial induction factors were calculated by equating the thrust equations with the elemental thrust values obtained with cfd as indicated in equation 8 there are two solutions possible for the induction factors with the thrust equation the choice of the solution for the induction factor is quite clear in the thrust equation as one root is 0 5 and the other is 0 5 all the roots 0 5 were chosen in compliance with fast the axial induction factors thus obtained were used to the elemental torque equation and equated with the elemental torque values obtained from cfd data to calculate the tangential induction factors as given by equation 9 8 a 1 a d f

11 f h 2 π cos 1 e f h where f h b r r h u b 2 r s i n ϕ b is the number of blades r is the rotor radius r is the elemental radius and φ is the local flow angle 2 4 reduced frequency analysis for a floating offshore wind turbine the platform motion surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw may cause an aerodynamic unsteadiness a dimensionless metric reduced frequency k is often used to characteristic the degree of unsteadiness of an aerodynamic system the reduced frequency is defined as equation 12 where ω c and v mean rotator angular speed airfoil chord and velocity respectively 12 k ωc 2 v according to theodorsen s theory the ranges of k can be divided into steady quasi steady unsteady and highly unsteady regions as oscillating airfoils the degree of flow unsteadiness as determined by reduced frequency is shown in table 3 the local overall velocity of wind turbine blade section is defined as equation 13 it is a resultant velocity of wind velocity component u and rotor angular speed ω 13 v u 2 rω 2 equation 13 may be substituted into equation 12 where c is the local blade chord and is a function of r 14 k ω c r 2 u 2 rω 2 sebastian and lackner 2012 illustrates the cut in rated and cut out reduced frequency curves for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine see fig 7 with the use of the nrel 5 mw turbine at rated operating conditions as an example an oscillation of 0 1 hz would yield unsteady loading for the inboard quarter span of the blade whereas an oscillation of 0 04 hz would be expected to be aerodynamically quasi steady throughout the span 3 wind turbine wakes in the near wake area which is usually described as two to four times of the rotor diameter much of the periodic nature of the flow is lost and tip vortices diffuse and turbulence and velocity profiles are more evenly distributed due to diffusion of turbulence and vorticity generated at the rotor turbines downwind of other units will experience higher turbulence levels due to producing upwind machines this increased turbulence results in larger loads and material fatigue which reduce turbine lifetime the energy capture is also reduced because of the increased turbulence levels and the lower mean wind speed for downstream units but the steady state load is reduced due to the lower mean velocity of the flow erich 2006 3 1 wake expansion a wind turbine extract kinetic energy is from the wind and therefore reduces the mean velocity of the flow passing through the rotor assuming that the mass affected is completely separated from the surrounding air and does not experience any boundary effects a stream tube can be constructed which illustrate the air passing a wind turbine see fig 8 as the air passes through the rotor both velocity and static pressure is reduced since the air is not compressed and the mass flow rate in the stream tube remains the same the cross sectional area of the streamtube must expand due to the lower air velocity the part of the streamtube in fig 8 that continues downstream from the rotor is what is known as the wake as the wake extends downstream of the rotor the centreline velocity deficit decrease and the width increase ainslie 1998 the growth rate dr dx can be used to describe how much the wake expands when moving downstream leonardo and porté agel 2009 when the thrust coefficient increases the expansion of the wake increases low velocities will cause a large jump in velocity from u1 to u4 in fig 8 this will again result in a turbulent wake state which is a formation of eddies that brings momentum in to the wake from the outer flow martin 2008 the rotor thrust coefficient has a large influence on the extent of the wake due to the significant influence on the loss of impulse behind the rotor the wake behind the rotor is also dependent on the turbine operating conditions as for instance the tip speed ratio blade pitch angle etc 3 2 wake rotation when air is passing the rotor disc it experience a torque this is the origin for the power production and rotation of the blades an equal and opposite torque is required due to newton s third law and this causes the wake to rotate in the opposite direction to that of the rotor due to the wake rotation there will be a tangential velocity component which increase the kinetic energy in the wake this is compensated for by a drop in the static pressure of the air in addition to the reduction in static pressure when the wind passes through the rotor wake rotation in a streamtube is illustrated in fig 9 3 3 wake with yaw angle the rotor acts like a disc seen from a global perspective and when the incoming wind is not perpendicular to the rotor plane there will be a discontinuity in the pressure drop across the disc the pressure drop generates the thrust which again induce a velocity normal to the rotor plane that deflects the wake as shown in fig 10 hence it follows that when the rotor plane is not perpendicular to the incoming wind flow the wake will be asymmetric this results in the downwind part of the rotor being closer to the wake centreline and experience higher induced velocities and forces 4 results and discussion classical bem characterise the airfoil sections in terms of parameters describing local flow and forces these include the sectional angle of attack aoa axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a lift cl and drag cd coefficients normal cn and tangential ct induction coefficients cfd results can be inspected to achieve these airfoil parameters though the definition of some of them makes evaluation somewhat ambiguous 4 1 grid sensitivity the verification is to confirm that we solve the equation correctly by checking if the solutions are consistent with the governing equations and initial and boundary conditions that have been used the accuracy of numerical results significantly depends on the number of grids chosen for each problem thus the proper grid system is needed to be verified before large numerical cases to be simulated international towing tank conference ittc defined the uncertainty analysis method in cfd ittc 2008 verification is defined as a process for assessing simulation numerical uncertainty u sn and when conditions permit estimating the sign and magnitude δ s n of the simulation numerical error itself and the uncertainty in that error estimate u scn for the uncorrected simulation approach numerical error is decomposed into contributions from iteration number δ i grid size δ g time step δ t and other parameters δ p which gives the following expression for

index gci method in the gci approach roache 1994 the uncertainty u i 18 is defined using the error estimate from richardson extrapolation re multiplied by a factor of safety f s to band simulation error 18 u i f s δ r e i 1 where δ r e i 1 is based on a single term estimate as given by 19 with either assumed or estimated observed order of accuracy if the order of accuracy is assumed e g based

solution is corrected with an error estimate from re as 20 u i f s 1 δ r e i 1 the turbine condition at wind speed 8 m s is considered for this study three grades of mesh refinement are used shown in table 4 five interrogation points are arbitrarily used at different locations in the flow field in order to find the gci at these locations the axial velocity is considered in this analysis table 5 shows various quantities of interest including the gci for all points considered from a to e the coordinates of the points are also shown in fig 11 values of the gci all fall below 6 which is acceptable for this work through common practice the gci is acceptable below 10 the gci from other papers for example zhi rong 2010 ismail et al 2008 tahsin et al 2015 are all around 10 which give support for this hypothesis this ensured that the level of grid refinement is enough to ensure that the solution is independent of the grid size 4 2 validation first validate cfd results with fast at three different conditions described in table 3 it can be shown from figs 12 14 that power and thrust with cfd data has a similar trend with fast results bem under estimates results than that of cfd while generalized dynamic wake gdw another method in fast has a good agreement with cfd 4 3 unsteady aerodynamic effect compared with onshore and floating offshore to investigate how the aerodynamic torque distribution varies along the blade span the blade is segmented into 17 span wises shown in fig 15 we investigate sectional thrust and power compared between the floating offshore and onshore wind turbine and the cfd approach and fast code as shown in figs 16 and 17 as can be observed in figures the largest forces occur at 3 4 blade which is agreed with the theory compared with the cfd result first at low wind speed below rated 8 m s the platform pitch motion makes the flow complex which increasing the aerodynamic load however at around rated wind speed 11 4 m s the phenomenon is reversed the platform motion makes the negative effect which decreasing the thrust and power then data from fast code show a big difference the results do not vary a lot when the wind turbine got a pitch motion because the bem method cannot predict the platform motion effect on the aerodynamic performance of the rotor accurately overall fast code underestimates the results than cfd approach particularly near the blade tip this may be due to the fact that the loads here are influenced significantly by the tip loss factors used along with the bem equations the angle of attack along the blade is shown in fig 18 compared with the onshore consequences the biggest difference is indicated at 15 m of the blade moreover the difference between cfd and bem is larger than that of onshore condition it is proved again that bem may not predict the aerodynamic performance in a complicated motion condition the axial induction factors are obtained by equating the bem based thrust equations with the cfd thrust data for every element these values are later substituted into the bem based power equations and equated with the cfd power values at each element to obtain the tangential induction factors for each element the plots comparing the axial and tangential induction factors are given in fig 19 for two different wind cases the variation in the axial induction factors near the tip arises owing to the variation of thrust it may result in the tip loss factors included in the bem code also a slight variation in the axial and tangential induction factors is noticed near the hub this is explained by the factor that there is no hub in the cfd based calculations overall further investigations for prediction the validity of the tip loss factors and enhancing the same for fowt applications are needed 4 4 unsteady aerodynamic effect with different platform motions pitch and surge motions will cause a phase difference in a real situation fig 20 shows power results using cfd methods in different phase angles of pitch and surge we can discover that the times to get the maximum and minimum point are different here 180 are chosen to compare with other platform motions figs 21 23 are power and thrust curves from cfd results at different wind speeds compared with discrete platform motions pitch and surge motion shows the similar power and thrust results however power and thrust results of pitch surge combined motion are larger obviously at the maximum point especially in the severe sea condition the difference between maximum and minimum point is larger as well 4 5 wake evolution and induction according to fig 24 we can find that the wake spreads about two times of the radius strong tip and hub vortices are shown in figs 25 and 26 notice that the vortices cannot be resolved beyond x r 1 the trailing vortices exhibit the same characteristics as the tip vortices with very slight radial oscillatory motion compared with the onshore vortices the hub vortices are more clearly contour plots of the resulting velocity field at hub and tip during different time instances of 0 4 t 1 4 t 2 4 t and 3 4 t where t is the motion period are shown in fig 27 compared with the onshore wind turbine the velocity is tilted the velocity flow varies from discrete time instances axial velocity of lateral traverses at x d 1 and 2 of four different times is shown in fig 28 which provides insight on the general wake behaviour downstream of the rotor the variation results arise it is asymmetric and varies with time which is different from the onshore condition figs 29 and 30 describe the horizontal profiles at a severe sea condition to achieve the results first get a velocity circle line at the different chosen position and then there will be two different velocities at the same distance therefore we can see two points at the same position in figs 29 and 30 from this it is possible to see some of the wake development wake width increase with streamwise distance from the rotor plane as the wake width increase downstream the velocity deficit decrease the axial velocity of the onshore rotor plane is almost similar with the freestream velocity this indicates that there is little interaction between the airflow and rotor and most of the air passes through without being disturbed by the wind turbine blades since large part of the air flows past the turbine without being affected by the rotor less energy is extracted from the flow the farther the distance the bigger the difference in the two sides is compared with onshore wind turbine the axial velocity profiles of floating condition show more complicated the unit axial velocity differs with inflow velocities the larger the inflow velocity the larger the wake expansion is another two conditions below and rated condition are presented as well in figs 31 and 32 and figs 33 and 34 respectively time history of turbulent velocities for 2 points located at approximately hub height and center of the turbine y 0 m and z 90 m and at different non dimensional axial locations including the inlet of the simulation domain in fig 35 positions at 1 m and 5 m are chosen to avoid the influence of the rotor and to ensure that the stream tube is not broken down due to viscous dissipation it can be seen that for all locations the 3 velocities components fluctuate randomly around their expected mean velocities 11 m s for u and 8 m s for v and w the figure essentially shows that the turbulent field solved by cfd with the explicit wind turbulence at the inlet is appropriately transported through the whole simulation domain throughout the simulation but turbulence decay due to viscous losses mentioned previously is observed as velocities closer to the inlet tend to have larger fluctuations than more downstream locations 5 conclusion pitch surge and pitch surge combined motions are calculated separately to detect the platform motions effect on the rotor blade cfd results have a difference with bem data moreover element power and thrust are compared with onshore and floating offshore wind turbine the largest forces occur at the 3 4 blade radius which is in agreement with the theory at below rated wind speed 8 m s compared the cfd results with fowt and onshore wind turbine the power and thrust of fowt is larger than that of onshore wind turbine therefore the platform motion makes an advantage effect on the aerodynamic load however at around rated wind speed 11 4 m s the phenomenon is reversed what s more the variation in the axial induction and tangential induction factors near the tip and blade arises third strong tip and hub vortices are set out compared with the onshore wind turbine the velocity is tilted the velocity flow varies from discrete time instances axial velocity is asymmetric and varies with time which is different from the onshore condition compared with onshore wind turbine the axial velocity profiles of floating offshore condition show more complicated the unit axial velocity differs with inflow velocities the larger the inflow velocity the larger the wake expansion is moreover point velocities components fluctuate randomly around their expected mean velocities 11 m s for u and 8 m s for v and w velocities closer to the inlet tend to have larger fluctuations than more downstream locations future floating offshore wind turbine designs should strive to either minimize platform motions or be complementarity optimized via higher fidelity aerodynamic analysis techniques to account for them it is estimated that this paper is the first in depth study of floating offshore wind turbine aerodynamics and the applicability of various analysis methods

influence the control system like generator torque or independent blade pitch maybe used to reduce the peak cyclical loads however tuning these systems needs an accurate aerodynamic simulation capability most design and dynamics study of floating offshore wind turbine is to assume that the aerodynamic analysis methods used in the onshore or conventional offshore wind turbine are also suitable for floating offshore wind turbine but this hypothesis may be not accurate they may be in violation of the original formula assumes for example using blade element momentum bem theory and generalized dynamic wake gdw method it supposed potential energy conservation of blades due to the limitation of this method this may not be valid for fowt so the rationality of the results obtained from these assumptions is doubtful additionally modern large blades are of increased flexibility allowing for larger tip deflections the platform motions make the rotor blades precipitous drop in wind speed which leads tip speed ratios increasing as the rotor blade begins to pitch back it interacts with its own wake which develops the turbulent region these contain the normal working state nws the turbulent wake state tws the vortex ring state vbs and the windmill braking state wbs fig 2 illustrates how various flow states occur when the floating platform undergoes pitching motion minu et al 2014 the different aerodynamic performance between fixed and floating wind turbine lead to researching into fowt see for example musial et al 2004 several prototype concepts have been deployed for example hywind a spar design floating wind turbine in this study phase iv of the iea annex xxiii offshore code comparison collaboration jonkman 2010 which considered the spar buoy concept is chosen to show the critical effects of unsteady aerodynamic loads because of platform motion due to the increasing of tower height the slight motion of the floating platform will cause large motion of wind turbine which makes the power of wind turbine fluctuate significantly and aerodynamic characteristics of blade more obvious numerous parameters such as output power and blade load characteristics are key to the performance of fowt and this study also aims at calculating the induction factors with the data obtained from complete cfd simulations than bem the most common aerodynamic characteristic analysis technology and limitation will be outlined and some formulation assumption will be confirmed cfd will be utilized to simulate the response of fowt undergoing various platform motions with different operating conditions these results are used to establish a better understanding of the aerodynamic performance of floating offshore wind turbine and to determine when it may not be right to analyse these assumptions applying a simple method therefore studying the effect of platform motions on power fluctuation and blade load is meaningful to master the specific characteristics of fowt and design the floating platform 2 numerical modelling 2 1 case conditions in this paper we choose three different platform pitching frequencies and angles below rated rated and severe sea state the simulation motion can be identified as a simple harmonic platform motion the simulation of the operating condition is defined by a wind speed of 8 m s and 11 m s and a rotor speed of 9 16 min 1and 12 1 min 1 respectively thanhtoan et al 2014 the inputs are divided into four distinct regions corresponding with four quadrants of the wave phase space for comparison r1 wave crest is at maximum downstream velocity and mean positions r2 mean wave height decreasing is at zero stream wise velocity and maximum downstream platform positions r3 wave trough is at maximum upstream velocity and mean position and r4 mean wave height increasing is at zero stream wise velocity and maximum upstream position the case conditions are shown in table 1 used to set up the cfd simulations is computed by fast code jonkman and buhl 2005 fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence code with aerodyn and hydrodyn is an open comprehensive aero elastic and time based numerical simulation tool capable of modelling the dynamics and performance of a wind turbine system from wind data and the physical properties of two and three bladed horizontal axis wind turbines hawts developed by the national renewable energy laboratory aerodyn uses two modes for calculating the effect of wind turbine wakes the blade element momentum bem theory and the generalized dynamic wake gdw theory bem theory is one of the most commonly used aerodynamic analysis methods for many wind turbine designers to solve tip and hub losses effects of high tip speed ratios dynamic stall and non axisymmetric flow factor corrections are required to modify the bem theory including the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model at wind speeds below 8 m s gdw theory is a more recent model useful for modelling skewed and unsteady wake dynamics for higher wind speed according to the pitt and peters method of dynamic inflow derivatives and is based on a potential flow solution to laplace s equation the induced velocities in the rotor plane are described by a system of first order differential equations jonkman and buhl 2005 in table 1 u ω hs tp means the average velocity of wind speed the rotating speed of the blade the significant wave height and the peak periodic of the wave respectively moreover the case output values are given in table 2 amplitude is mean amplitude of the platform motion aerodynamic performance with different platform motions is compared with fast results pitch surge and pitch surge combined motions are calculated separately to detect the platform motions effect on the rotor blade 2 2 simulation settings the specific profiles of nrel 5 mw wind turbine and spar are open to public jonkman et al 2009 we choose k omega sst turbulence model in this simulation the motion technique called rigid body motion is applied to simulate the moving rotor blade and platform motions the pitching and surging motion of a platform is provided by the following equations

remesher and trimmer mesh methods for blade surface a refine grid is obtained at the leading edge with a maximum and minimum grid size c grid type mesh is inserted into the blade domains figs 4 and 5 show computational meshes for the upwind three bladed turbines which illustrate the grid density around the rotor and steady regions the blade surface mesh resolution near the tip region is illustrated in fig 6 2 3 induction factors with cfd results the axial and tangential induction factors are two most important factors that a bem code calculates iteratively the axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a are defined as follows 4 a 1 u x u 5 a u θ r ω where velocities u x and u θ are the velocities which are intrinsically calculated as part of solution iteration the cfd based approach to calculate the induction factors is a first step towards the verification of these values when complex turbine motions are involved the approach involves the calculation of the forces on the wind turbine blades with high fidelity cfd simulations and extracts the elemental force values these values compare with the forces from the bem equations and the induction factors are derived the two equations used for the above mentioned approach are the thrust and the torque equations elemental torque df and the elemental thrust dt equations used in bem along with the loss factors f are given in equations 6 and 7 respectively here r means the radius of blade rotor ρ means the density of air u means the velocity of wind and ω means the rotor angular speed 6 d t 4 π r 3 d r ρ u f 1 a a 7 d f 4 π r d r ρ u 2 f 1 a a both axial and tangential induction factors a and a can be evaluated using the two equations 4 and 5 the axial induction factors were calculated by equating the thrust equations with the elemental thrust values obtained with cfd as indicated in equation 8 there are two solutions possible for the induction factors with the thrust equation the choice of the solution for the induction factor is quite clear in the thrust equation as one root is 0 5 and the other is 0 5 all the roots 0 5 were chosen in compliance with fast the axial induction factors thus obtained were used to the elemental torque equation and equated with the elemental torque values obtained from cfd data to calculate the tangential induction factors as given by equation 9 8 a 1 a d f

11 f h 2 π cos 1 e f h where f h b r r h u b 2 r s i n ϕ b is the number of blades r is the rotor radius r is the elemental radius and φ is the local flow angle 2 4 reduced frequency analysis for a floating offshore wind turbine the platform motion surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw may cause an aerodynamic unsteadiness a dimensionless metric reduced frequency k is often used to characteristic the degree of unsteadiness of an aerodynamic system the reduced frequency is defined as equation 12 where ω c and v mean rotator angular speed airfoil chord and velocity respectively 12 k ωc 2 v according to theodorsen s theory the ranges of k can be divided into steady quasi steady unsteady and highly unsteady regions as oscillating airfoils the degree of flow unsteadiness as determined by reduced frequency is shown in table 3 the local overall velocity of wind turbine blade section is defined as equation 13 it is a resultant velocity of wind velocity component u and rotor angular speed ω 13 v u 2 rω 2 equation 13 may be substituted into equation 12 where c is the local blade chord and is a function of r 14 k ω c r 2 u 2 rω 2 sebastian and lackner 2012 illustrates the cut in rated and cut out reduced frequency curves for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine see fig 7 with the use of the nrel 5 mw turbine at rated operating conditions as an example an oscillation of 0 1 hz would yield unsteady loading for the inboard quarter span of the blade whereas an oscillation of 0 04 hz would be expected to be aerodynamically quasi steady throughout the span 3 wind turbine wakes in the near wake area which is usually described as two to four times of the rotor diameter much of the periodic nature of the flow is lost and tip vortices diffuse and turbulence and velocity profiles are more evenly distributed due to diffusion of turbulence and vorticity generated at the rotor turbines downwind of other units will experience higher turbulence levels due to producing upwind machines this increased turbulence results in larger loads and material fatigue which reduce turbine lifetime the energy capture is also reduced because of the increased turbulence levels and the lower mean wind speed for downstream units but the steady state load is reduced due to the lower mean velocity of the flow erich 2006 3 1 wake expansion a wind turbine extract kinetic energy is from the wind and therefore reduces the mean velocity of the flow passing through the rotor assuming that the mass affected is completely separated from the surrounding air and does not experience any boundary effects a stream tube can be constructed which illustrate the air passing a wind turbine see fig 8 as the air passes through the rotor both velocity and static pressure is reduced since the air is not compressed and the mass flow rate in the stream tube remains the same the cross sectional area of the streamtube must expand due to the lower air velocity the part of the streamtube in fig 8 that continues downstream from the rotor is what is known as the wake as the wake extends downstream of the rotor the centreline velocity deficit decrease and the width increase ainslie 1998 the growth rate dr dx can be used to describe how much the wake expands when moving downstream leonardo and porté agel 2009 when the thrust coefficient increases the expansion of the wake increases low velocities will cause a large jump in velocity from u1 to u4 in fig 8 this will again result in a turbulent wake state which is a formation of eddies that brings momentum in to the wake from the outer flow martin 2008 the rotor thrust coefficient has a large influence on the extent of the wake due to the significant influence on the loss of impulse behind the rotor the wake behind the rotor is also dependent on the turbine operating conditions as for instance the tip speed ratio blade pitch angle etc 3 2 wake rotation when air is passing the rotor disc it experience a torque this is the origin for the power production and rotation of the blades an equal and opposite torque is required due to newton s third law and this causes the wake to rotate in the opposite direction to that of the rotor due to the wake rotation there will be a tangential velocity component which increase the kinetic energy in the wake this is compensated for by a drop in the static pressure of the air in addition to the reduction in static pressure when the wind passes through the rotor wake rotation in a streamtube is illustrated in fig 9 3 3 wake with yaw angle the rotor acts like a disc seen from a global perspective and when the incoming wind is not perpendicular to the rotor plane there will be a discontinuity in the pressure drop across the disc the pressure drop generates the thrust which again induce a velocity normal to the rotor plane that deflects the wake as shown in fig 10 hence it follows that when the rotor plane is not perpendicular to the incoming wind flow the wake will be asymmetric this results in the downwind part of the rotor being closer to the wake centreline and experience higher induced velocities and forces 4 results and discussion classical bem characterise the airfoil sections in terms of parameters describing local flow and forces these include the sectional angle of attack aoa axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a lift cl and drag cd coefficients normal cn and tangential ct induction coefficients cfd results can be inspected to achieve these airfoil parameters though the definition of some of them makes evaluation somewhat ambiguous 4 1 grid sensitivity the verification is to confirm that we solve the equation correctly by checking if the solutions are consistent with the governing equations and initial and boundary conditions that have been used the accuracy of numerical results significantly depends on the number of grids chosen for each problem thus the proper grid system is needed to be verified before large numerical cases to be simulated international towing tank conference ittc defined the uncertainty analysis method in cfd ittc 2008 verification is defined as a process for assessing simulation numerical uncertainty u sn and when conditions permit estimating the sign and magnitude δ s n of the simulation numerical error itself and the uncertainty in that error estimate u scn for the

solution is corrected with an error estimate from re as 20 u i f s 1 δ r e i 1 the turbine condition at wind speed 8 m s is considered for this study three grades of mesh refinement are used shown in table 4 five interrogation points are arbitrarily used at different locations in the flow field in order to find the gci at these locations the axial velocity is considered in this analysis table 5 shows various quantities of interest including the gci for all points considered from a to e the coordinates of the points are also shown in fig 11 values of the gci all fall below 6 which is acceptable for this work through common practice the gci is acceptable below 10 the gci from other papers for example zhi rong 2010 ismail et al 2008 tahsin et al 2015 are all around 10 which give support for this hypothesis this ensured that the level of grid refinement is enough to ensure that the solution is independent of the grid size 4 2 validation first validate cfd results with fast at three different conditions described in table 3 it can be shown from figs 12 14 that power and thrust with cfd data has a similar trend with fast results bem under estimates results than that of cfd while generalized dynamic wake gdw another method in fast has a good agreement with cfd 4 3 unsteady aerodynamic effect compared with onshore and floating offshore to investigate how the aerodynamic torque distribution varies along the blade span the blade is segmented into 17 span wises shown in fig 15 we investigate sectional thrust and power compared between the floating offshore and onshore wind turbine and the cfd approach and fast code as shown in figs 16 and 17 as can be observed in figures the largest forces occur at 3 4 blade which is agreed with the theory compared with the cfd result first at low wind speed below rated 8 m s the platform pitch motion makes the flow complex which increasing the aerodynamic load however at around rated wind speed 11 4 m s the phenomenon is reversed the platform motion makes the negative effect which decreasing the thrust and power then data from fast code show a big difference the results do not vary a lot when the wind turbine got a pitch motion because the bem method cannot predict the platform motion effect on the aerodynamic performance of the rotor accurately overall fast code underestimates the results than cfd approach particularly near the blade tip this may be due to the fact that the loads here are influenced significantly by the tip loss factors used along with the bem equations the angle of attack along the blade is shown in fig 18 compared with the onshore consequences the biggest difference is indicated at 15 m of the blade moreover the difference between cfd and bem is larger than that of onshore condition it is proved again that bem may not predict the aerodynamic performance in a complicated motion condition the axial induction factors are obtained by equating the bem based thrust equations with the cfd thrust data for every element these values are later substituted into the bem based power equations and equated with the cfd power values at each element to obtain the tangential induction factors for each element the plots comparing the axial and tangential induction factors are given in fig 19 for two different wind cases the variation in the axial induction factors near the tip arises owing to the variation of thrust it may result in the tip loss factors included in the bem code also a slight variation in the axial and tangential induction factors is noticed near the hub this is explained by the factor that there is no hub in the cfd based calculations overall further investigations for prediction the validity of the tip loss factors and enhancing the same for fowt applications are needed 4 4 unsteady aerodynamic effect with different platform motions pitch and surge motions will cause a phase difference in a real situation fig 20 shows power results using cfd methods in different phase angles of pitch and surge we can discover that the times to get the maximum and minimum point are different here 180 are chosen to compare with other platform motions figs 21 23 are power and thrust curves from cfd results at different wind speeds compared with discrete platform motions pitch and surge motion shows the similar power and thrust results however power and thrust results of pitch surge combined motion are larger obviously at the maximum point especially in the severe sea condition the difference between maximum and minimum point is larger as well 4 5 wake evolution and induction according to fig 24 we can find that the wake spreads about two times of the radius strong tip and hub vortices are shown in figs 25 and 26 notice that the vortices cannot be resolved beyond x r 1 the trailing vortices exhibit the same characteristics as the tip vortices with very slight radial oscillatory motion compared with the onshore vortices the hub vortices are more clearly contour plots of the resulting velocity field at hub and tip during different time instances of 0 4 t 1 4 t 2 4 t and 3 4 t where t is the motion period are shown in fig 27 compared with the onshore wind turbine the velocity is tilted the velocity flow varies from discrete time instances axial velocity of lateral traverses at x d 1 and 2 of four different times is shown in fig 28 which provides insight on the general wake behaviour downstream of the rotor the variation results arise it is asymmetric and varies with time which is different from the onshore condition figs 29 and 30 describe the horizontal profiles at a severe sea condition to achieve the results first get a velocity circle line at the different chosen position and then there will be two different velocities at the same distance therefore we can see two points at the same position in figs 29 and 30 from this it is possible to see some of the wake development wake width increase with streamwise distance from the rotor plane as the wake width increase downstream the velocity deficit decrease the axial velocity of the onshore rotor plane is almost similar with the freestream velocity this indicates that there is little interaction between the airflow and rotor and most of the air passes through without being disturbed by the wind turbine blades since large part of the air flows past the turbine without being affected by the rotor less energy is extracted from the flow the farther the distance the bigger the difference in the two sides is compared with onshore wind turbine the axial velocity profiles of floating condition show more complicated the unit axial velocity differs with inflow velocities the larger the inflow velocity the larger the wake expansion is another two conditions below and rated condition are presented as well in figs 31 and 32 and figs 33 and 34 respectively time history of turbulent velocities for 2 points located at approximately hub height and center of the turbine y 0 m and z 90 m and at different non dimensional axial locations including the inlet of the simulation domain in fig 35 positions at 1 m and 5 m are chosen to avoid the influence of the rotor and to ensure that the stream tube is not broken down due to viscous dissipation it can be seen that for all locations the 3 velocities components fluctuate randomly around their expected mean velocities 11 m s for u and 8 m s for v and w the figure essentially shows that the turbulent field solved by cfd with the explicit wind turbulence at the inlet is appropriately transported through the whole simulation domain throughout the simulation but turbulence decay due to viscous losses mentioned previously is observed as velocities closer to the inlet tend to have larger fluctuations than more downstream locations 5 conclusion pitch surge and pitch surge combined motions are calculated separately to detect the platform motions effect on the rotor blade cfd results have a difference with bem data moreover element power and thrust are compared with onshore and floating offshore wind turbine the largest forces occur at the 3 4 blade radius which is in agreement with the theory at below rated wind speed 8 m s compared the cfd results with fowt and onshore wind turbine the power and thrust of fowt is larger than that of onshore wind turbine therefore the platform motion makes an advantage effect on the aerodynamic load however at around rated wind speed 11 4 m s the phenomenon is reversed what s more the variation in the axial induction and tangential induction factors near the tip and blade arises third strong tip and hub vortices are set out compared with the onshore wind turbine the velocity is tilted the velocity flow varies from discrete time instances axial velocity is asymmetric and varies with time which is different from the onshore condition compared with onshore wind turbine the axial velocity profiles of floating offshore condition show more complicated the unit axial velocity differs with inflow velocities the larger the inflow velocity the larger the wake expansion is moreover point velocities components fluctuate randomly around their expected mean velocities 11 m s for u and 8 m s for v and w velocities closer to the inlet tend to have larger fluctuations than more downstream locations future floating offshore wind turbine designs should strive to either minimize platform motions or be complementarity optimized via higher fidelity aerodynamic analysis techniques to account for them it is estimated that this paper is the first in depth study of floating offshore wind turbine aerodynamics and the applicability of various analysis methods 
23458,the propeller of a polar ship sailing in icy areas will quite likely be subjected to ice loads because of the various kinds of ice conditions and propeller working conditions there are large differences in the types of ice loads acting on a propeller in this paper research has been done to investigate the propeller ice contact and milling loads under different conditions we established a numerical method for solving this propeller ice contact problem based on the peridynamics method and the panel method which numerically simulates the dynamic responses of single ice blade collisions at different advance speed contact positions propeller rotational speeds and ice sizes with the help of a fortran program we conducted a comparative analysis of the thrust and torque of the blade

critical compression s c r 2 critical stretch 1 introduction with the current opening of the arctic passage the research of polar ships is on the rise when polar ships sail in icy areas the propeller exposed to the stern is in direct contact with sea ice which can easily cause damage the problem of a collision occurring between sea ice and propeller blades is a structural problem between two solids compared with hydrodynamic loads the loads of propeller ice contact are larger by an order of magnitude occupying a large proportion of the total propeller load hence it is necessary to investigate propeller ice contact propeller ice contact has been studied in 3ways full scale measurements model tests and numerical methods in the 1990s with the background of a joint project arrangement called jpra6 conducted by canada and finland several researchers carried out full scale measurements e g keinonen et al 1990 williams et al 1992 browne 1997 and obtained valuable data that could be used to explore the variation trend and the magnitude of ice loads however obvious shortcomings in these full scale measurements such as insufficient information and high cost make this approach less than ideal therefore with the advantages of requiring less labor and financial commitment scale model tests veitch 1995 searle et al 1999 wang et al 2005 have been conducted in this research field but more attention should be paid to the drawbacks caused by their complex scale effects in recent years with the development of computer technology and numerical calculation methods numerical simulation has been used to solve these kinds of problem numerical simulation is a promising approach that can highly improve working efficiency and can be more appropriate in complex operating conditions one study by liu et al 2000 simulated the blocking flow conditions under different ice conditions based on a propeller program two years later the propeller program was improved to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the area between the propeller blade and an ice block hu hu and gui 2013 used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to calculate and analyze the loads of propeller ice contact and further investigation has summarized and analyzed the influence of different sizes and speeds of ice blocks acting on the contact loads ye et al 2017 applied pd theory to establish a model of propeller ice contact applying a fresh approach to this research field consistent with ye this paper investigates propeller ice contact using the pd method and focuses on analyzing the effect of factors influencing the contact load in this paper to assess pd theory in modeling ice failure we undertook a verification study by comparing a numerical model established by pd theory of an ice cylinder affecting a rigid flat panel with the uniaxial compression tests conducted by carney et al 2006 and to prove the accuracy of the propeller ice contact model we further carried out a verification study by comparing the prediction result of our contact model with the result of a propeller ice interaction model test carried out at the ice tank of institute for ocean technology iot by wang et al 2005 we then studied the main factors influencing the contact process mostly considering ice size advance speed propeller rotational speed and depth of cut we summarized and analyzed the changes that occurred when varying the noted factors 2 ice material model and discretization in propeller blade 2 1 ice material model and its discretization traditional continuum mechanics theory is based on the continuum hypothesis and it has singularities when solving discontinuous problems of differential equations in abstract spaces thus it is not suitable to solve the propeller ice contact problem because of the many discontinuities that occur during the ice crushing process such as damage fracture and cracks pd silling and askari 2005 madenci and oterkus 2014 huang et al 2015 is a new meshless method based on continuous medium theory which discretizes a continuum into a series of material points with finite volume and mass the method considers only the affecting force of the material points in the near field range and disregards whether the displacement field is continuous showing great adaptability to many discontinuous problems pd theory places a greater focus on the interaction between the two material points to understand the link between two material points better you might imagine the effect between the two material points to be a bond or somewhat like a spring in pd theory we use the horizon of h x to describe the near field range of a material point x which is a sphere with a radius of δ and its sphere center is set as the location of material point x as shown in fig 1 to describe the mechanical properties of the material points in the domain the relative positions between the two material points are defined as ξ x x and the relative displacements at time t are defined as η u x t u x t so the vector ξ η is the relative position of the two interacting points at t the action of the bond between the material points changes with the deformation of the material which is indicated by the elongation of the bonds 1 s ξ η ξ ξ y ξ ξ the key aspect of pd theory is the basic equation representing the displacement and force of the material points all of the formulas in pd theory are transformed to solve the following equation 2 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at exerts on the material point at x for an object composed of micro elastic materials the constitutive function of pd can be expressed as follows 3 f η ξ ξ η ξ η f ξ η ξ η ξ the pairwise forces are regarded as interactions between pairs of material points as a continuum to ensure a function does not violate newton s third law of motion the pairwise force density function must obey the linear and angular admissibility conditions which are as follows 4 f η ξ f η ξ η ξ when a bond is deformed beyond a predetermined value it is judged to be a failure and can never be recovered for the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material the bond force can be expressed as follows 5 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function defined by 6 g s c s s where c is a constant for linear elastic isotropic material c can be obtained in terms of the bulk modulus κ and the horizon δ as follows 7 c 18 k π δ 4 when a bond fails the bond force of pairs of material points comes to zero and this can be expressed by μ which is a history dependent scalar valued function 8 μ t ξ 1 i f i f s t ξ s 0 f o r a l l 0 t t 0 o t h e r w i s e we propose a quantity known as local damage at a point to describe the level of failure of the material which can be quantified as follows 9 φ x t h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ 2 2 discretization of the propeller surface to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade its surface is divided into many small quadrilateral panels the number and pattern of chordwise and radial intervals should be properly chosen to approximate its actual shape in this paper chordwise and radial intervals are discretized using a cosine function which can be expressed as follows 10 r j 1 2 r 0 r h 1 2 r 0 r h cos β i j j 1 2 n r 1 11 s i 1 2 1 cos β c i b j i 1 2 n c 1 where b j is the chord length of a blade section in r n r is the blade surface grid number in the radial direction and n c is the blade surface grid number in the chordwise direction β r j and β c j can be defined by the following formulas 12 β r j 0 j 1 2 j 1 2 n r 1 π j 2 n r 1 13 β c i i 1 n c π i 1 2 n c 1 2 3 verification of peridynamics in modeling ice failure a verification study is undertaken to assess peridynamics in modeling ice failure numerical simulations are carried out on an ice impact problem the numerical setup is similar to the uniaxial compression tests conducted by carney et al 2006 for the numerical model an ice cylinder with diameter d 17 46 m m and height h 42 66 m m 42 16 mm impacts on a rigid flat panel with different velocities the ice cylinder is simplified as homogeneous material with an elastic modulus of e 1 8 g p a a poission s ratio of υ 0 25 and a density of ρ 900 kg m 3 fig 2 shows the comparison of the numerical results and the experimental results with different impact velocities of the ice cylinder the convergence of the particle spacing effect on the calculated results is also shown in the figure the particle spacing are varied as δ x d 10 δ x d 15 δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 as we can see from the fig 2 with the increase of the particle spacing the discrepancy decreases for the particle spacing of δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 the impact load curves coincide with each other which means that when the particle spacing is less than δ x d 20 the calculated results are convergent we further make comparisons of the results for the particle spacing of δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 with the experimental results of carney et al 2006 good agreement can be observed thus the current numerical method can get stable and reliable results fig 3 shows the dynamic impact process of an ice cylinder with a velocity of v i c e 91 44 m s the red color of ice particle means the ice failure it can be that the number of ice failure particles increases with the time at the time of approximately 0 14 ms the ice impact loads reach to the peak value 3 geometry and numerical setup 3 1 the propeller model numerical simulations are carried out on a model of a full scale propeller the chosen propeller has a similar design to the four blade r class propeller walker 1966 and the blades are thickened for safe operation in ice the diameter of the propeller is d 4 12 m and the diameter of the hub is d h 1 24 m the pitch to diameter ratio p d is 0 76 to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade we establish the propeller model using the panel mode method and divide its surface into several small quadrilateral panels the number and layout of the chordwise and radial intervals should be properly chosen to approach its actual shape fig 4 shows the surface mesh of the propeller 3 2 the ice block model a complete numerical simulation of sea ice with another material is difficult to conduct because the physical properties of sea ice are affected significantly by temperature salinity porosity and other external factors the focus of this paper is on the complete moving process of the ice but not on its specific properties considering that ice material can exhibit a variety of behaviors ranging from ductile to brittle as a function of strain rate in compression see in fig 5 the ductile to brittle transition occurs at a strain rate on the order of 10 3 carney et al 2006 we can conclude that when the strain rate of ice is larger than 10 3 ice properties usually exhibits as brittle material considering propeller ice interaction the linear velocity in the tip is often high so the relative velocity between ice and blade would be large the strain rate of ice would be larger than 10 3 ice material mainly exhibits as brittle material so it is useful and meaningful to simulate ice material with prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material in bond based peridynamics accumulation of the destruction of the bond in all directions across a surface lead to the generation of a cracked surface we mainly judge the damage of a bond by comparing the deformation of it with the critical deformation the failure criterion of the models both consist of compression and tension and we establish the failure criterion of compression by referring the concept of failure of tension when the ice block is under compression the distance between ice particles would be close when the deformation of the bond between 2 ice particles caused by compression is larger than the critical compression defined as s c r 1 then the bond is judged to be damaged the critical compression is s c r 1 0 0032 the critical stretch is s c r 2 0 00064 and the determination of the two critical deformation in this paper refers to the study of liu et al 2018 he compared the simulation work in peridynamics with test result and confirmed suitable determination of the two critical compression in his study s c r 1 0 0031 s c r 2 0 00062 in our study by comparing the prediction results with test results we finally confirmed our parameters as s c r 1 0 0032 s c r 2 0 00064 the time step of the calculation is set at δ t 0 0348 ms we choose the time step size referring to the study of yu 2011 in his study the time step size is limited as δ t β s a f e ξ min c k max we set the safety factor β s a f e 0 5 finally we calculated the time step δ t 0 00348 m s the elastic modulus is e 1 8 g p a poisson s ratio is 0 25 and density is 900 kg m3 the ice block seen in fig 6 is considered to be a cuboid with a length of l 0 5 d a width of w 0 75 d and a thickness of h 0 25 d 3 3 propeller ice contact model the contact model is very essential in our study we had briefly introduced the key part of the contact model in the following this model is established by ye et al 2017 the key part of the model is how the ice particle contact with the propeller surface and how to obtain its force acting on the surface therefore this process develops a contact surface between the propeller and ice material particles at a particular time t see fig 7 the velocity of such a material point x k in its new location at the next time step t δ t can be computed as madenci and oterkus 2014 14 v k t δ t u k t δ t u k t δ t where u k t δ t is the modified displacement vector at time t δ t u k t represents the displacement vector at time t at time t δ t the contribution of the material point x k to the reaction force from the target material to the propeller f k t δ t can be computed from 15 f k t δ t 1 ρ k v k t δ t v k t δ t δ t v k as the ice block model and the propeller model is set up we establish the propeller ice contact model using the continuous contact detection algorithm established by ye et al 2017 with this algorithm we can detect the contact area between the propeller blade and the ice block and can establish the complete propeller ice contact model see fig 8 4 a verification study to the propeller ice contact model in order to verify the accuracy of the propeller ice interaction model constructed in this paper based on the model test conducted at the iot s ice tank wang et al 2005 this paper carried out a verification study by comparing the test results with the prediction results obtained from the interaction model the working condition in the contact model is set the same as the working condition in the model test parameters are setting as following propeller diameter d 0 3 m rotational speed n 5 r p s cutting depth c 20 m m ice speed v 0 5 m s the sketch of the model test is shown in fig 9 the propeller ice numerical simulation is shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the comparison of contact force and moment for the main blade between calculation and experiment in the contact model the ice block is placed at 0 6 m in front of the propeller in the beginning so it cost 0 12s of time for the main blade to contact ice and suffer loads it can also be seen that because of the rational speed n 5 r p s the ice load of main blade will have 5 peaks within 1s which is also well reflected by the test results and numerical prediction results in fig 11 from fig 11 it could also be seen that the coincidence of ice force between numerical prediction and experimental results is high especially the magnitude and trend of ice loads in the contact model is very consistent with the test results in the model test during the time when the main blade is not contacting with the ice the blade would also suffer a small load due to the effect of hydrodynamic load however the contact model in this paper does not consider the effect of seawater so the main blade would not suffer any load in the prediction result when the blade is not contacting with any ice from fig 11 it could also be seen that during the time 150 200ms the prediction results are smaller than the test result this is because during this period the main blade are just contacting with the ice for a little while in the model so the main blade is not in sufficient contact with ice in general although there are differences between prediction results and test results but the ice load magnitude ice loads trend and peak ice loads in prediction results are in good agreement with the test results and this could prove the accuracy of the numerical model established in this paper 5 parameter analysis in this paper we selected two parameters the propeller part and the ice part we primarily consider the most significant influencing factors on the contact loads after consulting previous research we confirm the influencing factors as propeller rotational speed ice block size ice advancing speed and contact location we evaluated each parameter under three working conditions considering that the propeller and shaft suffer damage mainly from force in the direction of the x axis and moments in the direction of the y and z axes this paper focuses on the analysis of the three noted loads the total time steps for one working condition is set as 20 000 and the total cpu time for each working condition is about 10 h the following table contains information about the working conditions under the four parameters see table 1 5 1 basic condition analysis this paper focuses on comparative analysis under different working conditions investigating many parameters for ease of analysis and considering that trends with time for ice loads under different working conditions are similar we selected a basic condition to study before changing the working condition which concentrates on the study of variation of ice loads with time the basic working condition has propeller diameter d 4 12 m rotational speed n 3 r p s and penetration thickness m 0 65 m the ice model is cuboid with length l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness s h 1 5 l and advance speed v 2 4 m s the propeller is in front of the ice block and it takes 400 ms to make the ice block be in contact with the propeller blade so during this time the ice load is zero in the following cases the time series curves are all started not at the time of zero because we put propeller in front of the ice block in the simulation work fig 12 shows time domain curves of ice forces or moments for the main propeller blade in six degrees of freedom as shown in fig 12 a the axial milling thrust increases rapidly over time after 400 ms reaching its peak at about 445 ms this is because the contact area between the blade and ice block increases rapidly after contact at 400 ms and the contact area is related positively to the contact force of the propeller blade at 445 ms the contact area reaches its peak and so the contact force also reaches its peak it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the contact area between the ice and paddle at 450 ms is much larger than at 420 ms besides from fig 12 a it is evident that the force decreases rapidly with time after 455 ms but the rate of decline is less than the previous rate of increase the contact force is reduced because the blade slowly revolves out from the interior of the ice block after 455 ms the milling area decreases and so the milling thrust also decreases additionally broken ice continues to be thrown out from the ice block by the propeller during the whole milling process this will lead to a continuous reduction in the total volume of ice resulting in a slower rate of change in the contact area as the propeller revolves out from the ice compared with when the propeller revolves into the ice therefore the decreasing slope of the milling load is smaller than the previous increasing slope from fig 12 it is easy to see that the ice loads suddenly change from a decrease to an increase this is caused by the shadow effect wang et al 2009 whereby the lead edge was first in contact with the ice during the milling process resulting in decreasing ice strength consequently part of the main blade s surface does not completely contact the ice so the ice loads for the propeller blade decrease analyzing fig 13 we see that when the propeller penetrates out from the ice block a groove is generated from the front blade the contact area between the back blade and the ice is diminished this leads to a decreasing positive ice load on the back blade which will cause the milling loads for the whole blade to decrease as the process blade revolves out from the ice from fig 13 we conducted a comparative analysis and found that the amplitude of loads in the z axis is much larger than in the x axis because as the propeller blade is fan shaped the projection of the force arm in the z direction is much bigger than in the x direction therefore more attention should be paid to avoiding torsion failure in the z direction when considering propeller strength additionally as shown in fig 12 both the contact force and the torque are fluctuating violently because of the severe ice induced vibration that emerged during the propeller ice contact which is also the main cause of the ship s vibration 5 2 varying cutting depth fig 14 shows the dynamic changing process of the propeller ice contact under variable cutting depths the penetration thickness is selected as 0 4 m 0 65 m or 0 9 m the propeller s rotational speed is set as n 3 r p s the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l and the ice speed is v 2 4 m s fig 15 shows the time variation curve for the milling load of the propeller at various cutting depths as shown in the diagram the load of the propeller increases with the cutting depth a greater cutting depth will lead to a greater contact area between the propeller and ice block resulting in greater contact load from fig 14 we can conduct a validation analysis compared with an ice propeller cutting at 305 ms the greater cutting depth at 345 ms results is in a larger contact area as we can see from fig 15 a the force at 345 ms is greater than at 305 ms additionally a greater cutting depth will cause an earlier contact time the starting times for cutting depths of 0 4 m 0 65 m and 0 9 m are 303 ms 315 ms and 329 ms respectively this is consistent with the actual situation as the thickness of the ice is the same the deeper the cutting depth the earlier the propeller blade contacts the ice fig 14 also provides verification at the same time the blade has penetrated the ice and it has been a period of time since the load emerged in fig 14 a whereas in fig 14 c the blade has revolved just into the ice to displace just a small volume and for fig 14 e the blade was in contact only with the ice block notably fig 15 shows that the vanishing time for the ice load is essentially the same at different cutting depths by observing fig 14 b and d and 14 f we can conclude that as the blade leaves the ice only the surface of the blade remains in contact with a slice of ice that has been cut from the interior of the ice block the impact force of the propeller from the slice of ice could be negligible so the vanishing time for ice loads under different cutting depths are roughly the same this phenomenon is summarized as follows a deeper cutting depth will cause an earlier starting timing for the contact but it makes little difference in the ending time which will sustain the whole milling process longer the total process of milling times at 0 9 m and 0 65 m are respectively 1 31 and 1 14 times that at 0 4 m therefore more attention should be paid to the fatigue strength of the propeller 5 3 varying rotational speed fig 16 shows the dynamic change process of the propeller ice contact under variable propeller rotational speeds the rotational speed n is selected to be 2 rps 3 rps or 4 rps the penetration thickness is set as m 0 65 m the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l and the ice speed v 2 4 m s fig 17 displays the time variation curve for milling loads of the propeller under various rotational speeds it is easily seen that at low rotational speeds the milling load of the propeller decreases as the rotational speed increases a lower rotational speed such as in the full scale simulation will cause the milling process to be sustained longer making the ice damage from the ice impact complete causing the function between propeller blade and ice block to be more complete and severe so the ice loads tend to be larger also if the rotational speed continues to increase the milling loads will not continue to decrease and instead will increase this change occurs because the relative speed between the propeller and ice block will increase and the rotational speed keeps increasing so the impact to the ice from the propeller tends to be more severe and so the ice loads for the propeller increase also a more severe impact with the ice will result in broken ice pieces thrown from the ice block with a higher initial velocity and for great distance the thrown ice with high velocity will be a threat to the structural strength of ship stern therefore in this case more measurements need to be taken to protect the structure of the stern area from the damage of these thrown ice pieces fig 17 shows that at 2 rps the first and second halves of the contact force are positive and negative respectively at 3 rps and 4 rps the direction of contact force is always negative this can be explained by comparing the data between the advancing velocity of the ice block and the velocity component of the propeller in the x direction fig 16 a shows that at a slow rotational speed the blade leaves shallow scratches on the surface of the ice block but it does not cut pieces from the ice block as in other cases this means the ice block contacts only the back of the propeller so the propeller sustains a positive load in the x direction for the latter half of the milling load the blade can penetrate the interior of the ice block and the load analysis is the same as in fig 16 e and f looking at these figures cutting grooves appear because the whole blade mills the ice block leading to a shadow effect that covers the contact area with the back of the blade this can result in a contact area for the ice block with the blade back that is much smaller than that with the blade face therefore the positive load in the x rail from the blade back is greater than the negative load from the blade face and finally the whole blade sustains a positive load 5 4 varying advancing speed fig 18 shows the dynamic change process of the propeller ice contact under ice advancing speeds of 3 6 m s 4 8 m s and 6 m s the propeller rotational speed is n 3 r p s the penetration thickness is m 0 65 m the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l the paper focus on the influence of variable advancing speeds to the direction of ice loads if the speed spacing is too small the differences of ice loads for each conditions is too small to analysis hence the speed spacing is set as 1 2 m s and the largest advancing speed is set as 6 m s besides as we set the advancing speed of the basic condition as 2 4 m s before and find the changing law of its loads similar to the condition of 3 6 m s so we will not analysis the ice loads of 2 4 m s again here fig 19 shows the time variation curve of milling loads for the propeller blade with variable ice block advancing speeds fig 18 shows that the advancing speed can have a great impact on the magnitude and direction of the contact load this can be explained by considering the shadow effect in the propeller ice contact process a change in the advancing speed of the ice block will cause a change in the contact area of the blade face and back with the ice thus affecting the load magnitude and direction of the blade fig 18 verifies this finding in fig 18 b a small internal volume of ice is cut from the ice block so the shadowed area for the blade is quite small causing the shadow effect to have negligible influence the contact area with the ice is approximately the same with both the blade back and the blade face a forward load is exerted on the propeller blade as the ice block moves forward in fig 18 f a relatively large contact area between the blade back and the ice is shadowed as the former blade has cut a large groove area from the ice block leading to the shadow effect that greatly influences the whole blade this makes the contact area with the blade face much larger than with the blade back subjecting the whole blade to a negative load additionally as shown in fig 18 d in this working condition the milling groove is not that big nor is it too small so the contact load is influenced by both the shadow effect and the forward motion of the ice block this leads to a change in the direction of the milling loads between the positive and negative directions as shown in fig 18 c with a larger advancing velocity the axial distance of milling area between the front and blade back with the ice block is small causing the two cutting grooves to penetrate each other and to expand thus aggravating the shadow effect on the milling load if the advancing velocity of the ice block decreases the time of duration for the whole milling process also will decrease decreasing the total volume of broken ice thrown from the interior of the ice block this will cause the cutting groove to be shallow and small the axial distance of milling area between the front and back blades with the ice block also will expand making it hard to penetrate the two milling grooves and result in one all of these factors lead to a reduction in the shadow effect therefore we can conclude that the shadow effect is positively correlated with the advancing speed of the ice block 5 5 varying ice size fig 20 shows the dynamic change process of propeller ice contact with variable ice sizes the ice sizes are chosen as l 0 412 m 1 236 m and 2 06 m their width and thickness are set as the same ratio with length width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l the rotational speed of the propeller is set as n 3 r p s the penetration thickness is m 0 65 m and the speed of the ice is v 4 8 m s fig 21 shows the time variation curve of the milling load with variable ice block sizes we see that the milling loads decrease with decreasing ice block sizes this is because a decrease in the ice size will lead to a decrease in the contact area between the ice and the propeller which diminishes the milling loads additionally the amplitude of variation for the milling load from the length 0 412 m 1 236 m is much greater than from 1 236 m to 2 06 m this is determined by comparing the relative size of the ice block width to the blade radius fig 20 e demonstrates that the ice block is much smaller than the propeller radius with the cutting depth at 0 2 m so that even at the maximum depth of the cut a large area of the blade surface remains exposed to the ice as the ice block size varies from 0 4 m to 0 6 m the size of the ice is greater than the width of the propeller the contact area in both cases varies little and this is also true of the milling loads we can conclude that if the propeller mills an ice block bigger than itself the increase of ice size has little effect on the milling load but if the propeller radius is larger than the ice block width increasing the ice size will more greatly affect the milling load therefore considering that the working conditions of polar ships often vary to protect the structure of the propeller blade research is needed to compare the scale of the ice size with the magnitude of the blade radius 6 conclusion in this paper we establish a numerical solution model based on pd theory coded in fortran numerically simulating the ice propeller contact process in different conditions from which we obtain a time variation curve of the milling loads we simulate a case of ice impact to validate pd in modeling ice failure the following conclusions can be drawn from this comparative analysis 1 ice load will increase with ice size additionally it appears that an increase in the magnitude of the ice will have little impact on the ice load if the width of the ice is greater than the radius of the propeller blade conversely the ice load will change rapidly with the increase of the ice size if the width of the ice is less than the radius of the propeller blade 2 because of the shadow effect a propeller blade penetrating an ice block may not completely contact the ice causing the magnitude and direction of the milling load to change rapidly with the advancing speed of ice and changing rotational speed of the screw 3 as the cutting depth increases the thrust and torque of the propeller sustained during the milling process are increasing and the time for the propeller blade exposed to the milling load is longer justifying higher requirements for strength protection of the blade 4 a greater ice speed leads to a greater contact force and torque of the propeller a shorter contact time and a more severe change of the milling loads therefore attention should be paid to the distortion of the propeller this paper has focused on the analysis of the geometry of ice and factors influencing contact it has ignored the specific properties of different kinds of ice the constitutive model of ice should be investigated under different conditions a more accurate propeller ice contact model should be established considering structural deformation of the propeller blade acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51679052 and the defense

23458,the propeller of a polar ship sailing in icy areas will quite likely be subjected to ice loads because of the various kinds of ice conditions and propeller working conditions there are large differences in the types of ice loads acting on a propeller in this paper research has been done to investigate the propeller ice contact and milling loads under different conditions we established a numerical method for solving this propeller ice contact problem based on the peridynamics method and the panel method which numerically simulates the dynamic responses of single ice blade collisions at different advance speed contact positions propeller rotational speeds and ice sizes with the help of a fortran program we conducted a comparative analysis of the thrust and torque of the blade sustained in six degrees by changing the specified factors and finally obtained the changing regularity of the milling loads for the blade under different conditions keywords propeller ice contact

critical compression s c r 2 critical stretch 1 introduction with the current opening of the arctic passage the research of polar ships is on the rise when polar ships sail in icy areas the propeller exposed to the stern is in direct contact with sea ice which can easily cause damage the problem of a collision occurring between sea ice and propeller blades is a structural problem between two solids compared with hydrodynamic loads the loads of propeller ice contact are larger by an order of magnitude occupying a large proportion of the total propeller load hence it is necessary to investigate propeller ice contact propeller ice contact has been studied in 3ways full scale measurements model tests and numerical methods in the 1990s with the background of a joint project arrangement called jpra6 conducted by canada and finland several researchers carried out full scale measurements e g keinonen et al 1990 williams et al 1992 browne 1997 and obtained valuable data that could be used to explore the variation trend and the magnitude of ice loads however obvious shortcomings in these full scale measurements such as insufficient information and high cost make this approach less than ideal therefore with the advantages of requiring less labor and financial commitment scale model tests veitch 1995 searle et al 1999 wang et al 2005 have been conducted in this research field but more attention should be paid to the drawbacks caused by their complex scale effects in recent years with the development of computer technology and numerical calculation methods numerical simulation has been used to solve these kinds of problem numerical simulation is a promising approach that can highly improve working efficiency and can be more appropriate in complex operating conditions one study by liu et al 2000 simulated the blocking flow conditions under different ice conditions based on a propeller program two years later the propeller program was improved to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the area between the propeller blade and an ice block hu hu and gui 2013 used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to calculate and analyze the loads of propeller ice contact and further investigation has summarized and analyzed the influence of different sizes and speeds of ice blocks acting on the contact loads ye et al 2017 applied pd theory to establish a model of propeller ice contact applying a fresh approach to this research field consistent with ye this paper investigates propeller ice contact using the pd method and focuses on analyzing the effect of factors influencing the contact load in this paper to assess pd theory in modeling ice failure we undertook a verification study by comparing a numerical model established by pd theory of an ice cylinder affecting a rigid flat panel with the uniaxial compression tests conducted by carney et al 2006 and to prove the accuracy of the propeller ice contact model we further carried out a verification study by comparing the prediction result of our contact model with the result of a propeller ice interaction model test carried out at the ice tank of institute for ocean technology iot by wang et al 2005 we then studied the main factors influencing the contact process mostly considering ice size advance speed propeller rotational speed and depth of cut we summarized and analyzed the changes that occurred when varying the noted factors 2 ice material model and discretization in propeller blade 2 1 ice material model and its discretization traditional continuum mechanics theory is based on the continuum hypothesis and it has singularities when solving discontinuous problems of differential equations in abstract spaces thus it is not suitable to solve the propeller ice contact problem because of the many discontinuities that occur during the ice crushing process such as damage fracture and cracks pd silling and askari 2005 madenci and oterkus 2014 huang et al 2015 is a new meshless method based on continuous medium theory which discretizes a continuum into a series of material points with finite volume and mass the method considers only the affecting force of the material points in the near field range and disregards whether the displacement field is continuous showing great adaptability to many discontinuous problems pd theory places a greater focus on the interaction between the two material points to understand the link between two material points better you might imagine the effect between the two material points to be a bond or somewhat like a spring in pd theory we use the horizon of h x to describe the near field range of a material point x which is a sphere with a radius of δ and its sphere center is set as the location of material point x as shown in fig 1 to describe the mechanical properties of the material points in the domain the relative positions between the two material points are defined as ξ x x and the relative displacements at time t are defined as η u x t u x t so the vector ξ η is the relative position of the two interacting points at t the action of the bond between the material points changes with the deformation of the material which is indicated by the elongation of the bonds 1 s ξ η ξ ξ y ξ ξ the key aspect of pd theory is the basic equation representing the displacement and force of the material points all of the formulas in pd theory are transformed to solve the following equation 2 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at exerts on the material point at x for an object composed of micro elastic materials the constitutive function of pd can be expressed as follows 3 f η ξ ξ η ξ η f ξ η ξ η ξ the pairwise forces are regarded as interactions between pairs of material points as a continuum to ensure a function does not violate newton s third law of motion the pairwise force density function must obey the linear and angular admissibility conditions which are as follows 4 f η ξ f η ξ η ξ when a bond is deformed beyond a predetermined value it is judged to be a failure and can never be recovered for the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material the bond force can be expressed as follows 5 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function defined by 6 g s c s s where c is a constant for linear elastic isotropic material c can be obtained in terms of the bulk modulus κ and the horizon δ as follows 7 c 18 k π δ 4 when a bond fails the bond force of pairs of material points comes to zero and this can be expressed by μ which is a history dependent scalar valued function 8 μ t ξ 1 i f i f s t ξ s 0 f o r a l l 0 t t 0 o t h e r w i s e we propose a quantity known as local damage at a point to describe the level of failure of the material which can be quantified as follows 9 φ x t h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ 2 2 discretization of the propeller surface to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade its surface is divided into many small quadrilateral panels the number and pattern of chordwise and radial intervals should be properly chosen to approximate its actual shape in this paper chordwise and radial intervals are discretized using a cosine function which can be expressed as follows 10 r j 1 2 r 0 r h 1 2 r 0 r h cos β i j j 1 2 n r 1 11 s i 1 2 1 cos β c i b j i 1 2 n c 1 where b j is the chord length of a blade section in r n r is the blade surface grid number in the radial direction and n c is the blade surface grid number in the chordwise direction β r j and β c j can be defined by the following formulas 12 β r j 0 j 1 2 j 1 2 n r 1 π j 2 n r 1 13 β c i i 1 n c π i 1 2 n c 1 2 3 verification of peridynamics in modeling ice failure a verification study is undertaken to assess peridynamics in modeling ice failure numerical simulations are carried out on an ice impact problem the numerical setup is similar to the uniaxial compression tests conducted by carney et al 2006 for the numerical model an ice cylinder with diameter d 17 46 m m and height h 42 66 m m 42 16 mm impacts on a rigid flat panel with different velocities the ice cylinder is simplified as homogeneous material with an elastic modulus of e 1 8 g p a a poission s ratio of υ 0 25 and a density of ρ 900 kg m 3 fig 2 shows the comparison of the numerical results and the experimental results with different impact velocities of the ice cylinder the convergence of the particle spacing effect on the calculated results is also shown in the figure the particle spacing are varied as δ x d 10 δ x d 15 δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 as we can see from the fig 2 with the increase of the particle spacing the discrepancy decreases for the particle spacing of δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 the impact load curves coincide with each other which means that when the particle spacing is less than δ x d 20 the calculated results are convergent we further make comparisons of the results for the particle spacing of δ x d 20 and δ x d 25 with the experimental results of carney et al 2006 good agreement can be observed thus the current numerical method can get stable and reliable results fig 3 shows the dynamic impact process of an ice cylinder with a velocity of v i c e 91 44 m s the red color of ice particle means the ice failure it can be that the number of ice failure particles increases with the time at the time of approximately 0 14 ms the ice impact loads reach to the peak value 3 geometry and numerical setup 3 1 the propeller model numerical simulations are carried out on a model of a full scale propeller the chosen propeller has a similar design to the four blade r class propeller walker 1966 and the blades are thickened for safe operation in ice the diameter of the propeller is d 4 12 m and the diameter of the hub is d h 1 24 m the pitch to diameter ratio p d is 0 76 to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade we establish the propeller model using the panel mode method and divide its surface into several small quadrilateral panels the number and layout of the chordwise and radial intervals should be properly chosen to approach its actual shape fig 4 shows the surface mesh of the propeller 3 2 the ice block model a complete numerical simulation of sea ice with another material is difficult to conduct because the physical properties of sea ice are affected significantly by temperature salinity porosity and other external factors the focus of this paper is on the complete moving process of the ice but not on its specific properties considering that ice material can exhibit a variety of behaviors ranging from ductile to brittle as a function of strain rate in compression see in fig 5 the ductile to brittle transition occurs at a strain rate on the order of 10 3 carney et al 2006 we can conclude that when the strain rate of ice is larger than 10 3 ice properties usually exhibits as brittle material considering propeller ice interaction the linear velocity in the tip is often high so the relative velocity between ice and blade would be large the strain rate of ice would be larger than 10 3 ice material mainly exhibits as brittle material so it is useful and meaningful to simulate ice material with prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material in bond based peridynamics accumulation of the destruction of the bond in all directions across a surface lead to the generation of a cracked surface we mainly judge the damage of a bond by comparing the deformation of it with the critical deformation the failure criterion of the models both consist of compression and tension and we establish the failure criterion of compression by referring the concept of failure of tension when the ice block is under compression the distance between ice particles would be close when the deformation of the bond between 2 ice particles caused by compression is larger than the critical compression defined as s c r 1 then the bond is judged to be damaged the critical compression is s c r 1 0 0032 the critical stretch is s c r 2 0 00064 and the determination of the two critical deformation in this paper refers to the study of liu et al 2018 he compared the simulation work in peridynamics with test result and confirmed suitable determination of the two critical compression in his study s c r 1 0 0031 s c r 2 0 00062 in our study by comparing the prediction results with test results we finally confirmed our parameters as s c r 1 0 0032 s c r 2 0 00064 the time step of the calculation is set at δ t 0 0348 ms we choose the time step size referring to the study of yu 2011 in his study the time step size is limited as δ t β s a f e ξ min c k max we set the safety factor β s a f e 0 5 finally we calculated the time step δ t 0 00348 m s the elastic modulus is e 1 8 g p a poisson s ratio is 0 25 and density is 900 kg m3 the ice block seen in fig 6 is considered to be a cuboid with a length of l 0 5 d a width of w 0 75 d and a thickness of h 0 25 d 3 3 propeller ice contact model the contact model is very essential in our study we had briefly introduced the key part of the contact model in the following this model is established by ye et al 2017 the key part of the model is how the ice particle contact with the propeller surface and how to obtain its force acting on the surface therefore this process develops a contact surface between the propeller and ice material particles at a particular time t see fig 7 the velocity of such a material point x k in its new location at the next time step t δ t can be computed as madenci and oterkus 2014 14 v k t δ t u k t δ t u k t δ t where u k t δ t is the modified displacement vector at time t δ t u k t represents the displacement vector at time t at time t δ t the contribution of the material point x k to the reaction force from the target material to the propeller f k t δ t can be computed from 15 f k t δ t 1 ρ k v k t δ t v k t δ t δ t v k as the ice block model and the propeller model is set up we establish the propeller ice contact model using the continuous contact detection algorithm established by ye et al 2017 with this algorithm we can detect the contact area between the propeller blade and the ice block and can establish the complete propeller ice contact model see fig 8 4 a verification study to the propeller ice contact model in order to verify the accuracy of the propeller ice interaction model constructed in this paper based on the model test conducted at the iot s ice tank wang et al 2005 this paper carried out a verification study by comparing the test results with the prediction results obtained from the interaction model the working condition in the contact model is set the same as the working condition in the model test parameters are setting as following propeller diameter d 0 3 m rotational speed n 5 r p s cutting depth c 20 m m ice speed v 0 5 m s the sketch of the model test is shown in fig 9 the propeller ice numerical simulation is shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the comparison of contact force and moment for the main blade between calculation and experiment in the contact model the ice block is placed at 0 6 m in front of the propeller in the beginning so it cost 0 12s of time for the main blade to contact ice and suffer loads it can also be seen that because of the rational speed n 5 r p s the ice load of main blade will have 5 peaks within 1s which is also well reflected by the test results and numerical prediction results in fig 11 from fig 11 it could also be seen that the coincidence of ice force between numerical prediction and experimental results is high especially the magnitude and trend of ice loads in the contact model is very consistent with the test results in the model test during the time when the main blade is not contacting with the ice the blade would also suffer a small load due to the effect of hydrodynamic load however the contact model in this paper does not consider the effect of seawater so the main blade would not suffer any load in the prediction result when the blade is not contacting with any ice from fig 11 it could also be seen that during the time 150 200ms the prediction results are smaller than the test result this is because during this period the main blade are just contacting with the ice for a little while in the model so the main blade is not in sufficient contact with ice in general although there are differences between prediction results and test results but the ice load magnitude ice loads trend and peak ice loads in prediction results are in good agreement with the test results and this could prove the accuracy of the numerical model established in this paper 5 parameter analysis in this paper we selected two parameters the propeller part and the ice part we primarily consider the most significant influencing factors on the contact loads after consulting previous research we confirm the influencing factors as propeller rotational speed ice block size ice advancing speed and contact location we evaluated each parameter under three working conditions considering that the propeller and shaft suffer damage mainly from force in the direction of the x axis and moments in the direction of the y and z axes this paper focuses on the analysis of the three noted loads the total time steps for one working condition is set as 20 000 and the total cpu time for each working condition is about 10 h the following table contains information about the working conditions under the four parameters see table 1 5 1 basic condition analysis this paper focuses on comparative analysis under different working conditions investigating many parameters for ease of analysis and considering that trends with time for ice loads under different working conditions are similar we selected a basic condition to study before changing the working condition which concentrates on the study of variation of ice loads with time the basic working condition has propeller diameter d 4 12 m rotational speed n 3 r p s and penetration thickness m 0 65 m the ice model is cuboid with length l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness s h 1 5 l and advance speed v 2 4 m s the propeller is in front of the ice block and it takes 400 ms to make the ice block be in contact with the propeller blade so during this time the ice load is zero in the following cases the time series curves are all started not at the time of zero because we put propeller in front of the ice block in the simulation work fig 12 shows time domain curves of ice forces or moments for the main propeller blade in six degrees of freedom as shown in fig 12 a the axial milling thrust increases rapidly over time after 400 ms reaching its peak at about 445 ms this is because the contact area between the blade and ice block increases rapidly after contact at 400 ms and the contact area is related positively to the contact force of the propeller blade at 445 ms the contact area reaches its peak and so the contact force also reaches its peak it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the contact area between the ice and paddle at 450 ms is much larger than at 420 ms besides from fig 12 a it is evident that the force decreases rapidly with time after 455 ms but the rate of decline is less than the previous rate of increase the contact force is reduced because the blade slowly revolves out from the interior of the ice block after 455 ms the milling area decreases and so the milling thrust also decreases additionally broken ice continues to be thrown out from the ice block by the propeller during the whole milling process this will lead to a continuous reduction in the total volume of ice resulting in a slower rate of change in the contact area as the propeller revolves out from the ice compared with when the propeller revolves into the ice therefore the decreasing slope of the milling load is smaller than the previous increasing slope from fig 12 it is easy to see that the ice loads suddenly change from a decrease to an increase this is caused by the shadow effect wang et al 2009 whereby the lead edge was first in contact with the ice during the milling process resulting in decreasing ice strength consequently part of the main blade s surface does not completely contact the ice so the ice loads for the propeller blade decrease analyzing fig 13 we see that when the propeller penetrates out from the ice block a groove is generated from the front blade the contact area between the back blade and the ice is diminished this leads to a decreasing positive ice load on the back blade which will cause the milling loads for the whole blade to decrease as the process blade revolves out from the ice from fig 13 we conducted a comparative analysis and found that the amplitude of loads in the z axis is much larger than in the x axis because as the propeller blade is fan shaped the projection of the force arm in the z direction is much bigger than in the x direction therefore more attention should be paid to avoiding torsion failure in the z direction when considering propeller strength additionally as shown in fig 12 both the contact force and the torque are fluctuating violently because of the severe ice induced vibration that emerged during the propeller ice contact which is also the main cause of the ship s vibration 5 2 varying cutting depth fig 14 shows the dynamic changing process of the propeller ice contact under variable cutting depths the penetration thickness is selected as 0 4 m 0 65 m or 0 9 m the propeller s rotational speed is set as n 3 r p s the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l and the ice speed is v 2 4 m s fig 15 shows the time variation curve for the milling load of the propeller at various cutting depths as shown in the diagram the load of the propeller increases with the cutting depth a greater cutting depth will lead to a greater contact area between the propeller and ice block resulting in greater contact load from fig 14 we can conduct a validation analysis compared with an ice propeller cutting at 305 ms the greater cutting depth at 345 ms results is in a larger contact area as we can see from fig 15 a the force at 345 ms is greater than at 305 ms additionally a greater cutting depth will cause an earlier contact time the starting times for cutting depths of 0 4 m 0 65 m and 0 9 m are 303 ms 315 ms and 329 ms respectively this is consistent with the actual situation as the thickness of the ice is the same the deeper the cutting depth the earlier the propeller blade contacts the ice fig 14 also provides verification at the same time the blade has penetrated the ice and it has been a period of time since the load emerged in fig 14 a whereas in fig 14 c the blade has revolved just into the ice to displace just a small volume and for fig 14 e the blade was in contact only with the ice block notably fig 15 shows that the vanishing time for the ice load is essentially the same at different cutting depths by observing fig 14 b and d and 14 f we can conclude that as the blade leaves the ice only the surface of the blade remains in contact with a slice of ice that has been cut from the interior of the ice block the impact force of the propeller from the slice of ice could be negligible so the vanishing time for ice loads under different cutting depths are roughly the same this phenomenon is summarized as follows a deeper cutting depth will cause an earlier starting timing for the contact but it makes little difference in the ending time which will sustain the whole milling process longer the total process of milling times at 0 9 m and 0 65 m are respectively 1 31 and 1 14 times that at 0 4 m therefore more attention should be paid to the fatigue strength of the propeller 5 3 varying rotational speed fig 16 shows the dynamic change process of the propeller ice contact under variable propeller rotational speeds the rotational speed n is selected to be 2 rps 3 rps or 4 rps the penetration thickness is set as m 0 65 m the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l and the ice speed v 2 4 m s fig 17 displays the time variation curve for milling loads of the propeller under various rotational speeds it is easily seen that at low rotational speeds the milling load of the propeller decreases as the rotational speed increases a lower rotational speed such as in the full scale simulation will cause the milling process to be sustained longer making the ice damage from the ice impact complete causing the function between propeller blade and ice block to be more complete and severe so the ice loads tend to be larger also if the rotational speed continues to increase the milling loads will not continue to decrease and instead will increase this change occurs because the relative speed between the propeller and ice block will increase and the rotational speed keeps increasing so the impact to the ice from the propeller tends to be more severe and so the ice loads for the propeller increase also a more severe impact with the ice will result in broken ice pieces thrown from the ice block with a higher initial velocity and for great distance the thrown ice with high velocity will be a threat to the structural strength of ship stern therefore in this case more measurements need to be taken to protect the structure of the stern area from the damage of these thrown ice pieces fig 17 shows that at 2 rps the first and second halves of the contact force are positive and negative respectively at 3 rps and 4 rps the direction of contact force is always negative this can be explained by comparing the data between the advancing velocity of the ice block and the velocity component of the propeller in the x direction fig 16 a shows that at a slow rotational speed the blade leaves shallow scratches on the surface of the ice block but it does not cut pieces from the ice block as in other cases this means the ice block contacts only the back of the propeller so the propeller sustains a positive load in the x direction for the latter half of the milling load the blade can penetrate the interior of the ice block and the load analysis is the same as in fig 16 e and f looking at these figures cutting grooves appear because the whole blade mills the ice block leading to a shadow effect that covers the contact area with the back of the blade this can result in a contact area for the ice block with the blade back that is much smaller than that with the blade face therefore the positive load in the x rail from the blade back is greater than the negative load from the blade face and finally the whole blade sustains a positive load 5 4 varying advancing speed fig 18 shows the dynamic change process of the propeller ice contact under ice advancing speeds of 3 6 m s 4 8 m s and 6 m s the propeller rotational speed is n 3 r p s the penetration thickness is m 0 65 m the ice size is l 2 06 m width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l the paper focus on the influence of variable advancing speeds to the direction of ice loads if the speed spacing is too small the differences of ice loads for each conditions is too small to analysis hence the speed spacing is set as 1 2 m s and the largest advancing speed is set as 6 m s besides as we set the advancing speed of the basic condition as 2 4 m s before and find the changing law of its loads similar to the condition of 3 6 m s so we will not analysis the ice loads of 2 4 m s again here fig 19 shows the time variation curve of milling loads for the propeller blade with variable ice block advancing speeds fig 18 shows that the advancing speed can have a great impact on the magnitude and direction of the contact load this can be explained by considering the shadow effect in the propeller ice contact process a change in the advancing speed of the ice block will cause a change in the contact area of the blade face and back with the ice thus affecting the load magnitude and direction of the blade fig 18 verifies this finding in fig 18 b a small internal volume of ice is cut from the ice block so the shadowed area for the blade is quite small causing the shadow effect to have negligible influence the contact area with the ice is approximately the same with both the blade back and the blade face a forward load is exerted on the propeller blade as the ice block moves forward in fig 18 f a relatively large contact area between the blade back and the ice is shadowed as the former blade has cut a large groove area from the ice block leading to the shadow effect that greatly influences the whole blade this makes the contact area with the blade face much larger than with the blade back subjecting the whole blade to a negative load additionally as shown in fig 18 d in this working condition the milling groove is not that big nor is it too small so the contact load is influenced by both the shadow effect and the forward motion of the ice block this leads to a change in the direction of the milling loads between the positive and negative directions as shown in fig 18 c with a larger advancing velocity the axial distance of milling area between the front and blade back with the ice block is small causing the two cutting grooves to penetrate each other and to expand thus aggravating the shadow effect on the milling load if the advancing velocity of the ice block decreases the time of duration for the whole milling process also will decrease decreasing the total volume of broken ice thrown from the interior of the ice block this will cause the cutting groove to be shallow and small the axial distance of milling area between the front and back blades with the ice block also will expand making it hard to penetrate the two milling grooves and result in one all of these factors lead to a reduction in the shadow effect therefore we can conclude that the shadow effect is positively correlated with the advancing speed of the ice block 5 5 varying ice size fig 20 shows the dynamic change process of propeller ice contact with variable ice sizes the ice sizes are chosen as l 0 412 m 1 236 m and 2 06 m their width and thickness are set as the same ratio with length width w 0 5 l thickness h 1 5 l the rotational speed of the propeller is set as n 3 r p s the penetration thickness is m 0 65 m and the speed of the ice is v 4 8 m s fig 21 shows the time variation curve of the milling load with variable ice block sizes we see that the milling loads decrease with decreasing ice block sizes this is because a decrease in the ice size will lead to a decrease in the contact area between the ice and the propeller which diminishes the milling loads additionally the amplitude of variation for the milling load from the length 0 412 m 1 236 m is much greater than from 1 236 m to 2 06 m this is determined by comparing the relative size of the ice block width to the blade radius fig 20 e demonstrates that the ice block is much smaller than the propeller radius with the cutting depth at 0 2 m so that even at the maximum depth of the cut a large area of the blade surface remains exposed to the ice as the ice block size varies from 0 4 m to 0 6 m the size of the ice is greater than the width of the propeller the contact area in both cases varies little and this is also true of the milling loads we can conclude that if the propeller mills an ice block bigger than itself the increase of ice size has little effect on the milling load but if the propeller radius is larger than the ice block width increasing the ice size will more greatly affect the milling load therefore considering that the working conditions of polar ships often vary to protect the structure of the propeller blade research is needed to compare the scale of the ice size with the magnitude of the blade radius 6 conclusion in this paper we establish a numerical solution model based on pd theory coded in fortran numerically simulating the ice propeller contact process in different conditions from which we obtain a time variation curve of the milling loads we simulate a case of ice impact to validate pd in modeling ice failure the following conclusions can be drawn from this comparative analysis 1 ice load will increase with ice size additionally it appears that an increase in the magnitude of the ice will have little impact on the ice load if the width of the ice is greater than the radius of the propeller blade conversely the ice load will change rapidly with the increase of the ice size if the width of the ice is less than the radius of the propeller blade 2 because of the shadow effect a propeller blade penetrating an ice block may not completely contact the ice causing the magnitude and direction of the milling load to change rapidly with the advancing speed of ice and changing rotational speed of the screw 3 as the cutting depth increases the thrust and torque of the propeller sustained during the milling process are increasing and the time for the propeller blade exposed to the milling load is longer justifying higher requirements for strength protection of the blade 4 a greater ice speed leads to a greater contact force and torque of the propeller a shorter contact time and a more severe change of the milling loads therefore attention should be paid to the distortion of the propeller this paper has focused on the analysis of the geometry of ice and factors influencing contact it has ignored the specific properties of different kinds of ice the constitutive model of ice should be investigated under different conditions a more accurate propeller ice contact model should be established

23459,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model was conducted to determine the response performance of vortex induced vibration viv on a long circular cylinder the coupling equations of the structural oscillator model and wake oscillator model were solved based on a standard central finite difference method of the second order the viv response characteristics including viv displacement viv frequency viv wavelength standing waves travelling waves structural velocity lift force coefficient and the transferred energy from fluid to structure with different cylinder tensions were compared the numerical results show that as the tension increases the viv response amplitude and the viv frequency have slightly deceasing and increasing tendencies respectively however the viv wavelength is obviously increased as the tension increases the viv response emerges as standing waves first and then displays a mixture of standing and travelling waves last the viv response eventually transforms into travelling waves keywords vortex induced vibration standing wave travelling wave wavelength displacement envelop transferred energy 1 introduction when a fluid with reynolds number in a certain range flows past a circular cylinder periodic vortices will develop the continuous generation and shedding of these vortices will induce periodic hydrodynamic forces on the structure if the cylinder is flexibly mounted the forces may lead to vibration of the structure which is named vortex induced vibration viv blevins 2001 viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to many branches of engineering for example it influences the dynamics of mooring cables petroleum production risers and pipelines the viv of a structure is one of the key issues of the structure s design because viv increases the dynamic load on the structure and may cause fatigue damage viv problems have been studied by many researchers in past decades in early research the majority of studies focused on rigid cylinders sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 govardhan and williamson 2000 the studies of rigid cylinders can reflect many important mechanisms of the viv problem such as lock in phenomenon dahl et al 2010 and hysteretic behavior facchinetti et al 2004a however recently with the rapid development of oil and gas production in deep waters the viv responses of long flexible cylinders have received considerable attention in the practice of ocean engineering the studies of viv on long cylinders contain both physical experiments chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2009 huera huarte et al 2014 gao et al 2015 2016 and computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulations newman and karniadakis 1997 bourguet et al 2011 2013 the research content using these two methods is very abundant however when the length to diameter aspect ratio of a cylinder exceeds 103 physical experiments are usually very expensive furthermore the cfd simulation time of viv on a cylinder having a very large aspect ratio is very difficult and too long to meet the actual needs of engineering practice therefore it is very necessary to establish a selected model that can predict the important viv characteristics of cylinders with large aspect ratios quickly in recent years the wake oscillator method has been used widely to predict the viv responses of long structures bishop and hassan 1964 first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van del pol equation to simulate the lift force acted on the structure in vortex induced vibration after that based on the suggestion of bishop and hassan 1964 hartlen and currie 1970 proposed the first wake oscillator model where the structural vibration velocity was coupled with the van der pol equation facchinetti et al 2004a compared the amplitudes of the structural and wake oscillators on a rigid cylinder with three different coupled models including displacement velocity and acceleration models and they found that the acceleration model is the most appropriate one to simulate the wake dynamics the wake oscillator model is also been used to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders by many other researchers farshidianfar and zanganeh 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 jin and dong 2016 kang et al 2018 as the long cylinders used in ocean engineering develop quickly the model is further developed to predict the viv responses of long structures facchinetti et al 2004b extended their research for predicting viv and viw vortex induced waves responses of a cable in uniform flows mathelin and de langre 2005 further pushed facchinetti et al s work to study the viv responses of a cable subjected to shear flows violette et al 2010 validated the results predicted by the wake oscillator method against the numerical and experimental results on flexible cylinders in both uniform and shear flows this model has also been used by other researchers to study the viv characteristics of long cylinders xu et al 2008 2017 ge et al 2009 viotette et al 2010 grouthier et al 2014 doan and nishi 2015 low and srinil 2016 the main difference between the cfd method and the wake oscillator method is how the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure are determined the former method computes the hydrodynamic forces directly by solving navier stokes equations the latter method determines the forces empirically using a wake oscillator model from past studies facchinetti et al 2004a vandiver et al 2009 it was found that compared with that of a rigid cylinder the viv response of a flexible cylinder has many additional complicated characteristics such as standing wave behavior travelling wave behavior multiple response frequencies and time sharing standing wave and travelling wave behaviors are two important differences between the viv responses of a rigid cylinder and a flexible one and indicate that the viv response varies along the cylinder span for a rigid circular cylinder as the vibration stabilizes the vibration response y can be expressed simply as y t y 0cos ωt facchinetti et al 2004a where y 0 is the vibration amplitude ω is the vibration angular frequency and t is the time according to this relationship the viv response remains constant along the span however for a flexible cylinder the viv response will change along the span and also the expression of the vibration response y will be more complicated the expression can be written as y z t y 0sin 2πz λ sinωt for standing wave behavior and y z t y 0sin 2πz λ ωt for travelling wave behavior vandiver et al 2009 where ω and t are as defined for the stable response and λ is the wavelength which reflects the response variation along the span another parameter the wavenumber k k 2π λ also is used to express the response variation along the span and the related expressions using this parameter can be found elsewhere facchinetti et al 2004b mathelin and de langre 2005 viotette et al 2010 as with the viv characteristics of flexible cylinders having very large aspect ratios remain some unanswered fundamental questions that need further research for example as the cylinder tension varies how do the standing and travelling wave behaviors change furthermore how do the important parameters such as vibration amplitude vibration frequency and vibration wavelength vary with different tensions to answer these questions we developed a simulation method to conduct several studies on the viv response of long cylinders in section 4 1 to validate our method s reliability the results from our method are compared with the results obtained using direct numerical simulation dns method in section 4 2 the sensitivity of the viv response to different selected length to diameter aspect ratios is studied in section 4 3 the sensitivity to the cylinder tension is reported in section 4 4 the lift force structural velocity and transferred energy from the fluid to the structure are discussed 2 model description for flexible cylinders viv responses are dominated by the bending stiffness ei and tension θ simultaneously however when the aspect ratio becomes very large on the same order of 103 the contribution of the bending stiffness to the viv responses is very small compared to that of the tension and even can be negligible thus a cylinder with a very large aspect ratio can be simplified as an infinite tensioned cable model let us consider an infinite tensioned cable with diameter d and constant axial tension θ constrained to oscillate transversely to a stationary and uniform flow with velocity u as shown in fig 1 due to the infinite characteristics of the cable here we just choose a part of the cable with length l and periodic boundary conditions to conduct our study whether the viv performances are sensitive to the selected cable length l or not will be discussed in detail in section 4 2 the dimensional cross flow displacement y of the selected cable can be described as 1 m 2 y z t t 2 r y z t t θ y 2 z t z 2 p z t where t is the dimensional time and z is the dimensional space coordinate as shown in fig 1 in eq 1 m is the mass per unit length of the vibration system and includes the structural mass m s and the added mass m f it is calculated as m m s m f m s c m ρd 2π 4 in which c m and ρ are the added mass coefficient and fluid density respectively r is the damping

in which st is the strouhal number compared with the value of the fluid damping coefficient especially in low mass ratio media such as water the structural damping coefficient is very small and even can be ignored thus the structural damping coefficient is neglected in this paper γ is the stall parameter γ c d 4πst in which c d is the mean drag coefficient p z t is the lift force per unit length

3 although the strouhal number st is dependent on reynolds number we considered to be constant and assumed it to be an approximation for the subcritical range for a cylinder undergoing vibration st usually has a value less than 0 2 for a stationary cylinder lie and kaasen 2006 for consistency with the results of newman and karniadakis 1997 the value of st was set as 0 16 in the model eqs 3 and 4 were discretized using a standard central finite difference method of the second order in both the time and space domains supposing the total calculated time t total can be divided into n segments and

furthermore δz 0 1 and δt 0 01 are applied to discretize the space and time domains respectively the calculation proceeded for a dimensionless time t of 600 for all simulation cases reported in this paper the detailed description of this discretization method can also be found in the literature written by riley et al 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical model validation before proceeding to the issue under investigation a model validation procedure was conducted to verify the accuracy and usefulness of the procedure all parameters used in the validation had the same values as those used by newman and karniadakis 1997 i e st 0 16 c 4 μ 1 785 and l d 25 fig 2 shows the evolution of tensioned cable displacement with time and space using our wake oscillator model compared with the results using the dns model developed by newman and karniadakis 1997 it can be seen in fig 2 that the vibration frequency and the wavelength predicted by the two models were both very close the displacements predicted by the two models were both in the range from 0 6 to 0 6 in both models the standing wave behaviors emerged first and then the standing wave behaviors transformed into the travelling wave behaviors after several vibration cycles for consistency with newman and karniadakis s results in fig 2 the parameter of the horizontal ordinate was t 2πst in general there was very good agreement in vibration frequency wavelength standing wave behavior and travelling wave behavior between the predictions from our wake oscillator model and those of newman and karniadakis s dns model 4 2 sensitivity to selected length to diameter ratios the purpose of this section is to prove that the viv characteristics are not sensitive to the selected aspect ratio so that we can use a finite tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions to study the viv characteristics of an infinite tensioned cable here three typical different aspect ratios with the values of 25 75 and 125 are selected to study this problem fig 3 shows the time series of structural displacement fluctuation and root mean square rms values of dimensionless displacements along the span for different length to diameter ratios when l d varies the mass ratio μ and the dimensionless tension c remain constant values at 2 and 4 respectively it can be seen from fig 3 that when the dimensionless time is between 200 and 230 for the three l d ratios the viv displacements all display the standing wave behaviors when dimensionless time exceeds 230 the standing wave behaviors change to a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves the propagation velocities can be determined from fig 3 for example when l d 75 the dimensionless time of the propagation from the bottom location z 0 to the top location z 75 is approximately 20 thus the dimensionless velocity of the propagation is about 3 75 the wavelengths for the three aspect ratios can also be found from fig 3 and remain constant at a value of 25 when l d varied the rms values of the dimensionless displacements for l d 25 75 and 125 are 0 476 0 468 and 0 463 respectively these results clearly demonstrated that the viv displacement is not sensitive to the selected aspect ratio to further confirm that the viv characteristics are not sensitive to a selected aspect ratio the vibration frequencies for the three different aspect ratios are also studied here fig 3 shows that for each of the different aspect ratios the dimensionless period t p has the same value thus the dimensionless frequency ω ω 2π t p also has the same value generally speaking when l d varies the viv characteristics including the viv displacement viv frequency standing wave behavior and travelling wave behavior all remain constant in other words viv response of long tensioned cable had no relationship with the selected aspect ratio therefore the remainder of the study is conducted using a single aspect ratio l d 75 4 3 sensitivity to cable tension this section describes results of the study on the effect that tension has on the viv characteristics of a finite tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions the values of the aspect ratio l d and the mass ratio μ are set at constant values 75 and 2 respectively figs 4 6 show the evolutions of the structural displacements versus time and span the displacement versus time at a nodal location and the instantaneous displacement along the span at a random time when the dimensionless tension c is 2 4 and 6 respectively it can be seen from figs 4 6 that when the dimensionless time is small the viv displacement at the nodal location fluctuates with a stable small amplitude and during this time the viv displacements along the span display standing wave behaviors as the dimensionless time is increased the viv displacement at the nodal location becomes unstable the fluctuation amplitude increases and the viv displacements along the span transmit to a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves when the dimensionless time is further increased the viv displacement at the nodal location re stabilize and the viv displacement fluctuates with a stable large amplitude and during this time the viv displacements along the span transform into travelling wave behaviors for all three cable tensions the standing waves eventually change to travelling waves in other words the travelling wave behaviors become the ultimate stable behaviors the reason of the transition from a standing wave pattern to a travelling wave pattern will be discussed in section 4 4 the propagation velocities of the travelling waves also can be determined from figs 4 6 the propagation times from one end of the cable to the other end are 40 19 and 12 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively the propagation velocities can be calculated using the aspect ratio 75 divided by each of these propagation times resulting in the propagation velocities of 1 88 3 95 and 6 25 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively thus the propagation velocity of the travelling wave increases as c increases the dimensionless wave lengths are 15 25 and 37 5 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively thus wavelength also increases as c increases it can be seen from figs 4 6 that the propagation direction of the travelling wave is arbitrary the viv response amplitudes and frequencies for different cable tensions can also be observed from figs 4 6 the dimensionless values of viv response amplitudes for c 2 4 and 6 are 0 77 0 6475 and 0 6471 respectively thus as tension increases the viv amplitude decreases compared with the decrease of the viv amplitude when c varies from 2 to 4 the decrease of the viv amplitude is much smaller when c varies from 4 to 6 the dimensionless viv periods t p are 7 69 6 29 and 6 25 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively the dimensionless angular frequencies ω can be calculated using the expression ω 2π t p accordingly the dimensionless angular frequencies are 0 817 0 999 and 1 005 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively and thus viv frequency increases as the tension increases however compared with the increase of the viv frequency when c varies from 2 to 4 the increase of the viv frequency is much smaller when c varies from 4 to 6 the viv displacement characteristics including viv amplitude and frequency are closely related with the transferred energy from the fluid to the structure which will be discussed in detail in section 4 4 we further studied the viv displacement envelops of standing wave behaviors the mixture of standing wave and travelling wave behaviors and the travelling wave behaviors we used a single dimensionless time interval of 10 for each behavior figs 7 9 show the structural displacement envelops with the three different wave behavior patterns and the viv displacement variations with time at four classical locations along the span named as node 1 anti node 1 node 2 and anti node 2 figs 7 9 show that during the standing wave period several nodes exist where the values of the viv displacement amplitudes are always near zero however compared with those at the nodes the values of the viv displacement amplitudes at the anti nodes are much larger the values of viv displacement amplitudes at nodes and anti nodes are all very stable during this period as time increases the viv displacement amplitudes at the nodes lift upward significantly however the viv displacement amplitudes at the anti nodes are pushed downward slightly the viv responses display the mixture of standing waves and travelling waves finally the displacement amplitudes at the nodes lift up quickly and the amplitudes at the anti nodes push down slowly and become very close and the viv response display travelling wave behaviors during the travelling wave period the values of viv displacement amplitudes at nodes and anti nodes re stabilize 4 4 lift force coefficient structural velocity and fluid structure energy transfer to further confirm the intrinsic reason for the transition from a standing wave pattern to a travelling wave pattern in this section we studied the lift force coefficient the structural velocity and the instantaneous energy transferred from the fluid to the structure the instantaneous energy w l z t induced by the lift force coefficient c l z t acting on the cable can be expressed as newman and karniadakis 1997 12 w l z t c l z t v z t c l 0 2 q z t y z t t where v z t y z t and q z t are the instantaneous velocity displacement and the wake variable respectively figs 10 12 show the evolutions of the lift force coefficient structural velocity transferred energy versus time and span and the instantaneous energy with time at four classical locations along the span the four classical locations were selected as the same ones in section 4 3 the transferred energy with positive value implies that the fluid supplies energy to the structure and excites cable vibration while negative value indicates that the energy is transferred from the structure to the fluid and damps the structural vibration as shown in figs 10 12 for the cable with period boundary conditions when the lift force coefficient is at its maximum the structural velocity has the largest value however the structural velocity has the smallest value when the lift force coefficient is at its minimum in other words the lift force coefficient is always in phase with the structural velocity thus it can be seen from eq 12 that the value of the instantaneous energy is always no less than zero indicating that there exists no energy transferred from the cable to the fluid in fact it is an idealization and caused by the special boundary conditions of the cable the periodic boundary conditions lead to that the redundant energy is transferred from the one end of the cable to the other end instead of the transfer from the cable to the fluid insuring that the viv displacement of the two ends always have the same values y 0 t y l d t for the nodal location during the standing wave period the energy transferred from the fluid to the structure is always near zero as the dimensionless time is increased the energy amplitude lifts up largely when the dimensionless time is further increased to the travelling wave period the energy amplitude becomes re stabilized however for the anti nodal location the energy fluctuates with a stable large amplitude during the standing wave period then the energy amplitude pushes down slightly and finally becomes re stable during the travelling wave period generally speaking during the standing wave period there is no energy transferred between the node and anti node resulting in that the energies at the node and anti node both fluctuate with a stable amplitude when the dimensionless time is increased into the mixed waves period the energy at the node lifts up and during this time the energy at the anti node pushes down indicating that there exists energy transferred from the anti node to the node this energy transfer results in that the energies at the anti node and node have the same values and eventually lead to the complete travelling wave behaviors during the travelling wave period the energies at the node and anti node both fluctuate with a constant amplitude again comparing figs 10 12 and figs 7 9 shows that the energy and viv displacement varied with time have the same trend that is to say the viv displacement of the cable is closely related with the energy transferred from the fluid to the cable it can be seen from figs 10 12 as tension increases the eventual amplitude of the energy decreases resulting in the decrease of the viv displacement amplitude and at the same time the fluctuation frequency of the energy is increased leading to the increase of the viv displacement frequency 5 conclusions the effects of selected length to diameter aspect ratios and cylinder tensions on the viv response characteristics of a tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions have been studied numerically during the sensitivity analysis of the aspect ratio three different aspect ratios 25 75 and 125 were studied while the mass ratio and the dimensionless tension remained constant at values 2 and 4 respectively during the sensitivity analysis of the cylinder tension three different dimensionless tensions 2 4 and 6 were studied while the aspect ratio and the mass ratio remained constant at values 75 and 2 respectively a standard central finite difference method of the second order was used to solve the coupling equations of the structural model and wake oscillator model the viv response characteristics including viv displacement viv frequency viv wavelength standing wave behavior travelling wave behavior and the variation of the structural displacements structural velocities lift force coefficients and the transferred energies from the fluid to the structure at nodes and anti nodes were determined and systematically discussed based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 in the viv model simulations of three different aspect ratios the viv responses including the viv amplitude viv frequency and viv wavelength are constant meanwhile the models also predict the same standing wave and travelling wave behaviors that is to say viv response performances of very long circular cylinders are independent of the selected aspect ratio 2 in the viv model simulations of three different cylinder tensions as the tension increases the viv displacement amplitude tends to slightly decrease and the viv displacement frequency tends to slightly increase the viv wavelength and the propagation velocity of the travelling wave obviously increases as the tension increases 3 in all cylinder models the viv response display the standing waves first during this first stage the viv displacements at nodes stabilize near zero then a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves are developed during this second stage the viv displacements at node and anti node are largely lifted up and slightly pushed down respectively eventually the viv responses are ultimately transformed into the travelling waves during this last stage the viv displacements at node and anti node re stabilize to the same values 4 the energy transferred from the fluid to the structure and viv displacement varied with time have the same trend indicating that the viv displacement is closely related with the transferred energy during the first stage there exists no energy being transferred between the node and anti node as the time enters the second stage the transferred energy from the anti node to the node appears during this time the energy at anti node decrease slightly while the energy at node increases largely finally the energies at node and anti node have the same values during the last stage acknowledgements this research was supported by the national science foundation of china grant nos 51609206 51522902 and

23459,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model was conducted to determine the response performance of vortex induced vibration viv on a long circular cylinder the coupling equations of the structural oscillator model and wake oscillator model were solved based on a standard central finite difference method of the second order the viv response characteristics including viv displacement viv frequency viv wavelength standing waves travelling waves structural velocity lift force coefficient and the transferred energy from fluid to structure with different cylinder tensions were compared the numerical results show that as the tension increases the viv response amplitude and the viv frequency have slightly deceasing and increasing tendencies respectively however the viv wavelength is obviously increased as the tension increases the viv response emerges as standing waves first and then displays a mixture of standing and travelling waves last the viv response eventually transforms into travelling waves keywords vortex induced vibration standing wave travelling wave wavelength displacement envelop transferred energy 1 introduction when a fluid with reynolds number in a certain range flows past a circular cylinder periodic vortices will develop the continuous generation and shedding of these vortices will induce periodic hydrodynamic forces on the structure if the cylinder is flexibly mounted the forces may lead to vibration of the structure which is named vortex induced vibration viv blevins 2001 viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to many branches of engineering for example it influences the dynamics of mooring cables petroleum production risers and pipelines the viv of a structure is one of the key issues of the structure s design because viv increases the dynamic load on the structure and may cause fatigue damage viv problems have been studied by many researchers in past decades in early research the majority of studies focused on rigid cylinders sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 govardhan and williamson 2000 the studies of rigid cylinders can reflect many important mechanisms of the viv problem such as lock in phenomenon dahl et al 2010 and hysteretic behavior facchinetti et al 2004a however recently with the rapid development of oil and gas production in deep waters the viv responses of long flexible cylinders have received considerable attention in the practice of ocean engineering the studies of viv on long cylinders contain both physical experiments chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2009 huera huarte et al 2014 gao et al 2015 2016 and computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulations newman and karniadakis 1997 bourguet et al 2011 2013 the research content using these two methods is very abundant however when the length to diameter aspect ratio of a cylinder exceeds 103 physical experiments are usually very expensive furthermore the cfd simulation time of viv on a cylinder having a very large aspect ratio is very difficult and too long to meet the actual needs of engineering practice therefore it is very necessary to establish a selected model that can predict the important viv characteristics of cylinders with large aspect ratios quickly in recent years the wake oscillator method has been used widely to predict the viv responses of long structures bishop and hassan 1964 first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van del pol equation to simulate the lift force acted on the structure in vortex induced vibration after that based on the suggestion of bishop and hassan 1964 hartlen and currie 1970 proposed the first wake oscillator model where the structural vibration velocity was coupled with the van der pol equation facchinetti et al 2004a compared the amplitudes of the structural and wake oscillators on a rigid cylinder with three different coupled models including displacement velocity and acceleration models and they found that the acceleration model is the most appropriate one to simulate the wake dynamics the wake oscillator model is also been used to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders by many other researchers farshidianfar and zanganeh 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 jin and dong 2016 kang et al 2018 as the long cylinders used in ocean engineering develop quickly the model is further developed to predict the viv responses of long structures facchinetti et al 2004b extended their research for predicting viv and viw vortex induced waves responses of a cable in uniform flows mathelin and de langre 2005 further pushed facchinetti et al s work to study the viv responses of a cable subjected to shear flows violette et al 2010 validated the results predicted by the wake oscillator method against the numerical and experimental results on flexible cylinders in both uniform and shear flows this model has also been used by other researchers to study the viv characteristics of long cylinders xu et al 2008 2017 ge et al 2009 viotette et al 2010 grouthier et al 2014 doan and nishi 2015 low and srinil 2016 the main difference between the cfd method and the wake oscillator method is how the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure are determined the former method computes the hydrodynamic forces directly by solving navier stokes equations the latter method determines the forces empirically using a wake oscillator model from past studies facchinetti et al 2004a vandiver et al 2009 it was found that compared with that of a rigid cylinder the viv response of a flexible cylinder has many additional complicated characteristics such as standing wave behavior travelling wave behavior multiple response frequencies and time sharing standing wave and travelling wave behaviors are two important differences between the viv responses of a rigid cylinder and a flexible one and indicate that the viv response varies along the cylinder span for a rigid circular cylinder as the vibration stabilizes the vibration response y can be expressed simply as y t y 0cos ωt facchinetti et al 2004a where y 0 is the vibration amplitude ω is the vibration angular frequency and t is the time according to this relationship the viv response remains constant along the span however for a flexible cylinder the viv response will change along the span and also the expression of the vibration response y will be more complicated the expression can be written as y z t y 0sin 2πz λ sinωt for standing wave behavior and y z t y 0sin 2πz λ ωt for travelling wave behavior vandiver et al 2009 where ω and t are as defined for the stable response and λ is the wavelength which reflects the response variation along the span another parameter the wavenumber k k 2π λ also is used to express the response variation along the span and the related expressions using this parameter can be found elsewhere facchinetti et al 2004b mathelin and de langre 2005 viotette et al 2010 as with the viv characteristics of flexible cylinders having very large aspect ratios remain some unanswered fundamental questions that need further research for example as the cylinder tension varies how do the standing and travelling wave behaviors change furthermore how do the important parameters such as vibration amplitude vibration frequency and vibration wavelength vary with different tensions to answer these questions we developed a simulation method to conduct several studies on the viv response of long cylinders in section 4 1 to validate our method s reliability the results from our method are compared with the results obtained using direct numerical simulation dns method in section 4 2 the sensitivity of the viv response to different selected length to diameter aspect ratios is studied in section 4 3 the sensitivity to the cylinder tension is reported in section 4 4 the lift force structural velocity and transferred energy from the fluid to the structure are discussed 2 model description for flexible cylinders viv responses are dominated by the bending stiffness ei and tension θ simultaneously however when the aspect ratio becomes very large on the same order of 103 the contribution of the bending stiffness to the viv responses is very small compared to that of the tension and even can be negligible thus a cylinder with a very large aspect ratio can be simplified as an infinite tensioned cable model let us consider an infinite tensioned cable with diameter d and constant axial tension θ constrained to oscillate transversely to a stationary and uniform flow with velocity u as shown in fig 1 due to the infinite characteristics of the cable here we just choose a part of the cable with length l and periodic boundary conditions to conduct our study whether the viv performances are sensitive to the selected cable length l or not will be discussed in detail in section 4 2 the dimensional cross flow displacement y of the selected cable can be described as 1 m 2 y z t t 2 r y z t t θ y 2 z t z 2 p z t where t is the dimensional time and z is the dimensional space coordinate as shown in fig 1 in eq 1 m is the mass per unit length of the vibration system and includes the structural mass m s and the added mass m f it is calculated as m m s m f m s c m ρd 2π 4 in which c m and ρ are the added mass coefficient and fluid density respectively r is the damping coefficient which includes the structural damping coefficient r s and fluid damping coefficient r f r f can be expresses as r f γω f ρd 2 where ω f is the vortex shedding angular frequency ω f 2πstu d in which st is the strouhal number compared with the value of the fluid damping coefficient especially in low mass ratio media such as water the structural damping coefficient is very small and even can be ignored thus the structural damping coefficient is neglected in this paper γ is the stall parameter γ c d 4πst in which c d is the mean drag coefficient p z t is the lift force per unit length and can be expressed as p z t ρu 2 dc l0 q z t 4 facchinetti et al 2004a in which c l0 is the reference lift coefficient and q z t is the dimensionless wake variable a classical van der pol equation

3 although the strouhal number st is dependent on reynolds number we considered to be constant and assumed it to be an approximation for the subcritical range for a cylinder undergoing vibration st usually has a value less than 0 2 for a stationary cylinder lie and kaasen 2006 for consistency with the results of newman and karniadakis 1997 the value of st was set as 0 16 in the model eqs 3 and 4 were discretized using a standard central finite difference method of the second order in both the time and space domains supposing the total calculated time t total can be divided into n segments and space length l d can be divided into m segments each time step can be determined as δt t total n and each space step as δz l d m the discrete space locations were expressed as z z i with i 0 1 2 m and the discrete times were expressed as t t j with j 0 1 2 n the dimensionless parameters y and q at location z m with time t n are denoted as y n m and q n m respectively the related partial derivatives with respect to y and q in eqs 3 and 4 can be expressed as 5 y t t t n z z m y n 1 m y n 1 m 2 δ t 2 y t 2 t t n z z m y n 1 m y n 1 m 2 y n m δ t 2 2 y z 2 t t n z z m y n m 1 y n m 1 2 y n m δ z 2 q

displacement y and the velocity y t along the span are all zero a one wavenumber excitation with amplitude of order o 10 3 is applied to the fluid variable q and the first time derivative q t is also set to zero thus the values of y 0 m and q 0 m when 0 m m can be directly determined from the initial conditions however when determining the values of y 1 m and q 1 m when 0 m m the initial conditions y t 0 and q t 0 should be used from y t 0 and q t 0 we have 7 y 1 m y 1 m q 1 m q 1 m substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the values of y 1 m and q 1 m can be written as 8 2 y 1 m δ t 2 m q 0 m 2 δ

expressed as 9 y 0 t y l d t the first expression of eq 6 shows that y n 1 m can be calculated directly when 1 m m 1 however the periodic boundary condition y n 0 y n m must be used when m 0 and m m the values of y n 1 and y n m 1 existed in the first expression of eq 6 when m 0 and m m can be written as 10 y n 1 y n m 1 y n m 1 y n 1 substituting eq 10 into the first expression of eq 6 the expression for y n 1 m when m 0 and m m can be developed as 11 1 δ t 2 γ 2 μ δ t y n 1 0 m q n 0 2 δ t 2 2 c 2 δ z 2 y n 0 γ 2 μ δ t 1 δ t 2 y n 1 0 c 2 δ z 2 y n 1 y n m 1 1 δ t 2 γ 2 μ δ t y n 1 m m

furthermore δz 0 1 and δt 0 01 are applied to discretize the space and time domains respectively the calculation proceeded for a dimensionless time t of 600 for all simulation cases reported in this paper the detailed description of this discretization method can also be found in the literature written by riley et al 1998 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical model validation before proceeding to the issue under investigation a model validation procedure was conducted to verify the accuracy and usefulness of the procedure all parameters used in the validation had the same values as those

finite tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions to study the viv characteristics of an infinite tensioned cable here three typical different aspect ratios with the values of 25 75 and 125 are selected to study this problem fig 3 shows the time series of structural displacement fluctuation and root mean square rms values of dimensionless displacements along the span for different length to diameter ratios when l d varies the mass ratio μ and the dimensionless tension c remain constant values at 2 and 4 respectively it can be seen from fig 3 that when the dimensionless time is between 200 and 230 for the three l d ratios the viv displacements all display the standing wave behaviors when dimensionless time exceeds 230 the standing wave behaviors change to a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves the propagation velocities can be determined from fig 3 for example when l d 75 the dimensionless time of the propagation from the bottom location z 0 to the top location z 75 is approximately 20 thus the dimensionless velocity of the propagation is about 3 75 the wavelengths for the three aspect ratios can also be found from fig 3 and remain constant at a value of 25 when l d varied the rms values of the dimensionless displacements for l d 25 75 and 125 are 0 476 0 468 and 0 463 respectively these results clearly demonstrated that the viv displacement is not sensitive to the selected aspect ratio to further confirm that the viv characteristics are not sensitive to a selected aspect ratio the vibration frequencies for the three different aspect ratios are also studied here fig 3 shows that for each of the different aspect ratios the dimensionless period t p has the same value thus the dimensionless frequency ω ω 2π t p also has the same value generally speaking when l d varies the viv characteristics including the viv displacement viv frequency standing wave behavior and travelling wave behavior all remain constant in other words viv response of long tensioned cable had no relationship with the selected aspect ratio therefore the remainder of the study is conducted using a single aspect ratio l d 75 4 3 sensitivity to cable tension this section describes results of the study on the effect that tension has on the viv characteristics of a finite tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions the values of the aspect ratio l d and the mass ratio μ are set at constant values 75 and 2 respectively figs 4 6 show the evolutions of the structural displacements versus time and span the displacement versus time at a nodal location and the instantaneous displacement along the span at a random time when the dimensionless tension c is 2 4 and 6 respectively it can be seen from figs 4 6 that when the dimensionless time is small the viv displacement at the nodal location fluctuates with a stable small amplitude and during this time the viv displacements along the span display standing wave behaviors as the dimensionless time is increased the viv displacement at the nodal location becomes unstable the fluctuation amplitude increases and the viv displacements along the span transmit to a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves when the dimensionless time is further increased the viv displacement at the nodal location re stabilize and the viv displacement fluctuates with a stable large amplitude and during this time the viv displacements along the span transform into travelling wave behaviors for all three cable tensions the standing waves eventually change to travelling waves in other words the travelling wave behaviors become the ultimate stable behaviors the reason of the transition from a standing wave pattern to a travelling wave pattern will be discussed in section 4 4 the propagation velocities of the travelling waves also can be determined from figs 4 6 the propagation times from one end of the cable to the other end are 40 19 and 12 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively the propagation velocities can be calculated using the aspect ratio 75 divided by each of these propagation times resulting in the propagation velocities of 1 88 3 95 and 6 25 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively thus the propagation velocity of the travelling wave increases as c increases the dimensionless wave lengths are 15 25 and 37 5 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively thus wavelength also increases as c increases it can be seen from figs 4 6 that the propagation direction of the travelling wave is arbitrary the viv response amplitudes and frequencies for different cable tensions can also be observed from figs 4 6 the dimensionless values of viv response amplitudes for c 2 4 and 6 are 0 77 0 6475 and 0 6471 respectively thus as tension increases the viv amplitude decreases compared with the decrease of the viv amplitude when c varies from 2 to 4 the decrease of the viv amplitude is much smaller when c varies from 4 to 6 the dimensionless viv periods t p are 7 69 6 29 and 6 25 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively the dimensionless angular frequencies ω can be calculated using the expression ω 2π t p accordingly the dimensionless angular frequencies are 0 817 0 999 and 1 005 for c 2 4 and 6 respectively and thus viv frequency increases as the tension increases however compared with the increase of the viv frequency when c varies from 2 to 4 the increase of the viv frequency is much smaller when c varies from 4 to 6 the viv displacement characteristics including viv amplitude and frequency are closely related with the transferred energy from the fluid to the structure which will be discussed in detail in section 4 4 we further studied the viv displacement envelops of standing wave behaviors the mixture of standing wave and travelling wave behaviors and the travelling wave behaviors we used a single dimensionless time interval of 10 for each behavior figs 7 9 show the structural displacement envelops with the three different wave behavior patterns and the viv displacement variations with time at four classical locations along the span named as node 1 anti node 1 node 2 and anti node 2 figs 7 9 show that during the standing wave period several nodes exist where the values of the viv displacement amplitudes are always near zero however compared with those at the nodes the values of the viv displacement amplitudes at the anti nodes are much larger the values of viv displacement amplitudes at nodes and anti nodes are all very stable during this period as time increases the viv displacement amplitudes at the nodes lift upward significantly however the viv displacement amplitudes at the anti nodes are pushed downward slightly the viv responses display the mixture of standing waves and travelling waves finally the displacement amplitudes at the nodes lift up quickly and the amplitudes at the anti nodes push down slowly and become very close and the viv response display travelling wave behaviors during the travelling wave period the values of viv displacement amplitudes at nodes and anti nodes re stabilize 4 4 lift force coefficient structural velocity and fluid structure energy transfer to further confirm the intrinsic reason for the transition from a standing wave pattern to a travelling wave pattern in this section we studied the lift force coefficient the structural velocity and the instantaneous energy transferred from the fluid to the structure the instantaneous energy w l z t induced by the lift force coefficient c l z t acting on the cable can be expressed as newman and karniadakis 1997 12 w l z t c l z t v z t c l 0 2 q z t y z t t where v z t y z t and q z t are the instantaneous velocity displacement and the wake variable respectively figs 10 12 show the evolutions of the lift force coefficient structural velocity transferred energy versus time and span and the instantaneous energy with time at four classical locations along the span the four classical locations were selected as the same ones in section 4 3 the transferred energy with positive value implies that the fluid supplies energy to the structure and excites cable vibration while negative value indicates that the energy is transferred from the structure to the fluid and damps the structural vibration as shown in figs 10 12 for the cable with period boundary conditions when the lift force coefficient is at its maximum the structural velocity has the largest value however the structural velocity has the smallest value when the lift force coefficient is at its minimum in other words the lift force coefficient is always in phase with the structural velocity thus it can be seen from eq 12 that the value of the instantaneous energy is always no less than zero indicating that there exists no energy transferred from the cable to the fluid in fact it is an idealization and caused by the special boundary conditions of the cable the periodic boundary conditions lead to that the redundant energy is transferred from the one end of the cable to the other end instead of the transfer from the cable to the fluid insuring that the viv displacement of the two ends always have the same values y 0 t y l d t for the nodal location during the standing wave period the energy transferred from the fluid to the structure is always near zero as the dimensionless time is increased the energy amplitude lifts up largely when the dimensionless time is further increased to the travelling wave period the energy amplitude becomes re stabilized however for the anti nodal location the energy fluctuates with a stable large amplitude during the standing wave period then the energy amplitude pushes down slightly and finally becomes re stable during the travelling wave period generally speaking during the standing wave period there is no energy transferred between the node and anti node resulting in that the energies at the node and anti node both fluctuate with a stable amplitude when the dimensionless time is increased into the mixed waves period the energy at the node lifts up and during this time the energy at the anti node pushes down indicating that there exists energy transferred from the anti node to the node this energy transfer results in that the energies at the anti node and node have the same values and eventually lead to the complete travelling wave behaviors during the travelling wave period the energies at the node and anti node both fluctuate with a constant amplitude again comparing figs 10 12 and figs 7 9 shows that the energy and viv displacement varied with time have the same trend that is to say the viv displacement of the cable is closely related with the energy transferred from the fluid to the cable it can be seen from figs 10 12 as tension increases the eventual amplitude of the energy decreases resulting in the decrease of the viv displacement amplitude and at the same time the fluctuation frequency of the energy is increased leading to the increase of the viv displacement frequency 5 conclusions the effects of selected length to diameter aspect ratios and cylinder tensions on the viv response characteristics of a tensioned cable with periodic boundary conditions have been studied numerically during the sensitivity analysis of the aspect ratio three different aspect ratios 25 75 and 125 were studied while the mass ratio and the dimensionless tension remained constant at values 2 and 4 respectively during the sensitivity analysis of the cylinder tension three different dimensionless tensions 2 4 and 6 were studied while the aspect ratio and the mass ratio remained constant at values 75 and 2 respectively a standard central finite difference method of the second order was used to solve the coupling equations of the structural model and wake oscillator model the viv response characteristics including viv displacement viv frequency viv wavelength standing wave behavior travelling wave behavior and the variation of the structural displacements structural velocities lift force coefficients and the transferred energies from the fluid to the structure at nodes and anti nodes were determined and systematically discussed based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 in the viv model simulations of three different aspect ratios the viv responses including the viv amplitude viv frequency and viv wavelength are constant meanwhile the models also predict the same standing wave and travelling wave behaviors that is to say viv response performances of very long circular cylinders are independent of the selected aspect ratio 2 in the viv model simulations of three different cylinder tensions as the tension increases the viv displacement amplitude tends to slightly decrease and the viv displacement frequency tends to slightly increase the viv wavelength and the propagation velocity of the travelling wave obviously increases as the tension increases 3 in all cylinder models the viv response display the standing waves first during this first stage the viv displacements at nodes stabilize near zero then a mixture of standing waves and travelling waves are developed during this second stage the viv displacements at node and anti node are largely lifted up and slightly pushed down respectively eventually the viv responses are ultimately transformed into the travelling waves during this last stage the viv displacements at node and anti node re stabilize to the same values 4 the energy transferred from the fluid to the structure and viv displacement varied with time have the same trend indicating that the viv displacement is closely related with the transferred energy during the first stage there exists no energy being transferred between the node and anti node as the time enters the second stage the transferred energy from the anti node to the node appears during this time the energy at anti node decrease slightly while the energy at node increases largely finally the energies at node and anti node have the same values during the last stage acknowledgements this research was supported by the national science foundation of china grant nos 51609206 51522902 and
