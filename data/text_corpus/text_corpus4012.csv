20060,water demand for consumption has been increasing continuously due to the expanding population worldwide the current accessible water is continually contaminated by global climate change and anthropogenic activities economically viable and safe treatment technologies are required for the contemporary world to meet the water demand the coagulation process is an economically feasible method and gaining much prominence in developing countries for water treatment during the operation sludge and secondary by products are formed due to the overdosage of the coagulant and improper mixing speeds optimizing process parameters is essential to reduce the costs associated with further treatment thus the current study aimed to optimize the process parameters by using alum chitin and sago coagulants with three ph variations i e 6 7 and 8 with a mixing speed of 100 30 and 80 20 rpm the results revealed that sago performed better than other coagulants and removed the turbidity up to 99 42 in addition sludge was reduced to 90 with a dosage of 0 4 g l a minor dosage compared to the literature with an optimal ph of 7 further the coagulants were characterized to identify the functionalized groups by ftir the nature of the coagulant by xrd and surface morphology by sem from the current study it can be concluded that a coagulant dose ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 g l with a mixing speed of 100 rpm for 2 min and 30 rpm for 30 min might be the best solution for obtaining greater coagulation efficiency keywords coagulants coagulation optimization turbidity mixing speed and sludge 1 introduction the quality of the water for human consumption specifically emphasizes its health effects drinking water demand worldwide has been increasing significantly due to the continuous increase in population dayarathne et al 2022a the accessible water resources are continuously polluted because of anthropogenic activities and climate change amiri et al 2021 dayarathne et al 2022b cost effective reliable and safe water treatment technologies are required for the current world to provide safe and clean drinking water for the expanding populations sadhu et al 2021 over the past few decades many researchers adopted different treatment processes like the chemical and physical processes for water treatment including coagulation membrane filtration and adsorption kaur 2021 prajapati et al 2021 turbidity is considered one of the most significant factors in water treatment owing to its impact on the water quality as the increase in suspended particulate matter concentration enhances the turbidity kambuyi et al 2021 these suspended particles can be diverse as these particles might be originated from minerals organic matter microbes ad humic substances etc kim and jang 2017 dayarathne et al 2021 coagulation methods for the treatment of water and wastewater are widely used processes for the removal of higher turbidites this includes the addition of destabilizing substances for aggregation of the dissolved substances into the flocs that can settle out as suspension or settleable solids alvarez bastida et al 2018 the colloids usually possess large surface areas with negative charges ogemdi 2019 though chemical coagulants are known for their high effectiveness their continuous usage with higher dosages has become a concern owing to their residues in treated water along with neurotoxic and carcinogenic properties causing diseases such as alzheimer s parkinson s and cancer bellouk et al 2022 karnena and saritha 2022 further sludge obtained in larger volumes and enhanced ph along with the high cost of imported coagulants are other challenges to be addressed ng et al 2022 muniz et al 2022 the coagulation method can remove several pollutants from surface water the reliability of the treatment leading to finish water quality depends on the success of the process mukhopadhyay et al 2022 further the efficiency of the process is governed by factors like the dose of coagulant temperature and ph of water othmani et al 2022 type of coagulant teh et al 2014 quality of water mixing speed and time a standard jar test experiment is conventionally performed to determine optimal conditions for precise parameters to understand the treatability of water sources at the bench scale coagulant dose and process efficiency are influenced by water s chemical characteristics including the existence and concentration of ions when the colloid concentration is high the probability of contact between destabilized particles increases leading to aggregation alazaiza et al 2022 a decrease in particle concentration reduces the chance of contact among destabilized particles requiring induced sweep flocculation action to remove particles effectively however for sweep flocculation the added coagulant dose should neutralize the charge and precipitate formation to start the movement of sweep floc benjamin and lawler 2013 this would require adding a high coagulant dose producing more significant amounts of waste solids when the optimal dose of coagulant was added it reduced membrane fouling in combined coagulation ultrafiltration lee et al 2009 dayarathne et al 2021 several researchers have studied the influence of mixing conditions on the coagulation process and efficiency alhweij et al 2022 almutairi et al 2022 the strong effect of rapid mix time was described by many researchers in the literature wang et al 2018 nieto et al 2011 immediate mixing intensity of 350 velocity gradient s 1 produced minimum residual turbidity and lower concentrations of small particles when the power was reduced to 25 s 1 growth in the floc was reduced obtaining smaller floc wang et al 2007 kan 2002 all these authors stated that rapid mixing time substantially influences coagulation when rapid mixing was carried out above optimum time an increase in residual turbidity was observed dependent on the nature and dosage of the coagulant yu et al 2011 even though these studies have reported optimal mixing conditions fundamental mechanisms have not been explained adequately mixing conditions associated with coagulation were also explored through breaking and re growth of floc coagulation of turbid water prepared by kaolin suspensions using hydrolyzing coagulant has restricted re growth of flocs representing noteworthy irreversibility in breaking floc yukselen and gregory 2004 karnena and saritha 2022 sludge dewatering is the most significant problem associated with sludge management jin et al 2020 it is conventionally determined by chemical composition and the physical configuration of flocs like volume strength and size fakhru l razi et al 2007 generally rapid mixing increases sludge formation the shape of precipitate from coagulant hydrolysis products destabilizes the contaminant and determines sludge production wang et al 2007 previous studies on coagulation experiments for optimizing the process parameters focussed on particular ph or single coagulant or constant mixing speed and temperatures were affecting the process parameters etc khettaf et al 2021 saritha et al 2017 huzir et al 2019 sakhi et al 2018 whilst the factors mentioned above have been the subject of many investigations in the past little attention has been paid to the optimization of the process parameters using or comparing the coagulants like conventional chemical based coagulant alum with an animal derived coagulant chitin and plant based coagulant sago at different ph i e 6 7 and 8 with different mixing speed thus proper optimization of physical factors governing coagulation flocculation must be studied to enhance treatment efficiency physical parameters like mixing speed and time and coagulant dose are supposed to be two essential criteria governing the efficiency of the process further the current setup has not been done in this area in line with the above background the present article aims to optimize coagulation s physical and operational parameters including coagulant dose and mixing speed with different phs for obtaining greater coagulation efficiencies 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic turbid solution 10 g of bentonite procured from sigma aldrich was dissolved in 1 litre deionized water to prepare the stock solution the stock solution was agitated for 24 h at 20 rpm using the jar test apparatus for uniform dispersion of colloidal particles in the suspension the prepared suspension solution was 100 ntu and used for the current study 2 2 coagulants preparation 2 2 1 alum aluminium sulfate commonly called alum is a crystalline white solid obtained as 18 hydrate al2 so4 3 18h2o an analytical grade of alum was procured from the sigma aldrich and utilized without further purification 2 2 2 chitin chitin is obtained from the merk chemicals and used for the experiment without further extractions 2 2 3 sago sago is the common name of manihot esculenta obtained from the local market and oven dried with a temperature of 45c for 48 h powdered using a domestic blender and sieved with a 75 Âµ sieve used for the current study 2 3 coagulation experiments 2 3 1 procedure of operating jar test apparatus the jar test apparatus was used to carry out the coagulation experiments cintex flocculator the investigation process includes rapid mixing at 100 rpm for 2 to 10 min followed by slow mixing at 20 30 rpm for about 20 30 min and then allowing it to settle for 30 min which is carried out in the batch process 2 3 2 sample preparation for an experimental run one litre of the sample under test was taken in 2 l for an exploratory run various coagulant doses were added and kept using jar test apparatus ph adjustments whenever compulsory were carried out using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solutions for obtaining desired ph values within 0 1 ph units 2 3 3 optimizing coagulant dose an individual coagulant chitin sago starch alum was introduced coagulant dosage optimization was carried out as follows the motive of the current study is to evaluate the possible lowest dose of coagulant that is effective for treating water hence the dosage of coagulant alum chitin sago starch was initially taken as 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 g l from the results obtained the optimum dosages were 2 g l for alum 3 g l for chitin and both two and 3 g l for sago hence the coagulant doses were selected for the next optimization level starting from 2 0 1 5 1 0 and 0 5 g l these experimental runs reported the optimum dose at 0 5 g l further the dose was reduced to 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 g l 2 3 4 optimizing mixing speed as discussed in the operating jar test apparatus two mixing speeds were evaluated 100 30 and 80 20 rpm all the experiments were performed at these two mixing speeds 2 3 5 analysis after coagulation after sedimentation the supernatant of coagulated samples was collected to measure the final turbidity the remaining were filtered using whatman no 40 filter paper turbidity was measured using hach turbidimeter model 2100 n 2 3 6 sludge analysis 2 3 6 1 settled sludge after performing the coagulation using the jar test apparatus the solutions were settled for half an hour under laboratory conditions to determine the sludge the supernatant was filtered and the settled sludge was strained out the filter paper having sludge was weighed and the difference was calculated for the analysis calculation s e t t l e s l u d g e w e i g h t weight o f f i l t e r p a p e r w i t h s l u d g e i n i t i a l w e i g h t o f f i l t e

used for the physicochemical analysis the solutions were filtered using the filter paper and the sludge was strained out the sludge present in the filter paper was oven dried at 105 0c for 8 h and later the weight of the sludge dried was taken calculation s l u d g e w e i g h t weight o f f i l t e r p a p e r w i t h o v e n d r i e d s l u d g e i n i t i a l w e i g h t volume o f s a m p l

samples to observe the pollutant adsorption was studied using jsm 7600 fei quanta 3 results 3 1 optimizing coagulant dose the prime motive of the study was to optimize the possible lowest dose of coagulant considering turbidity removal the concentration of suspended solids obtained and total solid residue table 1 presents turbidity removal obtained by reducing coagulant doses by three coagulants in the initial doses of 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 g l it was observed that all the coagulants showed an increase in turbidity reduction with an increase in coagulant dose the highest turbidity reduction was reported by sago at 99 45 at coagulant dose 4 g l whereas the least was reported by chitin at 87 at dose 1 g l considering this further the study progressed with reduced coagulant doses of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g l this set of experiments showed that natural coagulants were effective at a lower dose of 0 5 g l while alum showed increased turbidity reduction with increased coagulant dose the highest turbidity removal was obtained at 1 0 g l by alum 97 10 while the minor removal was observed at 1 0 g l by chitin 83 95 with these positive results the coagulant dose was further reduced to 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l alum and sago have shown increasing turbidity reduction with an increase in amount while chitin exhibited a decrease in turbidity reduction with increasing dose fig 1 turbidity removal by coagulants under test was observed to be in the direction of chitin alum sago table 2 presents the settled sludge obtained from the decreasing doses of coagulants with the increase in coagulant dose alum has shown a decrease in the settled sludge 4 61 g l to 3 5 g l while sago and chitin reported a rise in settled sludge 7 01 g l to 11 75 g l and 9 37 g l to 20 07 g l respectively with the surge in a dose of coagulant from 1 0 g l to 4 0 g l as the dose of coagulants was reduced from 2 0 g l to 0 5 g l all the coagulants have reported an increase in settled sludge with an increase in coagulant dose a noteworthy point here is that the settled sludge obtained by natural coagulants is less than the previous doses of 6 08 g l to 7 47 g l by sago and 6 48 g l 12 04 g l by chitin respectively a similar trend was observed when the coagulant doses were reduced from 01 g l to 0 4 g l with natural coagulants obtaining much less settled sludge than alum fig 2 table 3 illustrates the dry sludge obtained by the coagulants sludge dewatering is one of the critical parameters to consider to reduce the sludge volume and dispose of it appropriately the present study applies heat treatment to the wet sludge mass obtained in a hot air oven and constant dry sludge mass is determined alum has shown an increase in the dry sludge concentration with a decrease in dose from 1 g l to 0 1 g l in contrast the natural coagulants have shown a reverse trend of decreasing dry sludge concentration with decreasing coagulant dose this is considered to be a positive result concerning sludge management the highest dry sludge was obtained by sago treatment at 4 g l while the lowest was reported by alum at 1 g l fig 3 table 4 presents the relation between settled sludge and turbidity removal alum reported a decrease in settled sludge 4 61 to 3 5 g l with an increase in turbidity 87 32 to 95 09 with coagulant doses of 1 g l to 4 g l in comparison the natural coagulants reported increased turbidity reduction 99 04 to 99 45 by sago and 87 00 to 91 95 by chitin increasing the settled sludge 7 01 to 11 75 g l to 9 37 to 20 07 g l from doses 1 g l to 4 g l when the coagulant doses were reduced to 2 g l to 0 5 g l alum reported an increase in settled sludge 4 81 to 5 8 g l with turbidity reduction 95 53 to 97 10 sago and chitin have reported a rise in settled sludge 6 08 to 7 47 g l by sago and 6 48 to 12 04 g l by chitin but a turbidity reduction 95 34 to 92 78 by sago and 86 40 to 83 95 by chitin with much lesser coagulant doses i e 0 1 g l to 0 4 g l alum has shown variability in settled sludge but an increase in turbidity reduction with an increase in coagulant dose in contrast natural coagulants have decreased settled sludge with increased turbidity reduction fig 4 3 2 optimization of mixing speed the optimized coagulant dose of 0 1 g l to 0 4 g l mixing speed was optimized testing with two mixing speeds 100 rpm for 2 min to 30 rpm for 20 min and 80 rpm for 2 min to 20 rpm for 20 min table 5 presents turbidity reduction obtained at 100 30 rpm mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown the highest turbidity reduction at ph 7 with a coagulant dose of 0 1 g l while chitin was effective both at 6 and 8 ph with 100 turbidity reduction at doses of 1 and 2 g l sago has shown the best performance at ph 6 which dropped at ph 7 and 8 fig 5 table 6 presents turbidity reduction obtained at 80 20 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown the highest turbidity reduction at all ph ranges with a coagulant dose of 0 1 g l at the same time chitin was effective at all ph ranges and good turbidity removal was seen at doses of 1 and 2 g l sago has shown the best performance at ph 7 which dropped at ph 6 and 8 fig 6 table 7 compares turbidity removal obtained at two mixing rates 100 30 rpm and 80 20 rpm at a mixing speed of 100 30 the reduction in turbidity by sago at 6 ph ranged from 53 85 to 100 presenting a similar result at ph 7 alum presented good turbidity removal at ph 7 with both mixing speeds but at 8 ph a good result was obtained only at a mixing rate of 100 30 with all four tested doses a noteworthy result was revealed by chitin being stable with turbidity reduction 93 at 6 7 and 8 ph conditions with two tested mixing speeds with doses of 0 1 and 0 2 g l fig 7 table 8 presents settled sludge obtained at 100 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum produced the highest settled sludge at ph 7 3 30 g l with a coagulant dose of 0 4 g l while chitin produced the highest settled sludge at ph 6 3 33 g l with ph 6 among three coagulants sago had the greatest settled sludge at ph 8 with all doses fig 8 table 9 settled sludge obtained from the coagulants at a mixing speed of 80 20 with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown an increase in settled sludge with an increase in dose at all ph ranges highest settled sludge by alum was reported at ph 8 3 54 g l with a dose of 0 4 g l chitin produced less settled sludge at ph 6 and 8 with the highest reported at ph 7 3 26 g l with a 0 4 g l dose sago made the least settled sludge at ph 6 while ph 7 and 8 had more settled sludge more significant than the sludge by sago reported at ph 7 3 34 g l at dose 0 4 g l fig 9 table 10 compares settled sludge obtained at two mixing speeds 100 30 rpm and 80 20 rpm alum performed well at 100 30 mixing speed producing lesser settled sludge at ph 6 and 7 while at ph 8 with most minor doses of 1 and 2 g l settled sludge was very high compared to 80 20 rpm a similar trend was observed with chitin and sago stating that at ph 8 100 30 rpm produced more excellent settled sludge by all coagulants fig 10 table 11 presents dry sludge obtained at 100 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution by the three coagulants the dewatering capability of settled sludge at ph 8 is very high the weight of dry sludge obtained by all the coagulants at this ph is significantly less than 0 04 g by alum 0 1 g by chitin 0 62 g by sago all at 1 g l dose fig 11 table 12 presents dry sludge obtained at 80 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution by the three coagulants the dewatering capability of settled sludge at ph 6 and 8 is very high from the weight reduction after drying obtained by alum and chitin with ph 8 reporting the minor weights of 0 01 g by alum 0 2 g by chitin and 0 05 g by sago all at 1 g l dose fig 12 table 13 compares dry sludge obtained at two mixing speeds 100 30 and 80 20 rpm the results show that the mixing speed of 80 20 would get much lesser dry sludge fig 13 table 14 compares settled sludge with turbidity removal obtained at 100 30 rpm at ph 6 and 7 alum has increased settled sludge with increased turbidity removal and dose in contrast at ph 8 the trend was reversed with a decrease in settled sludge with increased turbidity removal and dose fig 14 table 15 compares settled sludge with turbidity removal obtained at 80 20 rpm alum was stable only at ph 7 showing an increase in settled sludge with a decrease in turbidity removal as the dose increased from 1g l to 2g l chitin exhibited stability with all coagulant doses showing an increase in settled sludge but a reduction in turbidity as the amount raised from 1 to 4g l sago also reported less efficiency at ph 8 while stable at ph 7 followed by ph 6 fig 15 table 16 illustrates anova for turbidity removal obtained at different mixing speeds p values of less than 0 05 were obtained with 100 30 mixing speed at 7 and 8 ph conditions 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of coagulant dose saritha et al 2017 stated that the coagulant dose is one of the factors to be considered in determining optimum conditions for efficient results of the coagulation process in addition gebreyohannes 2022 from his study showed that overdosing or insufficient dosing results in reduced performance in the process of flocculation thus choosing the optimum dose will reduce coagulant cost and quantity besides sludge production and effective treatment patel and vashi 2013 gasmi et al 2022 in general salts of aluminium and iron get hydrolyzed swiftly in water giving an assortment of products that include species of cations that are neutralized by particles charged negatively sun et al 2022 varsani et al 2022 stated that the underlying process of particle destabilization is due to this process that leads to flocculation further excessive coagulant doses can disturb this process requiring precise coagulant doses to be added our current study has obtained similar results where turbidity removal varied with process parameters like dose ph and initial water turbidity many researchers have reported turbidity removal directly proportional to an increasing coagulant dose dahasahastra et al 2022 mishra and bajpai 2005 chaudhuri and khairuldin 2009 they have also reported that after an inevitable increase in dose a decrease in turbidity removal was observed mishra et al 2004 mishra and bajpai 2005 chaudhuri and khairuldin 2009 the current results of the study can be correlated with these studies further more significant turbidity reductions were observed with a significantly less dose of coagulant that was not used earlier these results can be elucidated because the optimum coagulant dosage brings about a more significant amount of solids to aggregate and settle down however divakaran and sivasankara 2002 tadros 2017 revealed that an increase over the optimum dose might result in re dispersion of aggregated particles into suspension disturbing particle settling tadros 2017 4 2 influence of ph alum is sensitive to ph conditions observed in the present study alum performed well at ph seven which can be called its optimum ph the outcome agrees with other studies conducted at the same ph shak and wu 2017 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 stated that alum performs well at 6 7 ph conditions the efficiency of chitin from the study can be traced to the explanation it has natural more excellent resistance as it possesses crystallinity to a greater extent which offers pronounced improvement furthermore bio composites can eliminate contaminants like anions cations and organic compounds contrarily starch from sago can efficiently work as a coagulant as a natural polymer karnena et al 2022 sun et al 2019 stated that the importance of ph in coagulation is that it influences the surface charge of coagulants besides affecting suspension stabilization further li et al 2022 from their studies revealed that chitin solubility in a liquid medium is also governed by ph thus it becomes essential to investigate optimum ph conditions for the treatment in our current study turbidity removal and other physicochemical parameters were observed as upright at ph 7 outcomes from the present research align with investigations conducted by ebeling et al 2003 the efficiency of chitin is enhanced at lower ph conditions requiring less dose which is credited to the improved quantity of protonated amine groups at lower ph similar studies by saritha et al 2017 reported that particle destabilization is enhanced with increased charged groups leading to neutralization 4 3 optimization of mixing speed mixing speed is one of the governing factors in obtaining efficient results rapid and slow mixing is adopted each of which comes with its significance initially rapid mixing is done to spread the coagulant all through the medium then slow mixing will accumulate the flocs najid et al 2022 followed by this flocs are efficiently removed upon sufficient time for settlement wang et al 2007 mixing speed of 100 30 rpm was most favourable for turbidity reduction at all ph conditions considerable removal in turbidity was achieved when sago was used in the blend as sago pam even at lower doses than alum qudsieh and isam 2006 further a longer duration of rapid mixing might result in deleterious effects on the process of coagulation and flocculation bratby 2006 moud 2022 thus each run and application will have an optimum mixing period that relies on rapid mixing and coagulant concentration intensity similar results were reported by wei et al 2022 where the high power of rapid mixing increased residual turbidity 4 4 statistical analysis experimental results were statistically significant with p values of less than 0 05 obtained at 100 30 mixing speed at 7 and 8 ph conditions proving this optimum mixing speed hence in further studies this mixing speed was adopted table 16 4 5 ftir analysis all the samples were analyzed with the ftir instrument to identify the functionalized groups responsible for the adsorption near the ir region the coagulants used in the experiment are further sieved using the 75 sieves mixed with the kbr for palletization and used for analysis the adsorption peaks for alum were obtained at the 891 cm 1 representing hydroxyl groups 1101 cm 1 revealing the presence of the co an alkyl group and further stretch identified at 1650 cm 1 showing the presence of an amine in the chitin the functionalized groups responsible for the adsorption of the impurities were identified at 1374 cm 1 representing co 1703 showing co and 2921 cm 1 revealing the presence of the carboxylic functionalized groups further in sago amine and secondary amine groups responsible for the more significant adsorption were identified at 1657 cm 1 and 3388 cm 1 fig 16 the more considerable adsorption of the colloidal substances on the coagulants is due to the interactions with the carboxylic hydrogen and alkali groups karnena et al 2022 4 6 xrd patterns xrd identify the crystallinity or amorphous nature of the coagulant as the sago performed well in all the results we have selected it to determine its nature the sago showed sharp peaks at 14 9 16 8 17 1 and 21 9 representing the less crystalline nature of the compounds further it is understood that all the samples tested are highly amorphic which led to increased interactions between the coagulants and pollutants resulting in more significant adsorption and showing high efficiencies in the coagulation fig 17 similar studies conducted by naduparambath and purushothaman 2016 studied sago using the xrd and reported similar results and further stated that the amorphous nature of the compounds leads to the collides adsorption 4 7 sem analysis the sago sem image fig 18 showed the dense structures by removing the colloidal particles onto the surface which might be due to the presence of the functionalized groups the floc formation can be observed below in fig 18 by observation it can be concluded that the natural coagulants are competent enough to remove the pollutants from the water and wastewater 5 conclusions this study aimed to optimize the process parameters focusing on the coagulant dose and mixing speed with ph variations of 6 7 and 8 the results suggested an important interplay between the coagulant dosage mixing speeds with the sludge and floc formation during the coagulation process the coagulants dosages were optimized and reduced to the concentrations of added coagulants from 2 g to 0 4 g l initial doses from 1 to 4 g l showed an increase in turbidity reduction reduced doses from 0 5 to 2 g l showed a decrease in turbidity removal with increasing amounts the most negligible coagulant doses applied in the study were 0 1 to 0 4 g l wherein turbidity removal was proportional to the dose added highest turbidity reductions obtained at least doses are in the order of sago 99 42 with 0 4 g l alum 97 96 with 0 4 g l chitin 93 40 with 0 1 g l alum and chitin were stable at all tested ph conditions chitin proved more efficient than alum at ph 6 and 8 resulting in 100 with 0 1 g l of coagulant dose turbidity removal at the same time alum performed better at ph 7 with 0 1 g l of coagulant dose the sago performed better than other coagulants and removed the turbidity up to 99 42 in addition sludge was reduced to 90 with a dosage of 0 4 g l a minor dosage compared to the literature with an optimal ph of 7 the ftir analysis of the coagulants revealed that the functionalized groups responsible for the coagulation and xrd revealed that sago is amorphous which might be attributed to the greater adsorption of the pollutants onto the coagulant s surface sem analysis acted as vibrant proof for showing the adsorption phenomenon by coagulants before and after coagulation from the current study it can be concluded that a coagulant dose ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 g l with a mixing speed of 100 rpm for 2 min and 30 rpm for 30 min can be the best solution for obtaining greater coagulation efficiency and pollutant removal declaration of competing interest the authors

governed by factors like the dose of coagulant temperature and ph of water othmani et al 2022 type of coagulant teh et al 2014 quality of water mixing speed and time a standard jar test experiment is conventionally performed to determine optimal conditions for precise parameters to understand the treatability of water sources at the bench scale coagulant dose and process efficiency are influenced by water s chemical characteristics including the existence and concentration of ions when the colloid concentration is high the probability of contact between destabilized particles increases leading to aggregation alazaiza et al 2022 a decrease in particle concentration reduces the chance of contact among destabilized particles requiring induced sweep flocculation action to remove particles effectively however for sweep flocculation the added coagulant dose should neutralize the charge and precipitate formation to start the movement of sweep floc benjamin and lawler 2013 this would require adding a high coagulant dose producing more significant amounts of waste solids when the optimal dose of coagulant was added it reduced membrane fouling in combined coagulation ultrafiltration lee et al 2009 dayarathne et al 2021 several researchers have studied the influence of mixing conditions on the coagulation process and efficiency alhweij et al 2022 almutairi et al 2022 the strong effect of rapid mix time was described by many researchers in the literature wang et al 2018 nieto et al 2011 immediate mixing intensity of 350 velocity gradient s 1 produced minimum residual turbidity and lower concentrations of small particles when the power was reduced to 25 s 1 growth in the floc was reduced obtaining smaller floc wang et al 2007 kan 2002 all these authors stated that rapid mixing time substantially influences coagulation when rapid mixing was carried out above optimum time an increase in residual turbidity was observed dependent on the nature and dosage of the coagulant yu et al 2011 even though these studies have reported optimal mixing conditions fundamental mechanisms have not been explained adequately mixing conditions associated with coagulation were also explored through breaking and re growth of floc coagulation of turbid water prepared by kaolin suspensions using hydrolyzing coagulant has restricted re growth of flocs representing noteworthy irreversibility in breaking floc yukselen and gregory 2004 karnena and saritha 2022 sludge dewatering is the most significant problem associated with sludge management jin et al 2020 it is conventionally determined by chemical composition and the physical configuration of flocs like volume strength and size fakhru l razi et al 2007 generally rapid mixing increases sludge formation the shape of precipitate from coagulant hydrolysis products destabilizes the contaminant and determines sludge production wang et al 2007 previous studies on coagulation experiments for optimizing the process parameters focussed on particular ph or single coagulant or constant mixing speed and temperatures were affecting the process parameters etc khettaf et al 2021 saritha et al 2017 huzir et al 2019 sakhi et al 2018 whilst the factors mentioned above have been the subject of many investigations in the past little attention has been paid to the optimization of the process parameters using or comparing the coagulants like conventional chemical based coagulant alum with an animal derived coagulant chitin and plant based coagulant sago at different ph i e 6 7 and 8 with different mixing speed thus proper optimization of physical factors governing coagulation flocculation must be studied to enhance treatment efficiency physical parameters like mixing speed and time and coagulant dose are supposed to be two essential criteria governing the efficiency of the process further the current setup has not been done in this area in line with the above background the present article aims to optimize coagulation s physical and operational parameters including coagulant dose and mixing speed with different phs for obtaining greater coagulation efficiencies 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic turbid solution 10 g of bentonite procured from sigma aldrich was dissolved in 1 litre deionized water to prepare the stock solution the stock solution was agitated for 24 h at 20 rpm using the jar test apparatus for uniform dispersion of colloidal particles in the suspension the prepared suspension solution was 100 ntu and used for the current study 2 2 coagulants

experiments 2 3 1 procedure of operating jar test apparatus the jar test apparatus was used to carry out the coagulation experiments cintex flocculator the investigation process includes rapid mixing at 100 rpm for 2 to 10 min followed by slow mixing at 20 30 rpm for about 20 30 min and then allowing it to settle for 30 min which is carried out in the batch process 2 3 2 sample preparation for an experimental run one litre of the sample under test was taken in 2 l for an exploratory run various coagulant doses were added and kept using jar test apparatus ph adjustments whenever compulsory were carried out using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solutions for obtaining desired ph values within 0 1 ph units 2 3 3 optimizing coagulant dose an individual coagulant chitin sago starch alum was introduced coagulant dosage optimization was carried out as follows the motive of the current study is to evaluate the possible lowest dose of coagulant that is effective for treating water hence the dosage of coagulant alum chitin sago starch was initially taken as 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 g l from the results obtained the optimum dosages were 2 g l for alum 3 g l for chitin and both two and 3 g l for sago hence the coagulant doses were selected for the next optimization level starting from 2 0 1 5 1 0 and 0 5 g l these experimental runs reported the optimum dose at 0 5 g l further the dose was reduced to 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 g l 2 3 4 optimizing mixing speed as discussed in the operating jar test apparatus two mixing speeds were evaluated 100 30 and 80 20 rpm all the experiments were performed at these two mixing speeds 2 3 5 analysis after coagulation after sedimentation the supernatant of coagulated samples was collected to measure the final turbidity the remaining were filtered using whatman no 40 filter paper turbidity was measured using hach turbidimeter model 2100 n 2 3 6 sludge analysis 2 3 6 1 settled sludge after performing the coagulation using the jar test apparatus the

samples to observe the pollutant adsorption was studied using jsm 7600 fei quanta 3 results 3 1 optimizing coagulant dose the prime motive of the study was to optimize the possible lowest dose of coagulant considering turbidity removal the concentration of suspended solids obtained and total solid residue table 1 presents turbidity removal obtained by reducing coagulant doses by three coagulants in the initial doses of 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 g l it was observed that all the coagulants showed an increase in turbidity reduction with an increase in coagulant dose the highest turbidity reduction was reported by sago at 99 45 at coagulant dose 4 g l whereas the least was reported by chitin at 87 at dose 1 g l considering this further the study progressed with reduced coagulant doses of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g l this set of experiments showed that natural coagulants were effective at a lower dose of 0 5 g l while alum showed increased turbidity reduction with increased coagulant dose the highest turbidity removal was obtained at 1 0 g l by alum 97 10 while the minor removal was observed at 1 0 g l by chitin 83 95 with these positive results the coagulant dose was further reduced to 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l alum and sago have shown increasing turbidity reduction with an increase in amount while chitin exhibited a decrease in turbidity reduction with increasing dose fig 1 turbidity removal by coagulants under test was observed to be in the direction of chitin alum sago table 2 presents the settled sludge obtained from the decreasing doses of coagulants with the increase in coagulant dose alum has shown a decrease in the settled sludge 4 61 g l to 3 5 g l while sago and chitin reported a rise in settled sludge 7 01 g l to 11 75 g l and 9 37 g l to 20 07 g l respectively with the surge in a dose of coagulant from 1 0 g l to 4 0 g l as the dose of coagulants was reduced from 2 0 g l to 0 5 g l all the coagulants have reported an increase in settled sludge with an increase in coagulant dose a noteworthy point here is that the settled sludge obtained by natural coagulants is less than the previous doses of 6 08 g l to 7 47 g l by sago and 6 48 g l 12 04 g l by chitin respectively a similar trend was observed when the coagulant doses were reduced from 01 g l to 0 4 g l with natural coagulants obtaining much less settled sludge than alum fig 2 table 3 illustrates the dry sludge obtained by the coagulants sludge dewatering is one of the critical parameters to consider to reduce the sludge volume and dispose of it appropriately the present study applies heat treatment to the wet sludge mass obtained in a hot air oven and constant dry sludge mass is determined alum has shown an increase in the dry sludge concentration with a decrease in dose from 1 g l to 0 1 g l in contrast the natural coagulants have shown a reverse trend of decreasing dry sludge concentration with decreasing coagulant dose this is considered to be a positive result concerning sludge management the highest dry sludge was obtained by sago treatment at 4 g l while the lowest was reported by alum at 1 g l fig 3 table 4 presents the relation between settled sludge and turbidity removal alum reported a decrease in settled sludge 4 61 to 3 5 g l with an increase in turbidity 87 32 to 95 09 with coagulant doses of 1 g l to 4 g l in comparison the natural coagulants reported increased turbidity reduction 99 04 to 99 45 by sago and 87 00 to 91 95 by chitin increasing the settled sludge 7 01 to 11 75 g l to 9 37 to 20 07 g l from doses 1 g l to 4 g l when the coagulant doses were reduced to 2 g l to 0 5 g l alum reported an increase in settled sludge 4 81 to 5 8 g l with turbidity reduction 95 53 to 97 10 sago and chitin have reported a rise in settled sludge 6 08 to 7 47 g l by sago and 6 48 to 12 04 g l by chitin but a turbidity reduction 95 34 to 92 78 by sago and 86 40 to 83 95 by chitin with much lesser coagulant doses i e 0 1 g l to 0 4 g l alum has shown variability in settled sludge but an increase in turbidity reduction with an increase in coagulant dose in contrast natural coagulants have decreased settled sludge with increased turbidity reduction fig 4 3 2 optimization of mixing speed the optimized coagulant dose of 0 1 g l to 0 4 g l mixing speed was optimized testing with two mixing speeds 100 rpm for 2 min to 30 rpm for 20 min and 80 rpm for 2 min to 20 rpm for 20 min table 5 presents turbidity reduction obtained at 100 30 rpm mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown the highest turbidity reduction at ph 7 with a coagulant dose of 0 1 g l while chitin was effective both at 6 and 8 ph with 100 turbidity reduction at doses of 1 and 2 g l sago has shown the best performance at ph 6 which dropped at ph 7 and 8 fig 5 table 6 presents turbidity reduction obtained at 80 20 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown the highest turbidity reduction at all ph ranges with a coagulant dose of 0 1 g l at the same time chitin was effective at all ph ranges and good turbidity removal was seen at doses of 1 and 2 g l sago has shown the best performance at ph 7 which dropped at ph 6 and 8 fig 6 table 7 compares turbidity removal obtained at two mixing rates 100 30 rpm and 80 20 rpm at a mixing speed of 100 30 the reduction in turbidity by sago at 6 ph ranged from 53 85 to 100 presenting a similar result at ph 7 alum presented good turbidity removal at ph 7 with both mixing speeds but at 8 ph a good result was obtained only at a mixing rate of 100 30 with all four tested doses a noteworthy result was revealed by chitin being stable with turbidity reduction 93 at 6 7 and 8 ph conditions with two tested mixing speeds with doses of 0 1 and 0 2 g l fig 7 table 8 presents settled sludge obtained at 100 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum produced the highest settled sludge at ph 7 3 30 g l with a coagulant dose of 0 4 g l while chitin produced the highest settled sludge at ph 6 3 33 g l with ph 6 among three coagulants sago had the greatest settled sludge at ph 8 with all doses fig 8 table 9 settled sludge obtained from the coagulants at a mixing speed of 80 20 with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution alum has shown an increase in settled sludge with an increase in dose at all ph ranges highest settled sludge by alum was reported at ph 8 3 54 g l with a dose of 0 4 g l chitin produced less settled sludge at ph 6 and 8 with the highest reported at ph 7 3 26 g l with a 0 4 g l dose sago made the least settled sludge at ph 6 while ph 7 and 8 had more settled sludge more significant than the sludge by sago reported at ph 7 3 34 g l at dose 0 4 g l fig 9 table 10 compares settled sludge obtained at two mixing speeds 100 30 rpm and 80 20 rpm alum performed well at 100 30 mixing speed producing lesser settled sludge at ph 6 and 7 while at ph 8 with most minor doses of 1 and 2 g l settled sludge was very high compared to 80 20 rpm a similar trend was observed with chitin and sago stating that at ph 8 100 30 rpm produced more excellent settled sludge by all coagulants fig 10 table 11 presents dry sludge obtained at 100 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution by the three coagulants the dewatering capability of settled sludge at ph 8 is very high the weight of dry sludge obtained by all the coagulants at this ph is significantly less than 0 04 g by alum 0 1 g by chitin 0 62 g by sago all at 1 g l dose fig 11 table 12 presents dry sludge obtained at 80 30 mixing speed with three different initial ph of the synthetic turbid solution by the three coagulants the dewatering capability of settled sludge at ph 6 and 8 is very high from the weight reduction after drying obtained by alum and chitin with ph 8 reporting the minor weights of 0 01 g by alum 0 2 g by chitin and 0 05 g by sago all at 1 g l dose fig 12 table 13 compares dry sludge obtained at two mixing speeds 100 30 and 80 20 rpm the results show that the mixing speed of 80 20 would get much lesser dry sludge fig 13 table 14 compares settled sludge with turbidity removal obtained at 100 30 rpm at ph 6 and 7 alum has increased settled sludge with increased turbidity removal and dose in contrast at ph 8 the trend was reversed with a decrease in settled sludge with increased turbidity removal and dose fig 14 table 15 compares settled sludge with turbidity removal obtained at 80 20 rpm alum was stable only at ph 7 showing an increase in settled sludge with a decrease in turbidity removal as the dose increased from 1g l to 2g l chitin exhibited stability with all coagulant doses showing an increase in settled sludge but a reduction in turbidity as the amount raised from 1 to 4g l sago also reported less efficiency at ph 8 while stable at ph 7 followed by ph 6 fig 15 table 16 illustrates anova for turbidity removal obtained at different mixing speeds p values of less than 0 05 were obtained with 100 30 mixing speed at 7 and 8 ph conditions 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of coagulant dose saritha et al 2017 stated that the coagulant dose is one of the factors to be considered in determining optimum conditions for efficient results of the coagulation process in addition gebreyohannes 2022 from his study showed that overdosing or insufficient dosing results in reduced performance in the process of flocculation thus choosing the optimum dose will reduce coagulant cost and quantity besides sludge production and effective treatment patel and vashi 2013 gasmi et al 2022 in general salts of aluminium and iron get hydrolyzed swiftly in water giving an assortment of products that include species of cations that are neutralized by particles charged negatively sun et al 2022 varsani et al 2022 stated that the underlying process of particle destabilization is due to this process that leads to flocculation further excessive coagulant doses can disturb this process requiring precise coagulant doses to be added our current study has obtained similar results where turbidity removal varied with process parameters like dose ph and initial water turbidity many researchers have reported turbidity removal directly proportional to an increasing coagulant dose dahasahastra et al 2022 mishra and bajpai 2005 chaudhuri and khairuldin 2009 they have also reported that after an inevitable increase in dose a decrease in turbidity removal was observed mishra et al 2004 mishra and bajpai 2005 chaudhuri and khairuldin 2009 the current results of the study can be correlated with these studies further more significant turbidity reductions were observed with a significantly less dose of coagulant that was not used earlier these results can be elucidated because the optimum coagulant dosage brings about a more significant amount of solids to aggregate and settle down however divakaran and sivasankara 2002 tadros 2017 revealed that an increase over the optimum dose might result in re dispersion of aggregated particles into suspension disturbing particle settling tadros 2017 4 2 influence of ph alum is sensitive to ph conditions observed in the present study alum performed well at ph seven which can be called its optimum ph the outcome agrees with other studies conducted at the same ph shak and wu 2017 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 stated that alum performs well at 6 7 ph conditions the efficiency of chitin from the study can be traced to the explanation it has natural more excellent resistance as it possesses crystallinity to a greater extent which offers pronounced improvement furthermore bio composites can eliminate contaminants like anions cations and organic compounds contrarily starch from sago can efficiently work as a coagulant as a natural polymer karnena et al 2022 sun et al 2019 stated that the importance of ph in coagulation is that it influences the surface charge of coagulants besides affecting suspension stabilization further li et al 2022 from their studies revealed that chitin solubility in a liquid medium is also governed by ph thus it becomes essential to investigate optimum ph conditions for the treatment in our current study turbidity removal and other physicochemical parameters were observed as upright at ph 7 outcomes from the present research align with investigations conducted by ebeling et al 2003 the efficiency of chitin is enhanced at lower ph conditions requiring less dose which is credited to the improved quantity of protonated amine groups at lower ph similar studies by saritha et al 2017 reported that particle destabilization is enhanced with increased charged groups leading to neutralization 4 3 optimization of mixing speed mixing speed is one of the governing factors in obtaining efficient results rapid and slow mixing is adopted each of which comes with its significance initially rapid mixing is done to spread the coagulant all through the medium then slow mixing will accumulate the flocs najid et al 2022 followed by this flocs are efficiently removed upon sufficient time for settlement wang et al 2007 mixing speed of 100 30 rpm was most favourable for turbidity reduction at all ph conditions considerable removal in turbidity was achieved when sago was used in the blend as sago pam even at lower doses than alum qudsieh and isam 2006 further a longer duration of rapid mixing might result in deleterious effects on the process of coagulation and flocculation bratby 2006 moud 2022 thus each run and application will have an optimum mixing period that relies on rapid mixing and coagulant concentration intensity similar results were reported by wei et al 2022 where the high power of rapid mixing increased residual turbidity 4 4 statistical analysis experimental results were statistically significant with p values of less than 0 05 obtained at 100 30 mixing speed at 7 and 8 ph conditions proving this optimum mixing speed hence in further studies this mixing speed was adopted table 16 4 5 ftir analysis all the samples were analyzed with the ftir instrument to identify the functionalized groups responsible for the adsorption near the ir region the coagulants used in the experiment are further sieved using the 75 sieves mixed with the kbr for palletization and used for analysis the adsorption peaks for alum were obtained at the 891 cm 1 representing hydroxyl groups 1101 cm 1 revealing the presence of the co an alkyl group and further stretch identified at 1650 cm 1 showing the presence of an amine in the chitin the functionalized groups responsible for the adsorption of the impurities were identified at 1374 cm 1 representing co 1703 showing co and 2921 cm 1 revealing the presence of the carboxylic functionalized groups further in sago amine and secondary amine groups responsible for the more significant adsorption were identified at 1657 cm 1 and 3388 cm 1 fig 16 the more considerable adsorption of the colloidal substances on the coagulants is due to the interactions with the carboxylic hydrogen and alkali groups karnena et al 2022 4 6 xrd patterns xrd identify the crystallinity or amorphous nature of the coagulant as the sago performed well in all the results we have selected it to determine its nature the sago showed sharp peaks at 14 9 16 8 17 1 and 21 9 representing the less crystalline nature of the compounds further it is understood that all the samples tested are highly amorphic which led to increased interactions between the coagulants and pollutants resulting in more significant adsorption and showing high efficiencies in the coagulation fig 17 similar studies conducted by naduparambath and purushothaman 2016 studied sago using the xrd and reported similar results and further stated that the amorphous nature of the compounds leads to the collides adsorption 4 7 sem analysis the sago sem image fig 18 showed the dense structures by removing the colloidal particles onto the surface which might be due to the presence of the functionalized groups the floc formation can be observed below in fig 18 by observation it can be concluded that the natural coagulants are competent enough to remove the pollutants from the water and wastewater 5 conclusions this study aimed to optimize the process parameters focusing on the coagulant dose and mixing speed with ph variations of 6 7 and 8 the results suggested an important interplay between the coagulant dosage mixing speeds with the sludge and floc formation during the coagulation process the coagulants dosages were optimized and reduced to the concentrations of added coagulants from 2 g to 0 4 g l initial doses from 1 to 4 g l showed an increase in turbidity reduction reduced doses from 0 5 to 2 g l showed a decrease in turbidity removal with increasing amounts the most negligible coagulant doses applied in the study were 0 1 to 0 4 g l wherein turbidity removal was proportional to the dose added highest turbidity reductions obtained at least doses are in the order of sago 99 42 with 0 4 g l alum 97 96 with 0 4 g l chitin 93 40 with 0 1 g l alum and chitin were stable at all tested ph conditions chitin proved more efficient than alum at ph 6 and 8 resulting in 100 with 0 1 g l of coagulant dose turbidity removal at the same time alum performed better at ph 7 with 0 1 g l of coagulant dose the sago performed better than other coagulants and removed the turbidity up to 99 42 in addition sludge was reduced to 90 with a dosage of 0 4 g l a minor dosage compared to the literature with an optimal ph of 7 the ftir analysis of the coagulants revealed that the functionalized groups responsible for the coagulation and xrd revealed that sago is amorphous which might be attributed to the greater adsorption of the pollutants onto the coagulant s surface sem analysis acted as vibrant proof for showing the adsorption phenomenon by coagulants before and after coagulation from the current study it can be concluded that a coagulant dose ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 g l with a mixing speed of 100 rpm for 2 min and 30 rpm for 30 min can be the best solution for obtaining greater coagulation efficiency and pollutant removal declaration of competing interest the authors

c 1 c with a 12 12 hrs light dark photoperiod in static conditions either to 0 01 2 5 9 6 and 0 48 g a i l which equaled the 1 10 of the application rates of copper sulfate temephos glyphosate and bifenthrin respectively data were collected from the agriculture pesticide committee 2020 as well as the control group dechlorinated tap water was used to prepare the tested concentrations and control tests feeding was done daily ad libitum during the test three replicates for each pesticide and each tank contained an equal volume of the tested solution 2 l and equal numbers of toads 3 for each n 9 the tested solutions were changed every 24 hrs during the 96 hrs of the tested periods the dead toads were removed and the incidences of mortality were recorded toads were assumed dead when they turned upside down and sank to the bottom of the tank or when they showed no form of movement even when prodded with a glass rod harri et al 1979 biochemical studies at the end of the experimental period blood samples were withdrawn from the toads by cardiac puncture in tubes centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm using janetzki t30 centrifuge germany and then serum was withdrawn for determination of biochemical parameters toads were dissected and brain and liver were quickly removed washed with ice cold saline solution 0 9 cleaned from the connective adipose tissues and then kept frozen at 20 c until subsequent biochemical analysis liver or brain was homogenized in ten volumes w v of cold physiological saline solution using polytron homogenizer centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm and 5 c c using janetzki cooling centrifuge type k23 germany and then the supernatant was separated for biochemical studies the activities of all selected enzymes representing the toxicity of the tested compounds were determined spectrophotometrically at appropriate wavelengths the specific activity of ache in brain tissue was assayed by the method of ellman et al 1961 using acetylthiocholine iodide as a substrate and the activity was expressed as Âµmole min mg protein glutathione s transferase gst activity was measured according to the method of vessey and boyer 1984 using 4 chloro 1 3 dinitrobenzene cdnb as a substrate the enzyme activity was expressed as Âµmole conjugated cdnb min mg protein the level of glutathione reduced gsh was measured according to sedlack and lindasy 1968 using metaphosphoric acid for protein precipitation and 5 5 dithio bis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dtnb for color development and the level of gsh was expressed as Âµmol mg protein lactate dehydrogenase ldh activity was determined according to the method of kaplan et al 1984 using spinreact kits spain and the activity was expressed as Î´od min mg protein activities of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt were determined according to the method of reitman and frankel 1957 using spinreact kits spain and expressed as Î´od min mg protein the activities of acid acp and alkaline

min mg protein protein concentration of tissue samples and serum was deremined by the method of lowery et al 1951 using bovine serum albumin as a standard genotoxic studies toads were randomly divided into 6 groups 9 toads per each and exposed as previously described to 1 10 of the application rates of either copper sulfate temephos glyphosate or bifenthrin dechlorinated tap negative control and 2 mg l of cyclophosphamide positive control for 96 hrs twenty four hours after the last treatment blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture for the determination of micronucleus mn according to the method of yin et al 2009 blood smears were prepared on clean grease free slides fixed in methanol for 10 min left to air dry at room temperature and then stained with 6 giemsa in sorenson buffer ph 6 9 for 20 min red blood cells rbcs were examined for each specimen under x1000 magnification using a fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse e 400 new york the number of polychromatic erythrocytes pce and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes mnpce among 1000 per frog were determined to evaluate any frequency of abnormalities and induction of mn respectively criteria used for identification of mn were no connection with the main nucleus share the same color and intensity as the main nucleus and area smaller than one third of the main nucleus fig 1 a total of 1000 pce from each toad were analyzed to record mnpce frequencies and pce normochromatic erythrocytes nce the mn frequency was calculated as follows statistical analysis statistical tests of all the obtained data were performed using costat version 6 40 software one way analysis of variance anova and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison tests were used to compare between treatments at level of 0 05 p 0 05 results and discussions effect of the tested pesticides on egyptian toads the primary objective of this study was to assess the toxic effects of 1 10 of the application rates of copper sulfate temephos glyphosate and bifenthrin on the egyptian toads exposed for 96 hrs as well as to evaluate their effects on some biochemical and genetic parameters the data showed that bifenthrin was the most toxic pesticide for the toads where all toads were found dead 48 hrs after exposure however no mortality was observed either in the control group or other treated groups table 1 declines in the amphibian populations due to exposure to different pesticides belonging to different chemical groups were recoreded relyea 2005 ezemonye and ilechie 2007 bernal et al 2009 ezemonye and tongo 2009 liu et al 2011 ismail et al 2014 lau et al 2015 junges et al 2017 the present results are parallel with the finding of dinehart et al 2008 who found that glyphosate based herbicide formulations did not pose an immediate risk to certain species of amphibians housed on soil or moist paper towels also temephos had no effect on the bull frog u s public health service 1995 whereas copper sulfate showed moderate toxicity to fish and aquatic animals tomlin 2002 and bifenthrin was very harmful to the aquatic life such as fish and other aquatic animals even in small concentrations technical fact sheet 2017 certain signs of toxicity such as initial hyperactivity symptoms followed by loss of balance motionlessness and finally death were observed as a sign of acute toxicity after treatment with pesticides sayim and kaya 2006 organophosphates ops carbamates pyrethroids and herbicides cause weakness lethargy for amphibians venturino et al 2003 in the present study external examinations of toads didn t reveal any abnormality in control and appeared active and healthy throughout the tested periods while toads treated either with temephos or bifenthrin showed hyperactivity and relaxed legs as straight shape with a lesion in the dead toads treated by bifenthrin the changes in the animal s behaviour after exposure to toxicants may be related to the consequent alteration in the physiological processs wolmarans et al 2022 in the present study he high mortality recorded in toads treated with bifenthrin could be explained by the bioconcentration of this pesticide in the tissues where a clear significant positive correlation between the accumulated residues of pesticides and mortality of toads was found ezemonye and tongo 2010 acetylcholinesterase ache is a serine protease found at the cholinergic synapses in the nerve system of all animals to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine hatami et al 2019 the effect of the tested pesticides on brain ache activity in toads is shown in table 1 a significant p 0 05 decrease in brain ache of toads treated with 1 10 of the application rates of temephos after 96 hrs with activity equaled to 76 of control while copper sulfate inhibited brain ache activity to less extent 4 of control the disruption in the biosynthesis or inhibition of ache in the egyptian toads exposed to these pesticides can lead to the accumulation of the acetylcholine ach in the nervous system so overstimulation of cholinergic synapses in the parasympathetic system neuromuscular attachment and central nervous system can disrupt the vital activities several studies have shown that when amphibians are exposed to compounds that decrease ache activity the reproduction forage and swimming will be altered attademo et al 2014 attademo et al 2015 these ecological consequences alter the long term survival of amphibians causing declines in amphibian populations davidson et al 2002 ache activity has shown to be strongly inhibited by ops and carbamates in vertebrate species sparling and fellers 2009 kumari and sinha 2015 samarakoon and pathiratne 2017 this may explaining the higher significant inhibition of brain ache of toads recorded in the present study after temephos exposure liu et al 2011 where temephos acts by inactivating ache via phosphorylation causing both the accumulation of ach in the synapse and subsequent overstimulation of cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system causing disorders in animals berrill et al 1994 saglio et al 1998 the pesticides have been found to concentrate in the tissue of frogs with depressed cholinesterase activity sparling et al 2001 and have induced hyperactivity in frogs followed by paralysis berrill et al 1998 therefore ache is considered as a specific molecular target for ops and recognized as a biological marker for pesticide poisoning lionetto et al 2013 additionally the interruption of the normal function of the nervous system can affect muscle function reducing the locomotor performance de arcaute et al 2012 this is matching with the results of sparling and fellers 2009 who found that chlorpyrifos declined the ache activity in metamorphose larval of pacific tree frogs pseudacris regilla and foothill yellow legged frogs rana boylii also the ache activity was inhibited in tadpoles of duttaphrynus melanostictus exposed to carbosulfan samarakoon and pathiratne 2017 rana tigrina and bufo melanostictus treated with carbaryl and methyl parathion kumari and sinha 2015 however in the present study bifenthrin and glyphosate induced the activities of brain ache to 118 and 121 of control respectively table 1 although glyphosate is an organophosphorus herbicide it lacks specific chemical groups such as sulfur halide or thiocyanate group that contribute to ache inhibition the effect of glyphosate on the nervous system of animals is attributed to glycine presents in its chemical structure which is also found in the structure of many proteins and enzymes banaeea et al 2019 and may interfere with the synthesis of glycogen synthase kinase by inhibiting ach gene expression besides glycine may affect the level of ache by reducing the synthesis of hormone sensitive lipids mesnage et al 2015 samsel and seneff 2016 although some aquatic species show no signs of toxicity when exposed to ops under laboratory conditions despite almost complete inhibition of ache the behavioral responses such as feeding and predator avoidance ferrari et al 2009 motor activity robles mendoza et al 2011 ruiz de arcaute et al 2012 and diverse toxicological effects ural 2013 may be impaired and consequently challenge the survival in the field situations ferrari et al 2009 this implies that these species will be at risk when exposed to such ops bifenthrin is a type i pyrethroids that affect the central and peripheral nervous system by interfering with sodium channel gating and tend to the channel to open for short times compared to type ii pyrethroids bradberry et al 2005 affecting the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates miller and salgado 1985 and cellular atp ase production johnson et al 2010 however bifenthrin cannot inhibit ache as ops and carbamates irac 2017 even in small concentrations fish and other aquatic animals are affected adversely by bifenthrin so it should not be applied near water sources clark and matsumura 1982 data in table 2 illustrate the effect of the tested pesticides on different biochemical markers in livers of toads it was found that liver gst decreased up to 24 and 16 in bifenthrin and copper sulfate exposed toads respectively while glyphosate significantly induced the activity of the enzyme by 26 of control temephos non significantly reduced the gst activity in livers of toads compared to untreated toads gst is a very important enzyme to the organism because of its role in cellular detoxification of various xenobiotics as a scavenger for lipophilic xenobiotics or endogenous formed waste products and as a defense mechanism to face the oxidative stress cruz santiago et al 2021 this enzyme protects cells against toxicants neutralizing them and rendering the product more water soluble lamoureus and rueness 1987 gst acts rapidly by metabolizing the insecticide to nontoxic products or by rapidly binding and very slowly turning over the insecticide kostaropoulos et al 2001 che mendozaet al 2009 in the present study the increase and decrease in gst activity in the liver were observed this antioxidant enzyme is conditioned by the transcriptional activity of the gst genes which could be either up or down regulated depending on various factors such as the chemical structure of the xenobiotic the concentration of the xenobiotic and time of exposure martÃ­nez guitarte 2018 these alterations in gst activity reveal the oxidative damage and the responses and mechanisms through which organisms protect themselves against the toxicity of pollutants clasen et al 2018 the increase in the activity of gst has been used as a marker of exposure to pesticides machala et al 1998 and these pesticides are expected to induce the activity of gst as a protection mechanism timur et al 2002 lajmanovich et al 2019 therefore gst could be used as an indicator of either exposure of toads to pesticides in the agroecosystems venturino et al 2003 cabagna et al 2005 or alteration of the phase ii of the biotransformation by the antioxidant defense system peltzer et al 2019 however the inhibition of gst found in the present study either by bifenthrin or copper sulfate is coincided with the study done by lajmanovich et al 2011 who recorded an inhibition of liver gst activity in frogs collected from agricultural fields of the humid pampas and contaminated with pesticides in argentina also the cytosolic gst in tadpole xenopus laevis was inhibited by exposure to Î» cyhalothrin and deltamethrin under static conditions aydin sinan et al 2012 this inhibition is thought to be caused by failure of the detoxification process and the development of oxidative stress cattaneo et al 2012 regarding the levels of gsh all treatments induced gsh levels in livers of treated toads and bifenthrin was found to be the most potent followed by copper sulfate temephos and then glyphosate with values of 146 143 137 and 110 of control respectively table 2 the alterations in the cellular antioxidant defense have been associated with pesticides exposures hai et al 1997 osman et al 2021 gsh acts as an essential cofactor for enzymes hayes et al 2005 and under oxidative stress it is consumed by the glutathione related enzymes through a pathway involving gst activity to detoxify peroxides produced due to increased lipid peroxidation cathcart 1985 the higher levels of gsh obtained in the present study after exposure to bifenthrin may indicate that pyrethroids induce oxidative stress which is probably an initial adaptive response to increase oxidative stress in pyrethroid intoxicated rats kaviraj et al 2014 in tadpoles gsh pool gst and metallothioneins respond in different ways to pesticides venturino et al 2003 and cause oxidative stress by elevating the levels of h2o2 and gsh david et al 2012 therefore gsh levels are considered as relevant biomarkers in aquatic toxicology doyotte et al 1997 lactate dehydrogenase ldh is an oxidoreductase enzyme that plays a role in cellular glycolysis where it converts pyruvate to lactate in the presence of nadh the present data illustrate that all the tested pesticides caused a significant p 0 01 increase in the activity of ldh in liver and bifenthrin was found to be the most potent followed by glyphosate copper sulfate and then temephos where the recorded percentages of activity were 283 248 248 and 235 respectively table 2 regarding serum ldh bifenthrin was also found to be the most potent to induce the activity 3 03 fold the control followed by copper sulfate 2 46 fold glyphosate 1 95 fold and then temephos 1 80 fold the increased ldh activity in the toads exposed to these pesticides may be due to cellular hypoxia and damage to hepatopancreatic cells the present investigation is in parallel with that reported by kumari and sinha 2010 who found that ldh activity increased when toads bufo melanostictus treated with methyl parathion indicating that the energy demands are met by anaerobic respiration and related with the increase of ldh activity the changes in the ldh activity in all toads treated by the tested pesticides may be due to severe cellular damage leading to an increase in the release of ldh that impaired carbohydrate and protein metabolism sivakumari et al 1997 ldh is considered as one of the most important enzymes involved in the anaerobic metabolism of carbohydrates under stress conditions and the increase in ldh activity is considered as a physiological mechanism for energy supply to cope with the toxic effects of pesticides such as glyphosate banaeea et al 2019 therefore ldh can be used as an indicator for cellular damage clinical practice cytotoxicity and common injuries and diseases such as heart failure stambaugh and post 1966 aspartate aminotransferase ast is an organ nonspecific enzyme wang and chen 2018 that plays a vital role in supplying l aspartate and d aspartate in the blood involved in many animal and hormonal cycles wang and chen 2018 the present results showed that bifenthrin was found to be more potent to increase the activity of liver ast followed by temephos copper sulfate and then glyphosate with percentages 184 142 130 and 129 respectively table 2 also bifenthrin induced serum ast to 241 of control followed by glyphosate 150 copper sulfate 134 and then temephos 125 the higher ast activities of the toad exposed to the tested pesticides may be due to injury of the tissues and increased ast biosynthesis especially in the hepatopancreas joseph and raj 2011 alina et al 2013 the increase of ast in liver and serum could reflect the induction of ast cell levels following exposure to pesticides because ast is involved in gluconeogenesis in hepatopancreas glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue synthesis of neurotransmitters and the neuroglial pathway in the nervous system wang and chen 2018 therefore any changes in ast activity can affect the biochemical and physiological processes of cells banaeea et al 2019 alanine aminotransferase alt is commonly found in the cytoplasm of liver cells supporting the transfer of amine groups from l alanine to Î± ketoglutarate to form pyruvate which is critical for the mitochondrial atp generation and supporting some of the biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid cycle richard et al 2010 therefore the changes in alt activity can lead to the disruption of these physiological processes in case of liver alt activity the activities increased by 2 4 1 4 1 26 and 1 12 fold of control for bifenthrin temephos copper sulfate and glyphosate respectively table 2 whereas serum alt increased by 63 59 22 and 11 following treatment with bifenthrin copper sulfate temephos and glyphosate respectively table 3 in the present study the increase in alt activities either in liver or serum of the toads exposed to the selected treatment compared to the control values may indicate damage to hepatopancreatic cells it is documented that the increase in plasma alt is indicative of liver damage while the increase in ast is indicative of heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction kumari and sinha 2010 the increase either in the ast or alt may reflect the changes in the amino acids transamination in the hepatopancreas wang and chen 2018 the cellular membrane damage has been evaluated by measuring the activity of acp and alp where acp takes part in processes such as digestion cheung and low 1975 ion transport yi and adams 2001 and carbohydrate metabolism sreenivasan et al 2011 while alp plays a role in transphosphorylation and mineralization in the hard tissues golub and boesze battaglia 2007 as well as involved in detoxification processes hatami et al 2019 data in table 2 illustrate that the higher percentages of liver acp activity were recorded for bifenthrin 156 followed by temephos 155 glyphosate 135 and then copper sulfate 104 in case of serum acp bifenthrin increased the activity by 60 whereas the reaming treatments slightly increased the activity by 8 15 table 3 regarding the alp activity copper sulfate was found to be the most effective to increase the activity of liver alp 2 51 fold the control followed by bifenthrin 2 36 fold glyphosate 2 12 fold and then temephos 1 66 fold table 3 while bifenthrin copper sulfate glyphosate and temephos increased serum alp to 1 53 1 47 1 17 and 1 14 fold the control value respectively table 3 therefore any damage to the cell membrane may change the acp and alp activity the present results showed that all the tested pesticides significantly increased the activities of ast alt acp and alp either in serum or liver of toad and bifenthrin was the most potent one to increase the activity of these enzymes except copper sulfate was the most potent to increase the activity of alp either in liver or serum many pesticides were found to increase the levels of these enzymes sexena and sarin 1980 abou donia et al 1986 kumari and sinha 2010 and cause a release of some hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes into the bloodstream barzu et al 1973 the elevated activities seem to result from enhanced enzyme turnover under the pesticide stress the elevation of ast alt and alp and acp indicates the utilization of amino acids for the oxidation or for glucogenesis and is used to determine liver heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction philip et al 1995 kumari and sinha 2010 genotoxicity of the tested pesticides table 4 and fig 1 summarized the results of micronuclei and frequency of abnormalities in erythrocytes of the egyptian toads exposed to the tested pesticides and cyclophosphamide positive control for 96 h the number of structural aberrations induced by the different treatments was enumerated in the present study it was found that all the tested pesticides significantly increased the frequency of abnormalities compared to the negative control vehicle bifenthrin significantly increased the frequency of abnormalities more than the positive control while copper sulfate and glyphosate were found to be less than the positive control table 4 the recorded frequency of abnormalities was 127 104 103 80 and 67 for bifenthrin temephos cyclophosphamide glyphosate and copper sulfate respectively however temephos nonsignificantly increased the frequency of abnormalities compared to the positive control micronuclei mn and other nuclear abnormalities test are fast and sensitive techniques for evaluating genetic damage lÃ³pez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2019 so it is widely used to assess the genotoxicity of chemicals fenech 1993 kirsch volders et al 1997 giving the indication for the cytotoxic potential of the tested compound the data in table 4 illustrate that all the treatments significantly increased the number of pce per 1000 cells the frequency of mn compared to the negative control where the recorded mn frequencies were 36 33 24 and 19 respectively in the toads treated with temephos bifenthrin glyphosate and copper sulfate respectively the present findings illustrated that temephos and bifenthrin were still more potent to induce the frequency of mn higher than cyclophosphamide 31 3 while copper sulfate and glyphosate were found to be less potent to induce the frequency of mn than the positive control the present findings are in parallel with the results of many investigators regarding the ability of pesticides to cause mn and or frequency of abnormalities in toads and other species de rocha 2011 kour et al 2014 the increase in the frequency of mn highlights the presence of compounds capable of producing genotoxic damage leading to increased teratogenesis and tumors and in consequence a decreased species fitness peluso et al 2020 copper sulfate was found to cause mn or abnormalities frequencies in frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis kour et al 2014 and in bull frog tadpoles lithobates catesbeianus de rocha 2011 the ability of temephos as an inducer of mn or abnormalities frequencies in tadpoles was evident by harischandra et al 2011 also temephos was found to be genotoxic and mutagenic at concentrations similar to those routinely used to combat aedes aegypti aiub et al 2002 glyphosate was found to elevate mn or abnormalities frequencies by increasing dna damage and delayed metamorphose tadpoles jayawardena et al 2010 yadav et al 2013 found that lower concentrations of roundup 1 2 and 3 mg l induced the formation of mn in the erythrocytes of tadpoles in a concentration dependent manner and caused dna damage in peripheral erythrocytes of goldfish carassius auratus cavas and kÃ¶nen 2007 however the reduction in the number of pce per 1000 following dimethoate treatment was recorded and this reduction may be due to direct cytotoxicity mn formation or heavy dna damage leading to cell death and or apoptosis especially in toads from the industrial zones ayed boussema et al 2012 cruz santiago et al 2021 although glyphosate in the present was found to be weakly to induce mn in the egyptian toads as found in bovine peripheral lymphocytes piesova 2005 potential risk alvarez moya et al 2014 genotoxicity poletta et al 2009 cytogenetic and dna damage cavas and kÃ¶nen 2007 were documented in fish birds and mammals recently potential genotoxic effects of glyphosate were reported for the freshwater shrimp macrobrachium nipponensis hong et al 2018 the neotropical fish prochilodus lineatus cavalcante et al 2008 and the fish corydoras paleatus de castilhos and cestari 2013 from the present data it is clear that bifenthrin increased the mn and frequencies of abnormalities and these results are in coincidence with chaudhari and saxena 2015 who illustrated that bifenthrin caused different types of aberrations like chromosomal gap sticky plates chromatid separation and breaks in the kidney cells of fishes as well as interacting with dna causing dna damage rajini et al 2015 therefore any alterations in the genetic material are considered as early warning signals to detect the long term low concentration effect of many xenobiotics lÃ³pez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2019 conclusion amphibians are susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides because they have thin and highly permeable skins that rapidly absorb toxic substances as well as their breeding sites in shallow forest and agricultural ponds that contain higher pesticide concentration levels therefore amphibians can be used as bioindicators for environmental contamination in the present study we demonstrated the toxicity of pesticide formulations under conditions that simulate the real situation of exposure suffered by toads in egypt where many pesticides are sprayed each year in the field at concentrations similar to 1 10 of the application rate of the tested pesticide bifenthrin was found to be highly toxic to the egyptian toads followed by temephos while glyphosate is moderately toxic in order to verify pesticide toxicity biomarkers either chemically or genetically used in this study are considered as important predictive tools for the evaluation of toxicity according to the results the sublethal exposure of the egyptian toads to the tested pesticides could lead to a collapse of cellular homeostasis and changes in the genetic and biochemical parameters that could potentially increase their susceptibility to disease and life history trade offs later in life therefore the egyptian toads can be used as bioindicators of environmental pollution where the presence of toads in the backyard is an index of good environment it is recommended that the pesticides used around amphibians breeding habitat should be prevented especially near headwaters to ensure the concentrations of these pesticides are below the safe levels and more studies are needed to investigate the effects of these pesticides at environmental concentrations to comprehensively assess their impacts on wildlife publisher s note springer nature remains

20061,the effect of the 1 10 the application rates of either copper sulfate temephos glyphosate or bifenthrin on some biochemical and genotoxic markers of the egyptian toads sclerophrys regularis exposed for 96 h under conditions similar to the real situation was investigated the results illustrated that brain acetylcholinesterase ache was significantly inhibited following temephos treatment while the enzyme activities markedly increased following either glyphosate or bifenthrin exposure liver glutathione s transferase gst activity was inhibited following either copper sulfate or bifenthrin while the activity increased following glyphosate treatment also the data illustrated that the level of glutathione reduced gsh in liver and the activities of lactic dehydrogenase ldh transaminasaes ast and alt and phosphatases acp and alp in liver and serum showed significant increases following all the treatments and bifenthrin was the potent one regarding the genotoxicity of the tested pesticides the number of structural aberrations induced by the different treatments was enumerated in the present study it was found that all the tested pesticides significantly increased either the frequency of abnormalities or the number of polychromatic erythrocytes pce per 1000 cells the frequency of micronucleus mn compared to the negative control where bifenthrin and temephos were found to be more potent than cyclophosphamide positive control to induce these structural aberrations according to the present results the tested concentrations of the tested pesticides could lead to a collapse of cellular homeostasis and changes in the biochemical and genetic parameters in the egyptian toads which can be considered as indicators of environmental pollution by pesticides

egyptian toads sclerophrys regularis handling breeding and bioassay were conducted with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc alexandria university egypt adult of the toads of the same size and almost the same weight 39 10 0 80 g of both sexes were obtained from the faculty of science zoology department alexandria university egypt it was ensured that the toads were not collected from agricultural sites toads were acclimatized in polypropylene tanks 50 30 30 cm3 containing 2 l of dechlorinated tap water for 7 days prior to starting the experiments volgiatzis and loumbourdis 1997 tanks were placed on a slant to provide the option of the both aqueous and dry environment allran and karasov 2001 water was changed every day and the tanks were cleaned thoroughly toads were fed on larvae of the cotton leaf worm and uneaten larvae and fecal wastes were removed regularly toxicity studies toads were randomly divided into 5 groups and then exposed for 96 hrs at 25 c 1 c with a 12 12 hrs light dark photoperiod in static conditions either to 0 01 2 5 9 6 and 0 48 g a i l which equaled the 1 10 of the application rates of copper sulfate temephos glyphosate and bifenthrin respectively data were collected from the agriculture pesticide committee 2020 as well as the control group dechlorinated tap water was used to prepare the tested concentrations and control tests feeding was done daily ad libitum during the test three replicates for each pesticide and each tank contained an equal volume of the tested solution 2 l and equal numbers of toads 3 for each n 9 the tested solutions were changed every 24 hrs during the 96 hrs of the tested periods the dead toads were removed and the incidences of mortality were recorded toads were assumed dead when they turned upside down and sank to the bottom of the tank or when they showed no form of movement even when prodded with a glass rod harri et al 1979 biochemical studies at the end of the experimental period blood samples were withdrawn from the toads by cardiac puncture in tubes centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm using janetzki t30 centrifuge germany and then serum was withdrawn for determination of biochemical parameters toads were dissected and brain and liver were quickly removed washed with ice cold saline solution 0 9 cleaned from the connective adipose tissues and then kept frozen at 20

using costat version 6 40 software one way analysis of variance anova and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison tests were used to compare between treatments at level of 0 05 p 0 05 results and discussions effect of the tested pesticides on egyptian toads the primary objective of this study was to assess the toxic effects of 1 10 of the application rates of copper sulfate temephos glyphosate and bifenthrin on the egyptian toads exposed for 96 hrs as well as to evaluate their effects on some biochemical and genetic parameters the data showed that bifenthrin was the most toxic pesticide for the toads where all toads were found dead 48 hrs after exposure however no mortality was observed either in the control group or other treated groups table 1 declines in the amphibian populations due to exposure to different pesticides belonging to different chemical groups were recoreded relyea 2005 ezemonye and ilechie 2007 bernal et al 2009 ezemonye and tongo 2009 liu et al 2011 ismail et al 2014 lau et al 2015 junges et al 2017 the present results are parallel with the finding of dinehart et al 2008 who found that glyphosate based herbicide formulations did not pose an immediate risk to certain species of amphibians housed on soil or moist paper towels also temephos had no effect on the bull frog u s public health service 1995 whereas copper sulfate showed moderate toxicity to fish and aquatic animals tomlin 2002 and bifenthrin was very harmful to the aquatic life such as fish and other aquatic animals even in small concentrations technical fact sheet 2017 certain signs of toxicity such as initial hyperactivity symptoms followed by loss of balance motionlessness and finally death were observed as a sign of acute toxicity after treatment with pesticides sayim and kaya 2006 organophosphates ops carbamates pyrethroids and herbicides cause weakness lethargy for amphibians venturino et al 2003 in the present study external examinations of toads didn t reveal any abnormality in control and appeared active and healthy throughout the tested periods while toads treated either with temephos or bifenthrin showed hyperactivity and relaxed legs as straight shape with a lesion in the dead toads treated by bifenthrin the changes in the animal s behaviour after exposure to toxicants may be related to the consequent alteration in the physiological processs wolmarans et al 2022 in the present study he high mortality recorded in toads treated with bifenthrin could be explained by the bioconcentration of this pesticide in the tissues where a clear significant positive correlation between the accumulated residues of pesticides and mortality of toads was found ezemonye and tongo 2010 acetylcholinesterase ache is a serine protease found at the cholinergic synapses in the nerve system of all animals to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine hatami et al 2019 the effect of the tested pesticides on brain ache activity in toads is shown in table 1 a significant p 0 05 decrease in brain ache of toads treated with 1 10 of the application rates of temephos after 96 hrs with activity equaled to 76 of control while copper sulfate inhibited brain ache activity to less extent 4 of control the disruption in the biosynthesis or inhibition of ache in the egyptian toads exposed to these pesticides can lead to the accumulation of the acetylcholine ach in the nervous system so overstimulation of cholinergic synapses in the parasympathetic system neuromuscular attachment and central nervous system can disrupt the vital activities several studies have shown that when amphibians are exposed to compounds that decrease ache activity the reproduction forage and swimming will be altered attademo et al 2014 attademo et al 2015 these ecological consequences alter the long term survival of amphibians causing declines in amphibian populations davidson et al 2002 ache activity has shown to be strongly inhibited by ops and carbamates in vertebrate species sparling and fellers 2009 kumari and sinha 2015 samarakoon and pathiratne 2017 this may explaining the higher significant inhibition of brain ache of toads recorded in the present study after temephos exposure liu et al 2011 where temephos acts by inactivating ache via phosphorylation causing both the accumulation of ach in the synapse and subsequent overstimulation of cholinergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system causing disorders in animals berrill et al 1994 saglio et al 1998 the pesticides have been found to concentrate in the tissue of frogs with depressed cholinesterase activity sparling et al 2001 and have induced hyperactivity in frogs followed by paralysis berrill et al 1998 therefore ache is considered as a specific molecular target for ops and recognized as a biological marker for pesticide poisoning lionetto et al 2013 additionally the interruption of the normal function of the nervous system can affect muscle function reducing the locomotor performance de arcaute et al 2012 this is matching with the results of sparling and fellers 2009 who found that chlorpyrifos declined the ache activity in metamorphose larval of pacific tree frogs pseudacris regilla and foothill yellow legged frogs rana boylii also the ache activity was inhibited in tadpoles of duttaphrynus melanostictus exposed to carbosulfan samarakoon and pathiratne 2017 rana tigrina and bufo melanostictus treated with carbaryl and methyl parathion kumari and sinha 2015 however in the present study bifenthrin and glyphosate induced the activities of brain ache to 118 and 121 of control respectively table 1 although glyphosate is an organophosphorus herbicide it lacks specific chemical groups such as sulfur halide or thiocyanate group that contribute to ache inhibition the effect of glyphosate on the nervous system of animals is attributed to glycine presents in its chemical structure which is also found in the structure of many proteins and enzymes banaeea et al 2019 and may interfere with the synthesis of glycogen synthase kinase by inhibiting ach gene expression besides glycine may affect the level of ache by reducing the synthesis of hormone sensitive lipids mesnage et al 2015 samsel and seneff 2016 although some aquatic species show no signs of toxicity when exposed to ops under laboratory conditions despite almost complete inhibition of ache the behavioral responses such as feeding and predator avoidance ferrari et al 2009 motor activity robles mendoza et al 2011 ruiz de arcaute et al 2012 and diverse toxicological effects ural 2013 may be impaired and consequently challenge the survival in the field situations ferrari et al 2009 this implies that these species will be at risk when exposed to such ops bifenthrin is a type i pyrethroids that affect the central and peripheral nervous system by interfering with sodium channel gating and tend to the channel to open for short times compared to type ii pyrethroids bradberry et al 2005 affecting the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates miller and salgado 1985 and cellular atp ase production johnson et al 2010 however bifenthrin cannot inhibit ache as ops and carbamates irac 2017 even in small concentrations fish and other aquatic animals are affected adversely by bifenthrin so it should not be applied near water sources clark and matsumura 1982 data in table 2 illustrate the effect of the tested pesticides on different biochemical markers in livers of toads it was found that liver gst decreased up to 24 and 16 in bifenthrin and copper sulfate exposed toads respectively while glyphosate significantly induced the activity of the enzyme by 26 of control temephos non significantly reduced the gst activity in livers of toads compared to untreated toads gst is a very important enzyme to the organism because of its role in cellular detoxification of various xenobiotics as a scavenger for lipophilic xenobiotics or endogenous formed waste products and as a defense mechanism to face the oxidative stress cruz santiago et al 2021 this enzyme protects cells against toxicants neutralizing them and rendering the product more water soluble lamoureus and rueness 1987 gst acts rapidly by metabolizing the insecticide to nontoxic products or by rapidly binding and very slowly turning over the insecticide kostaropoulos et al 2001 che mendozaet al 2009 in the present study the increase and decrease in gst activity in the liver were observed this antioxidant enzyme is conditioned by the transcriptional activity of the gst genes which could be either up or down regulated depending on various factors such as the chemical structure of the xenobiotic the concentration of the xenobiotic and time of exposure martÃ­nez guitarte 2018 these alterations in gst activity reveal the oxidative damage and the responses and mechanisms through which organisms protect themselves against the toxicity of pollutants clasen et al 2018 the increase in the activity of gst has been used as a marker of exposure to pesticides machala et al 1998 and these pesticides are expected to induce the activity of gst as a protection mechanism timur et al 2002 lajmanovich et al 2019 therefore gst could be used as an indicator of either exposure of toads to pesticides in the agroecosystems venturino et al 2003 cabagna et al 2005 or alteration of the phase ii of the biotransformation by the antioxidant defense system peltzer et al 2019 however the inhibition of gst found in the present study either by bifenthrin or copper sulfate is coincided with the study done by lajmanovich et al 2011 who recorded an inhibition of liver gst activity in frogs collected from agricultural fields of the humid pampas and contaminated with pesticides in argentina also the cytosolic gst in tadpole xenopus laevis was inhibited by exposure to Î» cyhalothrin and deltamethrin under static conditions aydin sinan et al 2012 this inhibition is thought to be caused by failure of the detoxification process and the development of oxidative stress cattaneo et al 2012 regarding the levels of gsh all treatments induced gsh levels in livers of treated toads and bifenthrin was found to be the most potent followed by copper sulfate temephos and then glyphosate with values of 146 143 137 and 110 of control respectively table 2 the alterations in the cellular antioxidant defense have been associated with pesticides exposures hai et al 1997 osman et al 2021 gsh acts as an essential cofactor for enzymes hayes et al 2005 and under oxidative stress it is consumed by the glutathione related enzymes through a pathway involving gst activity to detoxify peroxides produced due to increased lipid peroxidation cathcart 1985 the higher levels of gsh obtained in the present study after exposure to bifenthrin may indicate that pyrethroids induce oxidative stress which is probably an initial adaptive response to increase oxidative stress in pyrethroid intoxicated rats kaviraj et al 2014 in tadpoles gsh pool gst and metallothioneins respond in different ways to pesticides venturino et al 2003 and cause oxidative stress by elevating the levels of h2o2 and gsh david et al 2012 therefore gsh levels are considered as relevant biomarkers in aquatic toxicology doyotte et al 1997 lactate dehydrogenase ldh is an oxidoreductase enzyme that plays a role in cellular glycolysis where it converts pyruvate to lactate in the presence of nadh the present data illustrate that all the tested pesticides caused a significant p 0 01 increase in the activity of ldh in liver and bifenthrin was found to be the most potent followed by glyphosate copper sulfate and then temephos where the recorded percentages of activity were 283 248 248 and 235 respectively table 2 regarding serum ldh bifenthrin was also found to be the most potent to induce the activity 3 03 fold the control followed by copper sulfate 2 46 fold glyphosate 1 95 fold and then temephos 1 80 fold the increased ldh activity in the toads exposed to these pesticides may be due to cellular hypoxia and damage to hepatopancreatic cells the present investigation is in parallel with that reported by kumari and sinha 2010 who found that ldh activity increased when toads bufo melanostictus treated with methyl parathion indicating that the energy demands are met by anaerobic respiration and related with the increase of ldh activity the changes in the ldh activity in all toads treated by the tested pesticides may be due to severe cellular damage leading to an increase in the release of ldh that impaired carbohydrate and protein metabolism sivakumari et al 1997 ldh is considered as one of the most important enzymes involved in the anaerobic metabolism of carbohydrates under stress conditions and the increase in ldh activity is considered as a physiological mechanism for energy supply to cope with the toxic effects of pesticides such as glyphosate banaeea et al 2019 therefore ldh can be used as an indicator for cellular damage clinical practice cytotoxicity and common injuries and diseases such as heart failure stambaugh and post 1966 aspartate aminotransferase ast is an organ nonspecific enzyme wang and chen 2018 that plays a vital role in supplying l aspartate and d aspartate in the blood involved in many animal and hormonal cycles wang and chen 2018 the present results showed that bifenthrin was found to be more potent to increase the activity of liver ast followed by temephos copper sulfate and then glyphosate with percentages 184 142 130 and 129 respectively table 2 also bifenthrin induced serum ast to 241 of control followed by glyphosate 150 copper sulfate 134 and then temephos 125 the higher ast activities of the toad exposed to the tested pesticides may be due to injury of the tissues and increased ast biosynthesis especially in the hepatopancreas joseph and raj 2011 alina et al 2013 the increase of ast in liver and serum could reflect the induction of ast cell levels following exposure to pesticides because ast is involved in gluconeogenesis in hepatopancreas glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue synthesis of neurotransmitters and the neuroglial pathway in the nervous system wang and chen 2018 therefore any changes in ast activity can affect the biochemical and physiological processes of cells banaeea et al 2019 alanine aminotransferase alt is commonly found in the cytoplasm of liver cells supporting the transfer of amine groups from l alanine to Î± ketoglutarate to form pyruvate which is critical for the mitochondrial atp generation and supporting some of the biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid cycle richard et al 2010 therefore the changes in alt activity can lead to the disruption of these physiological processes in case of liver alt activity the activities increased by 2 4 1 4 1 26 and 1 12 fold of control for bifenthrin temephos copper sulfate and glyphosate respectively table 2 whereas serum alt increased by 63 59 22 and 11 following treatment with bifenthrin copper sulfate temephos and glyphosate respectively table 3 in the present study the increase in alt activities either in liver or serum of the toads exposed to the selected treatment compared to the control values may indicate damage to hepatopancreatic cells it is documented that the increase in plasma alt is indicative of liver damage while the increase in ast is indicative of heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction kumari and sinha 2010 the increase either in the ast or alt may reflect the changes in the amino acids transamination in the hepatopancreas wang and chen 2018 the cellular membrane damage has been evaluated by measuring the activity of acp and alp where acp takes part in processes such as digestion cheung and low 1975 ion transport yi and adams 2001 and carbohydrate metabolism sreenivasan et al 2011 while alp plays a role in transphosphorylation and mineralization in the hard tissues golub and boesze battaglia 2007 as well as involved in detoxification processes hatami et al 2019 data in table 2 illustrate that the higher percentages of liver acp activity were recorded for bifenthrin 156 followed by temephos 155 glyphosate 135 and then copper sulfate 104 in case of serum acp bifenthrin increased the activity by 60 whereas the reaming treatments slightly increased the activity by 8 15 table 3 regarding the alp activity copper sulfate was found to be the most effective to increase the activity of liver alp 2 51 fold the control followed by bifenthrin 2 36 fold glyphosate 2 12 fold and then temephos 1 66 fold table 3 while bifenthrin copper sulfate glyphosate and temephos increased serum alp to 1 53 1 47 1 17 and 1 14 fold the control value respectively table 3 therefore any damage to the cell membrane may change the acp and alp activity the present results showed that all the tested pesticides significantly increased the activities of ast alt acp and alp either in serum or liver of toad and bifenthrin was the most potent one to increase the activity of these enzymes except copper sulfate was the most potent to increase the activity of alp either in liver or serum many pesticides were found to increase the levels of these enzymes sexena and sarin 1980 abou donia et al 1986 kumari and sinha 2010 and cause a release of some hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes into the bloodstream barzu et al 1973 the elevated activities seem to result from enhanced enzyme turnover under the pesticide stress the elevation of ast alt and alp and acp indicates the utilization of amino acids for the oxidation or for glucogenesis and is used to determine liver heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction philip et al 1995 kumari and sinha 2010 genotoxicity of the tested pesticides table 4 and fig 1 summarized the results of micronuclei and frequency of abnormalities in erythrocytes of the egyptian toads exposed to the tested pesticides and cyclophosphamide positive control for 96 h the number of structural aberrations induced by the different treatments was enumerated in the present study it was found that all the tested pesticides significantly increased the frequency of abnormalities compared to the negative control vehicle bifenthrin significantly increased the frequency of abnormalities more than the positive control while copper sulfate and glyphosate were found to be less than the positive control table 4 the recorded frequency of abnormalities was 127 104 103 80 and 67 for bifenthrin temephos cyclophosphamide glyphosate and copper sulfate respectively however temephos nonsignificantly increased the frequency of abnormalities compared to the positive control micronuclei mn and other nuclear abnormalities test are fast and sensitive techniques for evaluating genetic damage lÃ³pez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2019 so it is widely used to assess the genotoxicity of chemicals fenech 1993 kirsch volders et al 1997 giving the indication for the cytotoxic potential of the tested compound the data in table 4 illustrate that all the treatments significantly increased the number of pce per 1000 cells the frequency of mn compared to the negative control where the recorded mn frequencies were 36 33 24 and 19 respectively in the toads treated with temephos bifenthrin glyphosate and copper sulfate respectively the present findings illustrated that temephos and bifenthrin were still more potent to induce the frequency of mn higher than cyclophosphamide 31 3 while copper sulfate and glyphosate were found to be less potent to induce the frequency of mn than the positive control the present findings are in parallel with the results of many investigators regarding the ability of pesticides to cause mn and or frequency of abnormalities in toads and other species de rocha 2011 kour et al 2014 the increase in the frequency of mn highlights the presence of compounds capable of producing genotoxic damage leading to increased teratogenesis and tumors and in consequence a decreased species fitness peluso et al 2020 copper sulfate was found to cause mn or abnormalities frequencies in frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis kour et al 2014 and in bull frog tadpoles lithobates catesbeianus de rocha 2011 the ability of temephos as an inducer of mn or abnormalities frequencies in tadpoles was evident by harischandra et al 2011 also temephos was found to be genotoxic and mutagenic at concentrations similar to those routinely used to combat aedes aegypti aiub et al 2002 glyphosate was found to elevate mn or abnormalities frequencies by increasing dna damage and delayed metamorphose tadpoles jayawardena et al 2010 yadav et al 2013 found that lower concentrations of roundup 1 2 and 3 mg l induced the formation of mn in the erythrocytes of tadpoles in a concentration dependent manner and caused dna damage in peripheral erythrocytes of goldfish carassius auratus cavas and kÃ¶nen 2007 however the reduction in the number of pce per 1000 following dimethoate treatment was recorded and this reduction may be due to direct cytotoxicity mn formation or heavy dna damage leading to cell death and or apoptosis especially in toads from the industrial zones ayed boussema et al 2012 cruz santiago et al 2021 although glyphosate in the present was found to be weakly to induce mn in the egyptian toads as found in bovine peripheral lymphocytes piesova 2005 potential risk alvarez moya et al 2014 genotoxicity poletta et al 2009 cytogenetic and dna damage cavas and kÃ¶nen 2007 were documented in fish birds and mammals recently potential genotoxic effects of glyphosate were reported for the freshwater shrimp macrobrachium nipponensis hong et al 2018 the neotropical fish prochilodus lineatus cavalcante et al 2008 and the fish corydoras paleatus de castilhos and cestari 2013 from the present data it is clear that bifenthrin increased the mn and frequencies of abnormalities and these results are in coincidence with chaudhari and saxena 2015 who illustrated that bifenthrin caused different types of aberrations like chromosomal gap sticky plates chromatid separation and breaks in the kidney cells of fishes as well as interacting with dna causing dna damage rajini et al 2015 therefore any alterations in the genetic material are considered as early warning signals to detect the long term low concentration effect of many xenobiotics lÃ³pez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2019 conclusion amphibians are susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides because they have thin and highly permeable skins that rapidly absorb toxic substances as well as their breeding sites in shallow forest and agricultural ponds that contain higher pesticide concentration levels therefore amphibians can be used as bioindicators for environmental contamination in the present study we demonstrated the toxicity of pesticide formulations under conditions that simulate the real situation of exposure suffered by toads in egypt where many pesticides are sprayed each year in the field at concentrations similar to 1 10 of the application rate of the tested pesticide bifenthrin was found to be highly toxic to the egyptian toads followed by temephos while glyphosate is moderately toxic in order to verify pesticide toxicity biomarkers either chemically or genetically used in this study are considered as important predictive tools for the evaluation of toxicity according to the results the sublethal exposure of the egyptian toads to the tested pesticides could lead to a collapse of cellular homeostasis and changes in the genetic and biochemical parameters that could potentially increase their susceptibility to disease and life history trade offs later in life therefore the egyptian toads can be used as bioindicators of environmental pollution where the presence of toads in the backyard is an index of good environment it is recommended that the pesticides used around amphibians breeding habitat should be prevented especially near headwaters to ensure the concentrations of these pesticides are below the safe levels and more studies are needed to investigate the effects of these pesticides at environmental concentrations to comprehensively assess their impacts on wildlife publisher s note springer nature remains

species in this area discussion southwest coast of tamil nadu is critically subject to various anthropogenic pressures and the ecosystem based management requires the combined use of multiple tools which includes physicochemical parameters biological parameters and biotic indices mangano et al 2017 the do concentration was observed to be low particularly towards the southern part of the study area in most of the cases oxygen depletion is directly influenced by anthropogenic activities diaz and rosenberg 1995a diaz and rosenberg 1995b specifically due to non point sources like untreated sewage and agricultural runoff as well as point sources like mixing of coir retting liquor nandan 1997 shipping and oil discharge chatzinikolaou et al 2018 in the study area the study area also comprises a shipping harbour muttom mu and the busiest beach tourist destination kanyakumari kk in india responsible for increased anthropogenic pressures in coastal environment the hypoxic condition in the sediment can induce a stress on the benthic organisms tyson and pearson 1991 which may affect their abundance and diversity except temperature most of the environmental variables showed spatial variation among stations p 0 001 the maximum biodiversity index was 1 44 for macrobenthos and 1 17 for meiobenthos in the study area kumar and khan 2013 earlier reported that the benthic diversity ranged from 1 80 to 2 83 in pondichery mangrove similarly reizopoulou and nicolaidou 2004 reported a benthic diversity that ranged from 0 8 to 3 0 in rodia lagoon greece various anthropogenic activities like coir retting raw sewage disposal placer mining wastes anti biofouling paint spills harbour effluent mixing agricultural runoff shell bleaching by small scale industries and tourism activities have previously been reported along the sw coast of tamil nadu godson et al 2018 such activities have led to high organic matter pollution thus developing hypoxic conditions even in the shallow sediments which may be anthropogenically induced diaz and rosenberg 1995a diaz and rosenberg 1995b levin 2003 for example a large amount of organic matter accumulation occurs in the coastal sediments as a result of coir retting nandan and azis 1995 that results in oxygen depletion meiobenthos showed high diversity than macrobenthos which is attributed to the presence of more tolerant groups of meiobenthos than macrobenthos giere 1993 benthic communities show high abundance than diversity which is attributed to their preference for high organic matter content in the sediments levin and gage 1998 however the diversity of benthic invertebrate increases with the increase of organic input to a moderate level and then shows a decreasing trend with a large amount of organic input rosenzweig 1995 rosenzweig and abramsky 1993 in south west coast of tamil nadu polychaetes were dominant among macrobenthic assemblages previous studies by yucel gier et al 2007 yucel gier et al 2007 also suggested polychaetes as dominant phyla in eastern agean turkey in both marine and estuarine sediments of the south tamil nadu coast polychaetes were the dominant phyla among macrobenthos prabakaran et al 2019 polycheates are opportunistic species in polluted areas pearson 1978 and are more tolerant to low oxygen and organic enrichment than molluscs and crustaceans levin and gage 1998 which explains the prevalence of polychaetes in the study area nandan 1991 has observed polychaetes as the dominant organism in the coconut husk retting zones of cochin backwaters where the oxygen level reduces due to high organic matter content released during retting of coconut husk however latha and vincent 2010 have reported a higher incidence of gastropoda and insects in the retting zone of kadinamkulam lake in south kerala organic matter retaining capacity of sandy sediment is less jeshma et al 2017 and can influence the abundance of benthos yucel gier et al 2007 the corg content may depend on the sediment particle size arya et al 2022 milliman 1994 in the study area the sediment was predominantly sandy in most of the stations fig 2 the sand percentage varied between 53 08 and 87 82 and the maximum value was in s63 kanyakumari whereas silt and clay percentages varied between 0 63 and 19 56 and 1 09 and 41 38 respectively previous researches have suggested that sediment grain size can influence the spatial distribution of benthos galope bacaltos 2002 kim et al 2020 most of the organisms may be present in sandy sediment than muddy sediment due to the interstitial space coull 1999 corg and tom content of sandy sediment were low which may be due to the low retaining capacity of sandy sediment ansari et al 2012 the abundance of benthic organisms is directly related to the amount of food available in the sediment rodil et al 2008 sibuet et al 1984 the flow of food for benthic organisms can be reduced due to organic matter degradation portnova and polukhin 2018 and may lead to oxygen depletion kon et al 2015 this may affect benthic diversity organic matter can influence the structure and function of benthic communities bianchelli et al 2020 rex et al 1997 and act as an important parameter for determining polychaete diversity levin and gage 1998 the varying content of organic matter can influence the abundance and diversity of benthos gooday and turley 1990 snelgrove and butman 1995 moreover benthic foraminifera can also dominate in low oxygen conditions which support less diversity with high abundance because the respiratory oxygen demand of benthic foraminifera is less this explains their ability to survive in such conditions gupta and machain castillo 1993 and also adapt to marine salinity levels kasilingam et al 2019 application of site specific multi indices helps to best describe the ecological status of coastal ecosystems based on the pollution load as well as the benthic diversity ryu et al 2016 the ambi and m ambi indices developed by european water framework directive wfd provided insights in the ecological health status selvaraj et al 2019 of the 14 sampling stations in the southwest coast of tamil nadu based on these indices the stations were clustered into various ecological groups egi to egv revealing their ecological status such classification also corroborated with the presence of pollution tolerant species of macro meio benthos in the stations showing poor ecological health eg iv v and pollution sensitive species in the stations with moderate to good ecological health eg i to egiii among the 14 stations 2 were classified as poor and 9 as bad this is due to the fact that these stations were subject to multiple anthropogenic pressures such as input of coir retting effluent tourism placer mining deposits disposal of sewage effluent and the prevalence of fishing harbours leading to hydrocarbon contamination along the study area godson et al 2018 the predominant among these are coir retting effluents and untreated sewage rich in organic matter entering the coastal environment through streams and channels in addition to small rivers thamirabharani river pazhayar river and pannaiyar river that enters the coastal ecosystem through estuaries thengapattinam rajakkamangalam and manakudi as the decline in ecosystem health is a threat to coastal fisheries management measures to control organic pollution input in the coastal environment should be given top priority in this region site specific management is the key to restore the ecosystem health in the south west coast of india in addition to the conventional techniques the coastal assessment using modern tools such as remote sensing and gis along with the benthic index can provide realistic information that can be used for effective restoration solutions in this way integrated conservation approaches can ensure marine and coastal management conclusions increased input of organic matter due to anthropogenic activities like raw sewage disposal fishing activity tourism and coir retting in the coastal environment of arabian sea in tamil nadu have caused oxygen depletion in the sediments this consequently has caused spatial changes in the structure and function of benthic organisms among macrobenthos opportunistic taxa like polychaetes which are tolerant to low oxygen concentration were the dominant group the ecosystem health analysis based on ambi and m ambi indices classified the sampling stations into different ecological groups obviously due to the presence of pollution tolerant and sensitive species in the study area the study highlights the importance of using macro and meio benthic fauna for monitoring ecosystem health in coastal environment which further impacts coastal productivity nevertheless the results also reveal the spatial variations in benthic community assemblages under the influence of anthropogenic pressures particularly organic pollution from coir retting and untreated sewage which warrants site specific management solutions to reduce organic pollution in this region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

sewage and agricultural runoff as well as point sources like mixing of coir retting liquor nandan 1997 shipping and oil discharge chatzinikolaou et al 2018 in the study area the study area also comprises a shipping harbour muttom mu and the busiest beach tourist destination kanyakumari kk in india responsible for increased anthropogenic pressures in coastal environment the hypoxic condition in the sediment can induce a stress on the benthic organisms tyson and pearson 1991 which may affect their abundance and diversity except temperature most of the environmental variables showed spatial variation among stations p 0 001 the maximum biodiversity index was 1 44 for macrobenthos and 1 17 for meiobenthos in the study area kumar and khan 2013 earlier reported that the benthic diversity ranged from 1 80 to 2 83 in pondichery mangrove similarly reizopoulou and nicolaidou 2004 reported a benthic diversity that ranged from 0 8 to 3 0 in rodia lagoon greece various anthropogenic activities like coir retting raw sewage disposal placer mining wastes anti biofouling paint spills harbour effluent mixing agricultural runoff shell bleaching by small scale industries and tourism activities have previously been reported along the sw coast of tamil nadu godson et al 2018 such activities have led to high organic matter pollution thus developing hypoxic conditions even in the shallow sediments which may be anthropogenically induced diaz and rosenberg 1995a diaz and rosenberg 1995b levin 2003 for example a large amount of organic matter accumulation occurs in the coastal sediments as a result of coir retting nandan and azis 1995 that results in oxygen depletion meiobenthos showed high diversity than macrobenthos which is attributed to the presence of more tolerant groups of meiobenthos than macrobenthos giere 1993 benthic communities show high abundance than diversity which is attributed to their preference for high organic matter content in the sediments levin and gage 1998 however the diversity of benthic invertebrate increases with the increase of organic input to a moderate level and then shows a decreasing trend with a large amount of organic input rosenzweig 1995 rosenzweig and abramsky 1993 in south west coast of tamil nadu polychaetes were dominant among macrobenthic assemblages previous studies by yucel gier et al 2007 yucel gier et al 2007 also suggested polychaetes as dominant phyla in eastern agean turkey in both marine and estuarine sediments of the south tamil nadu coast polychaetes were the dominant phyla among macrobenthos prabakaran et al 2019 polycheates are opportunistic species in polluted areas pearson 1978 and are more tolerant to low oxygen and organic enrichment than molluscs and crustaceans levin and gage 1998 which explains the prevalence of polychaetes in the study area nandan 1991 has observed polychaetes as the dominant organism in the coconut husk retting zones of cochin backwaters where the oxygen level reduces due to high organic matter content released during retting of coconut husk however latha and vincent 2010 have reported a higher incidence of gastropoda and insects in the retting zone of kadinamkulam lake in south kerala organic matter retaining capacity of sandy sediment is less jeshma et al 2017 and can influence the abundance of benthos yucel gier et al 2007 the corg content may depend on the sediment particle size arya et al 2022 milliman 1994 in the study area the sediment was predominantly sandy in most of the stations fig 2 the sand percentage varied between 53 08 and 87 82 and the maximum value was in s63 kanyakumari whereas silt and clay percentages varied between 0 63 and 19 56 and 1 09 and 41 38 respectively previous researches have suggested that sediment grain size can influence the spatial distribution of benthos galope bacaltos 2002 kim et al 2020 most of the organisms may be present in sandy sediment than muddy sediment due to the interstitial space coull 1999 corg and tom content of sandy sediment were low which may be due to the low retaining capacity of sandy sediment ansari et al 2012 the abundance of benthic organisms is directly related to the amount of food available in the sediment rodil et al 2008 sibuet et al 1984 the flow of food for benthic organisms can be reduced due to organic matter degradation portnova and polukhin 2018 and may lead to oxygen depletion kon et al 2015 this may affect benthic diversity organic matter can influence the structure and function of benthic communities bianchelli et al 2020 rex et al 1997 and act as an important parameter for determining polychaete diversity levin and gage 1998 the varying content of organic matter can influence the abundance and diversity of benthos gooday and turley 1990 snelgrove and butman 1995 moreover benthic foraminifera can also dominate in low oxygen conditions which support less diversity with high abundance because the respiratory oxygen demand of benthic foraminifera is less this explains their ability to survive in such conditions gupta and machain castillo 1993 and also adapt to marine salinity levels kasilingam et al 2019 application of site specific multi indices helps to best describe the ecological status of coastal ecosystems based on the pollution load as well as the benthic diversity ryu et al 2016 the ambi and m ambi indices developed by european water framework directive wfd provided insights in the ecological health status selvaraj et al 2019 of the 14 sampling stations in the southwest coast of tamil nadu based on these indices the stations were clustered into various ecological groups egi to egv revealing their ecological status such classification also corroborated with the presence of pollution tolerant species of macro meio benthos in the stations showing poor ecological health eg iv v and pollution sensitive species in the stations with moderate to good ecological health eg i to egiii among the 14 stations 2 were classified as poor and 9 as bad this is due to the fact that these stations were subject to multiple anthropogenic pressures such as input of coir retting effluent tourism placer mining deposits disposal of sewage effluent and the prevalence of fishing harbours leading to hydrocarbon contamination along the study area godson et al 2018 the predominant among these are coir retting effluents and untreated sewage rich in organic matter entering the coastal environment through streams and channels in addition to small rivers thamirabharani river pazhayar river and pannaiyar river that enters the coastal ecosystem through estuaries thengapattinam rajakkamangalam and manakudi as the decline in ecosystem health is a threat to coastal fisheries management measures to control organic pollution input in the coastal environment should be given top priority in this region site specific management is the key to restore the ecosystem health in the south west coast of india in addition to the conventional techniques the coastal assessment using modern tools such as remote sensing and gis along with the benthic index can provide realistic information that can be used for effective restoration solutions in this way integrated conservation approaches can ensure marine and coastal management conclusions increased input of organic matter due to anthropogenic activities like raw sewage disposal fishing activity tourism and coir retting in the coastal environment of arabian sea in tamil nadu have caused oxygen depletion in the sediments this consequently has caused spatial changes in the structure and function of benthic organisms among macrobenthos opportunistic taxa like polychaetes which are tolerant to low oxygen concentration were the dominant group the ecosystem health analysis based on ambi and m ambi indices classified the sampling stations into different ecological groups obviously due to the presence of pollution tolerant and sensitive species in the study area the study highlights the importance of using macro and meio benthic fauna for monitoring ecosystem health in coastal environment which further impacts coastal productivity nevertheless the results also reveal the spatial variations in benthic community assemblages under the influence of anthropogenic pressures particularly organic pollution from coir retting and untreated sewage which warrants site specific management solutions to reduce organic pollution in this region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

20063,the contamination levels and distribution of heavy metals were assessed in riverbed sediments and water column samples from mura and kimpulande rivers both impacted by copper cobalt and gold mining activities analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms atomic absorption spectrometry aas and atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs results showed high concentrations of ni cu zn as cd and hg in water samples the concentrations of as cd and hg in water from both rivers exceeded the limits set in democratic republic of the congo drc legislation on requirements for mine water discharges high concentrations were found also for cu cr zn as cd pb and hg in river sediments and were assessed against sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life the enrichment factor ef and the geoaccumulation index igeo values revealed extremely severe enrichment of cu co as and cd and extreme pollution by cu and co in sediment samples demonstrating high contamination of these rivers the results from calculated ecologic risk factors revealed that aquatic ecosystems in the investigated rivers are at risk therefore a review of current mining practices is needed and the urgent enforcement of good practices is recommended in order to protect the environment and public health keywords mining copper cobalt pollution ecological risk factor introduction the pollution of rivers lakes groundwater and coastal areas by toxic chemicals such as heavy metals rare earths radioactive elements petroleum hydrocarbons and agrochemicals is a major environmental problem in several regions of the world and a major threat to the quality of freshwater resources and to the public health atibu et al 2021 thevenon et al 2012 pourret et al 2016 cheyns et al 2014 carvalho 2017a 2017b in particular past and current mining activities both industrial and artisanal very often affect the surrounding environment and contribute to the pollution of aquatic environments carvalho 2017b carvalho et al 2017 the mining activity exposes rocks and metal ores to the oxidizing conditions of both air and water thus causing a drop in the water ph which drastically increases the solubility of heavy metals and their environmental mobility nordstrom et al 2000 concentrations of heavy metals in water bodies can thus increase and exceed safe levels for aquatic biota and drinking water safety standards singh et al 2022 in the provinces of the eastern democratic republic of the congo drc particularly those of former katanga and kivu regions the rivers sediments soils and atmosphere are impacted by the discharge of polluted effluents from mining and milling facilities aerosol particles enriched in heavy metals can be extremely threatening to fauna flora and human health banza et al 2009 discharge of solid and liquid effluents from mining and milling operations into watercourses constitute also a chemical hazard and may exert toxic effects on the aquatic fauna and flora furthermore the discharged contaminants may be transferred through several environmental pathways to humans impinging on public health pardos et al 2004 in these areas of drc since local populations use river water for domestic needs they are likely to ingest and accumulate toxic metals in their bodies from contaminated drinking water and through consumption of aquatic organisms such as fish molluscs and aquatic plants miller et al 2004 some studies concerning the distribution and concentration of heavy metals metals exposure and human health condition in mining regions of the former katanga province lubumbashi kolwezi kipushi likasi etc were carried out recently atibu et al 2021 2017 2016 2013 banza et al 2009 however there was no information on the impact of mining activities on the distribution and concentration of heavy metals in the water column and in the riverbed sediments of the mura and kimpulande rivers haut katanga region this work aimed at determining the concentration of metals in sediments and water from mura and kimpulande rivers by the town of likasi haut katanga region in order to assess the impact of mining activities and ecotoxicological risks posed by metal contaminants materials and methods sampling site description soils and sediments were sampled along the mura and kimpulande rivers near the likasi town in the province of haut katanga fig 1 these two rivers were chosen because they surround the kipese polymetallic ore deposit located in tantara mining polygon at 37 km south west of likasi and at 7 km west of the shinkolobwe uranium mine and where copper cobalt and gold mining are carried out the mura river is well known for the waste spill of several tons of radioactive ores from shinkolobwe uranium mine that occurred in late 2007 and contaminated the river catchment area wnn 2007 sediment particle grain size measurement aliquots of approximately 1 g from fresh sediment samples were used for grain size determination after 5 min ultrasonic sediment dispersal in deionized water the particle grain size was measured using a laser coulter ls 100 diffractometer beckman coulter fullerton ca usa and the percentages of clay silt and sand were determined potÃ© et al 2008 the clay particles have a diameter 2 Î¼m the silt particles have diameters ranging from 2 to 63 Î¼m while the size of the sand particles ranges from 63 Î¼m to 2 mm blott and pye 2001 water and sediment sample treatment from each acidified river water sample 10 ml were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters millex lcr millipore to remove suspended particulate matter before analysis specific sample dilutions were made depending on the metals to be analysed sediment samples were air dried at ambient room temperature and sieved using 63 Î¼m mesh size sieve before being analyzed the digestion of sediments was performed according to the protocol described by pardos et al 2004 and potÃ© et al 2008 in short an accurately weighted aliquot with approximately 1 g of sieved sediment was digested using analytical grade 2 m hno3 and heating to 150 c in teflon bombs the digestion was followed by different dilution with 1 ultrapure hno3 heavy metal analysis of water and sediment samples by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x series icp ms developed for complex matrix analysis was used for heavy metals analysis to avoid spectral interferences that could bias the results a collision reaction cell helium mode and interference equations were used for calibration multi element standard solutions with different concentrations 0 0 02 1 5 20 100 and 200 Î¼g l 1 were used potÃ© et al 2008 thevenon et al 2013 in order to verify the sensitivity of the device and the reliability of the results the certified reference materials tmda 70 and lksd4 lgc standards uk were used for water and sediments analysis respectively standard deviations of the mean of 3 replicate measurements were below 10 and chemical blanks for the procedure were 2 of the sample signal the results are expressed in ppm mg l 1 and mg kg 1 dry weight for water and sediment samples respectively mercury analysis in sediment samples the total mercury thg in sediment samples was analysed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas specific for mercury determination advanced mercury analyser ama 254 altecs r l czech rep following the method described by roos barraclough et al 2002 this method is based on the combustion of the sediment sample for amalgamation of mercury in a gold trap and the measurement of the gaseous mercury by aas the limit of detection 3 sd of the blank was 0 005 mg kg 1 and the reproducibility was better than 5 the hg concentrations are expressed in ppm mg kg 1 of sediment dry weight mercury analysis in water samples the measurement of total mercury thg content in river water samples was carried out using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs merx model iii brooks rand usa following sample preparation techniques as described by gallorini and loizeau 2022 the procedure is similar to that of epa 1631 us epa 2002 in brief 100 ml of water sample pre acidified with 0 5 ml of hno3 was weighed and 0 5 ml of 20 sncl2 was then added to reduce hg ii to the volatile hg 0 to remove oxygen the sample was purged with argon for 20 min at a flow rate of 350 ml min 1 while the gold trap was purged with argon at a flow rate of 60 ml min 1 for 5 min thg in treated samples was then measured by cvafs the limit of detection calculated as 3 times the standard deviation of blank samples was 0 20 ng l degrees of soil and sediment contamination the degree of soil and sediment contamination was assessed through the calculation of the enrichment factor ef and of the geoaccumulation index igeo as described by maanan et al 2004 the ef was calculated using the following equation ef metal sc sample metal sc background where metal is the concentration of any heavy metal in analyzed samples and in the geochemical background and sc is the concentration of scandium in analyzed samples and in the geochemical background therefore the ef is a geochemical normalization performed using scandium sc as a reference element the upper continental crust ucc average values were used as background values for metals as described by mclennan 2001 the geoaccumulation index igeo was calculated according the following equation igeo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the concentration of the metal n in the sediment samples bn is the concentration of the metal n in the geochemical background and 1 5 is the lithospheric effect background correlation matrix factor lundemi et al 2022 atibu et al 2016 2017 ecological risk indices to evaluate the ecological risk posed by metal contaminants four parameters were determined the contamination factor the contamination degree the ecological risk index and the potential ecological risk index akanchise et al 2020 aja et al 2021 lundemi et al 2022 the contamination factor cf was calculated to quantify the contamination level of heavy metals in sediment samples using the following relation cf c n b n where c n and b n are respectively the heavy metal concentration in sediment and the geochemical background concentration of the metal n hÃ¥kanson 1980 fÃ¶rstner et al 1989 the contamination degree cd of the sediment sample facilitates the evaluation of the polymetallic contamination level it has been calculated with the following formula cd cf i where cf i represents the contamination factor of a specific heavy metal i hÃ¥kanson 1980 eight heavy metals namely hg cd as co cu pb cr and zn were considered in the cd calculation the heavy metals harmful impact on the environment and on the human population was assessed using the ecological risk index eri this ecological risk index is a comprehensive index that takes into account both the ecological sensitivity and the toxicity of the heavy metal hÃ¥kanson 1980 suresh et al 2012 eri was determined by the following formula eri tr i cf i where cf i is the contamination factor of the heavy metal i as defined above and tr i represents the toxic response factor or the biological toxic factor for a given heavy metal tr i values used were 40 30 10 5 5 5 2 and 1 for hg cd as co cu pb cr and zn respectively according to hÃ¥kanson 1980 the summing of ecological risk index eri for several metals is the potential ecological risk index ri ri was computed using the following formula ri eri ri was used to evaluate the potential ecological risk from the polymetallic contamination of river sediments the ri accounts for the synergy of metal concentration toxic level and ecological sensitivity of various biological communities to heavy metals and it is an overarching indicator for the ecological risks threatening the ecosystem singh et al 2002 data analysis triplicate measurements were performed on water and sediment samples for all analytes statistical treatment of data spearman rank order correlation has been realized using sigmastat 11 0 systat software inc usa a multivariate statistical analysis named principal component analysis pca was performed using r software r core team 2015 in order to understand the relationship between analyzed compounds their potential sources and transfer pathways data were centered prior to perform pca analysis to maximize the dispersion results and discussion particle grain size of sediment samples the grain size composition clay silt and sand of sediment samples is shown in the table 1 the proportions of clay silt and sand varied significantly among sediment samples in general the silt percentage remained the highest in almost all samples except for the sample skip3 and skip4 where the percentage of sand was higher the clay content was the lowest in samples from the kimpulande river while the silt content was the highest followed by clay and the sand fraction was less abundant in mura river these features in sediment composition are depicted in fig 2 in the sediment samples from kimpulande river the percentages of silt clay and sand varied from 1 18 to 2 25 from 25 60 to 68 16 and from 29 61 to 73 20 respectively in the mura river sediment samples the clay silt and sand percent contributions varied from 18 53 to 27 50 from 69 30 to 72 36 and from 0 14 to 11 41 respectively the mean grain size remained below 63 Âµm for all the sampling sites except for the skip3 site 63 62 Âµm and skip4 site 90 09 Âµm according to blott and pie 2001 when the mean grain size is between 2 mm and 63 Âµm the sample contains mainly sand while when the mean size is between 63 Âµm and 2 Âµm the silt is predominant concentration of heavy metals in water samples the heavy metals concentrations for sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb and hg in filtered water samples are reported in table 2 these concentration values varied significantly among sampling sites and ranged from 0 0 to 3 5 mg l 1 for cr from 65 2 to 982 2 mg l 1 for ni from 33 4 to 81 438 5 mg l 1 for cu from 160 6 to 10 061 mg l 1 for zn from 3 5 to 10 2 mg l 1 for as from 0 4 to 69 3 mg l 1 for cd from 0 4 to 2 3 mg l 1 for hg the levels of ni cu zn as cd and hg in the water samples were clearly above the low risk values established as a limit in the drc legislation on the requirements for mining effluent releases decree no 38 2013 furthermore in general the concentration levels of as cd and hg in water samples exceeded the high risk values established in the drc legislation and indicated in table 2 decree no 38 2013 concentrations of as cd and hg in river water attained values that were respectively 2 138 and 23 fold higher than the high risk values set in the legislation these results for metal concentrations in water from mura and kimpulande rivers are of the same order of magnitude of those determined in the luilu and musonoie rivers located in the same region of katanga for instance the concentrations in these two rivers ranged from 0 1 to 3 163 8 mg l 1 and from 0 3 to 5 917 5 mg l 1 for co and cu respectively and exceeded also the legal limits atibu et al 2013 concentration of heavy metals in sediment samples the concentrations of heavy metals in sediment samples are shown in table 3 results show a strong variation in the concentrations of sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb pb and hg among sampling stations remarkably high concentrations of cu and co were observed at all sites while most of the sites exhibited a low concentration of sn sb and hg sediments from kimpulande river exhibited the highest concentrations of ti 160 2 mg kg 1 co 2 760 mg kg 1 zn 282 6 mg kg 1 as 69 2 mg kg 1 and cd 3 3 mg kg 1 while the samples from mura river showed the highest concentrations of sc 8 3 mg kg 1 cr 81 3 mg kg 1 ni 98 1 mg kg 1 cu 9 975 mg kg 1 pb 86 1 mg kg 1 and hg 0 8 mg kg 1 these sediments from kimpulande and mura rivers displayed co and cu concentration levels similar to results from previous studies that reported high co and cu concentrations in samples from musonoie luilu dilala mpingiri lubumbashi rivers and from the tshamilemba canal in the same katanga region atibu et al 2017 2016 2013 for example co and cu concentrations in sediments from dilala and lubumbashi rivers were reported up to 21 134 mg kg 1 and 40 807 mg kg 1 and up to 2 043 mg kg 1 and 24 093 mg kg 1 respectively atibu et al 2016 2017 these concentrations are comparable to those reported herein for kimpulande and mura rivers metal concentrations in the rivers of this region in particular for cu and co are several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations usually reported in river sediments elsewhere e g dendievel et al 2022 sojka and jaskuÅa 2022 the katanga region as part of the africa copperbelt is known for a generally high natural background level of co and cu among other metals narendrula et al 2012 pourret et al 2016 this elevated background was taken in account in the igeo parameters utilized above and the concentrations of co and cu in river sediment samples were clearly enhanced above the regional background by the discharges of mining effluents originated from the many metal mines in the region the values of cu in samples table 3 were 35 280 times higher than the recommended values set by the sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life sqgs ccme epc 98e 1999 some other metals such as cr zn as cd pb and hg were also present in non negligible concentrations in the sediment samples with concentration values amounting to 1 to 12 fold higher than sqgs therefore these elevated metal concentrations in sediments represent a hazard to aquatic biota regarding the concentration of heavy metals in the studied sites cu co as and hg were the highest and most widespread among heavy metals analyzed those heavy metals are also among the most hazardous for human and environment health atsdr 2007 in particular the very high concentrations of cu exceeded also the probable effect level pel and therefore they are likely to induce adverse biological impacts on aquatic life in all sampling sites table 3 the as and hg values in sediments from kimpulande river exceeded the pel also table 3 it must be noted that the as and hg have been frequently associated with adverse biological effects observed in aquatic biota niane et al 2019 potÃ© et al 2008 in summary these results highlight a strong environmental contamination in the study area the enhanced concentration of these heavy metals in river water and sediments represent a significant source of toxic metals for the aquatic organisms and a threat for the health of the human riverine communities of the studied region cheyns et al 2014 squadrone et al 2016 assessment of soil and sediment contamination table 4 displays the enrichment factor ef and geoaccumulation index igeo values for selected heavy metals in sediment samples from kimpulande and mura rivers these parameters were used as a quantitative criteria to classify the levels of heavy metal pollution against a ranking contamination scale and to help identifying the natural or anthropogenic metal sources see table 4 adamo et al 2005 thevenon et al 2012 the highest ef values of co and cu for all sampling sites and of as for kimpulande river sites were above 50 corresponding to a classification of extremely severe enrichment sakan et al 2009 a minor enrichment degree was displayed by all mura river samples for pb and hg by all kimpulande river samples for ni by skip1 and skip4 samples for cr and by smr1 and smr2 samples for zn variable enrichment levels depending on sampling sites and ranging from moderate enrichment to extremely severe enrichment were found for cr ni zn cd pb and hg based on the igeo values all samples ranked as extremely polluted with cu while kimpulande river samples were extremely polluted with co samples from mura river ranked from heavily polluted smr3 to heavily to extremely polluted with co smr1 smr2 and smr4 all samples were practically unpolluted regarding cr kimpulande river samples were practically unpolluted with ni mura river samples were practically unpolluted with both pb and hg other samples were classified from unpolluted to moderately polluted class 1 to heavily to extremely polluted with ni zn as cd pb and hg several factors could explain the pollution levels observed including the geology of the region with high natural background levels of metals and metalloids key et al 2004 but human activities mining activities and especially mine effluent discharges into the rivers were the visible main source for such high pollution levels ecological risk factors table 5 displays the results of four ecological parameters namely the contamination factor cf the ecological risk factor eri the contamination degree cd and the potential ecological risk index ri which were calculated in order to assess the environmental ecological risk posed by metals contamination the cf revealed that in general sediment samples were considerably contaminated 3 cf 6 or very highly contaminated 6 cf by co cu zn as cd pb and hg all samples showed low contamination cf 1 or moderate contamination 1 cf 3 by cr and only sediments from mura river contained low contamination by pb and hg using the cd values all samples were very highly contaminated 32 cd calculations of eri indicated that all sediment samples displayed low ecological risk for cr zn and pb eri 40 while only sediment from mura river indicated low or moderate ecological risk for hg as and cd 40 eri 80 in general all samples were of high 160 eri 320 or very high eri 320 ecological risk for co cu as cd and hg for the overarching ri parameter which takes into account synergistic effects of pollutants better all samples showed very high ecological risk or serious ecological pollution level ri 600 globally these parameters indicated that mining activities have impacted negatively the environment in the catchment areas of kimpulande and mura rivers and aquatic ecosystems therein are at risk furthermore the riverine populations are thus extremely exposed to heavy metals contamination when using the mura and kimpulande water for domestic needs and consuming aquatic biota correlation between parameters the spearman s rank order correlation results for the parameters analyzed in the water samples are shown in table 6 a a strong positive correlation p 0 05 was observed between the ph and the metals sc co ni cu zn as cd sn sb and hg while a negative correlation was observed between the temperature t and sc cr co ni cu zn as cd sn and sb the intercorrelation observed above suggest that the ph and t are important factors that impact the transportation of metals positively and negatively respectively a positive correlation indicated in bold in table 6a was observed among some metals suggesting that they may have originated from the same sources and with a similar transport route which could be the mining discharges atibu et al 2017 2016 in contrast hg did not show significant correlations with any parameters potentially indicating another origin than mining discharges and different environmental pathways table 6b displays the spearman s rank order correlation among parameters analyzed in sediments samples a strong and positive correlation was found between mean grain size and the heavy metals ti co as cd sn sb pb and hg suggesting that the mean grain size has a positive impact on the mobility of heavy metals from their source to the receiving systems and their accumulation in sediments pca results confirmed that parameters such as sb pb as sn hg co cd zn and grain size were positively and strongly correlated p 0 01 fig 3 a while a negative correlation was observed between these parameters and cr and ni concentrations p 0 01 furthermore the pca results for physical chemical parameters such as the t ph and heavy metals concentration in water samples fig 3b confirm that there is a significant correlation among hg ph and all other heavy metals while t is negatively correlated with almost all other parameters parameters like cd as sb co ph zn cu ni and sc were positively and strongly correlated p 0 01 conclusions the concentrations and distribution of heavy metals were investigated in water and sediment samples from kimpulande and mura rivers which receive discharges from major mining activities heavy metal concentrations in river water were generally high compared with the drc legislation on the requirements for mine wastewater rejection concentrations of ni cu zn as cd and hg in river water samples were higher than the low risk values while as cd and hg concentrations were even higher than the high risk values in both kimpulande and mura rivers these results indicated in a clear manner that despite dilution of mine effluent discharges in river waters the metal concentrations in river water were still higher than permitted in effluent discharges therefore the direct use of river water as drinking water for riverine populations may pose a public health hazard large variability was observed in the concentrations of sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb pb and hg in sediments from these river basins cu cr zn as cd pb and hg were present in high concentration in sediments exceeding limit values set by the sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life furthermore the igeo and ef parameter values revealed an extremely severe enrichment of cu co and as and an extreme contamination of river sediments with cu and co accumulation of metals in sediments confirmed the chronic release of abnormally high concentrations of metals in mine effluent discharges into the rivers and impaired ecological conditions spearman test and pca results generally confirmed strong positive association among metal concentrations between metal concentrations and finer sediment particle grain sizes and between metal concentrations and water ph they indicated also that hg might come from a different source and actually it comes from hg use in artisanal gold mining the ecological risk factors determined namely cf cd eri and especially the ri revealed a very high ecological risk to freshwater ecosystems originated by metals in mine water discharges the levels of contamination found in rivers kimpulande and mura represent an ecological risk and a threat to human health and are a consequence of non adequate and unsustainable mining practices results show that there is an urgent need to improve mining and milling practices in this region and to adopt good mining practices in order to protect the environment and public

demonstrating high contamination of these rivers the results from calculated ecologic risk factors revealed that aquatic ecosystems in the investigated rivers are at risk therefore a review of current mining practices is needed and the urgent enforcement of good practices is recommended in order to protect the environment and public health keywords mining copper cobalt pollution ecological risk factor introduction the pollution of rivers lakes groundwater and coastal areas by toxic chemicals such as heavy metals rare earths radioactive elements petroleum hydrocarbons and agrochemicals is a major environmental problem in several regions of the world and a major threat to the quality of freshwater resources and to the public health atibu et al 2021 thevenon et al 2012 pourret et al 2016 cheyns et al 2014 carvalho 2017a 2017b in particular past and current mining activities both industrial and artisanal very often affect the surrounding environment and contribute to the pollution of aquatic environments carvalho 2017b carvalho et al 2017 the mining activity exposes rocks and metal ores to the oxidizing conditions of both air and water thus causing a drop in the water ph which drastically increases the solubility of heavy metals and their environmental mobility nordstrom et al 2000 concentrations of heavy metals in water bodies can thus increase and exceed safe levels for aquatic biota and drinking water safety standards singh et al 2022 in the provinces of the eastern democratic republic of the congo drc particularly those of former katanga and kivu regions the rivers sediments soils and atmosphere are impacted by the discharge of polluted effluents from mining and milling facilities aerosol particles enriched in heavy metals can be extremely threatening to fauna flora and human health banza et al 2009 discharge of solid and liquid effluents from mining and milling operations into watercourses constitute also a chemical hazard and may exert toxic effects on the aquatic fauna and flora furthermore the discharged contaminants may be transferred through several environmental pathways to humans impinging on public health pardos et al 2004 in these areas of drc since local populations use river water for domestic needs they are likely to ingest and accumulate toxic metals in their bodies from contaminated drinking water and through consumption of aquatic organisms such as fish molluscs and aquatic plants miller et al 2004 some studies concerning the distribution and concentration of heavy metals metals exposure and human health condition in mining regions of the former katanga province lubumbashi kolwezi kipushi likasi etc were carried out recently atibu et al 2021 2017 2016 2013 banza et al 2009 however there was no information on the impact of mining activities on the distribution and concentration of heavy metals in the water column and in the riverbed sediments of the mura and kimpulande rivers haut katanga region this work aimed at determining the concentration of metals in sediments and water from mura and kimpulande rivers by the town of likasi haut katanga region in order to assess the impact of mining activities and ecotoxicological risks posed by metal contaminants materials and methods sampling site description soils and sediments were sampled along the mura and kimpulande rivers near the likasi town in the province of haut katanga fig 1 these two rivers were chosen because they surround the kipese polymetallic ore deposit located in tantara mining polygon at 37 km south west of likasi and at 7 km west of the shinkolobwe uranium mine and where copper cobalt and gold mining are carried out the mura river is well known for the waste spill of several tons of radioactive ores from shinkolobwe uranium mine that occurred in late 2007 and contaminated the river catchment area wnn 2007 sediment particle grain size measurement aliquots of approximately 1 g from fresh sediment samples were used for grain size determination after 5 min ultrasonic sediment dispersal in deionized water the particle grain size was measured using a laser coulter ls 100 diffractometer beckman coulter fullerton ca usa and the percentages of clay silt and sand were determined potÃ© et al 2008 the clay particles have a diameter 2 Î¼m the silt particles have diameters ranging from 2 to 63 Î¼m while the size of the sand particles ranges from 63 Î¼m to 2 mm blott and pye 2001 water and sediment sample treatment from each acidified river water sample 10 ml were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters millex lcr millipore to remove suspended particulate matter before analysis specific sample dilutions were made depending on the metals to be analysed sediment samples were air dried at ambient room temperature and sieved using 63 Î¼m mesh size sieve before being analyzed the digestion of sediments was performed according to the protocol described by pardos et al 2004 and potÃ© et al 2008 in short an accurately weighted aliquot with approximately 1 g of sieved sediment was digested using analytical grade 2 m hno3 and heating to 150 c in teflon bombs the digestion was followed by different dilution with 1 ultrapure hno3 heavy metal analysis of water and sediment samples by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x series icp ms developed for complex matrix analysis was used for heavy metals analysis to avoid spectral interferences that could bias the results a collision reaction cell helium mode and interference equations were used for calibration multi element standard solutions with different concentrations 0 0 02 1 5 20 100 and 200 Î¼g l 1 were used potÃ© et al 2008 thevenon et al 2013 in order to verify the sensitivity of the device and the reliability of the results the certified reference materials tmda 70 and lksd4 lgc standards uk were used for water and sediments analysis respectively standard deviations of the mean of 3 replicate measurements were below 10 and chemical blanks for the procedure were 2 of the sample signal the results are expressed in ppm mg l 1 and mg kg 1 dry weight for water and sediment samples respectively mercury analysis in sediment samples the total mercury thg in sediment samples was analysed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas specific for mercury determination advanced mercury analyser ama 254 altecs r l czech rep following the method described by roos barraclough et al 2002 this method is based on the combustion of the sediment sample for amalgamation of mercury in a gold trap and the measurement of the gaseous mercury by aas the limit of detection 3 sd of the blank was 0 005 mg kg 1 and the reproducibility was better than 5 the hg concentrations are expressed in ppm mg kg 1 of sediment dry weight mercury analysis in water samples the measurement of total mercury thg content in river water samples was carried out using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cvafs merx model iii brooks rand usa following sample preparation techniques as described by gallorini and loizeau 2022 the procedure is similar to that of epa 1631 us epa 2002 in brief 100 ml of water sample pre acidified with 0 5 ml of hno3 was weighed and 0 5 ml of 20 sncl2 was then added to reduce hg ii to the volatile hg 0 to remove oxygen the sample was purged with argon for 20 min at a flow rate of 350 ml min 1 while the gold trap was purged with argon at a flow rate of 60 ml min 1 for 5 min thg in treated samples was then measured by cvafs the limit of detection calculated as 3 times the standard deviation of blank samples was 0 20 ng l degrees of soil and sediment contamination the degree of soil and sediment contamination was assessed through the calculation of the enrichment factor ef and of the geoaccumulation index igeo as described by maanan et al 2004 the ef was calculated using the following equation ef metal sc sample metal sc background where metal is the concentration of any heavy metal in analyzed samples and in the geochemical background and sc is the concentration of scandium in analyzed samples and in the geochemical background therefore the ef is a geochemical normalization performed using scandium sc as a reference element the upper continental crust ucc average values were used as background values for metals as described by mclennan 2001 the geoaccumulation index igeo was calculated according the following equation igeo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the concentration of the metal n in the sediment samples bn is the concentration of the metal n in the geochemical background and 1 5 is the lithospheric effect background correlation matrix factor lundemi et al 2022 atibu et al 2016 2017 ecological risk indices to evaluate the ecological risk posed by metal contaminants four parameters were determined the contamination factor the contamination degree the ecological risk index and the potential ecological risk index akanchise et al 2020 aja et al 2021 lundemi et al 2022 the contamination factor cf was calculated to quantify the contamination level of heavy metals in sediment samples using the following relation cf c n b n where c n and b n are respectively the heavy metal concentration in sediment and the geochemical background concentration of the metal n hÃ¥kanson 1980 fÃ¶rstner et al 1989 the contamination degree cd of the sediment sample facilitates the evaluation of the polymetallic contamination level it has been calculated with the following formula cd cf i where cf i represents the contamination factor of a specific heavy metal i hÃ¥kanson 1980 eight heavy metals namely hg cd as co cu pb cr and zn were considered in the cd calculation the heavy metals harmful impact on the environment and on the human population was assessed using the ecological risk index eri this ecological risk index is a comprehensive index that takes into account both the ecological sensitivity and the toxicity of the heavy metal hÃ¥kanson 1980 suresh et al 2012 eri was determined by the following formula eri tr i cf i where cf i is the contamination factor of the heavy metal i as defined above and tr i represents the toxic response factor or the biological toxic factor for a given heavy metal tr i values used were 40 30 10 5 5 5 2 and 1 for hg cd as co cu pb cr and zn respectively according to hÃ¥kanson 1980 the summing of ecological risk index eri for several metals is the potential ecological risk index ri ri was computed using the following formula ri eri ri was used to evaluate the potential ecological risk from the polymetallic contamination of river sediments the ri accounts for the synergy of metal concentration toxic level and ecological sensitivity of various biological communities to heavy metals and it is an overarching indicator for the ecological risks threatening the ecosystem singh et al 2002 data analysis triplicate measurements were performed on water and sediment samples for all analytes statistical treatment of data spearman rank order correlation has been realized using sigmastat 11 0 systat software inc usa a multivariate statistical analysis named principal component analysis pca was performed using r software r core team 2015 in order to understand the relationship between analyzed compounds their potential sources and transfer pathways data were centered prior to perform pca analysis to maximize the dispersion results and discussion particle grain size of sediment samples the grain size composition clay silt and sand of sediment samples is shown in the table 1 the proportions of clay silt and sand varied significantly among sediment samples in general the silt percentage remained the highest in almost all samples except for the sample skip3 and skip4 where the percentage of sand was higher the clay content was the lowest in samples from the kimpulande river while the silt content was the highest followed by clay and the sand fraction was less abundant in mura river these features in sediment composition are depicted in fig 2 in the sediment samples from kimpulande river the percentages of silt clay and sand varied from 1 18 to 2 25 from 25 60 to 68 16 and from 29 61 to 73 20 respectively in the mura river sediment samples the clay silt and sand percent contributions varied from 18 53 to 27 50 from 69 30 to 72 36 and from 0 14 to 11 41 respectively the mean grain size remained below 63 Âµm for all the sampling sites except for the skip3 site 63 62 Âµm and skip4 site 90 09 Âµm according to blott and pie 2001 when the mean grain size is between 2 mm and 63 Âµm the sample contains mainly sand while when the mean size is between 63 Âµm and 2 Âµm the silt is predominant concentration of heavy metals in water samples the heavy metals concentrations for sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb and hg in filtered water samples are reported in table 2 these concentration values varied significantly among sampling sites and ranged from 0 0 to 3 5 mg l 1 for cr from 65 2 to 982 2 mg l 1 for ni from 33 4 to 81 438 5 mg l 1 for cu from 160 6 to 10 061 mg l 1 for zn from 3 5 to 10 2 mg l 1 for as from 0 4 to 69 3 mg l 1 for cd from 0 4 to 2 3 mg l 1 for hg the levels of ni cu zn as cd and hg in the water samples were clearly above the low risk values established as a limit in the drc legislation on the requirements for mining effluent releases decree no 38 2013 furthermore in general the concentration levels of as cd and hg in water samples exceeded the high risk values established in the drc legislation and indicated in table 2 decree no 38 2013 concentrations of as cd and hg in river water attained values that were respectively 2 138 and 23 fold higher than the high risk values set in the legislation these results for metal concentrations in water from mura and kimpulande rivers are of the same order of magnitude of those determined in the luilu and musonoie rivers located in the same region of katanga for instance the concentrations in these two rivers ranged from 0 1 to 3 163 8 mg l 1 and from 0 3 to 5 917 5 mg l 1 for co and cu respectively and exceeded also the legal limits atibu et al 2013 concentration of heavy metals in sediment samples the concentrations of heavy metals in sediment samples are shown in table 3 results show a strong variation in the concentrations of sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb pb and hg among sampling stations remarkably high concentrations of cu and co were observed at all sites while most of the sites exhibited a low concentration of sn sb and hg sediments from kimpulande river exhibited the highest concentrations of ti 160 2 mg kg 1 co 2 760 mg kg 1 zn 282 6 mg kg 1 as 69 2 mg kg 1 and cd 3 3 mg kg 1 while the samples from mura river showed the highest concentrations of sc 8 3 mg kg 1 cr 81 3 mg kg 1 ni 98 1 mg kg 1 cu 9 975 mg kg 1 pb 86 1 mg kg 1 and hg 0 8 mg kg 1 these sediments from kimpulande and mura rivers displayed co and cu concentration levels similar to results from previous studies that reported high co and cu concentrations in samples from musonoie luilu dilala mpingiri lubumbashi rivers and from the tshamilemba canal in the same katanga region atibu et al 2017 2016 2013 for example co and cu concentrations in sediments from dilala and lubumbashi rivers were reported up to 21 134 mg kg 1 and 40 807 mg kg 1 and up to 2 043 mg kg 1 and 24 093 mg kg 1 respectively atibu et al 2016 2017 these concentrations are comparable to those reported herein for kimpulande and mura rivers metal concentrations in the rivers of this region in particular for cu and co are several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations usually reported in river sediments elsewhere e g dendievel et al 2022 sojka and jaskuÅa 2022 the katanga region as part of the africa copperbelt is known for a generally high natural background level of co and cu among other metals narendrula et al 2012 pourret et al 2016 this elevated background was taken in account in the igeo parameters utilized above and the concentrations of co and cu in river sediment samples were clearly enhanced above the regional background by the discharges of mining effluents originated from the many metal mines in the region the values of cu in samples table 3 were 35 280 times higher than the recommended values set by the sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life sqgs ccme epc 98e 1999 some other metals such as cr zn as cd pb and hg were also present in non negligible concentrations in the sediment samples with concentration values amounting to 1 to 12 fold higher than sqgs therefore these elevated metal concentrations in sediments represent a hazard to aquatic biota regarding the concentration of heavy metals in the studied sites cu co as and hg were the highest and most widespread among heavy metals analyzed those heavy metals are also among the most hazardous for human and environment health atsdr 2007 in particular the very high concentrations of cu exceeded also the probable effect level pel and therefore they are likely to induce adverse biological impacts on aquatic life in all sampling sites table 3 the as and hg values in sediments from kimpulande river exceeded the pel also table 3 it must be noted that the as and hg have been frequently associated with adverse biological effects observed in aquatic biota niane et al 2019 potÃ© et al 2008 in summary these results highlight a strong environmental contamination in the study area the enhanced concentration of these heavy metals in river water and sediments represent a significant source of toxic metals for the aquatic organisms and a threat for the health of the human riverine communities of the studied region cheyns et al 2014 squadrone et al 2016 assessment of soil and sediment contamination table 4 displays the enrichment factor ef and geoaccumulation index igeo values for selected heavy metals in sediment samples from kimpulande and mura rivers these parameters were used as a quantitative criteria to classify the levels of heavy metal pollution against a ranking contamination scale and to help identifying the natural or anthropogenic metal sources see table 4 adamo et al 2005 thevenon et al 2012 the highest ef values of co and cu for all sampling sites and of as for kimpulande river sites were above 50 corresponding to a classification of extremely severe enrichment sakan et al 2009 a minor enrichment degree was displayed by all mura river samples for pb and hg by all kimpulande river samples for ni by skip1 and skip4 samples for cr and by smr1 and smr2 samples for zn variable enrichment levels depending on sampling sites and ranging from moderate enrichment to extremely severe enrichment were found for cr ni zn cd pb and hg based on the igeo values all samples ranked as extremely polluted with cu while kimpulande river samples were extremely polluted with co samples from mura river ranked from heavily polluted smr3 to heavily to extremely polluted with co smr1 smr2 and smr4 all samples were practically unpolluted regarding cr kimpulande river samples were practically unpolluted with ni mura river samples were practically unpolluted with both pb and hg other samples were classified from unpolluted to moderately polluted class 1 to heavily to extremely polluted with ni zn as cd pb and hg several factors could explain the pollution levels observed including the geology of the region with high natural background levels of metals and metalloids key et al 2004 but human activities mining activities and especially mine effluent discharges into the rivers were the visible main source for such high pollution levels ecological risk factors table 5 displays the results of four ecological parameters namely the contamination factor cf the ecological risk factor eri the contamination degree cd and the potential ecological risk index ri which were calculated in order to assess the environmental ecological risk posed by metals contamination the cf revealed that in general sediment samples were considerably contaminated 3 cf 6 or very highly contaminated 6 cf by co cu zn as cd pb and hg all samples showed low contamination cf 1 or moderate contamination 1 cf 3 by cr and only sediments from mura river contained low contamination by pb and hg using the cd values all samples were very highly contaminated 32 cd calculations of eri indicated that all sediment samples displayed low ecological risk for cr zn and pb eri 40 while only sediment from mura river indicated low or moderate ecological risk for hg as and cd 40 eri 80 in general all samples were of high 160 eri 320 or very high eri 320 ecological risk for co cu as cd and hg for the overarching ri parameter which takes into account synergistic effects of pollutants better all samples showed very high ecological risk or serious ecological pollution level ri 600 globally these parameters indicated that mining activities have impacted negatively the environment in the catchment areas of kimpulande and mura rivers and aquatic ecosystems therein are at risk furthermore the riverine populations are thus extremely exposed to heavy metals contamination when using the mura and kimpulande water for domestic needs and consuming aquatic biota correlation between parameters the spearman s rank order correlation results for the parameters analyzed in the water samples are shown in table 6 a a strong positive correlation p 0 05 was observed between the ph and the metals sc co ni cu zn as cd sn sb and hg while a negative correlation was observed between the temperature t and sc cr co ni cu zn as cd sn and sb the intercorrelation observed above suggest that the ph and t are important factors that impact the transportation of metals positively and negatively respectively a positive correlation indicated in bold in table 6a was observed among some metals suggesting that they may have originated from the same sources and with a similar transport route which could be the mining discharges atibu et al 2017 2016 in contrast hg did not show significant correlations with any parameters potentially indicating another origin than mining discharges and different environmental pathways table 6b displays the spearman s rank order correlation among parameters analyzed in sediments samples a strong and positive correlation was found between mean grain size and the heavy metals ti co as cd sn sb pb and hg suggesting that the mean grain size has a positive impact on the mobility of heavy metals from their source to the receiving systems and their accumulation in sediments pca results confirmed that parameters such as sb pb as sn hg co cd zn and grain size were positively and strongly correlated p 0 01 fig 3 a while a negative correlation was observed between these parameters and cr and ni concentrations p 0 01 furthermore the pca results for physical chemical parameters such as the t ph and heavy metals concentration in water samples fig 3b confirm that there is a significant correlation among hg ph and all other heavy metals while t is negatively correlated with almost all other parameters parameters like cd as sb co ph zn cu ni and sc were positively and strongly correlated p 0 01 conclusions the concentrations and distribution of heavy metals were investigated in water and sediment samples from kimpulande and mura rivers which receive discharges from major mining activities heavy metal concentrations in river water were generally high compared with the drc legislation on the requirements for mine wastewater rejection concentrations of ni cu zn as cd and hg in river water samples were higher than the low risk values while as cd and hg concentrations were even higher than the high risk values in both kimpulande and mura rivers these results indicated in a clear manner that despite dilution of mine effluent discharges in river waters the metal concentrations in river water were still higher than permitted in effluent discharges therefore the direct use of river water as drinking water for riverine populations may pose a public health hazard large variability was observed in the concentrations of sc ti cr co ni cu zn as cd sn sb pb and hg in sediments from these river basins cu cr zn as cd pb and hg were present in high concentration in sediments exceeding limit values set by the sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life furthermore the igeo and ef parameter values revealed an extremely severe enrichment of cu co and as and an extreme contamination of river sediments with cu and co accumulation of metals in sediments confirmed the chronic release of abnormally high concentrations of metals in mine effluent discharges into the rivers and impaired ecological conditions spearman test and pca results generally confirmed strong positive association among metal concentrations between metal concentrations and finer sediment particle grain sizes and between metal concentrations and water ph they indicated also that hg might come from a different source and actually it comes from hg use in artisanal gold mining the ecological risk factors determined namely cf cd eri and especially the ri revealed a very high ecological risk to freshwater ecosystems originated by metals in mine water discharges the levels of contamination found in rivers kimpulande and mura represent an ecological risk and a threat to human health and are a consequence of non adequate and unsustainable mining practices results show that there is an urgent need to improve mining and milling practices in this region and to adopt good mining practices in order to protect the environment and public health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in

20064,wetland changes are very serious ecosystem problems which stem from unrestrained human and environmental actions despite significant attention in environmental management research the means to tackle wetland changes are still gaining momentum in science and research within developing countries with the increasing availability of remote sensing data and flexible solutions finding the right solution to wetland changes becomes a key research and policy agenda herein we assessed the wetland change prediction of ogun river or basin nigeria during 1999 2009 and 2019 by analyzing land cover change lcc images using cellular automata markov ca markov chain and remote sensing rs techniques the acquired shuttle radar topographic mapper and landsat remotely sensed data were applied to create thematic maps of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference salinity index ndsi and digital elevation model dem of the study area the ca markov required the supervised classification of the land cover maps of 1999 2009 and 2019 the results of the elevation ndvi and ndsi revealed the qualitative differences in the study area the lcc analysis indicated that farmlands and built up areas increased by 54 56 and 33 21 respectively however waterbodies wetlands and vegetation decreased by 0 42 3 53 and 8 28 respectively these findings agree with the ca markov with an accuracy exceeding 70 and thus predict the wetland changes for the year 2030 the major attributions to wetland cover variations in the study area are built up encroachment with extensive spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural activities this study through its findings provides relevant guidelines and information on wetland changes required by stakeholders for environmental policy planning and

lifeline for improving the quality of life by enriching the natural habitat promoting natural water levels and providing cultural and economic benefits such as natural resources supply food production and recreational opportunities epa 2018 despite their importance a large proportion of wetlands about 32 million hectares by global estimates are affected by runoff logging air and water pollution leading to geomorphological changes isidoro and grattan 2011 orimoloye et al 2020 wetland changes affect water quality by altering sediment chemical loads and the watershed hence information on land cover change lcc is indispensable in wetland change prediction basnyat et al 1999 arowolo et al 2018 moreover the primary drivers of wetland change are environmental and human induced activities through alteration of soil parent materials modification of lcc deterioration of stream water quality and the loss of biodiversity wulf et al 2015 according to ibrahim 2016 approximately 58 of wetlands are affected worldwide through climate change in sub saharan africa steep anthropogenic activities and natural environmental processes cause nearly 9 of wetland changes eldeiry and garcia 2010 as a result understanding the potential for wetland changes is still very important in developing countries such as nigeria wulf et al 2015 rapid population growth increases the need to investigate wetlands previously the conventional approach was largely employed but the high cost of field surveys or aerial photograph interpretation paves the way for a more convenient approach spies and woodgate 2005 remote sensing rs which is increasingly being used to study wetland changes abdelfattah and shahid 2009 comes from the understanding that satellites can provide repetitive and stereoscopic coverage of the earth and offer image interpretation using theories related to how earth features respond to electromagnetic signals nowadays many studies are now leveraging technological advances and flexible solutions to transition towards the use of cost effective satellite imagery such as landsat zhang et al 2015 to monitor wetland changes osunmadewa et al 2018 therefore given their cost effectiveness and technological robustness rs techniques have been used in collaboration with geographic information system gis to characterize wetland areas and analyze their lcc rao et al

nigeria moreover little or few research has assessed and predicted wetland changes using soil types digital elevation model dem normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference salinity index ndsi through cellular automata markov chain ca markov and rs techniques importantly wetlands are faced with salinity intrusion and vegetation cover loss especially in a spatial environment of today tobore et al 2021 dehni and lounis 2012 to mitigate salinity intrusion and vegetation cover loss in an areas with gradual to sudden population growth like nigeria requires simple and accurate rs indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference salinity index ndsi noroozi et al 2012 dasgupta etal 2015 according to existing studies rs products based on the spectral signatures single or multi band provides evidence that more than half of the wetland locations worldwide are threaten by anthropogenic activities especially for countries where gradual to sudden climate associated changes zhang et al 2015 for instance the single band method utilizes a subjective threshold value while the multi band can be used to delineate wetlands by analyzing the spectral signature difference between land cover classes zhang et al 2015 in fact spectral signatures such as ndvi and ndsi have gained popularity among researchers and offers simple timely and accurate results in mapping wetland changes at low cost nguyen et al 2020 at present information about land cover change is very important to detect and understand the management of wetland changes bevington et al 2022 nguyen et al 2020 using a ca markov chain technique wu et al 2010 the markov chain models helped to quantitatively predict the dynamic of land cover

integration of a ca markov model with predictor variables ndvi ndsi and topographic information has advantages such as providing a highly efficient dynamic simulation and the ability to predict complex land cover patterns wu et al 2010 additionally the ca markov model serves as a bottom up approach system which accommodates both human induced activities and biophysical landscape prediction hyandye and martz 2017 wetland change prediction is significant for the study of land degradation resulting from unfavorable human activities such as illegal felling of trees uncontrolled grazing and overuse of fertilizers or pesticides and environmental processes barbouchi et al 2015 consequently the shocks of climate change can be linked to wetland changes in countries like nigeria etc tobore et al 2021 extant research in agriculture planning and the environment indicates that the ca markov model and spectral indices ndvi and ndsi have been amply applied in developed countries to predict wetlands changes zhang et al 2015 szatmÃ¡ri et al 2020 sahbeni 2021a this is not the case in developing countries particularly nigeria the focus of this study hence this study aims to integrate both

worldwide isidoro and grattan 2011 szatmÃ¡ri et al 2020 in the study landsat images of 2019 were used to assess the ndvi and ndsi of the area ndvi and ndsi variables were used to create enhanced images for vegetation cover and salinity intrusion in the study due to their ability to intensify changes and high correlation with electrical conductivity goovaerts 1999 dehni and lounis 2012 azabdaftari 2015 the ndvi serves as a fractional numerical indicator to absorbed the active photosynthetic radiation of vegetation cover in specific area or region breunig et al 2010 however ndsi remains a significant technique that can be used to mitigate food insecurity by monitoring the inducing slower growth of agricultural lossess such as premature leaf senescence and tillering etc schmÃ¶ckel and jarvis 2017 szatmÃ¡ri et al 2020 hence the ndvi and ndsi of the area was assessed using the arcgis 10 version software ndv i nir red nir red and ndsi red nir green nir rouse et al 1974 dehni and lounis 2012 the ndvi and ndsi of the area were described through the song and ma 2007 and widad et al 2018 vegetation cover and salinity intrusion classes model analysis for predictor variables wetlands changes have resulted in limiting agricultural land use patterns leading to the stressed of vegetation cover and indirect sign of salinity intrusion in an area elhag 2016 the present study utilized the spatial integrated model of salinization which consists of soil texture elevation and the vegetation cover density the model was assessed using equation 1 and subjected to tables 2 and 3 for vegetation and salinity intrusion classes 1 salinity i 1 e z where 117 soil texture 0 22 elevation 0 16 vegetation density 0 012 wetland mapping and analysis the natural color composite ncc of the area was generated using the acquired multi temporal landsat images for better visibility in the study geospatial analysis was performed in an open source gis environment through quantum geographic information system qgis 3 18 3 version software the qgis was used to produce the image color composite based on spectral signatures the spectral signatures red green and blue r g b representing bands 4 3 2 of landsat 7 etm images and bands 5 4 3 of landsat 8 oli were used as ncc of the study area good and giordano 2019 the land cover classes were coded as feature class id with the help of google earth image which was a group of region of interest roi with multiple class ids the identified roi through the google earth image helped classify spectral pixels that have specific signatures hoque et al 2020 and offered higher accuracy of the land cover classes of the area for 100 random google earth sampling training data the scheme identified five roi farmland rainfed cropping planted cropping areas and bare soils vegetation dense sparse forest and grass built up residential commercial industrial and services wetlands marshes and swamps and waterbodies rivers and streams the information on the number of pixels and class separability for each of the identified roi is shown in the table 4 thereafter the supervised technique was used to classify the images anderson et al 1976 through a semi automated random forest classification algorithm by selecting the pixels of each roi using the installed grass plugin in qgis the random forest classification algorithm was applied due to its higher accurate pixel allocation strenght in a remotely sensed image congedo 2017 further semi automated random forest classification algorithm are proven to be more superior than unsupervised classification technique islam et al 2016 akber et al 2018 hoque et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 afterwards post processing tool operation through editing was carried out to recover and revalidate the misclassification pixel cells predictor variables assessment despite decades of research only very little has been done in nigeria and many developing countries on wetland assessment using ndvi and ndsi predictor variables across broad regional scales lobell et al 2010 so the present study utilized the ndvi ndsi and land cover of the years 1999 2009 and 2019 integrated into the development of the cellular automata markov ca markov model to predict the future wetland scenario of the area the cellular automata ca analysis is a bottom up dynamic model approach with a time and space discrete spatio temporal calculation while markov chain utilized the random process to determine the transition probability between the initial and final states among land use categories mishra and rai 2016 the ndvi and ndsi layers of the area were used as environmental variables to assess the loss or increase in vegetated and salinity intrusion of the study area this operation were performed in the arc gis10 x ca markov chain and the algorithm in the idrisi package using a three step technique suggested by bashir and board 2007 first the transition probability matrics and the transition area matrics are generated through markov chain analysis of a set of land cover maps which are mainly classified from the acquired landsat images second a set of transition potential maps are generated from the ndvi and ndsi as driving variables of the land cover third based on the land cover transition rules specified in the transition potential maps a multi criteria objective land allocation procedure is then used to allocate the land cover change areas that are specified in the transition area matrics into the to be simulated wetland land cover map balogun and ishola 2017 the ca markov chain model was utilized due to its better proximity and higher prediction accuracy of landscape patterns at both temporal and spatial dimensions balogun and ishola 2017 the maximum iteration and neighborhood of 3 by 3 random cells sampling method was applied the ca markov described by ma et al 2012 was used to assess the predicted wetland changes through equations 5 and 6 5 st p i j s t where s denotes the salinity changes t 1 denotes the time point 6 p ij p 11 p 1 p 1 p 11 p 11 p 11 p ij represent the state transition probability matrics wetland validation and accuracy validation is the process of generating a set of points from the classified image by the ground truth data from the original maps liu 2005 the ca markov model was validated to predict the classified land cover maps for 1999 2009 and 2019 which is compared to the estimated land cover map of the same year from google earth image 100 randomly selected points were coded as farmland vegetation built up wetland and water bodies to determine the kappa coefficient the kappa k parameters obtained in the idrisi selva software environment were used for a cell by cell location using the created database the producer s and user s accuracy which were derived from the error confusion matrix as discussed by liu et al 2007 and congalton and green 2009 were also applied to assess the accuracy the model acceptance and validation were used in predicting the wetland changes for the year 2030 kappa parameters are tests used to measure the accuracy between predefined producer and user assigned ratings pontius and millones 2011 the kappa test can be expressed in the formula 7 k p a p e 1 p e the p a is the number of time the k raster agree p e is the number of times the k raster is expected to agree only by chance the workflow of this study is shown below results and discussion satellite based wetland assessment landsat images of 2019 were used to detect reflectance differences between the vegetated and salinity areas the spatial variation of the ndvi and ndsi displays the magnitude for mapping and predicting wetland changes in the study area the results obtained show that the present study possesses slightly saline soils and severe vegetation cover loss fig 4 ndvi and ndsi maps revealed that spectral indices using landsat images are the commonly used technique to identify wetland changes iqbal 2010 mo et al 2017 feilhauer et al 2018 according to isidoro and grattan 2011 wetland salinization and vegetation cover loss have significant effects on both agricultural productivity and ecosystem quality worldwide ndvi and ndsi map coupled with the digital elevation model serves as indicators for future trends in mapping wetland changes due to their ability to retrieve and update vegetation cover and salinity intrusion inventories geerken et al 2005 tajgardan et al 2007 eldeiry and garcia 2010 bouaziz et al 2011 noroozi et al 2012 zewdu et al 2016 although the thermal infrared band used in this study provides more reflectance in salt affected areas than other bands iqbal 2010 khanna et al 2018 these findings also confirm the agreements of metternicht and zinck 1997 and abdul qadir and benni 2010 that salt affected areas and vegetation cover loss results from spectral reflectance properties which can be used to study combined effects of wetland changes furthermore geerken et al 2005 pinpointed that spectral signatures of photosynthetically and non photosynthetically active vegetation cover showed obvious differences in predicting wetland changes according to iqbal 2010 and shapiro et al 2016 spectral signatures through covariates variables such as ndvi and ndsi make it simple and accurate to assess vegetation and salinity changes at less time van beijma et al 2014 tepanosyan et al 2021 the use of the ndvi map in this study helped to characterize absorptive and reflective features of vegetative areas which holds considerable promise in detecting multi temporal and phenological dynamics in mapping wetland changes furthermore tassopoulou et al 2019 opined that ndvi remains the most important index for vegetation cover change detection especially areas with spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural activities according to he et al 2006 vegetation monitoring using ndvi presents valuable information for a better understanding of man made and natural wetland environments furthermore xiao et al 2004 and tobore et al 2019 identified that mapping and classifying vegetation cover using ndvi serves as an important task in monitoring wetlands changes due to its higher accuracy efficiency this finding is similar to the result of xavier et al 2005 which showed that ndvi remains one of the commonly used indices for mapping vegetation cover changes this results was also identical to those of previous studies for example tobore et al 2021 and akintuyi et al 2021 in the same region also inappropriate land use and land cover change affects wetland changes alabi et al 2021 especially under a changing climatic conditions such as sub saharan africa oyerinde et al 2022 besides nigeria s vegetation cover is faced with anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and extensive bush burning etc oyerinde et al 2015 therefore the loss of vegetative cover in the present study area could be attributed to these drivers of change moreover aguilara et al 2012 also highlighted that ndvi can be used to distinguish between non vegetated cover from natural landscape patterns nevertheless a growing number of studies have examined a wide variety of vegetative phenomena by using remotely sensed data in mapping and monitoring wetland changes duchemin et al 1999 nerry et al 1998 tobore et al 2019 the result of the ndsi map shows that the study area possesses slight salinity intrusion the slight salinity intrusion may be traced to heavy metal deposition close vicinity to dumpsites and discharge sites of industrial waste to surrounding rivers and streams according to obiora et al 2016 nigeria s soils and environment are faced with heavy metal e g al hg zn and fe deposition although pajak et al 2015 suggested that leaching from a drainage or irrigation channel network could result in land salinization in addition mazurek et al 2017 reaffirm that the distribution and presence of salinity intrusion on the landscape depended on human activities and the existing vegetation cover the superiority of the ndsi map in the study of wetland changes can help to monitor and predict the physiological drought which is apparent to a shortage of water when a plant is growing in moist saline soil or solution iqbal 2010 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 nguyen et al 2018 sahbeni 2021b although gain etal 2012 discovered that salinity intrusion most commonly occurred within wetlands compared to inland areas due to environmental and anthropogenic activities furthermore tobore et al 2021 opined that developing countries like nigeria commonly referred wetlands area s as wastelands and the deleterious consequence can cause food shortages and potential risk to human health such as cancer high blood pressure and skin diseases mah muduzzaman etal 2014 nkwunonwo et al 2020 ndvi and ndsi indices have helped to show the importance and significant relationship in the detection and monitoring of wetland changes allbed and kumar 2013 the present results also match with the outcomes of mondal and southworth 2010 that wetland change predictions are better correlated through the sensitivity of spectral satellite indices like ndvi and ndsi mah muduzzaman etal 2014 mentioned that mapping wetland changes using landsat satellite images can be regarded as one of the most used spectral indices to identify the rate of vegetation cover loss and salinity intrusion additionally the spectral satellite indices like ndvi and ndsi were considered for vegetation and salinity detection as these indices have already been proven accurate and suitable for this purpose in previous studies dehm et al 2019 gain etal 2012 in nigeria the aggravated rising climatic changes and socioeconomic vulnerabilities to wetland changes exploring soil salinity intrusion and vegetation cover dynamics is very important to formulate wetland protection and sustainability for better implementation of environmental policies and planning jiang et al 2017 wetland changes from the year 1999 to 2030 wetland and land cover changes have significance for human wellbeing hasan et al 2020 ficken et al 2019 wulder et al 2018 therefore need exists for evaluating the spatial temporal changes particularly to protect the wetlands ecosystems in this study natural color composite ncc focusing on farmland vegetation built up wetlands and water bodies were employed to interpret the land cover change the markov chain transition probability matrics of the land cover changes from 1999 to 2019 were used to obtain the diagonal values of the area table 5 afterward the ca markov was used to predict the year 2030 wetland based on the classified images of 1999 2009 and 2019 fig 5 the table 6 records the temporal differences in the maps of fig 5 for the selected spanned 1999 2009 2019 2030 years fig 5 showed a trend that the area occupied with vegetation wetlands and water bodies decreased while farmlands and built up areas increased and thus covering 1625 18 ha ha based on the analyzed results the land cover in 1999 was in the following order 885 31 ha vegetation 370 71 ha wetlands 229 17 ha built up 130 34 ha farmlands and 9 65 ha water bodies also in 2009 vegetation remains the represented major land cover class covering around 35 96 of the study area the other land cover areas farmlands accounts for 27 83 built up 24 35 wetlands 10 32 and waterbodies 0 53 however the significant changes observed from the 2019 land cover map revealed that vegetation wetlands and water bodies decreased from 35 96 to 18 30 10 32 to 7 99 and 0 53 to 0 49 while farmlands and built up areas increased from 27 83 452 83 ha to 47 06 764 82 ha and 24 35 379 55 ha to 26 15 425 03 ha the decrease observed in 2019 land cover map i e vegetation wetlands and waterbodies translated to the increase in the built up areas and farmlands in year 2030 respectively table 6 the substantial decrease observed in vegetation wetlands and waterbodies in the area may be rooted to the temporal interaction between climate change biophysical and rapid uncontrolled human activities especially in the ever increasing population growth country like nigeria tobore et al 2021 ramsar 2018 tarnocai 2009 lambin et al 2001 the significant decrease in vegetative cover in the area also hinder wetlands ecosystem services food and raw material production thereby causing food insecurity adam 2009 na et al 2015 hoque et al 2020 therefore these gradual to sudden changes may be responsible for the increase predicted in farmlands and built up areas in the year 2030 table 7 although the inappropriate use of land cover in sub saharan africa has been identified as one of the primary drivers of wetland biodiversity loss bhuiyan and dutta 2012 apart from anthropogenic activities like uncontrolled population expansion and socio economic activity the gradual sea level rise or climate pressure posed a substantial challenge to wetland sustainability bhuiyan and dutta 2012 for instance soil salinity intrusion owing to sea level rise has affected over 63 percent of agricultural lands especially in sub saharan africa srdi 2010 the present findings is consistent with many other studies that wetlands changes affects the provision of soil formation hoque et al 2020 raw amenities huq et al 2019 and food production akber et al 2018 hasan et al 2020 in comparison to our results to wetlands areas especially in developing countries like nigeria reveals a decline in wetland ecosystem services values and functions wang et al 2006 li et al 2007 davidson et al 2018 the kappa coefficients of the land cover map were calculated and used to compare the accuracy of wetland prediction based on the land cover classes from 1999 to 2030 it was observed that the overall land cover classification accuracies were 81 29 79 01 81 07 and 79 08 after the prediction it was found that the cohen kappa statistics were 0 70 and thus show substantial classification agreement with the present study table 8 according to anderson 1976 to approve the reliability of the classified images the land cover map should clearly exceed the minimum acceptable standard of 70 as assigned by the usgs classification scheme conclusion the research evaluates the first results of work dedicated to assess wetland change prediction within nigeria s ogun river basin through the integration of ca markov and remote sensing techniques although this study has stirred the need to consolidate empirical research on wetland ecosystems in the study area the integration of the ca markov and remote sensing techniques has not only improved an understanding of the trends in land cover change but can be used as indicators for future trends in assessing and monitoring wetland changes wetland ecosystem services are useful to land resources and serve as a lifeline for improving the quality of life by enriching the natural habitat promoting natural water levels and providing cultural and economic benefits such as natural resources supply food production and recreational opportunities nevertheless study on wetland changes has received widespread attention in the environmental and earth resources management system through the sensitivity of the spectral variables the sequence of the model through soil texture digital elevation model ndvi and ndsi are significantly conducive to obtaining more satisfactory results to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of wetland prediction the use of remote sensing data displayed that wetland cover pattern varied significantly from 1999 to 2030 the findings of the land cover map prediction reveal that the water bodies wetland and vegetation would decrease in the following order by 0 42 3 53 and 8 28 respectively while farmlands and built up areas would increase by 54 56 and 33 21 respectively the study indicated that the extensive spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural lands with built up areas encroachment would put further threat on wetlands management sustainability in the future to meet the food and value demands of ever increasing populations to moderate the impact of land cover change there should be appropriate and ecologically agronomic measure to conserve the wetland area s and integrate a bottom up and participatory approaches between agricultural activities and socioeconomic development for future land use planning the present study recommends that the wetlands within nigeria s ogun river basin need more attention for the reclamation and other activities from society government and stakeholders in the implementation of wetland policy planning and sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors are sincerely grateful to the united states

20064,wetland changes are very serious ecosystem problems which stem from unrestrained human and environmental actions despite significant attention in environmental management research the means to tackle wetland changes are still gaining momentum in science and research within developing countries with the increasing availability of remote sensing data and flexible solutions finding the right solution to wetland changes becomes a key research and policy agenda herein we assessed the wetland change prediction of ogun river or basin nigeria during 1999 2009 and 2019 by analyzing land cover change lcc images using cellular automata markov ca markov chain and remote sensing rs techniques the acquired shuttle radar topographic mapper and landsat remotely sensed data were applied to create thematic maps of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference salinity index ndsi and digital elevation model dem of the study area the ca markov required the supervised classification of the land cover maps of 1999 2009 and 2019 the results of the elevation ndvi and ndsi revealed the qualitative differences in the study area the lcc analysis indicated that farmlands and built up areas increased by 54 56 and 33 21 respectively however waterbodies wetlands and vegetation decreased by 0 42 3 53 and 8 28 respectively these findings agree with the ca markov with an accuracy exceeding 70 and thus predict the wetland changes for the year 2030 the major attributions to wetland cover variations in the study area are built up encroachment with extensive spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural activities this study through its findings provides relevant guidelines and information on wetland changes required by stakeholders for environmental policy planning and

lifeline for improving the quality of life by enriching the natural habitat promoting natural water levels and providing cultural and economic benefits such as natural resources supply food production and recreational opportunities epa 2018 despite their importance a large proportion of wetlands about 32 million hectares by global estimates are affected by runoff logging air and water pollution leading to geomorphological changes isidoro and grattan 2011 orimoloye et al 2020 wetland changes affect water quality by altering sediment chemical loads and the watershed hence information on land cover change lcc is indispensable in wetland change prediction basnyat et al 1999 arowolo et al 2018 moreover the primary drivers of wetland change are environmental and human induced activities through alteration of soil parent materials modification of lcc deterioration of stream water quality and the loss of biodiversity wulf et al 2015 according to ibrahim 2016 approximately 58 of wetlands are affected worldwide through climate change in sub saharan africa steep anthropogenic activities and natural environmental processes cause nearly 9 of wetland changes eldeiry and garcia 2010 as a result understanding the potential for wetland changes is still very important in developing countries such as nigeria wulf et al 2015 rapid population growth increases the need to investigate wetlands previously the conventional approach was largely employed but the high cost of field surveys or aerial photograph interpretation paves the way for a more convenient approach spies and woodgate 2005 remote sensing rs which is increasingly being used to study wetland changes abdelfattah and shahid 2009 comes from the understanding that satellites can provide repetitive and stereoscopic coverage of the earth and offer image interpretation using theories related to how earth features respond to electromagnetic signals nowadays many studies are now leveraging technological advances and flexible solutions to transition towards the use of cost effective satellite imagery such as landsat zhang et al 2015 to monitor wetland changes osunmadewa et al 2018 therefore given their cost effectiveness and technological robustness rs techniques have been used in collaboration with geographic information system gis to characterize wetland areas and analyze their lcc rao et al 1999 for instance gis and landsat imagery offers a useful tool for modeling and monitoring various spatial phenomena such as pervasive illegal deforestation seawater intrusion surface evaporation and plant transpiration rebelo et al 2009 with the growing attention all over the world to salvage the wetland situation science and policy are still gaining momentum for developing countries for example nigeria moreover little or few research has assessed and predicted wetland changes using soil types digital elevation model dem normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference salinity index ndsi through cellular automata markov chain ca markov and rs techniques importantly wetlands are faced with salinity intrusion and vegetation cover loss especially in a spatial environment of today tobore et al 2021 dehni and lounis 2012 to mitigate salinity intrusion and vegetation cover loss in an areas with gradual to sudden population growth like nigeria requires simple and accurate rs indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference salinity index ndsi noroozi et al 2012 dasgupta etal 2015 according to existing studies rs products based on the spectral signatures single or multi band provides evidence that more than half of the wetland locations worldwide are threaten by anthropogenic activities especially for countries where gradual to sudden climate associated changes zhang et al 2015 for instance the single band method utilizes a subjective threshold value while the multi band can be used to delineate wetlands by analyzing the spectral signature difference between land cover classes zhang et al 2015 in fact spectral signatures such as ndvi and ndsi have gained popularity among researchers and offers simple timely and accurate results in mapping wetland changes at low cost nguyen et al 2020 at present information about land cover change is very important to detect and understand the management of wetland changes bevington et al 2022 nguyen et al 2020 using a ca markov chain technique wu et al 2010 the markov chain models helped to quantitatively predict the dynamic of land cover patterns wu et al 2010 in contrast cellular automata models can simulate the spatial distribution of landscape patterns but lacks the potential to predict temporal changes he et al 2006 the integration of a ca markov model with predictor variables ndvi ndsi and topographic information has advantages such as providing a highly efficient dynamic simulation and the ability to predict complex land cover patterns wu et al 2010 additionally the ca markov model serves as a bottom up approach system which accommodates both human induced activities and biophysical landscape prediction hyandye and martz 2017 wetland change prediction is significant for the study of land degradation resulting from unfavorable human activities such as illegal felling of trees uncontrolled grazing and overuse of fertilizers or pesticides and environmental processes barbouchi et al 2015 consequently the shocks of climate change can be linked to wetland changes in countries like nigeria etc tobore et al 2021 extant research in agriculture planning and the environment indicates that the ca markov model and spectral indices ndvi and ndsi have been amply applied in developed countries to predict wetlands changes zhang et al 2015 szatmÃ¡ri et al 2020 sahbeni 2021a this is not the case in developing countries particularly nigeria the focus of this study hence this study aims to integrate both ca markov and rs approaches to assess and predict wetland changes at the ogun river or basin nigeria the specific objectives are as follows 1 to assess the spatial and temporal change of the study area using landsat images captured between 1999 2009 and 2019 and 2 to predict the spatial changes of wetlands from 1999 to 2030 using the ca markov chain model materials and methods description of

fao iuss 2010 and shuttle radar topographic mapper srtm of 30 m resolution for soil types and digital elevation model dem were used as driving varibles in mapping wetland changes of the area the soil s types and dem of the area revealed qualitative differences of the wetlands the parent material of the area is derived from the basement complex with intrusions of quartzite and gneisses the soil types is dominated by sandy clay loam and classified as ferric fluvisols leptosols and ferric luvisols as shown in fig 2 a the dem was used to better understand and assess the spatial variation of the area through the rate of acceleration and deceleration of lateral transit water flow of the wetlands fig 2 b the srtm image was acquired from the usgs united state geological survey website see fig 3 study methods data collection and preprocessing of satellite image the soil types and digital elevation data integrated with the landsat time series images assists in the easy and accurate mapping of

furthermore dark object subtraction dos operation and geometric corrections chavez 1988 were done for proportional image signal flexibility table 1 predictor variables satellite spectral indices are important variables in monitoring landscape changes furby et al 2010 wetland salinization and vegetation cover loss have significantly impacted both agricultural productivity and ecosystem quality worldwide isidoro and grattan 2011 szatmÃ¡ri et al 2020 in the study landsat images of 2019 were used to assess the ndvi and ndsi of the area ndvi and ndsi variables were used to create enhanced

azabdaftari 2015 the ndvi serves as a fractional numerical indicator to absorbed the active photosynthetic radiation of vegetation cover in specific area or region breunig et al 2010 however ndsi remains a significant technique that can be used to mitigate food insecurity by monitoring the inducing slower growth of agricultural lossess such as premature leaf senescence and tillering etc

assessment using ndvi and ndsi predictor variables across broad regional scales lobell et al 2010 so the present study utilized the ndvi ndsi and land cover of the years 1999 2009 and 2019 integrated into the development of the cellular automata markov ca markov model to predict the future wetland scenario of the area the cellular automata ca analysis is a bottom up dynamic model approach with a time and space discrete spatio temporal calculation while markov chain utilized the random process to determine the transition probability between the initial and final states among land use categories mishra and rai 2016 the ndvi and ndsi layers of the area were used as environmental variables to assess the loss or increase in vegetated and salinity intrusion of the study area this operation were performed in the arc gis10 x ca markov chain and the algorithm in the idrisi package using a three step technique suggested by bashir and board 2007 first the transition probability matrics and the transition area matrics are generated through markov chain analysis of a set of land cover maps which are mainly classified from the acquired landsat images second a set of transition potential maps are generated from the ndvi and ndsi as driving variables of the land cover third based on the land cover transition rules specified in the transition potential maps a multi criteria objective land allocation procedure is then used to allocate the land cover change areas that are specified in the transition area matrics into the to be simulated wetland land cover map balogun and ishola 2017 the ca markov chain model was utilized due to its better proximity and higher prediction accuracy of landscape patterns at both temporal and spatial dimensions balogun and ishola 2017 the maximum iteration and neighborhood of 3 by 3 random cells sampling method was applied the ca markov described by ma et al 2012 was used to assess the predicted wetland changes through equations 5 and 6 5 st p i j s t where s denotes the salinity changes t 1 denotes the time point 6 p ij p 11 p 1 p 1 p 11 p 11 p 11 p ij represent the state transition probability matrics wetland validation and accuracy validation is the process of generating a set of points from the classified image by the ground truth data from the original maps liu 2005 the ca markov model was validated to predict the classified land cover maps for 1999 2009 and 2019 which is compared to the estimated land cover map of the same year from google earth image 100 randomly selected points were coded as farmland vegetation built up wetland and water bodies to determine the kappa coefficient the kappa k parameters obtained in the idrisi selva software environment were used for a cell by cell location using the created database the producer s and user s accuracy which were derived from the error confusion matrix as discussed by liu et al 2007 and congalton and green 2009 were also applied to assess the accuracy the model acceptance and validation were used in predicting the wetland changes for the year 2030 kappa parameters are tests used to measure the accuracy between predefined producer and user assigned ratings pontius and millones 2011 the kappa test can be expressed in the formula 7 k p a p e 1 p e the p a is the number of time the k raster agree p e is the number of times the k raster is expected to agree only by chance the workflow of this study is shown below results and discussion satellite based wetland assessment landsat images of 2019 were used to detect reflectance differences between the vegetated and salinity areas the spatial variation of the ndvi and ndsi displays the magnitude for mapping and predicting wetland changes in the study area the results obtained show that the present study possesses slightly saline soils and severe vegetation cover loss fig 4 ndvi and ndsi maps revealed that spectral indices using landsat images are the commonly used technique to identify wetland changes iqbal 2010 mo et al 2017 feilhauer et al 2018 according to isidoro and grattan 2011 wetland salinization and vegetation cover loss have significant effects on both agricultural productivity and ecosystem quality worldwide ndvi and ndsi map coupled with the digital elevation model serves as indicators for future trends in mapping wetland changes due to their ability to retrieve and update vegetation cover and salinity intrusion inventories geerken et al 2005 tajgardan et al 2007 eldeiry and garcia 2010 bouaziz et al 2011 noroozi et al 2012 zewdu et al 2016 although the thermal infrared band used in this study provides more reflectance in salt affected areas than other bands iqbal 2010 khanna et al 2018 these findings also confirm the agreements of metternicht and zinck 1997 and abdul qadir and benni 2010 that salt affected areas and vegetation cover loss results from spectral reflectance properties which can be used to study combined effects of wetland changes furthermore geerken et al 2005 pinpointed that spectral signatures of photosynthetically and non photosynthetically active vegetation cover showed obvious differences in predicting wetland changes according to iqbal 2010 and shapiro et al 2016 spectral signatures through covariates variables such as ndvi and ndsi make it simple and accurate to assess vegetation and salinity changes at less time van beijma et al 2014 tepanosyan et al 2021 the use of the ndvi map in this study helped to characterize absorptive and reflective features of vegetative areas which holds considerable promise in detecting multi temporal and phenological dynamics in mapping wetland changes furthermore tassopoulou et al 2019 opined that ndvi remains the most important index for vegetation cover change detection especially areas with spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural activities according to he et al 2006 vegetation monitoring using ndvi presents valuable information for a better understanding of man made and natural wetland environments furthermore xiao et al 2004 and tobore et al 2019 identified that mapping and classifying vegetation cover using ndvi serves as an important task in monitoring wetlands changes due to its higher accuracy efficiency this finding is similar to the result of xavier et al 2005 which showed that ndvi remains one of the commonly used indices for mapping vegetation cover changes this results was also identical to those of previous studies for example tobore et al 2021 and akintuyi et al 2021 in the same region also inappropriate land use and land cover change affects wetland changes alabi et al 2021 especially under a changing climatic conditions such as sub saharan africa oyerinde et al 2022 besides nigeria s vegetation cover is faced with anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and extensive bush burning etc oyerinde et al 2015 therefore the loss of vegetative cover in the present study area could be attributed to these drivers of change moreover aguilara et al 2012 also highlighted that ndvi can be used to distinguish between non vegetated cover from natural landscape patterns nevertheless a growing number of studies have examined a wide variety of vegetative phenomena by using remotely sensed data in mapping and monitoring wetland changes duchemin et al 1999 nerry et al 1998 tobore et al 2019 the result of the ndsi map shows that the study area possesses slight salinity intrusion the slight salinity intrusion may be traced to heavy metal deposition close vicinity to dumpsites and discharge sites of industrial waste to surrounding rivers and streams according to obiora et al 2016 nigeria s soils and environment are faced with heavy metal e g al hg zn and fe deposition although pajak et al 2015 suggested that leaching from a drainage or irrigation channel network could result in land salinization in addition mazurek et al 2017 reaffirm that the distribution and presence of salinity intrusion on the landscape depended on human activities and the existing vegetation cover the superiority of the ndsi map in the study of wetland changes can help to monitor and predict the physiological drought which is apparent to a shortage of water when a plant is growing in moist saline soil or solution iqbal 2010 azhikodan and yokoyama 2015 nguyen et al 2018 sahbeni 2021b although gain etal 2012 discovered that salinity intrusion most commonly occurred within wetlands compared to inland areas due to environmental and anthropogenic activities furthermore tobore et al 2021 opined that developing countries like nigeria commonly referred wetlands area s as wastelands and the deleterious consequence can cause food shortages and potential risk to human health such as cancer high blood pressure and skin diseases mah muduzzaman etal 2014 nkwunonwo et al 2020 ndvi and ndsi indices have helped to show the importance and significant relationship in the detection and monitoring of wetland changes allbed and kumar 2013 the present results also match with the outcomes of mondal and southworth 2010 that wetland change predictions are better correlated through the sensitivity of spectral satellite indices like ndvi and ndsi mah muduzzaman etal 2014 mentioned that mapping wetland changes using landsat satellite images can be regarded as one of the most used spectral indices to identify the rate of vegetation cover loss and salinity intrusion additionally the spectral satellite indices like ndvi and ndsi were considered for vegetation and salinity detection as these indices have already been proven accurate and suitable for this purpose in previous studies dehm et al 2019 gain etal 2012 in nigeria the aggravated rising climatic changes and socioeconomic vulnerabilities to wetland changes exploring soil salinity intrusion and vegetation cover dynamics is very important to formulate wetland protection and sustainability for better implementation of environmental policies and planning jiang et al 2017 wetland changes from the year 1999 to 2030 wetland and land cover changes have significance for human wellbeing hasan et al 2020 ficken et al 2019 wulder et al 2018 therefore need exists for evaluating the spatial temporal changes particularly to protect the wetlands ecosystems in this study natural color composite ncc focusing on farmland vegetation built up wetlands and water bodies were employed to interpret the land cover change the markov chain transition probability matrics of the land cover changes from 1999 to 2019 were used to obtain the diagonal values of the area table 5 afterward the ca markov was used to predict the year 2030 wetland based on the classified images of 1999 2009 and 2019 fig 5 the table 6 records the temporal differences in the maps of fig 5 for the selected spanned 1999 2009 2019 2030 years fig 5 showed a trend that the area occupied with vegetation wetlands and water bodies decreased while farmlands and built up areas increased and thus covering 1625 18 ha ha based on the analyzed results the land cover in 1999 was in the following order 885 31 ha vegetation 370 71 ha wetlands 229 17 ha built up 130 34 ha farmlands and 9 65 ha water bodies also in 2009 vegetation remains the represented major land cover class covering around 35 96 of the study area the other land cover areas farmlands accounts for 27 83 built up 24 35 wetlands 10 32 and waterbodies 0 53 however the significant changes observed from the 2019 land cover map revealed that vegetation wetlands and water bodies decreased from 35 96 to 18 30 10 32 to 7 99 and 0 53 to 0 49 while farmlands and built up areas increased from 27 83 452 83 ha to 47 06 764 82 ha and 24 35 379 55 ha to 26 15 425 03 ha the decrease observed in 2019 land cover map i e vegetation wetlands and waterbodies translated to the increase in the built up areas and farmlands in year 2030 respectively table 6 the substantial decrease observed in vegetation wetlands and waterbodies in the area may be rooted to the temporal interaction between climate change biophysical and rapid uncontrolled human activities especially in the ever increasing population growth country like nigeria tobore et al 2021 ramsar 2018 tarnocai 2009 lambin et al 2001 the significant decrease in vegetative cover in the area also hinder wetlands ecosystem services food and raw material production thereby causing food insecurity adam 2009 na et al 2015 hoque et al 2020 therefore these gradual to sudden changes may be responsible for the increase predicted in farmlands and built up areas in the year 2030 table 7 although the inappropriate use of land cover in sub saharan africa has been identified as one of the primary drivers of wetland biodiversity loss bhuiyan and dutta 2012 apart from anthropogenic activities like uncontrolled population expansion and socio economic activity the gradual sea level rise or climate pressure posed a substantial challenge to wetland sustainability bhuiyan and dutta 2012 for instance soil salinity intrusion owing to sea level rise has affected over 63 percent of agricultural lands especially in sub saharan africa srdi 2010 the present findings is consistent with many other studies that wetlands changes affects the provision of soil formation hoque et al 2020 raw amenities huq et al 2019 and food production akber et al 2018 hasan et al 2020 in comparison to our results to wetlands areas especially in developing countries like nigeria reveals a decline in wetland ecosystem services values and functions wang et al 2006 li et al 2007 davidson et al 2018 the kappa coefficients of the land cover map were calculated and used to compare the accuracy of wetland prediction based on the land cover classes from 1999 to 2030 it was observed that the overall land cover classification accuracies were 81 29 79 01 81 07 and 79 08 after the prediction it was found that the cohen kappa statistics were 0 70 and thus show substantial classification agreement with the present study table 8 according to anderson 1976 to approve the reliability of the classified images the land cover map should clearly exceed the minimum acceptable standard of 70 as assigned by the usgs classification scheme conclusion the research evaluates the first results of work dedicated to assess wetland change prediction within nigeria s ogun river basin through the integration of ca markov and remote sensing techniques although this study has stirred the need to consolidate empirical research on wetland ecosystems in the study area the integration of the ca markov and remote sensing techniques has not only improved an understanding of the trends in land cover change but can be used as indicators for future trends in assessing and monitoring wetland changes wetland ecosystem services are useful to land resources and serve as a lifeline for improving the quality of life by enriching the natural habitat promoting natural water levels and providing cultural and economic benefits such as natural resources supply food production and recreational opportunities nevertheless study on wetland changes has received widespread attention in the environmental and earth resources management system through the sensitivity of the spectral variables the sequence of the model through soil texture digital elevation model ndvi and ndsi are significantly conducive to obtaining more satisfactory results to better understand the spatial and temporal variations of wetland prediction the use of remote sensing data displayed that wetland cover pattern varied significantly from 1999 to 2030 the findings of the land cover map prediction reveal that the water bodies wetland and vegetation would decrease in the following order by 0 42 3 53 and 8 28 respectively while farmlands and built up areas would increase by 54 56 and 33 21 respectively the study indicated that the extensive spontaneous and uncontrolled agricultural lands with built up areas encroachment would put further threat on wetlands management sustainability in the future to meet the food and value demands of ever increasing populations to moderate the impact of land cover change there should be appropriate and ecologically agronomic measure to conserve the wetland area s and integrate a bottom up and participatory approaches between agricultural activities and socioeconomic development for future land use planning the present study recommends that the wetlands within nigeria s ogun river basin need more attention for the reclamation and other activities from society government and stakeholders in the implementation of wetland policy planning and sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors are sincerely grateful to the united states
