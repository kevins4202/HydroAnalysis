9190,monitoring continuous daily actual evapotranspiration et is very useful for managing regional water resources and understanding vegetation water consumption and water use efficiency however the research on remote sensing based temporal reconstruction methods for mapping continuous daily et is still limited lacking comparative evaluations and mechanism discussions in the study four reconstruction methods including two interpolation methods the reference evaporative fraction etrf and evaporative fraction ef method and two calibration methods the advection aridity aa and modified katerji perrier kp method were systematically evaluated to reconstruct continuous daily et from discrete daily et based on modis products and atmospheric data meanwhile an additional test using in situ measurements as a perfect proxy for the retrievals on satellite overpass dates was added as a baseline case that is independent of remotely sensed et error the internal coupling mechanism between each model s simulations and the underlying surface physical and atmospheric driving factors were also analyzed using the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods the results demonstrated that the interpolation methods performed better and had a higher potential for improvement as the quality of remote sensing et inputs improved although the underestimation errors in the remote sensing based et estimates propagated to subsequent reconstructions and caused underestimation to a certain extent the four methods could still effectively simulate continuous daily et among them the ef method with a simple calculation process which used reference quantity directly related to solar radiation had the best performance based on in situ with an r 2 of 0 8233 and an nrmse of 0 0889 given remote sensing estimates the aa method was the best due to the compensation effects with an r 2 of 0 7267 and an nrmse of 0 1442 as all methods showed high sensitivity to et of satellite overpass days its accuracy should be a top priority for continuous daily et reconstruction work keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing time scale continuity comparative evaluation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et is one of the keys and most difficult components in the global hydrological cycle and the energy budget on earth due to the complex interactions between the parts of the terrestrial plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 and has played an important role in water management and agricultural production maček et al 2018 accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal distribution of regional et over long time series is essential to understanding the energy and hydrological partitioning between the surface and the atmosphere in the region boegh et al 2002 venturini et al 2008 with the emergence and application of remote sensing technology several remote sensing based models have been proposed in the past decades to map et and surface fluxes at large regional scales mu et al 2007 most of these models rely on the surface biological and physical variables e g albedo leaf area index and surface temperature from remote sensing products however it is difficult for the products to meet both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution the landsat products have a clear advantage in spatial resolution with 30 m but with a temporal resolution of 16 days in contrast the meteosat second generation msg is capable of providing et estimates at very high temporal scales nearly every 15 min but at coarse spatial resolution anderson et al 2011 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellites can achieve daily scanning of the earth s surface with a spatial resolution of 1 km and have a wide spectral range to provide the measurements of abundant surface biophysical variables huete et al 2002 thus it is widely used for mapping et at regional scales el masri et al 2019 hao et al 2022 jang et al 2010 yebra et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 nonetheless there is an important problem that modis satellites are susceptible to cloud cover or sensor malfunction so the simulated et based on modis products is instantaneous and discontinuous on the time scale agricultural and water management practices require long time series et information on continuous daily monthly yearly and even multi year time scales rather than instantaneous or discontinuous daily et tang et al 2013 accurate estimates of continuous daily evapotranspiration can provide a better understanding of natural resource availability and water use efficiency of vegetation and crops especially in areas where crop water needs typically exceed precipitation or in arid regions therefore a direct retrieval of daily et from initial instantaneous et etinst or reconstruction of continuous daily et under the condition of missing remote sensing products is indispensable and makes a lot of sense depending on this process and purpose the methods to achieve the above objectives can be broadly divided into two categories 1 the temporal upscaling methods from etinst to daily 24 h et 2 the temporal reconstruction methods from intermittent daily et to continuous daily et cammalleri et al 2014 xu et al 2015 several upscaling methods have been developed to accurately convert remotely sensed etinst to daily et of satellite overpass days such as the well known constant evaporative fraction method shuttleworth et al 1989 the constant reference evaporative fraction method tasumi et al 2005 the solar radiation based method ryu et al 2012 and the constant decoupling factor method tang and li 2017b overall the performance of these methods is acceptable galleguillos et al 2011 tang et al 2013 however further restricted by factors such as sensors of satellites and meteorological conditions it is difficult to obtain continuous daily high quality satellite products liu et al 2012 for instance the landsat satellite revisit cycle is 16 days while the original modis daily products are of low quality with a lot of missing so most of them are synthesized by an 8 day cycle therefore the et of satellite overpass days obtained by the temporal upscaling methods is discontinuous and scattered long and singh 2012 and the temporal reconstruction methods are urgently needed to estimate the et of continuous days the temporal reconstruction methods have been given less attention than the temporal upscaling methods with a shortage of comprehensive comparative evaluations of the different performances of these methods in different climate regions and few studies explained the method simulation results at the mechanism level moreover most studies used in situ measurements as a proxy for remotely sensed et to evaluate continuous daily et reconstruction methods liu et al 2012 alfieri et al 2017 guillevic et al 2019 these evaluations represented the best case scenario considering no errors or uncertainties in the et estimates from the remote sensing based models however any error in the remote sensing based et will be propagated into the subsequent temporal reconstruction delogu et al 2021 which is the real situation that must be considered in the practical application of the reconstruction methods therefore this paper took the above limitations into account and comprehensively evaluated two types of typical and commonly used temporal reconstruction methods based on remotely sensed et models to derive continuous daily et including two interpolation methods the reference evaporative fraction etrf and evaporative fraction ef method and two calibration methods the advection aridity aa and modified katerji perrier kp method the reference evaporative fraction etrf method is a commonly used temporal reconstruction method which extrapolates et from the time of satellite image to periods of 24 h or longer through the time interpolation module etrf the ratio of daily et to the reference grass alfalfa et allen et al 2007 xu et al 2015 used five temporal reconstruction methods to calculate continuous daily et distributions over the beijing area the results showed that the etrf method yielded smaller errors than the data assimilation methods reichle et al 2002 and surface resistance methods mu et al 2007 zhao et al 2020 developed a new model by combining the shuttleworth wallace hu swh model hu et al 2009 with the etrf method to simulate continuous daily et with high spatiotemporal resolution in the loess plateau of china the simulation had a high consistency with the eddy covariance measurements and was superior to the swh model overall the etrf method has been widely recognized as a reliable reconstruction method chávez et al 2008 tang et al 2017 farah et al 2004 found that the seasonal variation of daily ef was gradual and regular depending on the land cover type land management and environmental conditions it was sufficient to obtain ef every 5 10 days to capture the seasonal variation of ef for days without satellite imagery ef can be interpolated between satellite overpass days to acquire the continuous daily et alfieri et al 2017 and guillevic et al 2019 investigated the performance of the ef method for calculating continuous daily et the lower biases were generally yielded when using reference quantities directly related to solar radiation than using reference et or potential et however these studies were generally based on in situ simulations only and no remote sensing observations were involved delogu et al 2021 recently completed this work using instantaneous ef interpolation at the time of satellite overpass based on remote sensing et simulations and in situ observations respectively the method appeared relevant and robust against long revisit frequencies at the seasonal scale the katerji perrier kp method was developed by relating canopy resistance to normal weather data katerji and perrier 1983 after local calibration the method was derived from reliable estimates of canopy resistance and incorporated into the penman monteith pm method to obtain the continuous daily et tang and li 2017b evaluated five methods with different mechanisms concluding that the method based on canopy resistance was of a more solid physical foundation and can effectively capture the effect of temporally variable meteorological factors on the diurnal pattern of surface et the simulation performance of this method is acceptable rana et al 2005 katerji et al 2011 liu et al 2012 but complex resistance information needs to be considered and its applicability in low vegetation coverage cases requires further discussion li et al 2021 the advection aridity aa method on the basis of the complementary relationship cr was developed simply by considering standard meteorological observations to estimate et brutsaert and stricker 1979 the method s coefficients need to be calibrated for different land cover types under various climatic regional conditions before it can be successfully applied han et al 2011 liu et al 2012 reported that the aa method performed better than the kp method both for maize and canola crops in southeastern australia jian et al 2018 found that the advection budget played the major role in et in the aa method while the energy budget had little influence yan and gao 2021 recently evaluated the performance of five cr based et models including the aa method the results indicated that 1 the performance of the aa method calibrated at the monthly timescale was comparable to that of the method calibrated at the daily timescale 2 the accuracy of the aa method increased as a region becomes wetter climate control in a humid area the method has been widely used in different climatic regions including arid lands kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 the objectives of this study were threefold 1 to comprehensively evaluate the performance of four reconstruction methods in extrapolating remotely sensed et estimates on the days of satellite overpass to continuous daily estimates meanwhile in situ eddy covariance ec measurements of satellite overpass days were also introduced into reconstruction methods as a baseline case for quantifying the impact of remotely sensed et estimates errors on subsequent reconstruction work 2 to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of the simulated daily et distribution images 3 to innovatively apply the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods to discuss the internal coupling mechanisms between the simulation results of the four methods and the underlying surface physical conditions and atmospheric environmental factors it was anticipated that the study will provide methodological reference and theoretical support for the research on the time scale continuity of evapotranspiration retrieved by remote sensing 2 research area and data 2 1 research area this study selected the loess plateau of northern shaanxi lpns as the research area the lpns is in the middle of the loess plateau shaanxi china with an area of 925 2 104 ha fig 1 and the terrain is rugged with an elevation of 456 1882 m it is a typical arid and semi arid region with an average annual temperature of 6 11 c its average annual rainfall is 400 600 mm li et al 2017 which occurs mainly during summer and autumn i e from may to september the land use type in the lpns is mainly grassland followed by deciduous broadleaf forests next croplands 2 2 data the study collected meteorological remote sensing and ec measured data in the lpns which are necessary for the model operation and verification the meteorological datasets were acquired from the resource and environment data cloud platform http data cma cn the datasets included the daily wind speed ws m s 1 relative humidity rh maximum temperature tmax c minimum temperature tmin c mean temperature tmean c and sunshine duration sd h of 54 stations in and around the lpns from 2005 to 2008 fig 1 considering that the loess plateau in northern shaanxi is dominated by mountains and hills the anusplin procedure hutchinson 1995 and digital elevation model dem data national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn tang 2019 were used to spatially interpolate the above meteorological station data to the pixel of 1 1 km since there was no available flux observation station in the lpns the ec measurements daily every 30 min at 2 m height were collected at the changwu flux station provided by chinaflux http www chinaflux org as parameterization and verification data fig 1 the ec system consisted of a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell usa that measured instantaneous wind speeds and sonic air temperature fluctuations and an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor usa that measured the water vapor density and carbon dioxide concentrations fluctuations soil heat fluxes hfp01 hukseflux are directly measured at 5 and 10 cm depth soil temperature moisture sensors campbell scientific

university of edinburgh http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire including spike removal sonic virtual temperature correction the planar fit coordinate rotation corrections for density fluctuation and frequency response etc given the eddy covariance method generally underestimates surface heat fluxes and generates an energy imbalance le h r n g et measurements from eddy covariance instruments were corrected for energy closure problems on a daily basis using the bowen ratio method foken 2008 twine et al 2000 and were performed quality control of the processed data to derive daily et liu et al 2013 in addition to these correction problems there are some issues related to flux divergence in the equilibrium boundary layer inhomogeneous vegetation or moisture conditions in the source area i e footprint and non representative sensing of rn and g which were large missed by the covariance algorithm and needed to be concerned allen et al 2011 in our study the energy balance ratio ebr the sum of sensible heat and latent heat against surface available energy averaged approximately 0 86 at the daily time scale over the study period which was consistent with previous studies reported for cropland liu et al 2011 meyers and hollinger 2004 flux footprint describes the influence of the upwind spatial distribution of the surface emission to the vertical fluxes measured at some height and represents the upwind surface area that is statistically responsible for the conditioning of the measurement allen et al 2011 a footprint size and shape depend on many factors such as the measurement height wind speed and direction aerodynamic roughness length and planetary boundary layer mixing conditions liu et al 2011 in the previous studies some footprint models were selected to obtain the flux footprint of the changwu flux measurement over our study period from 2004 to 2009 li et al 2013 tang et al 2012 wang et al 2016 2013 the results suggested that the measured fluxes of changwu station are fully spatial representative of the study area and the source areas of the ec measurements extended along the prevailing wind direction the prevailing wind directions of changwu flux station were distributed from the southeast to the northwest the changwu flux station is located at 107 40 55 90 e and 35 14 31 54 n respectively the region around the station is dominated by winter wheat with a plant height of 1 m and belongs to the farmland ecosystem beyond the farmland are sparsely scattered apple orchards with scattered crops of wheat tang et al 2012 the climate characteristics of the station are consistent with those of lpns and belong to the warm temperate semi humid and drought prone climate zone with an annual mean temperature and precipitation of 9 1 c and 584 mm respectively moreover there is also relatively little topographic relief and spatial heterogeneity between the station and lpns the remote sensing data the 1 km mod15a2 lai fpar leaf area index fraction of photosynthetically active radiation 8 day composite datasets from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and 500 m mcd12q1 yearly land cover datasets from nasa http ladsweb nascom nasa gov were used these parameters vary slightly over the 8 day composite period in this study we assumed that these were the data measured at the satellite overpass time in other words we obtained the data every eight days for each grid in addition we identified the land cover types of the lpns by using the international geosphere biosphere igbp based mcd12q1 dataset fig 1 these data were all resampled to 1 km spatial resolution 3 methodology 3 1 calculation of the et on satellite overpass days in this study remotely sensed et estimates on the days of satellite overpass were calculated by the swh model hu et al 2009 for each pixel the swh model a two source et model was developed from the shuttleworth wallace s w model model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 to estimate et by

electric currents hu et al 2013 the five resistances are necessary to estimate et with the water vapor flow hu et al 2013 introduced the function of soil water content and the ball berry model on the

in this study the etrf method was used to extrapolate etswh to obtain continuous daily et in the etrf method the key intermediate parameter etrf used for interpolation from the image to entire research period is defined as zhao et al 2020 7 e t r f e t s w h e t r where e t r is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and its calculation refers to allen et al 1998 finally the cumulative et is calculated as 8 e t p e r i o d i m n e t r f i e t r i where e t p e r i o d is cumulative et for the period from day m to day n e t r i is e t r for day i e t r f i was interpolated e t r f for day i eq 8 shows that continuous daily et can be obtained by multiplying etr on the day with interpolated etrf 3 2 2 evaporative fraction ef method the ef method interpolates the ef of satellite overpass days into the continuous daily time scale and then calculates daily et in combination with the effective energy of the day through the following equations 9 λ λ e t s w h r n g 10 e t p e r i

aridity aa method the evapotranspiration complementary theory is the basis of the aa method which can be expressed as liu et al 2012 11 e t p e t w m e t w e t where et p is the potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 et w is the wet environment evapotranspiration mm day 1 m is the empirical parameter in this study et p was calculated by combining information from the energy budget and

according to penman 1948 the et w is calculated by using the partial equilibrium evapotranspiration equation xu and singh 2005 as 13 e t w c e t r a d 14 e t r a d δ r n g δ γ λ where c is the empirical parameter and et rad is defined as the radiation term of et p after substituting eqs 12 14 into eq 11 the aa method can be expressed as 15 e t a e t p c 1 1 m e t r a d e t p 1 m eq 15 can be simplified to 16 e t e t p c 1 e t r a d e t p m 1 where c 1 and m 1 are the empirical parameters requiring local calibration han et al 2011 in this study et swh of every 8 day was used to substitute into et in eq 16 which calibrated parameters c 1 and m 1 for each grid to obtain the complete eq 16 and then the completed eq 16 can be used to obtain the continuous daily et 3 2 4 modified katerji perrier kp method malek et al 1992 used the calculated et and aerodynamic resistance to rearrange the pm equation and obtain the canopy resistance which can be expressed as 17 r c r a γ δ r n g ρ c p e s e a r a λ e δ γ where r c is the canopy resistance s m 1 and r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 katerji and perrier 1983 proposed an alternative linear equation the kp method for calculating r c that is a key parameter used in the pm method to determine et relating canopy resistance to normal weather data liu et al 2012 18 r c r a a r r a b where a and b are the empirical parameters requiring local calibration and r represents a critical resistance value for the evaporative process given by rana et al 2005 as 19 r δ γ δ γ ρ c p e s e a r n g in the study we used the aerodynamic resistance equation to modify r a in the kp method xiong et al 2008 which can be defined as 20 r a ln z m d 0 z o m ln z h d 0 z o h k 2 u z where z m and z h are the wind measurement and air and dew point temperature heights both 2 m in this study after local calibration the daily et can be derived through simultaneous eqs 17 18 in this study et swh of every 8 day was used in eq 17 to calculate r c of satellite overpass days which was used to calibrate parameters a and b in eq 18 when the complete eq 18 was obtained the daily r c can be calculated and finally the daily et can be derived through simultaneous eqs 17 18 finally a summary of the relevant algorithms for swh and four reconstruction methods can be found in fig 2 3 3 indicators for the evaluation of method performance in the study five indicators namely the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae normalized root mean square error nrmse the mean bias error mbe and index of agreement ia were chosen to evaluate the performance of each model 21 m a e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 22 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 o max o min 23 m b e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 24 i a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where o i is et measurement p i is estimated et o is mean et measurement p is mean estimated et n is the sample number it is suggested that 1 r 2 is dimensionless and the simulation performance of the model is better when r 2 is closer to 1 2 the closer the value of nrmse mae mm day 1 and mbe mm day 1 are to 0 the better the simulation performance 3 ia is dimensionless and its higher value represents better performance 3 4 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can improve understanding of the relationships between input and output variables in a model and reduce uncertainty through the identification of model input that cause significant uncertainty in the output the one at a time oat method bailis et al 2005 murphy et al 2004 one of the most common approaches was selected to quantify the sensitivity of the input drivers among the four reconstruction methods in the study this approach is to change one factor at a time keeping others at their baseline values then measure sensitivity by monitoring changes in the output bao et al 2021 sun et al 2020 in this paper the uncertainty in its inputs including ws rh tmax tmin tmean sd and lai was considered as the main source of uncertainty for reconstruction methods 25 u v s e n v d v where u v is the uncertainty for driving data to et simulations s e n v is the sensitivity coefficient of the driving data d v is the uncertainty of driving the data i e the error in this study the input climate data e g ws rh tmax tmin tmean sd were acquired by interpolating observation data of 23 meteorological stations within the lpns and their errors were obtained by calculating the average relative deviations in comparison with the actual meteorological data at these stations referring to previous studies nunes et al 2012 xu et al 2016 we took the mean value of the error of lai of mod15a2 products which is 23 4 results and discussions 4 1 swh model validation the accuracy of remote sensing based et directly affected the simulation of continuous daily et which was the basis for the next temporal reconstruction works during the two year research period 90 scattered etswh images were derived from the swh model and verified the simulation results through eddy covariance measurements at changwu station fig 3 and table 1 overall the swh model underestimated the et to a certain extent with an mbe of 0 35 mm day 1 and the obvious underestimates mainly occurred in summer this may be because the swh model only considers the water vapor flux from soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration but neglects the water vapor flux from the canopy hu et al 2013 the r 2 and ia between the measured and simulated et were 0 67 and 0 83 respectively with a high correlation and consistency the nrmse mae was 0 21 0 47 mm day 1 indicating that the swh model had adequate simulation performance and could provide a strong foundation for the subsequent temporal reconstruction works 4 2 performance of the four reconstruction methods the daily ec measurements of the changwu flux station were used as a benchmark to evaluate the simulation effect of the continuous daily et obtained by the four reconstruction methods fig 4 fig 5 and table 2 results indicated that for in situ estimates all of the methods successfully simulated daily et during the two year research period r 2 of the four methods were all larger than 0 66 nrmse mae of that were within 0 15 0 45 mm day 1 and ia of that were larger than 0 87 among them the performance of the two interpolation methods etrf and ef method was clearly better than the two calibration methods aa and kp method relatively there were more underestimates in the two calibration methods given all the indices within two years the ef method provided the best performance and was slightly better than the etrf method which was consistent with the results reported by alfieri et al 2017 meanwhile delogu et al 2021 also reported that lower bias was available when using a reference quantity ef directly related to solar radiation in temporal reconstruction works the kp method relied on accurate measurement of crop height and estimation of canopy resistance variables li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 however in practice the information is difficult to measure precisely especially at the regional scale which may be part of the reason why the performance of kp method was inferior to that of aa method the above results represented a baseline case without considering the error from the remotely sensed et estimates when considering the etswh of the 8 day time step the four methods performance was inferior to that based on in situ measurements mainly because the underestimation error from etswh as the base of the et reconstruction propagated into the subsequent temporal reconstruction and led to a general underestimation of all methods overall however the four methods could still effectively reconstruct the time series of daily et derived from etswh compared with the measured daily et at the changwu station nrmse ranged between 0 13 and 0 17 which was in the range of published evaluation of remote sensing estimates of et xu et al 2015 delogu et al 2021 among these four models the aa method showed the highest correlation with an r 2 of 0 7267 and had relatively smaller error indices with an nrmse of 0 1442 and an mae of 0 4402 mm day 1 while the etrf method had the highest consistency with an ia of 0 8448 and same error index with an nrmse of 0 1442 as the aa method the kp method performed slightly worse than the aa method and the ef method performed relatively poorly which differed from the comparative evaluation based on in situ data we investigated the reasons for this difference in section 4 3 additionally the index difference of interpolation reconstruction methods between in situ data based reconstruction and etswh based reconstruction was greater than that of calibration reconstruction methods which indicated that interpolation methods had a higher potential to improve with the improvement of the quality of remote sensing et inputs 4 3 comparison between et distribution simulations the change details of the daily et simulated by the four methods and the measured et over time were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 in general for in situ data the variation trend and magnitude of the four methods simulated et were consistent with the eddy covariance measurements among them both the average value and intra annual change trend of the ef simulation were closest to the ec measurements in spite of the extremely short term underestimates e g 209 216 days in 2005 or overestimates e g 229 232 days in 2008 in summer the et curves simulated by the etrf method were similar to those of the ef method but its fluctuation amplitude was larger and the method s overall performance was slightly inferior to the ef method both the aa method and kp method would not fairly mirror the changes in et peak value especially in 2008 when et values changed rapidly and obviously at this time their et curves fluctuated gently and presented the shape of a single peak generally which was inconsistent with the actual situation the use of remote sensing model estimates etswh as the base of the et reconstruction led to an underestimation of the seasonal et that was smaller than in situ estimates usually for all methods it should be noticed that in this case some overestimates from the reconstruction methods themselves were compensated with the overall underestimation of etswh especially for the aa method aa etswh curve in 2008 therefore leading to relatively smaller errors based on remote sensing estimates however the aa method was still mediocre in describing the fluctuation trend of et peak values and the aa etswh curve was similar to the overall decline of the et curve of in situ estimates aa in situ curve the fluctuation trend of the kp simulation was similar to that of the aa simulation but the decline in kp etswh relative to kp in situ curve was smaller than the decline in aa etswh relative to aa in situ curve and its performance was still inferior to that of the aa method similar performance existed between the two interpolation methods etrf and ef method which were more affected by swh underestimation in summer so mainly underestimates occurred in summer e g 190 199 days in 2005 accordingly it can also be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the etrf method overestimated the results compared to the ef method which may offset the underestimation caused by the swh model and lead to relatively smaller errors considering itself reconstruction mechanism there were greater discrepancies between in situ data based and etswh based reconstruction results for the interpolation methods etrf and ef method which can directly convey the errors from remote sensing based et estimation to the final results as shown in fig 6 there was obvious underestimation from etswh at the key interpolation nodes of days 193 and 201 thus the interpolation modules etrf ef at these nodes were underestimated it led to the daily et for both reconstruction methods being clearly lower than the reconstructed et based on in situ measurements for the 193 201 days in 2005 the two calibration methods aa and kp method performed parameterization with reference to the condition of the whole growing season so that the errors from the remote sensing based model may be evenly distributed to each day and be reduced therefore et derived from the calibration methods was overall less affected by the error from the remote sensing based et estimation and the deviation of calibration methods between in situ data based reconstruction and etswh based reconstruction was less than that of the interpolation methods in this comparison the performance of all methods was consistent with the conclusions in section 4 2 considering all performance we believe that the ef method was the best method for the continuous daily et reconstruction based on in situ in this study while the aa method was the best based on remote sensing estimates 4 4 spatiotemporal variation of et the four temporal reconstruction methods coupling the swh model were used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration in the lpns in each quarter of 2005 and 2008 figs 8 and 9 show that there was an obvious difference in et among different land cover types the spatial and temporal variability characteristics of et simulated by the four methods were relatively consistent spatially except for winter the et was highest in the croplands located in the middle of the south followed by the grasslands in the central and north and finally the forests in the southwest and southeast corners the southern cropland area around luochuan county is mainly planted with winter wheat and spring corn so the et is minimal due to low temperature and young plants in winter that is before the green up date of winter wheat it is slightly lower than et in the forests at the same latitude and greater than that in the grassland in the north of the lpns meanwhile affected by the concentrated precipitation from may to september and vegetation growth the daily et on the whole was ranked in descending order from summer spring autumn and winter between the seasons the evapotranspiration corresponding to different land cover types in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi was simulated based on the optimum aa method and swh model aa etswh model for 2005 and 2008 we extracted and calculated the mean et of each land use type over the whole study area as seen in fig 10 it was consistent with the above spatial distribution of et in agroecosystems evapotranspiration was always at the top in march october when crops were in a period of rapid growth and development with a maximum et value of more than 1 75 mm day 1 in june 2005 the second of that was grasslands with concentrated precipitation from may october the differences in et between the land cover types of closed shrublands forests and savannas were not obvious with the smallest values of that in mixed forests and in winter december to february the evapotranspiration values of all land use types did not differ obviously among them the et corresponding to closed shrublands and deciduous broadleaf forests were slightly higher than that of other types and barren or sparsely vegetated with lower vegetation cover had a minimum et consistently below 0 25 mm day 1 4 5 discussions of coupling mechanisms based on sensitivity analysis method the reconstruction methods above could be effectively used to convert the et of every 8 day satellite overpass day to evapotranspiration with a time resolution of 1 day as reported in different studies by numerous authors however the four methods in this study performed differently as the different reconstruction conversion methods or coupling mechanisms of factors applied in each reconstruction method fig 2 a comparison of methods characteristics was briefly presented in table 3 meanwhile the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of input driving data were performed fig 11 and fig 12 to focus more on uncertainty quantification and propagation of uncertainty of the input drivers on the simulation of the four reconstruction methods observations of the changwu site et in situ were used as a replacement for input et based on remote sensing model in the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis overall the sensitivity of et in situ was highest for all four methods indicating that the et on the satellite overpass days will obviously influence subsequent continuous daily et reconstruction works meanwhile the uncertainty analysis of the input parameters showed that the average relative deviation of et based on the swh model at changwu station 56 was much larger than that of the other meteorological parameters therefore ensuring and improving the accuracy of the et on satellite overpass days major sources of model uncertainty was the first thing for accurate simulation of continuous daily et among the meteorological parameters wind speed had the largest error 29 2 followed by sunshine hours 10 8 and rh 5 2 the maximum and minimum temperature were accurately estimated by the anusplin program with an error of no more than 0 2 indicating weak model uncertainty caused by it fig 12 moreover each method also showed relatively high sensitivity to rh except for the ef method especially the etrf and aa method lai only worked on the calculation of surface resistance in kp method and ultimately affected daily et therefore it was the least sensitive for each method in the etrf method the key module etrf for interpolation was obtained based on etswh and etr fig 2 the etr calculated by various meteorological data such as t rh sd and ws and the etrf method had a solid theoretical basis which combined the regional surface environment level more effectively zhao et al 2020 in addition the sensitivity analysis showed that the etrf method was a more sensitive method to the parameter rh compared to other models thus the method can provide sensitive feedback on capturing the rapid and strong fluctuation trend of evapotranspiration when the water vapor factors on the underlying surface fluctuate violently in summer previous studies have also confirmed that there is a better performance of the etrf method when vegetation is growing and developing rapidly colaizzi et al 2006 xu et al 2015 simultaneously ws and rh introduced the same degree of uncertainty to the etrf method due to the large error in the wind speed itself fig 12 more input factors and higher sensitivity of them were considered to incorporate more uncertainty caused by measurement errors in the driving factors into the results tang et al 2013 and the lack of daily high quality data on these meteorological factors may hinder the method s widespread use moreover considering the synchronization of rain and heat during the fast growing vegetation period the day to day variation of etr is more complex allen et al 2007 therefore the stable operation of the method requires high quality of meteorological data especially in the high temperature and rainy periods in summer alfieri et al 2017 reported that interpolation may be a key source of error when temporal reconstruction was used to estimate the moisture flux between image retrievals delogu et al 2021 also indicated when the interpolation occurred on a cloudy day actual et is underestimated because the stress is lower compared to values predicted with the interpolation thus the brief underestimation from the etrf and ef methods in summer may be explained by the uncertainty of interpolation in contrast the ef method does not need to consider the complex underlying surface resistance and atmospheric environment information only the daily surface available energy and the et of satellite overpass days were needed to obtain the gradual evaporative fraction and then interpolated it to simulated continuous daily et fig 2 table 3 the method had a much simpler computational process and reduced sensitivity from input drivers but the solar radiation term sd fig 11 although such a mechanism may attenuate the sensitivity that capturing the effects of horizontal advection and atmospheric environmental factors e g wind speed vapor pressure deficit on the variations of the available energy in the daily et estimation tang et al 2013 it reduced the uncertainty caused by measurement errors besides many researches on conversing etinst to a daily scale generally pointed out that the ef method usually underestimated et due to the self preservation hypothesis of instantaneous ef during the day gentine et al 2011 van niel et al 2011 xu et al 2015 unlike the above when the ef method reconstructed the time series of daily et the interpolated ef was obtained directly from the daily energy fraction λ e t r n g rather than the instantaneous value at the time of satellite overpass which avoided the error of assuming that the instantaneous ef was relatively constant during the day the above two points may explain why this method showed the best simulation performance in this study tang and li 2017a improved the accuracy of ef method based on the decoupling factor with meteorological factors which provided a reference for further improvement of the ef method the aa method simulated the continuous daily et after a local calibration of empirical coefficients c1 and m1 through the feedback mechanism between et and etp fig 2 compared to such methods as canopy resistance the aa method based on the complementary relationship bypassed the complex and poorly understood soil plant processes and thus did not require soil moisture or vegetation stomatal resistance property data difficult to obtain it only used standard meteorological observations to obtain daily et xu and singh 2005 fig 2 of the eight statistic driving factors the aa method showed the top sensitivity to three of them tmax tmin and ws fig 11 and its sensitivity to tmean rh and sd was also very close to that of the etrf and kp methods this showed that the aa method was relatively sensitive to the statistical drivers in the four reconstruction methods however the coefficients c1 and m1 were calibrated and held constant for the entire growth period ignoring their inter seasonal variation the applicability may be reduced in specific growth stages especially when the water vapor factors on the underlying surface fluctuate violently li et al 2021 also reported that this method does not consider well the characteristics of the specific crops and the underlying conditions of the region in the estimation of crop et this may be the reason why the curves from aa method fluctuated gently and were in the shape of a single peak additionally the aa method does not involve soil moisture in its calculations which results in a decline in its predictive capability in the soil moisture control area i e arid area hobbins et al 2001 the kp method combined the basic meteorological data of the underlying surface and satellite overpass days flux information to obtain r c through the pm method and then calibrated the empirical coefficients locally to simulate the daily et fig 2 in this method basic atmospheric environmental factors such as vapor pressure deficit solar radiation and air temperature were fully considered as well as surface resistance information as the primary link between the pm and kp methods r c was a physiological parameter and had an aerodynamic component tang et al 2017 besides etswh lai also works on surface resistance required by only the kp method fig 2 therefore the method was more sensitive to lai than other methods similar to the aa method the kp method also ignored the seasonal impact on the r c which may also bring changes to a and b coefficient values li et al 2021 proposed calibrating the empirical coefficients of the above two methods in specific growth stages to improve performance liu et al 2012 reported that this method calculates r c with the calibrated eq 17 then incorporates it into the pm method to obtain et indirectly both of the above calculation steps will produce errors these reasons may explain the underestimates and low correlation of this method additionally the kp method required a higher quality of remote sensing based land cover type products for calculating surface resistance but the uncertainty in the accuracy of the products morisette et al 2002 limited the application of the kp method 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to evaluate the four temporal reconstruction methods for the continuous daily et estimation and to provide a methodological reference and mechanism discussion for developing a more accurate and reliable et reconstruction method for in situ estimates the interpolation methods performed obviously better than calibration methods and had a higher potential for improvement among them the ef method showed the best simulation performance the aa method performed better than the kp method and both the two methods underestimated the daily et integrally the use of remotely sensed et estimates etswh as the base of the et reconstruction led to an underestimation of the seasonal et for all methods but also produced compensation effects to a certain extent overall the four methods could still effectively reconstruct the time series of daily et derived from etswh among them the aa method obtained more compensation effects from etswh underestimation therefore performed best with the highest correlation and relatively small errors the performance of kp method was similarly to the aa method and was slightly inferior to the aa method the underestimation of swh may offset more of the overestimation errors existing in the etrf method compared to the ef method which made a relatively large error according to the analysis of the coupling mechanism between the driving data and the methods based on the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods it can be concluded that the most crucial concern in temporal reconstruction works for the continuous daily et is to ensure the accuracy of the et on satellite overpass days additionally the etrf method which could combine the regional surface environment level more effectively had a higher quality requirement for meteorological data when the underlying surface physical parameters change dramatically the ef method which was easy to calculate and reduced the uncertainty caused by measurement errors demonstrated better performance in this study due to the omitted seasonal impact on the calibration coefficients the applicability of the aa method and kp method may be reduced in specific growth stages thus the direction of future research can focus on improving the two method s performance through dividing specific growth stages to calibrate the coefficients moreover the kp method considers the complex surface resistance information and requires a higher quality of remote sensing based land cover products this study was aimed at a typical semi arid district in northwest china which was helpful for improving the efficiency of utilization and management level of local agricultural water resources however these methods may have different performance characteristics under underlying surface conditions in different climatic regions therefore the comparative study on the applicability of temporal reconstruction methods for the continuous daily et in different typical climate regions of the world should be attached great importance in the related research on the time scale continuity of evapotranspiration in the future

9190,monitoring continuous daily actual evapotranspiration et is very useful for managing regional water resources and understanding vegetation water consumption and water use efficiency however the research on remote sensing based temporal reconstruction methods for mapping continuous daily et is still limited lacking comparative evaluations and mechanism discussions in the study four reconstruction methods including two interpolation methods the reference evaporative fraction etrf and evaporative fraction ef method and two calibration methods the advection aridity aa and modified katerji perrier kp method were systematically evaluated to reconstruct continuous daily et from discrete daily et based on modis products and atmospheric data meanwhile an additional test using in situ measurements as a perfect proxy for the retrievals on satellite overpass dates was added as a baseline case that is independent of remotely sensed et error the internal coupling mechanism between each model s simulations and the underlying surface physical and atmospheric driving factors were also analyzed using the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods the results demonstrated that the interpolation methods performed better and had a higher potential for improvement as the quality of remote sensing et inputs improved although the underestimation errors in the remote sensing based et estimates propagated to subsequent reconstructions and caused underestimation to a certain extent the four methods could still effectively simulate continuous daily et among them the ef method with a simple calculation process which used reference quantity directly related to solar radiation had the best performance based on in situ with an r 2 of 0 8233 and an nrmse of 0 0889 given remote sensing estimates the aa method was the best due to the compensation effects with an r 2 of 0 7267 and an nrmse of 0 1442 as all methods showed high sensitivity to et of satellite overpass days its accuracy should be a top priority for continuous daily et reconstruction work keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing time scale continuity comparative evaluation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et is one of the keys and most difficult components in the global hydrological cycle and the energy budget on earth due to the complex interactions between the parts of the terrestrial plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 and has played an important role in water management and agricultural production maček et al 2018 accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal distribution of regional et over long time series is essential to understanding the energy and hydrological partitioning between the surface and the atmosphere in the region boegh et al 2002 venturini et al 2008 with the emergence and application of remote sensing technology several remote sensing based models have been proposed in the past decades to map et and surface fluxes at large regional scales mu et al 2007 most of these models rely on the surface biological and physical variables e g albedo leaf area index and surface temperature from remote sensing products however it is difficult for the products to meet both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution the landsat products have a clear advantage in spatial resolution with 30 m but with a temporal resolution of 16 days in contrast the meteosat second generation msg is capable of providing et estimates at very high temporal scales nearly every 15 min but at coarse spatial resolution anderson et al 2011 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellites can achieve daily scanning of the earth s surface with a spatial resolution of 1 km and have a wide spectral range to provide the measurements of abundant surface biophysical variables huete et al 2002 thus it is widely used for mapping et at regional scales el masri et al 2019 hao et al 2022 jang et al 2010 yebra et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 nonetheless there is an important problem that modis satellites are susceptible to cloud cover or sensor malfunction so the simulated et based on modis products is instantaneous and discontinuous on the time scale agricultural and water management practices require long time series et information on continuous daily monthly yearly and even multi year time scales rather than instantaneous or discontinuous daily et tang et al 2013 accurate estimates of continuous daily evapotranspiration can provide a better understanding of natural resource availability and water use efficiency of vegetation and crops especially in areas where crop water needs typically exceed precipitation or in arid regions therefore a direct retrieval of daily et from initial instantaneous et etinst or reconstruction of continuous daily et under the condition of missing remote sensing products is indispensable and makes a lot of sense depending on this process and purpose the methods to achieve the above objectives can be broadly divided into two categories 1 the temporal upscaling methods from etinst to daily 24 h et 2 the temporal reconstruction methods from intermittent daily et to continuous daily et cammalleri et al 2014 xu et al 2015 several upscaling methods have been developed to accurately convert remotely sensed etinst to daily et of satellite overpass days such as the well known constant evaporative fraction method shuttleworth et al 1989 the constant reference evaporative fraction method tasumi et al 2005 the solar radiation based method ryu et al 2012 and the constant decoupling factor method tang and li 2017b overall the performance of these methods is acceptable galleguillos et al 2011 tang et al 2013 however further restricted by factors such as sensors of satellites and meteorological conditions it is difficult to obtain continuous daily high quality satellite products liu et al 2012 for instance the landsat satellite revisit cycle is 16 days while the original modis daily products are of low quality with a lot of missing so most of them are synthesized by an 8 day cycle therefore the et of satellite overpass days obtained by the temporal upscaling methods is discontinuous and scattered long and singh 2012 and the temporal reconstruction methods are urgently needed to estimate the et of continuous days the temporal reconstruction methods have been given less attention than the temporal upscaling methods with a shortage of comprehensive comparative evaluations of the different performances of these methods in different climate regions and few studies explained the method simulation results at the mechanism level moreover most studies used in situ measurements as a proxy for remotely sensed et to evaluate continuous daily et reconstruction methods liu et al 2012 alfieri et al 2017 guillevic et al 2019 these evaluations represented the best case scenario considering no errors or uncertainties in the et estimates from the remote sensing based models however any error in the remote sensing based et will be propagated into the subsequent temporal reconstruction delogu et al 2021 which is the real situation that must be considered in the practical application of the reconstruction methods therefore this paper took the above limitations into account and comprehensively evaluated two types of typical and commonly used temporal reconstruction methods based on remotely sensed et models to derive continuous daily et including two interpolation methods the reference evaporative fraction etrf and evaporative fraction ef method and two calibration methods the advection aridity aa and modified katerji perrier kp method the reference evaporative fraction etrf method is a commonly used temporal reconstruction method which extrapolates et from the time of satellite image to periods of 24 h or longer through the time interpolation module etrf the ratio of daily et to the reference grass alfalfa et allen et al 2007 xu et al 2015 used five temporal reconstruction methods to calculate continuous daily et distributions over the beijing area the results showed that the etrf method yielded smaller errors than the data assimilation methods reichle et al 2002 and surface resistance methods mu et al 2007 zhao et al 2020 developed a new model by combining the shuttleworth wallace hu swh model hu et al 2009 with the etrf method to simulate continuous daily et with high spatiotemporal resolution in the loess plateau of china the simulation had a high consistency with the eddy covariance measurements and was superior to the swh model overall the etrf method has been widely recognized as a reliable reconstruction method chávez et al 2008 tang et al 2017 farah et al 2004 found that the seasonal variation of daily ef was gradual and regular depending on the land cover type land management and environmental conditions it was sufficient to obtain ef every 5 10 days to capture the seasonal variation of ef for days without satellite imagery ef can be interpolated between satellite overpass days to acquire the continuous daily et alfieri et al 2017 and guillevic et al 2019 investigated the performance of the ef method for calculating continuous daily et the lower biases were generally yielded when using reference quantities directly related to solar radiation than using reference et or potential et however these studies were generally based on in situ simulations only and no remote sensing observations were involved delogu et al 2021 recently completed this work using instantaneous ef interpolation at the time of satellite overpass based on remote sensing et simulations and in situ observations respectively the method appeared relevant and robust against long revisit frequencies at the seasonal scale the katerji perrier kp method was developed by relating canopy resistance to normal weather data katerji and perrier 1983 after local calibration the method was derived from reliable estimates of canopy resistance and incorporated into the penman monteith pm method to obtain the continuous daily et tang and li 2017b evaluated five methods with different mechanisms concluding that the method based on canopy resistance was of a more solid physical foundation and can effectively capture the effect of temporally variable meteorological factors on the diurnal pattern of surface et the simulation performance of this method is acceptable rana et al 2005 katerji et al 2011 liu et al 2012 but complex resistance information needs to be considered and its applicability in low vegetation coverage cases requires further discussion li et al 2021 the advection aridity aa method on the basis of the complementary relationship cr was developed simply by considering standard meteorological observations to estimate et brutsaert and stricker 1979 the method s coefficients need to be calibrated for different land cover types under various climatic regional conditions before it can be successfully applied han et al 2011 liu et al 2012 reported that the aa method performed better than the kp method both for maize and canola crops in southeastern australia jian et al 2018 found that the advection budget played the major role in et in the aa method while the energy budget had little influence yan and gao 2021 recently evaluated the performance of five cr based et models including the aa method the results indicated that 1 the performance of the aa method calibrated at the monthly timescale was comparable to that of the method calibrated at the daily timescale 2 the accuracy of the aa method increased as a region becomes wetter climate control in a humid area the method has been widely used in different climatic regions including arid lands kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 the objectives of this study were threefold 1 to comprehensively evaluate the performance of four reconstruction methods in extrapolating remotely sensed et estimates on the days of satellite overpass to continuous daily estimates meanwhile in situ eddy covariance ec measurements of satellite overpass days were also introduced into reconstruction methods as a baseline case for quantifying the impact of remotely sensed et estimates errors on subsequent reconstruction work 2 to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of the simulated daily et distribution images 3 to innovatively apply the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods to discuss the internal coupling mechanisms between the simulation results of the four methods and the underlying surface physical conditions and atmospheric environmental factors it was anticipated that the study will provide methodological reference and theoretical support for the research on the time scale continuity of evapotranspiration retrieved by remote sensing 2 research area and data 2 1 research area this study selected the loess plateau of northern shaanxi lpns as the research area the lpns is in the middle of the loess plateau shaanxi china with an area of 925 2 104 ha fig 1 and the terrain is rugged with an elevation of 456 1882 m it is a typical arid and semi arid region with an average annual temperature of 6 11 c its average annual rainfall is 400 600 mm li et al 2017 which occurs mainly during summer and autumn i e from may to september the land use type in the lpns is mainly grassland followed by deciduous broadleaf forests next croplands 2 2 data the study collected meteorological remote sensing and ec measured data in the lpns which are necessary for the model

cn tang 2019 were used to spatially interpolate the above meteorological station data to the pixel of 1 1 km since there was no available flux observation station in the lpns the ec measurements daily every 30 min at 2 m height were collected at the changwu flux station provided by chinaflux http www chinaflux org as parameterization and verification data fig 1 the ec system consisted of a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell usa that measured instantaneous wind speeds and sonic air temperature fluctuations and an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor usa that measured

university of edinburgh http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire including spike removal sonic virtual temperature correction the planar fit coordinate rotation corrections for density fluctuation and frequency response etc given the eddy covariance method generally underestimates surface heat fluxes and generates an energy imbalance le h r n g et measurements from eddy covariance instruments were corrected for energy closure problems on a daily basis using the bowen ratio method foken 2008 twine et al 2000 and were performed quality control of the processed data to derive daily et liu et al 2013 in addition to these correction problems there are some issues related to flux divergence in the equilibrium boundary layer inhomogeneous vegetation or moisture conditions in the source area i e footprint and non representative sensing of rn and g which were large missed by the covariance algorithm and needed to be concerned allen et al 2011 in our study the energy balance ratio ebr the sum of sensible heat and latent heat against surface available energy averaged approximately 0 86 at the daily time scale over the study period which was consistent with previous studies reported for cropland liu et al 2011 meyers and hollinger 2004 flux footprint describes the influence of the upwind spatial distribution of the surface emission to the vertical fluxes measured at some height and represents the upwind surface area that is statistically responsible for the conditioning of the measurement allen et al 2011 a footprint size and shape depend on many factors such as the measurement height wind speed and direction aerodynamic roughness length and planetary boundary layer mixing conditions liu et al 2011 in the previous studies some footprint models were selected to obtain the flux footprint of the changwu flux measurement over our study period from 2004 to 2009 li et al 2013 tang et al 2012 wang et al 2016 2013 the results suggested that the measured fluxes of changwu station are fully spatial representative of the study area and the source areas of the ec measurements extended along the prevailing wind direction the prevailing wind directions of changwu flux station were distributed from the southeast to the northwest the changwu flux station is located at 107 40 55 90 e and 35 14 31 54 n respectively the region around the station is dominated by winter wheat with a plant height of 1 m and belongs to the farmland ecosystem beyond the farmland are sparsely scattered apple orchards with scattered crops of wheat tang et al 2012 the climate characteristics of the station are consistent with those of lpns and belong to the warm temperate semi humid and drought prone climate zone with an annual mean temperature and precipitation of 9 1 c and 584 mm respectively moreover there is also relatively little topographic relief and spatial heterogeneity between the station and lpns the remote sensing data the 1 km mod15a2 lai fpar leaf area

nascom nasa gov were used these parameters vary slightly over the 8 day composite period in this study we assumed that these were the data measured at the satellite overpass time in other words we obtained the data every eight days for each grid in addition we identified the land cover types of the lpns by using the international geosphere biosphere igbp based mcd12q1 dataset fig 1 these data were all resampled to 1 km spatial resolution 3 methodology 3 1 calculation of the et on satellite overpass days in this study remotely sensed et estimates on the days of satellite overpass were

research period is defined as zhao et al 2020 7 e t r f e t s w h e t r where e t r is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and its calculation refers to allen et al 1998 finally the cumulative

for day i eq 8 shows that continuous daily et can be obtained by multiplying etr on the day with interpolated etrf 3 2 2 evaporative fraction ef method the ef method interpolates the ef of satellite overpass days into the continuous daily time scale and then calculates daily et in combination with the effective energy of the day through the following equations 9 λ λ e t s w h r n g 10 e t p e r i

evapotranspiration mm day 1 et w is the wet environment evapotranspiration mm day 1 m is the empirical parameter in this study et p was calculated by combining information from the energy budget and water vapor transfer in the pm equation 12 e t p δ r n g δ γ λ γ δ γ f u z e s e a where e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit kpa the term f u z is the function of the mean ws at a reference level z according to penman 1948 the et w is calculated by using the partial equilibrium evapotranspiration equation xu and singh 2005 as 13 e t w c e t r a d 14 e t r a d δ r n g δ γ λ where c is the empirical parameter and et rad is defined as the radiation term of et p after substituting eqs 12 14 into eq 11 the aa method can be expressed as 15 e t a e t p c 1 1 m e t r a d e t p 1 m eq 15 can be simplified to 16 e t e t p c 1 e t r a d e t p m 1 where c 1 and m 1 are the empirical parameters requiring local calibration han et al 2011 in this study et swh of every 8 day was used to substitute into et in eq 16 which calibrated parameters c 1 and m 1 for each grid to obtain the complete eq 16 and then the completed eq 16 can be used to obtain the continuous daily et 3 2 4 modified

calculating r c that is a key parameter used in the pm method to determine et relating canopy resistance to normal weather data liu et al 2012 18 r c r a a r r a b where a and b are the empirical parameters requiring local calibration and r represents a critical resistance value for the evaporative process given by rana et al 2005 as 19 r δ γ δ γ ρ c p e s e a r n g in the study we used the aerodynamic resistance equation to modify r a in the kp method xiong et al 2008 which can be defined as 20 r a ln z m d 0 z o m ln z h d 0 z o h k 2 u z where z m and z h are the wind measurement and air and dew point temperature heights both 2 m in this study after local calibration the daily et can be derived through simultaneous eqs 17 18 in this study et swh of every 8 day was used in eq 17 to calculate r c of satellite overpass days which was used to calibrate parameters a and b in eq 18 when the complete eq 18 was obtained the daily r c can be calculated and finally the daily et can be derived through simultaneous eqs 17 18 finally a summary of the relevant algorithms for swh and four reconstruction methods can be found in fig 2 3 3 indicators for the evaluation of method performance in the study five indicators namely the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae normalized root mean square error nrmse the mean bias error mbe and index of agreement ia were chosen to evaluate the performance of each model 21 m a e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 22 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 o max o min 23 m b e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 24 i a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where o i is et measurement p i is estimated et o is mean et measurement p is mean estimated et n is the sample number it is suggested that 1 r 2 is dimensionless and the simulation performance of the model is better when r 2 is closer to 1 2 the closer the value of nrmse mae mm day 1 and mbe mm day 1 are to 0 the better the simulation performance 3 ia is dimensionless and its higher value represents better performance 3 4 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can improve understanding of the relationships between input and output variables in a model and reduce uncertainty through the identification of model input that cause significant uncertainty in the output the one at a time oat method bailis et al 2005 murphy et al 2004 one of the most common approaches was selected to quantify the sensitivity of the input drivers among the four reconstruction methods in the study this approach is to change one factor at a time keeping others at their baseline values then measure sensitivity by monitoring changes in the output bao et al 2021 sun et al 2020 in this paper the uncertainty in its inputs including ws rh tmax tmin tmean sd and lai was considered as the main source of uncertainty for reconstruction methods 25 u v s e n v d v where u v is the uncertainty for driving data to et simulations s e n v is the sensitivity coefficient of the driving data d v is the uncertainty of driving the data i e the error in this study the input climate data e g ws rh tmax tmin tmean sd were acquired by interpolating observation data of 23 meteorological stations within the lpns and their errors were obtained by calculating the average relative deviations in comparison with the actual meteorological data at these stations referring to previous studies nunes et al 2012 xu et al 2016 we took the mean value of the error of lai of mod15a2 products which is 23 4 results and discussions 4 1 swh model validation the accuracy of remote sensing based et directly affected the simulation of continuous daily et which was the basis for the next temporal reconstruction works during the two year research period 90 scattered etswh images were derived from the swh model and verified the simulation results through eddy covariance measurements at changwu station fig 3 and table 1 overall the swh model underestimated the et to a certain extent with an mbe of 0 35 mm day 1 and the obvious underestimates mainly occurred in summer this may be because the swh model only considers the water vapor flux from soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration but neglects the water vapor flux from the canopy hu et al 2013 the r 2 and ia between the measured and simulated et were 0 67 and 0 83 respectively with a high correlation and consistency the nrmse mae was 0 21 0 47 mm day 1 indicating that the swh model had adequate simulation performance and could provide a strong foundation for the subsequent temporal reconstruction works 4 2 performance of the four reconstruction methods the daily ec measurements of the changwu flux station were used as a benchmark to evaluate the simulation effect of the continuous daily et obtained by the four reconstruction methods fig 4 fig 5 and table 2 results indicated that for in situ estimates all of the methods successfully simulated daily et during the two year research period r 2 of the four methods were all larger than 0 66 nrmse mae of that were within 0 15 0 45 mm day 1 and ia of that were larger than 0 87 among them the performance of the two interpolation methods etrf and ef method was clearly better than the two calibration methods aa and kp method relatively there were more underestimates in the two calibration methods given all the indices within two years the ef method provided the best performance and was slightly better than the etrf method which was consistent with the results reported by alfieri et al 2017 meanwhile delogu et al 2021 also reported that lower bias was available when using a reference quantity ef directly related to solar radiation in temporal reconstruction works the kp method relied on accurate measurement of crop height and estimation of canopy resistance variables li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 however in practice the information is difficult to measure precisely especially at the regional scale which may be part of the reason why the performance of kp method was inferior to that of aa method the above results represented a baseline case without considering the error from the remotely sensed et estimates when considering the etswh of the 8 day time step the four methods performance was inferior to that based on in situ measurements mainly because the underestimation error from etswh as the base of the et reconstruction propagated into the subsequent temporal reconstruction and led to a general underestimation of all methods overall however the four methods could still effectively reconstruct the time series of daily et derived from etswh compared with the measured daily et at the changwu station nrmse ranged between 0 13 and 0 17 which was in the range of published evaluation of remote sensing estimates of et xu et al 2015 delogu et al 2021 among these four models the aa method showed the highest correlation with an r 2 of 0 7267 and had relatively smaller error indices with an nrmse of 0 1442 and an mae of 0 4402 mm day 1 while the etrf method had the highest consistency with an ia of 0 8448 and same error index with an nrmse of 0 1442 as the aa method the kp method performed slightly worse than the aa method and the ef method performed relatively poorly which differed from the comparative evaluation based on in situ data we investigated the reasons for this difference in section 4 3 additionally the index difference of interpolation reconstruction methods between in situ data based reconstruction and etswh based reconstruction was greater than that of calibration reconstruction methods which indicated that interpolation methods had a higher potential to improve with the improvement of the quality of remote sensing et inputs 4 3 comparison between et distribution simulations the change details of the daily et simulated by the four methods and the measured et over time were shown in fig 6 and fig 7 in general for in situ data the variation trend and magnitude of the four methods simulated et were consistent with the eddy covariance measurements among them both the average value and intra annual change trend of the ef simulation were closest to the ec measurements in spite of the extremely short term underestimates e g 209 216 days in 2005 or overestimates e g 229 232 days in 2008 in summer the et curves simulated by the etrf method were similar to those of the ef method but its fluctuation amplitude was larger and the method s overall performance was slightly inferior to the ef method both the aa method and kp method would not fairly mirror the changes in et peak value especially in 2008 when et values changed rapidly and obviously at this time their et curves fluctuated gently and presented the shape of a single peak generally which was inconsistent with the actual situation the use of remote sensing model estimates etswh as the base of the et reconstruction led to an underestimation of the seasonal et that was smaller than in situ estimates usually for all methods it should be noticed that in this case some overestimates from the reconstruction methods themselves were compensated with the overall underestimation of etswh especially for the aa method aa etswh curve in 2008 therefore leading to relatively smaller errors based on remote sensing estimates however the aa method was still mediocre in describing the fluctuation trend of et peak values and the aa etswh curve was similar to the overall decline of the et curve of in situ estimates aa in situ curve the fluctuation trend of the kp simulation was similar to that of the aa simulation but the decline in kp etswh relative to kp in situ curve was smaller than the decline in aa etswh relative to aa in situ curve and its performance was still inferior to that of the aa method similar performance existed between the two interpolation methods etrf and ef method which were more affected by swh underestimation in summer so mainly underestimates occurred in summer e g 190 199 days in 2005 accordingly it can also be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the etrf method overestimated the results compared to the ef method which may offset the underestimation caused by the swh model and lead to relatively smaller errors considering itself reconstruction mechanism there were greater discrepancies between in situ data based and etswh based reconstruction results for the interpolation methods etrf and ef method which can directly convey the errors from remote sensing based et estimation to the final results as shown in fig 6 there was obvious underestimation from etswh at the key interpolation nodes of days 193 and 201 thus the interpolation modules etrf ef at these nodes were underestimated it led to the daily et for both reconstruction methods being clearly lower than the reconstructed et based on in situ measurements for the 193 201 days in 2005 the two calibration methods aa and kp method performed parameterization with reference to the condition of the whole growing season so that the errors from the remote sensing based model may be evenly distributed to each day and be reduced therefore et derived from the calibration methods was overall less affected by the error from the remote sensing based et estimation and the deviation of calibration methods between in situ data based reconstruction and etswh based reconstruction was less than that of the interpolation methods in this comparison the performance of all methods was consistent with the conclusions in section 4 2 considering all performance we believe that the ef method was the best method for the continuous daily et reconstruction based on in situ in this study while the aa method was the best based on remote sensing estimates 4 4 spatiotemporal variation of et the four temporal reconstruction methods coupling the swh model were used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration in the lpns in each quarter of 2005 and 2008 figs 8 and 9 show that there was an obvious difference in et among different land cover types the spatial and temporal variability characteristics of et simulated by the four methods were relatively consistent spatially except for winter the et was highest in the croplands located in the middle of the south followed by the grasslands in the central and north and finally the forests in the southwest and southeast corners the southern cropland area around luochuan county is mainly planted with winter wheat and spring corn so the et is minimal due to low temperature and young plants in winter that is before the green up date of winter wheat it is slightly lower than et in the forests at the same latitude and greater than that in the grassland in the north of the lpns meanwhile affected by the concentrated precipitation from may to september and vegetation growth the daily et on the whole was ranked in descending order from summer spring autumn and winter between the seasons the evapotranspiration corresponding to different land cover types in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi was simulated based on the optimum aa method and swh model aa etswh model for 2005 and 2008 we extracted and calculated the mean et of each land use type over the whole study area as seen in fig 10 it was consistent with the above spatial distribution of et in agroecosystems evapotranspiration was always at the top in march october when crops were in a period of rapid growth and development with a maximum et value of more than 1 75 mm day 1 in june 2005 the second of that was grasslands with concentrated precipitation from may october the differences in et between the land cover types of closed shrublands forests and savannas were not obvious with the smallest values of that in mixed forests and in winter december to february the evapotranspiration values of all land use types did not differ obviously among them the et corresponding to closed shrublands and deciduous broadleaf forests were slightly higher than that of other types and barren or sparsely vegetated with lower vegetation cover had a minimum et consistently below 0 25 mm day 1 4 5 discussions of coupling mechanisms based on sensitivity analysis method the reconstruction methods above could be effectively used to convert the et of every 8 day satellite overpass day to evapotranspiration with a time resolution of 1 day as reported in different studies by numerous authors however the four methods in this study performed differently as the different reconstruction conversion methods or coupling mechanisms of factors applied in each reconstruction method fig 2 a comparison of methods characteristics was briefly presented in table 3 meanwhile the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of input driving data were performed fig 11 and fig 12 to focus more on uncertainty quantification and propagation of uncertainty of the input drivers on the simulation of the four reconstruction methods observations of the changwu site et in situ were used as a replacement for input et based on remote sensing model in the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis overall the sensitivity of et in situ was highest for all four methods indicating that the et on the satellite overpass days will obviously influence subsequent continuous daily et reconstruction works meanwhile the uncertainty analysis of the input parameters showed that the average relative deviation of et based on the swh model at changwu station 56 was much larger than that of the other meteorological parameters therefore ensuring and improving the accuracy of the et on satellite overpass days major sources of model uncertainty was the first thing for accurate simulation of continuous daily et among the meteorological parameters wind speed had the largest error 29 2 followed by sunshine hours 10 8 and rh 5 2 the maximum and minimum temperature were accurately estimated by the anusplin program with an error of no more than 0 2 indicating weak model uncertainty caused by it fig 12 moreover each method also showed relatively high sensitivity to rh except for the ef method especially the etrf and aa method lai only worked on the calculation of surface resistance in kp method and ultimately affected daily et therefore it was the least sensitive for each method in the etrf method the key module etrf for interpolation was obtained based on etswh and etr fig 2 the etr calculated by various meteorological data such as t rh sd and ws and the etrf method had a solid theoretical basis which combined the regional surface environment level more effectively zhao et al 2020 in addition the sensitivity analysis showed that the etrf method was a more sensitive method to the parameter rh compared to other models thus the method can provide sensitive feedback on capturing the rapid and strong fluctuation trend of evapotranspiration when the water vapor factors on the underlying surface fluctuate violently in summer previous studies have also confirmed that there is a better performance of the etrf method when vegetation is growing and developing rapidly colaizzi et al 2006 xu et al 2015 simultaneously ws and rh introduced the same degree of uncertainty to the etrf method due to the large error in the wind speed itself fig 12 more input factors and higher sensitivity of them were considered to incorporate more uncertainty caused by measurement errors in the driving factors into the results tang et al 2013 and the lack of daily high quality data on these meteorological factors may hinder the method s widespread use moreover considering the synchronization of rain and heat during the fast growing vegetation period the day to day variation of etr is more complex allen et al 2007 therefore the stable operation of the method requires high quality of meteorological data especially in the high temperature and rainy periods in summer alfieri et al 2017 reported that interpolation may be a key source of error when temporal reconstruction was used to estimate the moisture flux between image retrievals delogu et al 2021 also indicated when the interpolation occurred on a cloudy day actual et is underestimated because the stress is lower compared to values predicted with the interpolation thus the brief underestimation from the etrf and ef methods in summer may be explained by the uncertainty of interpolation in contrast the ef method does not need to consider the complex underlying surface resistance and atmospheric environment information only the daily surface available energy and the et of satellite overpass days were needed to obtain the gradual evaporative fraction and then interpolated it to simulated continuous daily et fig 2 table 3 the method had a much simpler computational process and reduced sensitivity from input drivers but the solar radiation term sd fig 11 although such a mechanism may attenuate the sensitivity that capturing the effects of horizontal advection and atmospheric environmental factors e g wind speed vapor pressure deficit on the variations of the available energy in the daily et estimation tang et al 2013 it reduced the uncertainty caused by measurement errors besides many researches on conversing etinst to a daily scale generally pointed out that the ef method usually underestimated et due to the self preservation hypothesis of instantaneous ef during the day gentine et al 2011 van niel et al 2011 xu et al 2015 unlike the above when the ef method reconstructed the time series of daily et the interpolated ef was obtained directly from the daily energy fraction λ e t r n g rather than the instantaneous value at the time of satellite overpass which avoided the error of assuming that the instantaneous ef was relatively constant during the day the above two points may explain why this method showed the best simulation performance in this study tang and li 2017a improved the accuracy of ef method based on the decoupling factor with meteorological factors which provided a reference for further improvement of the ef method the aa method simulated the continuous daily et after a local calibration of empirical coefficients c1 and m1 through the feedback mechanism between et and etp fig 2 compared to such methods as canopy resistance the aa method based on the complementary relationship bypassed the complex and poorly understood soil plant processes and thus did not require soil moisture or vegetation stomatal resistance property data difficult to obtain it only used standard meteorological observations to obtain daily et xu and singh 2005 fig 2 of the eight statistic driving factors the aa method showed the top sensitivity to three of them tmax tmin and ws fig 11 and its sensitivity to tmean rh and sd was also very close to that of the etrf and kp methods this showed that the aa method was relatively sensitive to the statistical drivers in the four reconstruction methods however the coefficients c1 and m1 were calibrated and held constant for the entire growth period ignoring their inter seasonal variation the applicability may be reduced in specific growth stages especially when the water vapor factors on the underlying surface fluctuate violently li et al 2021 also reported that this method does not consider well the characteristics of the specific crops and the underlying conditions of the region in the estimation of crop et this may be the reason why the curves from aa method fluctuated gently and were in the shape of a single peak additionally the aa method does not involve soil moisture in its calculations which results in a decline in its predictive capability in the soil moisture control area i e arid area hobbins et al 2001 the kp method combined the basic meteorological data of the underlying surface and satellite overpass days flux information to obtain r c through the pm method and then calibrated the empirical coefficients locally to simulate the daily et fig 2 in this method basic atmospheric environmental factors such as vapor pressure deficit solar radiation and air temperature were fully considered as well as surface resistance information as the primary link between the pm and kp methods r c was a physiological parameter and had an aerodynamic component tang et al 2017 besides etswh lai also works on surface resistance required by only the kp method fig 2 therefore the method was more sensitive to lai than other methods similar to the aa method the kp method also ignored the seasonal impact on the r c which may also bring changes to a and b coefficient values li et al 2021 proposed calibrating the empirical coefficients of the above two methods in specific growth stages to improve performance liu et al 2012 reported that this method calculates r c with the calibrated eq 17 then incorporates it into the pm method to obtain et indirectly both of the above calculation steps will produce errors these reasons may explain the underestimates and low correlation of this method additionally the kp method required a higher quality of remote sensing based land cover type products for calculating surface resistance but the uncertainty in the accuracy of the products morisette et al 2002 limited the application of the kp method 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to evaluate the four temporal reconstruction methods for the continuous daily et estimation and to provide a methodological reference and mechanism discussion for developing a more accurate and reliable et reconstruction method for in situ estimates the interpolation methods performed obviously better than calibration methods and had a higher potential for improvement among them the ef method showed the best simulation performance the aa method performed better than the kp method and both the two methods underestimated the daily et integrally the use of remotely sensed et estimates etswh as the base of the et reconstruction led to an underestimation of the seasonal et for all methods but also produced compensation effects to a certain extent overall the four methods could still effectively reconstruct the time series of daily et derived from etswh among them the aa method obtained more compensation effects from etswh underestimation therefore performed best with the highest correlation and relatively small errors the performance of kp method was similarly to the aa method and was slightly inferior to the aa method the underestimation of swh may offset more of the overestimation errors existing in the etrf method compared to the ef method which made a relatively large error according to the analysis of the coupling mechanism between the driving data and the methods based on the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods it can be concluded that the most crucial concern in temporal reconstruction works for the continuous daily et is to ensure the accuracy of the et on satellite overpass days additionally the etrf method which could combine the regional surface environment level more effectively had a higher quality requirement for meteorological data when the underlying surface physical parameters change dramatically the ef method which was easy to calculate and reduced the uncertainty caused by measurement errors demonstrated better performance in this study due to the omitted seasonal impact on the calibration coefficients the applicability of the aa method and kp method may be reduced in specific growth stages thus the direction of future research can focus on improving the two method s performance through dividing specific growth stages to calibrate the coefficients moreover the kp method considers the complex surface resistance information and requires a higher quality of remote sensing based land cover products this study was aimed at a typical semi arid district in northwest china which was helpful for improving the efficiency of utilization and management level of local agricultural water resources however these methods may have different performance characteristics under underlying surface conditions in different climatic regions therefore the comparative study on the applicability of temporal reconstruction methods for the continuous daily et in different typical climate regions of the world should be attached great importance in the related research on the time scale continuity of evapotranspiration in the future

9191,increasing grain yield and quality are the two most important objectives in wheat production in this study grain yield processing quality parameters protein component concentration nitrogen uptake and grain nitrogen source were compared under micro sprinkler irrigation msi and conventional border irrigation cbi treatments by field and isotope micro plot experiments the results showed that the msi treatment with late and split application n increased grain yield protein concentration post anthesis nitrogen accumulation amount and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency by 5 8 8 6 42 5 and 15 8 respectively compared with cbi treatment the results of isotope micro plot test showed that the proportion of nitrogen from topdressing nitrogen in mature grains was 30 1 in msi which was 80 6 higher than that of cbi what s more the increase in nitrogen uptake in msi was mainly due to the increase in nitrogen uptake in chaff and grains msi treatment increased the concentrations of protein and its components in grains especially the concentration of storage protein thus resulting in the increase in wet gluten content but did not significantly change grain processing quality parameters in addition msi treatment significantly improved fertilizer nitrogen utilization efficiency by applying topdressing in different stages in general msi management may be an efficient way to simultaneously increase grain yield protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency and stabilize grain processing quality of winter wheat in the north china plain keywords micro sprinkler irrigation 15n yield nitrogen use efficiency wheat quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important staple cereals worldwide contributing to over 45 of the global calories supply and over 40 of the global protein supply http faostat fao org in 2020 china s wheat yield per unit area was 53 6 and 20 9 higher than 10 and 20 years ago respectively https www fao org faostat en data qcl this is mainly due to the improvement of wheat varieties and planting techniques in recent years the focus of china s wheat production has gradually shifted from the pursuit of high grain yield to high processing quality ma et al 2021 however there is always a negative correlation between yield and quality of wheat mosleth et al 2020 barraclough et al 2014 so it is an important goal to solve the contradiction between yield and quality nitrogen is a component of plant structure and metabolic enzymes pask et al 2012 the high yield and high quality of wheat are dependent on the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the effective absorption of nitrogen by wheat according to zörb et al 2018 research wheat needs about 60 kg n ha 1 at tillering stage early jointing stage and booting stage respectively to ensure sufficient tiller number and protein synthesis in the ears and the nitrogen accumulated at maturity derived from fertilizer n and from soils ranged from 34 to 55 and from 44 to 66 respectively jia et al 2011 in the absorbed fertilizer n the base fertilizer n and topdressing n accounted for 15 22 and 16 40 respectively jia et al 2011 in terms of nitrogen remobilization 50 95 of grain n at harvest comes from the remobilization of n stored pre anthesis 5 50 comes from post anthesis n uptake however increasing post anthesis n supply could change this ratio increase the contribution rate of post anthesis n accumulation to grain n accumulation and then increase grain protein concentration kichey et al 2007 in terms of nitrogen application rate the optimal nitrogen application rate for high yield and high efficiency in north china plain is between 180 and 240 kg ha 1 si et al 2020 in terms of nitrogen form lyu et al 2022 found that foliar application of nitrate nitrogen and urea at anthesis could significantly improve grain quality in terms of nitrogen application methods turley et al 2001 found that compared with soil nitrogen supply foliar nitrogen application significantly increased wheat yield and protein concentration in terms of topdressing time delaying topdressing time to jointing stage or even post anthesis could significantly improve the concentration of protein components in grains and baking quality zhong et al 2018 in addition fertilization by stages was an effective strategy to increase the yield and quality of wheat xue et al 2016a garrido lestache et al 2004 however traditional agronomic measures are difficult to integrate these nitrogen management measures to improve grain yield and quality simultaneously fortunately micro sprinkler irrigation msi can well combine these nitrogen management measures so it has great potential to improve the yield and quality of winter wheat simultaneously under the optimized nitrogen application msi is an emerging irrigation method developed in recent years which combines the characteristics of drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation li et al 2018 it can not only achieve a small amount of uniform irrigation for many times but also easily realize the integrated irrigation of water and fertilizer in addition because water and fertilizer pass through the plant canopy it also plays the role of foliar fertilizer a large number of studies have confirmed that msi can significantly improve grain yield and water use efficiency li et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 results from one of our recent studies also showed that msi significantly increased grain yield and protein concentration simultaneously compared to conventional border irrigation li et al 2019 2021 however many studies have shown that the correlation between wheat end use quality and grain protein concentration is very low xue et al 2016b gabriel et al 2017 compared with grain protein concentration grain protein composition can better reflect grain quality xue et al 2016b thanhaeuser et al 2014 according to osborne

wheat quality plessis et al 2013 in china grain protein concentration wet gluten content and dough stabilization time are important parameters to measure the quality of wheat aqsiq 2013 and they also determine the price of wheat recent studies also found that settling value maximum elongation resistance of dough and dough stabilization time are important parameters to reflect wheat quality ma et al 2021 however the effect of micro sprinkler irrigation on the processing quality of winter wheat is still unclear and the character of nitrogen utilization under this mode is not clear which needs to be further studied here we hypothesized that micro sprinkler irrigation could increase grain protein concentration and optimize protein composition by increasing nitrogen uptake thus improving grain processing quality parameters we analyzed the responses of n uptake protein composition and processing quality parameters to different irrigation patterns through field experiments and 15n micro plot tracer experiments specifically this study aimed to 1 clarify the effects of different irrigation methods on the yield and processing quality of winter wheat 2 reveal the nitrogen utilization

method dordas and sioulas 2009 grain protein concentration was calculated as grain n concentration 5 7 the amounts of plant n derived from fertilizer ndff and from soil ndfs were calculated as follows

transfer amount of nitrogen pre anthesis is the difference between the amount of nitrogen accumulation at anthesis and the amount of nitrogen accumulation at maturity the transfer rate was nitrogen transfer amount divided by the nitrogen accumulation at anthesis the amount of nitrogen accumulation post anthesis was the difference between the amount of nitrogen accumulation at maturity and anthesis the contribution of post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation was the ratio between post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation post anthesis nitrogen uptake is the difference between grain nitrogen accumulation and pre anthesis nitrogen transfer 2 4 statistical analysis the effects of irrigation methods i years y and their interactions i y on winter wheat grain yield yield components dry matter and nitrogen accumulation and processing quality parameters were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the 2 way anova general linear model procedure in spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa the independent samples t test was used to test the differences between means of these parameters and all data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance all figures were created by origin2022 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components as shown in table 2 1000 grain weight and grain yield were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y spike number and grains per spike were significantly affected by year y in 2019 2020 wheat plants were infected with diseases from jointing to anthesis so the number of grains per spike was lower than that in 2018 2019 there was similar change trend for grain yield and yield composition in the two years compared with conventional border irrigation cbi treatment micro sprinkler irrigation msi treatment significantly increased grain yield by 4 3 and 7 5 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively while there was no significant difference in spike number and grain number per spike between the two treatments the increase in grain yield was mainly due to the significant increase in 1000 grain weight under msi treatment which increased by 5 7 on average 3 2 dry matter accumulation as shown in table 3 anthesis post anthesis maturity dry matter accumulation and harvest index were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y across the two years post anthesis maturity dry matter accumulation and harvest index increased by 15 4 4 6 and 3 0 respectively under msi relative to cbi while there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation at anthesis so the increase in dry matter accumulation at maturity was mainly due to the increase in post anthesis dry matter accumulation under msi treatment in conclusion msi significantly regulated dry matter production of post anthesis in winter wheat furthermore dry matter accumulation and harvest index at maturity were significantly increased 3 3 nitrogen accumulation and remobilization as shown in table 4 there were significant differences in nitrogen accumulation nitrogen remobilization and utilization in the key growth period of winter wheat under the two irrigation treatments across the two years the nitrogen accumulation at post anthesis maturity and in grain nitrogen harvest index and contribution rate of post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation increased by 42 5 6 8 8 7 1 83 and 37 2 respectively under msi relative to cbi the nitrogen pre anthesis accumulation in cbi treatment was higher than that in msi treatment which was caused by one time top dressing in cbi treatment at jointing stage at the mature stage the nitrogen accumulation of cbi treatment was significantly lower than that of msi because msi treatment increased the water and fertilizer supply post anthesis and thus significantly increased the post anthesis nitrogen accumulation grain nitrogen accumulation and the nitrogen accumulation at maturity the significantly higher contribution rate of post anthesis nitrogen to grains and nitrogen harvest index in msi than in cbi was due to the high nitrogen uptake post anthesis 3 4 proportion and source of nitrogen accumulation 3 4 1 the amount and proportion of nitrogen accumulation in different organs at anthesis and maturity as shown in table 5 at anthesis stage 55 2 of plant nitrogen accumulation in cbi treatment came from fertilizer nitrogen 44 8 from soil nitrogen while in msi treatment 40 2 from fertilizer nitrogen and 59 8 from soil nitrogen the nitrogen uptake of cbi treatment was significantly higher than that of msi treatment and the trend was consistent with field results table 3 it is worth noting that msi treatment decreased fertilizer nitrogen uptake but increased soil n uptake the amount of soil nitrogen absorbed by all organs in msi was significantly higher than that in cbi and the amount of plant nitrogen from soil nitrogen was 26 7 higher than that in cbi thus reducing the supply of fertilizer nitrogen caused the plant to increase the uptake of soil nitrogen at maturity stage 53 5 and 54 8 of plant nitrogen accumulation in cbi and msi treatments came from soil nitrogen respectively and soil nitrogen accounted for more than 53 on the other hand the proportion of nitrogen accumulation from fertilizer nitrogen in cbi treatment decreased from 55 2 at anthesis stage to 46 5 at maturity stage while it increased from 40 2 at anthesis stage to 45 2 at maturity stage in msi treatment indicating that the absorption of fertilizer nitrogen by cbi treatment was weakened while the absorption of fertilizer nitrogen by msi treatment was enhanced post anthesis since the nitrogen uptake from fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen in msi were both higher than that in cbi treatment the total nitrogen uptake in msi treatment was significantly higher than that in cbi treatment at maturity in terms of nitrogen uptake in each organ although the nitrogen uptake in stem and sheath under msi was lower than that under cbi the nitrogen uptake in grains and chaff under msi was significantly higher than that under cbi treatment therefore msi treatment increased plant nitrogen uptake mainly depending on the increase in nitrogen uptake in chaff and grain which was beneficial to increasing grain protein concentration 3 4 2 source and proportion of nitrogen in mature grains in terms of nitrogen sources nitrogen accumulation in mature grains came from soil nitrogen and fertilizer nitrogen in this study fertilizer n included base fertilizer n and topdressing fertilizer n according to fig 2 the proportion of grain nitrogen from soil nitrogen in cbi and msi treatments at the mature stage was over 53 but the composition of soil nitrogen for the two irrigation modes was different the proportion of soil nitrogen remobilization in msi 32 45 was significantly higher than that in cbi 29 86 while the proportion of soil nitrogen absorption in msi 21 01 was significantly lower than that in cbi 24 55 under the two treatments there was no significant difference in the proportion of nitrogen from fertilizer but significant difference occurred in the proportion of nitrogen from base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer in cbi treatment the proportion of nitrogen from base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer was 27 91 and 17 67 respectively in msi the proportion was 16 44 and 30 10 respectively for the basal nitrogen cbi and msi treatments absorbed 1 99 and 0 99 of basal n from fertilizer n post anthesis and there was no significant difference between them therefore winter wheat basically did not absorb basal n from soil at post anthesis the proportion of basal fertilizer nitrogen transfer from pre anthesis organs in cbi treatment 25 92 was significantly higher than that in msi 15 45 the proportion of topdressing n absorbed from fertilizer n post anthesis in msi 24 31 was significantly higher than that in cbi 17 03 it is worth noting that more than 50 of the fertilizer nitrogen absorbed by msi during the nitrogen accumulation in mature grains came from the absorption of post anthesis topdressing nitrogen in conclusion msi treatment increased the supply of water and nitrogen at late growth stage and significantly increased the absorption of topdressing nitrogen and then increased grain nitrogen accumulation 3 5 nitrogen utilization in the 2019 2020 micro plot experiment as shown in fig 3 there was a significant difference in fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency between the two treatments the basal n use efficiency in cbi treatment was significantly higher than that of msi by 23 8 however the topdressing n use efficiency in cbi treatment was significantly lower than msi treatment and it increased by 62 2 in msi compared with cbi treatment in conclusion the use efficiency of topdressing nitrogen can be greatly improved by dividing the topdressing stage into booting stage anthesis stage and filling stage thus significantly improving the use efficiency of fertilizer nitrogen therefore the proportion of base fertilizer n should be appropriately increased under cbi condition while the proportion of topdressing n should be appropriately increased under msi condition 3 6 concentrations of grains protein and its components as shown in table 6 winter wheat grains contain four main proteins and other proteins of which 70 are gliadin and glutenin while albumin globulin and other proteins only account for about 30 across the two years albumin globulin gliadin glutenin and total protein increased by 2 6 3 0 16 1 7 2 and 8 6 respectively under msi relative to cbi the concentrations of albumin globulin gliadin glutenin other proteins and total protein were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y and the concentrations of albumin gliadin glutenin and total protein were significantly affected by irrigation method i msi treatment significantly increased grain protein concentration compared with cbi treatment the main reason was that the storage protein increased under msi moreover the increase in gliadin concentration was greater than that of glutenin 3 7 grain quality as shown in table 7 across the two years msi treatment significantly increased the wet gluten content of flour by 6 4 however msi treatment did not improve the flour parameters and stretch parameters of wheat dough stretch area extensibility maximum tensile resistance wet gluten content stability time and farinograph quality number were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y and stretch area stability time and farinograph quality number were significantly affected by i y msi treatment significantly increased grain protein content and wet gluten content but did not significantly improve grain processing quality parameters which may be due to because msi treatment changed the proportion of storage protein in grains resulting in a relative decrease in the proportion of gluten in grains 4 discussion at anthesis of wheat a large amount of nitrogen is accumulated in the vegetative organs such as stem leaf and ear and this part of nitrogen can reach about 80 of the total nitrogen at maturity stage smith and whitfield 1990 pask et al 2012 the nitrogen accumulated pre anthesis is partly used as structural material in the plant partly as metabolic enzymes and partly as storage material in the organs pask et al 2012 once the wheat enters reproductive growth the stored nitrogen in vegetative organs is hydrolyzed by hydrolase and transported to grains in the form of amino acids to synthesize proteins masclaux et al 2000 in addition to the reoperation of nitrogen in the pre anthesis nutrient organs nitrogen synthesis of grain storage proteins is also derived from post anthesis nitrogen assimilation dupont and altenbach 2003 post anthesis plants will absorb part of nitrogen from the environment and directly participate in the synthesis of grain storage proteins kichey et al 2007 studied 5 wheat varieties with different genotypes and found that the proportion of nitrogen remobilization pre anthesis was 69 8 88 8 similar results were also obtained under field and micro plot experiments in this study the proportion of nitrogen accumulation at maturity stage from pre anthesis nitrogen remobilization in cbi and msi was 63 6 82 6 and 59 1 67 2 respectively and the proportion from post anthesis was 17 4 36 4 and 32 8 40 9 table 4 respectively therefore msi treatment changed the proportion of nitrogen sources reduced pre anthesis nitrogen remobilization and increased the proportion of post anthesis nitrogen uptake from the perspective of exogenous nitrogen winter wheat nitrogen accumulation mainly comes from soil nitrogen jia et al 2011 and the other part comes from artificially added fertilizer nitrogen in this study 15n tracer method was used to determine the nitrogen source of grains at maturity stage and the same result was obtained the nitrogen sources of grains at maturity stage were more than 53 from soil nitrogen in both treatments in addition 24 31 of grain nitrogen accumulation in msi came from topdressing nitrogen absorption while it was 0 64 in cbi fig 2 the yield and quality of wheat are largely determined by the efficiency and amount of nitrogen absorption barraclough et al 2014 zörb et al 2018 there are many nitrogen management strategies including late application of nitrogen zhong et al 2018 split nitrogen xue et al 2016b foliar spraying lyu et al 2022 which aim to further improve nitrogen absorption and nitrogen use efficiency in this study msi treatment was set to move the topdressing nitrogen at the jointing stage in cbi treatment to booting stage anthesis stage and filling stage in different stages and the topdressing nitrogen was sprayed into the plant canopy in the form of foliar fertilizer in a way of integrating water and fertilizer table 1 therefore msi treatment significantly increased grain yield nitrogen accumulation post anthesis and then increased protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency by increasing topdressing nitrogen absorption tables 2 4 and 6 fig 3 in general there was a significant negative correlation between wheat yield and grain protein concentration which could be explained by carbon and nitrogen competition and protein dilution by starch in grains mosleth et al 2020 acreche and slafer 2009 however ciampitti and vyn 2012 pointed out that increasing nitrogen absorption and high nitrogen distribution were two approaches to simultaneously improve grain yield and protein concentration in this study msi significantly increased grain yield and protein concentration by 7 5 and 8 8 respectively compared with cbi treatment tables 2 and 6 as our previous results showed msi treatment significantly increased post anthesis nitrogen accumulation and the increase of grain protein accumulation was greater than the increase of grain yield under msi thus achieving the synergistic increase of grain yield and protein concentration and the increase in grain yield was because msi significantly increased grain weight but had no significant effect on spike number and grain number per spike li et al 2021 the result of this study was similar to those of previous studies and this synergistic increase was related to nitrogen uptake post anthesis analysis of protein components showed that msi mainly increased the concentrations of gliadin and glutenin and then significantly increased the total protein concentration of grains table 6 however a growing number of studies show that the increase of protein concentration does not necessarily improve the processing quality xue et al 2016a gabriel et al 2017 compared with grain protein concentration protein component concentration and proportion can better reflect wheat baking quality xue et al 2016a especially gliadin and glutenin because they are storage proteins and are the building blocks of gluten goesaert et al 2005 gluten is formed by high molecular weight hmw gs and low molecular weight gluten subunits lmw gs which are cross linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds hmw gs plays an important role in determining dough strength and accounts for 45 70 of the variation in bread making properties payne et al 1988 millar 2003 showed that the grain processing and bread baking quality were better with high hmw gs lmw gs and low gliadin glutenin in this study msi treatment significantly increased grain storage protein concentration and thus further increased grain wet gluten content tables 6 and 7 however there was no significant difference in processing quality parameters such as stability time and stretch area between the two treatments this may be caused by the increased contents of gliadin and lmw gs in msi treatment which will be further investigated in our future work 5 conclusion compared with conventional border irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation with late and split application n fertilizer significantly increased grain yield protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency field and isotope micro field experiments showed that msi treatment increased the uptake of nitrogen post anthesis especially the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen and then significantly increased grains and total nitrogen accumulation as well as the concentrations of protein components especially storage protein concentration however grain processing quality was not significantly changed therefore micro sprinkler irrigation with water and nitrogen supply at late growth stage may be an efficient way to simultaneously increase grain yield protein concentration and

9191,increasing grain yield and quality are the two most important objectives in wheat production in this study grain yield processing quality parameters protein component concentration nitrogen uptake and grain nitrogen source were compared under micro sprinkler irrigation msi and conventional border irrigation cbi treatments by field and isotope micro plot experiments the results showed that the msi treatment with late and split application n increased grain yield protein concentration post anthesis nitrogen accumulation amount and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency by 5 8 8 6 42 5 and 15 8 respectively compared with cbi treatment the results of isotope micro plot test showed that the proportion of nitrogen from topdressing nitrogen in mature grains was 30 1 in msi which was 80 6 higher than that of cbi what s more the increase in nitrogen uptake in msi was mainly due to the increase in nitrogen uptake in chaff and grains msi treatment increased the concentrations of protein and its components in grains especially the concentration of storage protein thus resulting in the increase in wet gluten content but did not significantly change grain processing quality parameters in addition msi treatment significantly improved fertilizer nitrogen utilization efficiency by applying topdressing in different stages in general msi management may be an efficient way to simultaneously increase grain yield protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency and stabilize grain processing quality of winter wheat in the north china plain keywords micro sprinkler irrigation 15n yield nitrogen use efficiency wheat quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important staple cereals worldwide contributing to over 45 of the global calories supply and over 40 of the global protein supply http faostat fao org in 2020 china s wheat yield per unit area was 53 6 and 20 9 higher than 10 and 20 years ago respectively https www fao org faostat en data qcl this is mainly due to the improvement of wheat varieties and planting techniques in recent years the focus of china s wheat production has gradually shifted from the pursuit of high grain yield to high processing quality ma et al 2021 however there is always a negative correlation between yield and quality of wheat mosleth et al 2020 barraclough et al 2014 so it is an important goal to solve the contradiction between yield and quality nitrogen is a component of plant structure and metabolic enzymes pask et al 2012 the high yield and high quality of wheat are dependent on the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the effective absorption of nitrogen by wheat according to zörb et al 2018 research wheat needs about 60 kg n ha 1 at tillering stage early jointing stage and booting stage respectively to ensure sufficient tiller number and protein synthesis in the ears and the nitrogen accumulated at maturity derived from fertilizer n and from soils ranged from 34 to 55 and from 44 to 66 respectively jia et al 2011 in the absorbed fertilizer n the base fertilizer n and topdressing n accounted for 15 22 and 16 40 respectively jia et al 2011 in terms of nitrogen remobilization 50 95 of grain n at harvest comes from the remobilization of n stored pre anthesis 5 50 comes from post anthesis n uptake however increasing post anthesis n supply could change this ratio increase the contribution rate of post anthesis n accumulation to grain n accumulation and then increase grain protein concentration kichey et al 2007 in terms of nitrogen application rate the optimal nitrogen application rate for high yield and high efficiency in north china plain is between 180 and 240 kg ha 1 si et al 2020 in terms of nitrogen form lyu et al 2022 found that foliar application of nitrate nitrogen and urea at anthesis could significantly improve grain quality in terms of nitrogen application methods turley et al 2001 found that compared with soil nitrogen supply foliar nitrogen application significantly increased wheat yield and protein concentration in terms of topdressing time delaying topdressing time to jointing stage or even post anthesis could significantly improve the concentration of protein components in grains and baking quality zhong et al 2018 in addition fertilization by stages was an effective strategy to increase the yield and quality of wheat xue et al 2016a garrido lestache et al 2004 however traditional agronomic measures are difficult to integrate these nitrogen management measures to improve grain yield and quality simultaneously fortunately micro sprinkler irrigation msi can well combine these nitrogen management measures so it has great potential to improve the yield and quality of winter wheat simultaneously under the optimized nitrogen application msi is an emerging irrigation method developed in recent years which combines the characteristics of drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation li et al 2018 it can not only achieve a small amount of uniform irrigation for many times but also easily realize the integrated irrigation of water and fertilizer in addition because water and fertilizer pass through the plant canopy it also plays the role of foliar fertilizer a large number of studies have confirmed that msi can significantly improve grain yield and water use efficiency li et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 results from one of our recent studies also showed that msi significantly increased grain yield and protein concentration simultaneously compared to conventional border irrigation li et al 2019 2021 however many studies have shown that the correlation between wheat end use quality and grain protein concentration is very low xue et al 2016b gabriel et al 2017 compared with grain protein concentration grain protein composition can better reflect grain quality xue et al 2016b thanhaeuser et al 2014 according to osborne 1908 research wheat grain protein is divided into albumin globulin gliadin and glutenin as storage proteins gliadin and glutenin determine the elasticity and ductility of dough and are key proteins of wheat quality plessis et al 2013 in china grain protein concentration wet gluten content and dough stabilization time are important parameters to measure the quality of wheat aqsiq 2013 and they also determine the price of wheat recent studies also found that settling value maximum elongation resistance of dough and dough stabilization time are important parameters to reflect wheat quality ma et al 2021 however the effect of micro sprinkler irrigation on the processing quality of winter wheat is still unclear and the character of nitrogen utilization under this mode is not clear which needs to be further studied here we hypothesized that micro sprinkler irrigation could increase grain protein concentration and optimize protein composition by increasing nitrogen uptake thus improving

method dordas and sioulas 2009 grain protein concentration was calculated as grain n concentration 5 7 the amounts of plant n derived from fertilizer ndff and from soil ndfs were calculated as follows hauck and bremner 1976 1 ndff b a c a 100 where a is the 15n natural abundance b is the 15n atom percent excess in the plant organs stem and sheath leaf grain chaff and c is the 15n atom percent

ndff 15nt 5 ndfs 100 plant ndff 6 nre nf f 100 where nre is the n recovery efficiency nf is the total plant n uptake derived from 15n fertilizer and f is the fertilizer rate nitrogen accumulation na was calculated following ruisi et al 2016 7 na dmc nc 8 grain n gy nc where dmc is the dm accumulation of the plant components and nc is the n concentration of the plant components total na at anthesis and maturity was calculated as the sum of na in each organ of the plant the n harvest index nhi was calculated as the ratio of grain n to total aboveground na at maturity dordas 2012 the transfer amount of nitrogen pre anthesis is the difference between the amount of nitrogen accumulation at anthesis and the amount of nitrogen accumulation at maturity the transfer rate was nitrogen transfer amount divided by the nitrogen accumulation at anthesis the amount of nitrogen accumulation post anthesis was the difference between the amount of nitrogen accumulation at maturity and anthesis the contribution of post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation was the ratio between post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation post anthesis nitrogen uptake is the difference between grain nitrogen accumulation and pre anthesis nitrogen transfer 2 4 statistical analysis the effects of irrigation methods i years y and their interactions i y on winter wheat grain yield yield components dry matter and nitrogen accumulation and processing quality parameters were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the 2 way anova general linear model procedure in spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa the independent samples t test was used to test the differences between means of these parameters and all data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance all figures were created by origin2022 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 grain yield and yield components as shown in table 2 1000 grain weight and grain yield were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y spike number and grains per spike were significantly affected by year y in 2019 2020 wheat plants were infected with diseases from jointing to anthesis so the number of grains per spike was lower than that in 2018 2019 there was similar change trend for grain yield and yield composition in the two years compared with conventional border irrigation cbi treatment micro sprinkler irrigation msi treatment significantly increased grain yield by 4 3 and 7 5 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively while there was no significant difference in spike number and grain number per spike between the two treatments the increase in grain yield was mainly due to the significant increase in 1000 grain weight under msi treatment which increased by 5 7 on average 3 2 dry matter accumulation as shown in table 3 anthesis post anthesis maturity dry matter accumulation and harvest index were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y across the two years post anthesis maturity dry matter accumulation and harvest index increased by 15 4 4 6 and 3 0 respectively under msi relative to cbi while there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation at anthesis so the increase in dry matter accumulation at maturity was mainly due to the increase in post anthesis dry matter accumulation under msi treatment in conclusion msi significantly regulated dry matter production of post anthesis in winter wheat furthermore dry matter accumulation and harvest index at maturity were significantly increased 3 3 nitrogen accumulation and remobilization as shown in table 4 there were significant differences in nitrogen accumulation nitrogen remobilization and utilization in the key growth period of winter wheat under the two irrigation treatments across the two years the nitrogen accumulation at post anthesis maturity and in grain nitrogen harvest index and contribution rate of post anthesis nitrogen accumulation to grain nitrogen accumulation increased by 42 5 6 8 8 7 1 83 and 37 2 respectively under msi relative to cbi the nitrogen pre anthesis accumulation in cbi treatment was higher than that in msi treatment which was caused by one time top dressing in cbi treatment at jointing stage at the mature stage the nitrogen accumulation of cbi treatment was significantly lower than that of msi because msi treatment increased the water and fertilizer supply post anthesis and thus significantly increased the post anthesis nitrogen accumulation grain nitrogen accumulation and the nitrogen accumulation at maturity the significantly higher contribution rate of post anthesis nitrogen to grains and nitrogen harvest index in msi than in cbi was due to the high nitrogen uptake post anthesis 3 4 proportion and source of nitrogen accumulation 3 4 1 the amount and proportion of nitrogen accumulation in different organs at anthesis and maturity as shown in table 5 at anthesis stage 55 2 of plant nitrogen accumulation in cbi treatment came from fertilizer nitrogen 44 8 from soil nitrogen while in msi treatment 40 2 from fertilizer nitrogen and 59 8 from soil nitrogen the nitrogen uptake of cbi treatment was significantly higher than that of msi treatment and the trend was consistent with field results table 3 it is worth noting that msi treatment decreased fertilizer nitrogen uptake but increased soil n uptake the amount of soil nitrogen absorbed by all organs in msi was significantly higher than that in cbi and the amount of plant nitrogen from soil nitrogen was 26 7 higher than that in cbi thus reducing the supply of fertilizer nitrogen caused the plant to increase the uptake of soil nitrogen at maturity stage 53 5 and 54 8 of plant nitrogen accumulation in cbi and msi treatments came from soil nitrogen respectively and soil nitrogen accounted for more than 53 on the other hand the proportion of nitrogen accumulation from fertilizer nitrogen in cbi treatment decreased from 55 2 at anthesis stage to 46 5 at maturity stage while it increased from 40 2 at anthesis stage to 45 2 at maturity stage in msi treatment indicating that the absorption of fertilizer nitrogen by cbi treatment was weakened while the absorption of fertilizer nitrogen by msi treatment was enhanced post anthesis since the nitrogen uptake from fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen in msi were both higher than that in cbi treatment the total nitrogen uptake in msi treatment was significantly higher than that in cbi treatment at maturity in terms of nitrogen uptake in each organ although the nitrogen uptake in stem and sheath under msi was lower than that under cbi the nitrogen uptake in grains and chaff under msi was significantly higher than that under cbi treatment therefore msi treatment increased plant nitrogen uptake mainly depending on the increase in nitrogen uptake in chaff and grain which was beneficial to increasing grain protein concentration 3 4 2 source and proportion of nitrogen in mature grains in terms of nitrogen sources nitrogen accumulation in mature grains came from soil nitrogen and fertilizer nitrogen in this study fertilizer n included base fertilizer n and topdressing fertilizer n according to fig 2 the proportion of grain nitrogen from soil nitrogen in cbi and msi treatments at the mature stage was over 53 but the composition of soil nitrogen for the two irrigation modes was different the proportion of soil nitrogen remobilization in msi 32 45 was significantly higher than that in cbi 29 86 while the proportion of soil nitrogen absorption in msi 21 01 was significantly lower than that in cbi 24 55 under the two treatments there was no significant difference in the proportion of nitrogen from fertilizer but significant difference occurred in the proportion of nitrogen from base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer in cbi treatment the proportion of nitrogen from base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer was 27 91 and 17 67 respectively in msi the proportion was 16 44 and 30 10 respectively for the basal nitrogen cbi and msi treatments absorbed 1 99 and 0 99 of basal n from fertilizer n post anthesis and there was no significant difference between them therefore winter wheat basically did not absorb basal n from soil at post anthesis the proportion of basal fertilizer nitrogen transfer from pre anthesis organs in cbi treatment 25 92 was significantly higher than that in msi 15 45 the proportion of topdressing n absorbed from fertilizer n post anthesis in msi 24 31 was significantly higher than that in cbi 17 03 it is worth noting that more than 50 of the fertilizer nitrogen absorbed by msi during the nitrogen accumulation in mature grains came from the absorption of post anthesis topdressing nitrogen in conclusion msi treatment increased the supply of water and nitrogen at late growth stage and significantly increased the absorption of topdressing nitrogen and then increased grain nitrogen accumulation 3 5 nitrogen utilization in the 2019 2020 micro plot experiment as shown in fig 3 there was a significant difference in fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency between the two treatments the basal n use efficiency in cbi treatment was significantly higher than that of msi by 23 8 however the topdressing n use efficiency in cbi treatment was significantly lower than msi treatment and it increased by 62 2 in msi compared with cbi treatment in conclusion the use efficiency of topdressing nitrogen can be greatly improved by dividing the topdressing stage into booting stage anthesis stage and filling stage thus significantly improving the use efficiency of fertilizer nitrogen therefore the proportion of base fertilizer n should be appropriately increased under cbi condition while the proportion of topdressing n should be appropriately increased under msi condition 3 6 concentrations of grains protein and its components as shown in table 6 winter wheat grains contain four main proteins and other proteins of which 70 are gliadin and glutenin while albumin globulin and other proteins only account for about 30 across the two years albumin globulin gliadin glutenin and total protein increased by 2 6 3 0 16 1 7 2 and 8 6 respectively under msi relative to cbi the concentrations of albumin globulin gliadin glutenin other proteins and total protein were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y and the concentrations of albumin gliadin glutenin and total protein were significantly affected by irrigation method i msi treatment significantly increased grain protein concentration compared with cbi treatment the main reason was that the storage protein increased under msi moreover the increase in gliadin concentration was greater than that of glutenin 3 7 grain quality as shown in table 7 across the two years msi treatment significantly increased the wet gluten content of flour by 6 4 however msi treatment did not improve the flour parameters and stretch parameters of wheat dough stretch area extensibility maximum tensile resistance wet gluten content stability time and farinograph quality number were significantly affected by irrigation method i and year y and stretch area stability time and farinograph quality number were significantly affected by i y msi treatment significantly increased grain protein content and wet gluten content but did not significantly improve grain processing quality parameters which may be due to because msi treatment changed the proportion of storage protein in grains resulting in a relative decrease in the proportion of gluten in grains 4 discussion at anthesis of wheat a large amount of nitrogen is accumulated in the vegetative organs such as stem leaf and ear and this part of nitrogen can reach about 80 of the total nitrogen at maturity stage smith and whitfield 1990 pask et al 2012 the nitrogen accumulated pre anthesis is partly used as structural material in the plant partly as metabolic enzymes and partly as storage material in the organs pask et al 2012 once the wheat enters reproductive growth the stored nitrogen in vegetative organs is hydrolyzed by hydrolase and transported to grains in the form of amino acids to synthesize proteins masclaux et al 2000 in addition to the reoperation of nitrogen in the pre anthesis nutrient organs nitrogen synthesis of grain storage proteins is also derived from post anthesis nitrogen assimilation dupont and altenbach 2003 post anthesis plants will absorb part of nitrogen from the environment and directly participate in the synthesis of grain storage proteins kichey et al 2007 studied 5 wheat varieties with different genotypes and found that the proportion of nitrogen remobilization pre anthesis was 69 8 88 8 similar results were also obtained under field and micro plot experiments in this study the proportion of nitrogen accumulation at maturity stage from pre anthesis nitrogen remobilization in cbi and msi was 63 6 82 6 and 59 1 67 2 respectively and the proportion from post anthesis was 17 4 36 4 and 32 8 40 9 table 4 respectively therefore msi treatment changed the proportion of nitrogen sources reduced pre anthesis nitrogen remobilization and increased the proportion of post anthesis nitrogen uptake from the perspective of exogenous nitrogen winter wheat nitrogen accumulation mainly comes from soil nitrogen jia et al 2011 and the other part comes from artificially added fertilizer nitrogen in this study 15n tracer method was used to determine the nitrogen source of grains at maturity stage and the same result was obtained the nitrogen sources of grains at maturity stage were more than 53 from soil nitrogen in both treatments in addition 24 31 of grain nitrogen accumulation in msi came from topdressing nitrogen absorption while it was 0 64 in cbi fig 2 the yield and quality of wheat are largely determined by the efficiency and amount of nitrogen absorption barraclough et al 2014 zörb et al 2018 there are many nitrogen management strategies including late application of nitrogen zhong et al 2018 split nitrogen xue et al 2016b foliar spraying lyu et al 2022 which aim to further improve nitrogen absorption and nitrogen use efficiency in this study msi treatment was set to move the topdressing nitrogen at the jointing stage in cbi treatment to booting stage anthesis stage and filling stage in different stages and the topdressing nitrogen was sprayed into the plant canopy in the form of foliar fertilizer in a way of integrating water and fertilizer table 1 therefore msi treatment significantly increased grain yield nitrogen accumulation post anthesis and then increased protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency by increasing topdressing nitrogen absorption tables 2 4 and 6 fig 3 in general there was a significant negative correlation between wheat yield and grain protein concentration which could be explained by carbon and nitrogen competition and protein dilution by starch in grains mosleth et al 2020 acreche and slafer 2009 however ciampitti and vyn 2012 pointed out that increasing nitrogen absorption and high nitrogen distribution were two approaches to simultaneously improve grain yield and protein concentration in this study msi significantly increased grain yield and protein concentration by 7 5 and 8 8 respectively compared with cbi treatment tables 2 and 6 as our previous results showed msi treatment significantly increased post anthesis nitrogen accumulation and the increase of grain protein accumulation was greater than the increase of grain yield under msi thus achieving the synergistic increase of grain yield and protein concentration and the increase in grain yield was because msi significantly increased grain weight but had no significant effect on spike number and grain number per spike li et al 2021 the result of this study was similar to those of previous studies and this synergistic increase was related to nitrogen uptake post anthesis analysis of protein components showed that msi mainly increased the concentrations of gliadin and glutenin and then significantly increased the total protein concentration of grains table 6 however a growing number of studies show that the increase of protein concentration does not necessarily improve the processing quality xue et al 2016a gabriel et al 2017 compared with grain protein concentration protein component concentration and proportion can better reflect wheat baking quality xue et al 2016a especially gliadin and glutenin because they are storage proteins and are the building blocks of gluten goesaert et al 2005 gluten is formed by high molecular weight hmw gs and low molecular weight gluten subunits lmw gs which are cross linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds hmw gs plays an important role in determining dough strength and accounts for 45 70 of the variation in bread making properties payne et al 1988 millar 2003 showed that the grain processing and bread baking quality were better with high hmw gs lmw gs and low gliadin glutenin in this study msi treatment significantly increased grain storage protein concentration and thus further increased grain wet gluten content tables 6 and 7 however there was no significant difference in processing quality parameters such as stability time and stretch area between the two treatments this may be caused by the increased contents of gliadin and lmw gs in msi treatment which will be further investigated in our future work 5 conclusion compared with conventional border irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation with late and split application n fertilizer significantly increased grain yield protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency field and isotope micro field experiments showed that msi treatment increased the uptake of nitrogen post anthesis especially the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen and then significantly increased grains and total nitrogen accumulation as well as the concentrations of protein components especially storage protein concentration however grain processing quality was not significantly changed therefore micro sprinkler irrigation with water and nitrogen supply at late growth stage may be an efficient way to simultaneously increase grain yield protein concentration and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency and stabilize grain processing quality of winter wheat in the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9192,in regions with a strong seasonal or interannual asymmetry in the distribution of precipitation and higher frequency of droughts collective irrigation systems are vital infrastructures for agricultural activity although operating for decades several systems have ageing infrastructures with relevant water losses and pumping energy inefficiencies consequently the systems are not adequately designed or operated to meet current and future water demand therefore rehabilitation to improve water and energy efficiency while ensuring infrastructure economic sustainability and service quality is crucial in this sense comprehensive approaches using performance assessment to support the planning process or benchmarking between water users associations play an essential role in improving efficiency in collective irrigation systems however few methodologies assess interdependencies between water losses energy efficiency infrastructure condition service quality economic and operational dimensions additionally these approaches rarely were applied to the different stages of the planning process diagnosis planning monitoring and reviewing the impact of measures and to different types of collective irrigation systems gravity pressurised combined for comparative analysis this paper presents a comprehensive performance assessment system pas for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems afterwards the pas is applied for diagnosis and prioritisation of alternatives to enhance the efficiency of a gravity system the results indicate significant water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges and leakage in canals and low pressure pipes related to network ageing and insufficient flow monitoring and control for the gravity system ranking allowed identifying the gravity network area with high priority of intervention due to poor performance in non revenue water water losses due to discharges energy efficiency of pumping stations and system energy in excess several alternatives were studied for this network area and infrastructural solutions involving canal rehabilitation and water discharge control significantly impact global performance improvement besides the substantial investment associated subsequently the pas is used for comparing gravity and pressurised systems in opposition to gravity the pressurised system with efficient use of water resources presents a poor performance in pumping energy efficiency furthermore the significant energy

portugal whose water demand represents between 40 and 80 of its average annual water availability presents high exposure to water stress in the future due to recurrent drought events and increased water consumption gassert et al 2013 according to the national water plan decree law no 76 2016 in dr 2016 the agriculture and livestock sector used 3390 hm3 year corresponding to 74 of the available water volume between 2012 and 2016 moreover climate scenarios for the next decades indicate a reduction in precipitation which might reach between 15 and 30 in the southern region fcg 2020 a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature leads to an increase in evapotranspiration and higher demand for irrigation therefore problems related to water scarcity due to environmental challenges and climate variability and ageing irrigation infrastructures highlight the need to improve efficiency in water and energy use in collective irrigation systems ciss and private irrigation systems as identified by the common agricultural policy strategic plan gpp 2020 and the national strategy for irrigation until 2050 fenareg 2019 in portugal the equipped area for irrigation corresponds to 626

comprehensive assessment of the impact of improvement measures ought to contribute to the observed energy increase in recent decades wuas and the end users namely the irrigators have focused on irrigation systems modernisation to improve water use efficiency and ensure on demand service without a relevant concern for energy consumption and efficiency rocamora et al 2013 levidow et al 2014 tarjuelo et al 2015 furthermore main efforts to improve efficiency in water use have been focused on the farmer level bjornlund et al 2009 speelman et al 2008 benouniche et al 2014 thereby it is essential to efficiently manage ciss for higher water and energy savings in abstraction storage transport and water distribution to end users however unlike the urban water systems there is a lack of integrated approaches that systematically quantify water and energy inefficiencies identify network areas with high priority for intervention and support planning and monitoring improvement measures in those infrastructures for instance speelman et al 2008 nam et al 2016 and zema et al 2019 focus on the water use related aspects namely the water delivery quantification and low cost measures neglecting the importance of integrated quantification of the water and energy inefficiencies in addition isolated and decoupled solutions may conflict with wuas objectives e g like for like pump replacement without reducing downstream water losses may lead to high investment and operation costs compared to an alternative involving water loss control and adequate pump design and replacement

almeida et al 2017 santos 2021 and energy inefficiencies in urban water systems loureiro et al 2020 in irrigation performance assessment in water and energy use has been proposed in some studies malano and burton 2001 malano et al 2004 córcoles et al 2010 borgia et al 2013 2020 however some are focused only on the irrigator level rodriguez diaz et al 2011 parra et al 2020 even when specific pis to evaluate water and energy use have been developed in ciss córcoles et al 2010 rodriguez diaz et al 2011 fernández pacheco et al 2015 zema et al 2018 the impact of water losses network layout and operation on energy efficiency was not assessed disregarding the water and energy nexus existing pis for ciss do not consider water loss components e g evaporation real losses due to discharges and leakage metering errors and the energy inefficiency components e g pump and hydropower inefficiencies energy dissipated due to water and head losses that occur throughout the network until the water intakes i e point of delivery to users recent contributions to water and energy balance for collective irrigation systems allow estimating these components during the irrigation period and enable the calculation of new pis cunha et al 2019a 2019b the water balance cunha et al 2019a estimates billed authorised consumption and non revenue components i e the volume associated with unbilled authorised consumption evaporation losses apparent losses and real losses relative to system input volume apparent losses include inaccuracies related to users metering and unauthorised consumption whereas real losses include canal and pipe leakage and discharges in canals and intermediate reservoirs the energy balance cunha et al 2019b mamade et al 2017 allows for estimating the minimum required energy to ensure the service to users and energy supplied in excess relative to system input energy i e natural shaft input energy the energy supplied in excess may be associated with water losses dissipated due to head losses or energy inefficiencies in pumping stations or hydraulic turbines first steps were given to establish a pas for ciss córcoles et al 2010 rodríguez díaz et al 2011 zema et al 2018 these studies also performed useful statistical analysis to reduce the number of pis and group wuas these studies constitute important steps for developing a pas with essential information and defining reference values however besides the economic impact of water and energy inefficiencies the relations with other dimensions should also be assessed namely on operation and infrastructure resources efficiency and quality of service thus a comprehensive pas to support planning in wuas or comparative analysis between utilities of cis from different contexts is still missing this paper presents and tests a pas for water and energy efficiency assessment based on trustworthy and well organised information for collective irrigation systems the pas was developed under a co production environment of researchers irrigation systems managers and irrigators in the scope of a research project aligned with the objectives of wuas this pas integrates a water utility profile a cis profile a set of criteria and a set of new pis to assess the impact of water and energy inefficiencies in economic infrastructural operational resources efficiency and quality of service dimensions and reference values that consider different types of ciss gravity pressurised combined the main contributions of this paper correspond to the proposal and application of a comprehensive framework for assessing the water and energy efficiency use and its practical application in a cis to support diagnosis and decision about measures to improve water and energy efficiency and for comparative analysis between ciss this work was motivated by the lack of a framework for systematic assessment of water and energy inefficiencies and their relations with economic infrastructural and service dimensions and support the management of ciss infrastructures associated with abstraction intermediate storage transport and distribution of water to end users this pas brings a new mindset to the irrigation market at the national and international levels to support benchmarking between wuas and planning of water and energy efficiency measures considering the impact on the multiple dimensions of the service provided besides the current section this paper presents the pas developed for ciss and the approach for diagnosis and decision support in the material and methods section in the results section two different applications of the assessment system are discussed the first application involves applying the pas for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve efficiency in a gravity cis the second application presents a comparative analysis between ciss considering the corporate objectives to highlight the significant water losses and energy inefficiency problems two ciss were selected for demonstration in this latter application a traditional gravity system and a pressurised gravity system finally the conclusions are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 performance assessment system pas the pas proposed in this study is driven by the organisational objectives of wuas and based on clearly defined data internal or external to the water utility including assessment criteria pis and reference values focused on the efficiency and effectiveness assessment according to each criterion only essential and complementary pis were selected for the evaluation avoiding redundant information consequently diagnosis and decision making should be based on the joint analysis of pis that integrate the pas considering context information provided in water utility and cis profiles fig 1 besides the water and energy efficiency dimensions the pas proposes a comprehensive set of pis that influence water losses and energy inefficiencies e g infrastructural dimension or are influenced by these inefficiency problems e g economic quality of service dimensions a comprehensive assessment system ensures that efficiency issues are not seen in isolation and that improvement solutions do not conflict with wuas objectives pis were proposed based on the preliminary diagnosis of three different cis gravity pressurised combined in the scope of a national research project about assessment of water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems agir afterwards pis formulation and results were discussed with a panel of specialists in ciss from the national authority for irrigation wuas irrigators national associations in the sector and academic institutions within the scope of the research project to have a first perception of the application in different ciss and contexts the pas comprises 14 variables describing the water utility profile 19 variables in the cis profile and 20 pis a schematic representation of the pas components and data flow is presented in fig 1 the water utility profile table 1 includes essential information about the water utility responsible for the service the contract period and end users types since the focus is on the water utility the number of irrigators deg07 the billed authorised consumption dbh02 pah01 pah02 and the average irrigated area pah03 also cover information about irrigated areas that collect water from the system but do not benefit from the irrigation infrastructure moreover since the objective is to assess energy costs and consumption for cis operation relatively to annual operational costs and energy produced by the water utility these last variables pah04 pa05 are calculated for the analysis year and not only for the irrigation period besides the regional aspects the collective irrigation system profile table 2 includes information about the licence for the use of water resources the operation start date characteristics of the water supply infrastructure for irrigation including abstraction conveyance and distribution area equipped with a collective irrigation system irrigation period and volume licensed for water abstraction it also includes some variables that characterise the coverage of end use points with water metres annual irrigation shortage and the potential to use water for reuse the pis are the key elements of the pas and they were established according to wuas service objectives i sustainability of service provision obj 1 ii sustainability in the use of water and energy obj 2 iii adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users obj 3 the objectives were defined under a co production environment of researchers wuas and irrigators during the agir project the objectives reflect the vision and mission of water utilities not only water and energy efficiency goals a set of relevant dimensions assessment criteria to assess objectives and respective performance indicators pis are proposed to measure the water and energy efficiency and effectiveness in the service provided table 3 for the criteria identification the first digit corresponds to the respective objective pis should be assessed for the year relative to the irrigation period under analysis the total costs coverage ah01 infrastructure value index ah05 pumping groups value index ah06 and network rehabilitation ah08 based on ersar and lnec 2021 should be calculated with yearly data rehabilitation interventions may occur outside the irrigation period and should be considered in the analysis year to ensure the service during the irrigation period additionally since the irrigation period varies between years for the same cis and between ciss network failures ah07 failures in pumping groups ah13 and service interruptions ah19 adapted from alegre et al 2017 were normalised for a one year time interval the pas encompass novel pis to highlight the main components of water losses in ciss due to canal or pipe leakage ah09 ah10 associated with infrastructural sustainability and water discharges in canals and reservoirs ah11 related to operational and maintenance sustainability criterium also non revenue water ah04 i e the volume due to authorised unbilled consumption evaporation apparent and real losses is used to assess the economic financial sustainability traducing an essential relationship between water and energy efficiency and the sustainability of service provision in addition water loss components responsible for the efficiency in the use of water resources real and evaporation losses ah14 is also considered to assess the fulfilment in terms of sustainability in the use of water and energy cunha et al 2019a presented a comprehensive approach for water balance calculation and estimating water loss variables used in the pis listed in table 3 the infrastructure value index ah05 represents the average age of the pipe and canal network through the devaluation degree alegre et al 2014 values close to 1 mean that the network is new and low values i e below 0 2 indicate that the average age of the network is high and significant investment in rehabilitation may be necessary ideally the value should be close to 0 5 the same rationale was adopted for pumping groups value index failures in canals pipes valves and fittings that require interruption of transport and distribution service should be considered for the calculation of ah07 independently of duration in contrast service interruption with a duration higher than one day and independent of the cause internal or external to the cis should be considered to calculate service interruptions ah19 besides assessing pump equipment efficiency ah15 the energy supplied in excess ah16 requires energy balance calculation cunha et al 2019b it includes the energy associated with water losses inefficiencies in pumping stations and hydraulic turbines continuous and singular head losses and the surplus energy delivered relevant in the case of pressurised irrigation systems table 4 proposes reference values for each pi reference values can be expressed into performance intervals and have the same units of the respective pi these reference values allow converting pis into a three level grade good green circle fair yellow circle poor red circle by comparing each pi value with the reference values some pis have different reference values regarding the cis type gravity pressurised or combined even though the conveyance and distribution networks are generally in canal low pressure pipe networks e g 1 m may also exist in the gravity system the pipe network can also have punctual pumping pressurised systems have high pressure conveyance and distribution pipe networks e g above 30 m in combined systems gravity and pressurised systems can coexist for ah04 ah10 ah11 ah14 and ah16 pis reference intervals for combined systems depend on the reference values for gravity and pressurised systems weighted by the respective network length according to 1 where α is the proportion of network length in gravity given by l g l g l p l g and l p km the network length in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g good and ll p good are the lower and ul g good and ul p good the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with good performance in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g fair and ll p fair are the lower and ul g fair and ul p fair the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with fair performance in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g poor and ll p poor are the lower and ul g poor and ul p poor the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with poor performance in gravity and pressurised respectively for example using equation 1 the reference values associated with non revenue water ah04 in a combined system with a network with 100 km in gravity and 300 km in pressure are the following values were estimated based on the references mentioned in table 4 for some pis ah12 ah13 ah18 and ah20 reference values were not proposed due to a lack of data in the bibliography or relative to the case studies 2 2 approach for diagnosis and decision support in a planning process a pas constitutes a core instrument for diagnosis planning monitoring and revising the impact of actions to improve water and energy efficiency in ciss in the medium term 3 5 years time horizon the water utility and the cis profiles are oriented to collect relevant information for the pas application based on alegre and coelho 2012 and alegre et al 2013 the proposed approach focuses on diagnosing and planning measures to improve water and energy efficiency in a three year to five year planning horizon before diagnosis data collection is carried out according to the variables required in the water utility profile table 1 the cis profile table 2 and the pis that integrate the pas table 3 for global system analysis since the focus is on improving water and energy efficiency the calculation of several pis ah04 ah09 ah10 ah11 ah14 ah15 and ah16 requires a prior calculation of the annual water and energy balances cunha et al 2019a 2019b diagnosis encompasses a first step dedicated to a global analysis to identify the main problems and possible cross cutting system measures e g inventory data improvement monitoring of system input volume and water discharges flow metering calibration using the performance assessment panel tables 3 and 4 and analysis of context information from the water utility and cis profiles tables 1 and 2 the second step of diagnosis consists in identifying priority network areas for a more detailed diagnosis and planning interventions through pas application to each network area for prioritisation the analysis involves a possible selection of pis from table 3 to highlight the differences between network areas before the analysis each network area water and energy balance calculation is carried out for network area prioritisation using multiple pis a ranking is established based on the overall assessment the ranking is based on the methodology proposed by alegre and coelho 2012 therefore the pis expressed in different units and judged by reference values are converted into performance indices dimensionless through the application of performance levels 0 1 poor performance 1 2 fair performance 2 3 good performance the global assessment corresponds to the average of normalised pis or a weighting average if the relative importance of each pi is different diagnosis takes into consideration the performance in the current situation reference year s and the expected performance in the future 20 years time horizon for a more informative diagnosis about current problems and their evolution probable scenarios e g demographic trends and regulatory changes corresponding to conditions not controlled by the wuas and impacting performance evolution should be considered alegre et al 2012 moreover internal factors in the wuas e g already planned interventions might also influence performance in each scenario thereby performance assessment in future is carried out for each probable scenario and considering the impact of internal factors both depend on the specific context and should be identified in articulation with the utility a set of assumptions were established to assess future cis performance which depends on the wua and cis contexts and should be tailored e g water and energy prices water demand the evolution of apparent and real water loss components pump efficiency degradation and maintenance costs for planning improvement measures the pas table 3 is applied to the network area with a high priority of intervention for a detailed diagnosis afterwards the analysis of improvement measures includes i identification of alternatives which may correspond to a combination of measures ii comparative analysis of alternatives in terms of performance assessment iii comparative economic analysis of alternatives and iv prioritisation of alternatives for global assessment of each alternative using multiple pis it is necessary to convert them into performance levels as described previously in addition the global assessment takes into consideration the performance in the current situation reference year s and the expected performance in the future 20 years time horizon similarly to diagnosis in terms of economic analysis besides estimating intervention costs based on the information and rehabilitation budgets provided by the water utility some economic indicators were adopted namely the net present value the internal rate of return and the payback period furthermore the proposed water utility and collective irrigation profiles tables 1 and 2 and the performance assessment panel tables 3 and 4 have an additional application they can be transferable for global analysis of different cis i e gravity pressurised or combined systems to highlight the main problems in these systems and support public policies 3 results 3 1 system diagnosis 3 1 1 water utility and cis profiles the proposed approach for water and efficiency diagnosis and decision support was applied in a gravity system in portugal the analysed system includes the conveyance and distribution infrastructures from the water intakes in reservoirs to the water delivery point to beneficiaries and non beneficiaries the irrigation period for analysis was established based on the availability of the service to the users the gravity flow system began operating in 1959 presents a total irrigated area of 16 351 ha and had 947 irrigation users in 2018 the conveyance system is an open canal and the distribution system integrates canals and low pressure pipes three reservoirs supply this system with associated hydropower stations and 13 pumping stations the gravity flow system comprises five network areas s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 network areas s1 s2 s3 and s4 are interconnected and network area s5 is independent due to infrastructure ageing some rehabilitation interventions were already implemented corresponding mainly to the complete rehabilitation of the canal network in s5 area in 2001 tables 5 and 6 list the water utility and conveyance and distribution system profiles for the gravity flow system for the reference year 2018 with a contract period of 20 years the water utility provides water to 947 irrigators still it only ensures the service to 906 beneficiaries 895 agricultural and 11 non agricultural covered by the area equipped with the collective irrigation system 16 351 ha the energy costs and the own energy production variables calculated annually indicate that the proportion of energy costs concerning the operation of the cis is reduced 6 9 with 13 pumping stations in operation the energy production represented 8 5 times the energy consumption for pumping which is relevant for the utility s economic and natural resources sustainability in operation since 1959 it includes three water intakes in reservoirs six in watercourses and a total network length of 402 4 km in 2018 the irrigation period corresponded to 174 days and the annual irrigation shortage represented only 16 6 relative to the average potential evapotranspiration for the estimation of evapotranspiration the well established penman monteith method was adopted allen et al 1998 3 1 2 global analysis the pas application is presented to identify the main water and energy efficiency problems and possible cross cutting measures for the gravity cis the global analysis includes assessing the service provided for the reference situation 2018 and analysis horizon 2038 based on scenarios and the expected changes in the internal context of the water utility table 7 enhancing the infrastructural operational and maintenance sustainability and water and energy efficiency represent the main improvement opportunities relative to economic financial sustainability the non revenue water ah04 39 8 with poor performance i e above 35 of the system input volume table 4 indicates a potential to reduce unbilled authorised consumption and water losses significant water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 and ah10 with fair performance and the ageing canal and pipe network ah05 with fair performance indicate that infrastructural problems are already noticeable the rehabilitation rate in the last five years ah08 with good performance suggests that infrastructural intervention is already a concern for the wua and should be continued for infrastructure sustainability water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges estimated according to cunha et al 2019a are also significant ah11 above 30 of the water input volume with poor performance indicating problems with operation and maintenance however further work is recommended to identify the most relevant discharges with the support of operators for temporary or permanent flow monitoring to validate this water loss component as such identifying solutions to improve canal operational control is required to reduce this volume of water losses moreover fernández pacheco et al 2015 demonstrated that automation systems for remote monitoring and control in wuas may correspond to low cost investments with large water and energy savings benefits for more information about water loss estimates in this case study see cunha et al 2019a this study lacked historical databases about failures in measurement control and cleaning equipment and pumping groups ah12 ah13 regarding water use efficiency the fair performance in efficiency in water resources ah14 together with the fair performance in water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 ah10 and the poor performance in water losses due to discharges ah11 indicate a significant potential to improve real losses significant water losses contribute to high energy in excess ah16 with fair performance in addition the low efficiency of pumping stations ah15 with poor performance also indicates a potential to reduce energy supplied in excess by improving pump efficiency and water loss control the pumping groups value index ah06 s good performance indicates that pumping groups are globally new therefore the low pumping stations efficiency ah15 with poor performance suggests the opportunity to improve the operation and maintenance of pumping groups for higher efficiency finally with the expected evolution in performance for ah06 and ah15 the oldest equipment with low efficiency should be replaced by new equipment with adequate design relative to the adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users the results highlight that own water capacity was adequate ah17 with good performance indicating the availability of water resources to ensure demand in 2018 however the number of service interruptions was significant ah19 with poor performance which might compromise the quality of service additionally most interruptions were due to infrastructure problems e g pipe or canal bursts impacting water losses and the service provided to users concerning the expected evolution three probable scenarios were established together with the wua i maintain current water availability and demand for irrigation ii increase demand for irrigation due to installation of more water intensive crops iii decrease water abstraction from reservoirs due to a new dam in the region located upstream of the cis the expected qualitative performance evolution for the first scenario and the internal factors is shown in table 7 the wua is planning changes in the internal context namely the rehabilitation of approximately 37 of the canal network and only about 11 of the pipe network in the next ten years these interventions also involve installing devices for automatic monitoring and control of discharges and replacing irrigators water metres to improve metering accuracy and billed consumption thus a performance improvement is expected namely in non revenue water ah04 infrastructure value index ah05 water losses due to canal leakage ah09 and due to discharges ah11 efficiency in water resources ah14 energy in excess ah16 and service interruptions ah19 moreover with a partial network modernisation to a pressurised system it is expected to increase the area irrigated with on demand service ah20 however lower performance in the pumping groups value index ah06 and water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 is expected indicating the importance of identifying those with high priority for intervention planning in terms of energy consumption and costs only 6 9 in 2018 table 5 an increase is expected due to pump efficiency degradation of existing groups and the installation of new pumping stations associated with network modernisation network rehabilitation performance is likely to decrease in the long term after the first ten years future interventions should be planned gradually to ensure an adequate quality of service based on the global analysis of the gravity system considering the initial reference situation and its expected evolution several cross cutting measures to increase water and energy efficiency were identified table 8 3 1 3 network area prioritisation the pas application at the network area level allows for identifying the areas with high priority for intervention for prioritising a set of pis was selected from criteria relative to the sustainability of service provision obj 1 and sustainability in water and energy obj 2 pis relative to the adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users objective obj 3 were not differentiating among the areas and were not considered for prioritisation table 9 presents the results of network area analysis for the reference year 2018 classifying the areas in terms of priority for intervention i e the area with lower global performance assessment is of high priority since pis are expressed in different units the global assessment was determined by converting pis into performance indices as described in section 2 2 from the global performance assessment network areas s1 to s4 show a fair performance particularly s1 and s2 with a lower global performance level indicating a high priority for a more detailed diagnosis and planning interventions network area s5 entirely rehabilitated in the last 20 years shows a good performance level above 2 0 the main problems identified in s1 to s4 correspond to the high non revenue water ah04 water losses due to discharges ah11 and energy in excess ah16 and the low energy efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 network area s2 1st priority presents the highest values in non revenue water ah04 and water losses due to discharges in intermediate reservoirs and canals ah11 furthermore the fair performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 water losses due to canal ah09 and pipe leakage ah10 and efficiency in water resources ah14 with poor performance indicate an ageing network with possible problems in infrastructure condition and network operation and control this area also presents poor performance relative to the energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 and energy in excess ah16 the significant water losses and the low efficiency in pumping stations contribute noticeably to the energy supplied in excess network area s1 2nd priority although with similar problems to s2 the poor performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 and the canal ah09 and pipe leakage ah10 with fair performance indicate that network rehabilitation is crucial in this network area though with fair performance in water losses due to discharges in intermediate reservoirs and canals ah11 the value is lower relative to s2 indicating the operational issues are less relevant in s1 this network area also presents potential to improve pump efficiency similarly to s2 network area s4 3rd priority presents the second highest value of non revenue water ah04 and stands out for its high water losses due to discharges ah11 with good performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 i e more recent network than s1 and s2 it is crucial to analyse measures to improve canals operational control to improve performance in water losses due to discharges it stands out that the energy efficiency of pumping stations is good ah15 in this network area thereby the major contribution to the energy supplied in excess may be due to water losses regarding network area s3 4th priority even though its non revenue water ah04 is lower than in s1 s2 and s4 it presents a fair performance in water losses due to discharges ah11 and poor performance in energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 and energy in excess ah16 besides the need to improve network operation the lowest efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 in the middle of their useful life ah06 highlights the high need to verify the operation practices e g installation of variable speed devices finally network area s5 with a good performance level stands out for the low efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 which are in the middle of their useful life ah06 besides a fair performance in water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 therefore improving the operating control and practices is important as analysing the need to install variable speed devices 3 2 network area diagnosis and prioritisation of improvement measures after identifying s2 as the priority network area the most extensive network with 115 km of canals and 91 km of pipes the diagnosis at network area level is developed to identify the main problems and measures to improve water and energy efficiency network area s2 was responsible for 63 of the volume of water losses due to canal discharges in 2018 which corresponded to approximately 30 hm3 furthermore the fair performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 in table 9 indicates that some water losses may relate to the ageing and degraded infrastructure on the other hand energy consumption in pumping stations represented 31 of the energy consumption in the water utility in 2018 this high consumption and the poor performance in pumping stations efficiency ah15 in table 9 highlight the need to adopt specific measures to improve the efficiency of this equipment secondly the efficiency of the francis turbine installed upstream of network area s2 was low in 2018 63 according to liu et al 2015 which indicates the potential to improve energy production from the natural energy supplied to the system for the analysis horizon changes in the wua internal context will involve the phased rehabilitation of 43 8 of the total canal extension of s2 in 10 years contributing to a better performance in the infrastructure value index for the future long term behaviour performance improvement is expected mainly in water losses due to canal leakage and discharges improving efficiency in water resources and non revenue water nevertheless performance in terms of pumping groups value index ah06 water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 and energy efficiency in pumping stations ah15 will decrease or maintain due to the lack of rehabilitation in the components moreover it also identified the need to improve the efficiency of the hydraulic turbine to improve energy production and related revenues five exploratory alternatives were identified in collaboration with the wua where a4 and a5 correspond to a combination of interventions in network area s2 alternative a0 status quo not considering interventions and maintaining the current operation and maintenance practices alternative a1 rehabilitation of 50 3 km of the main canal in 5 years 2019 2023 alternative a2 replace 149 old paddle wheel water metres with a nominal diameter dn150 and dn200 alternative a3 optimisation of the operation of the hydraulic turbine francis alternative a4 combination of alternatives a1 and a2 a1 a2 alternative a5 combination of alternatives a1 a2 and a3 a1 a2 a3 the prioritisation was developed based on the comparative analysis in terms of performance and economic viability of the proposed alternatives in a 20 years analysis horizon the same pis selected for prioritising network areas table 9 were adopted for comparative performance analysis between alternatives table 10 illustrates the global performance level for each solution analysed in 2023 i e after the implementation period of alternatives despite a fair performance the global assessment 1 43 indicates that canal rehabilitation alternative a1 has a relevant positive impact relative to a0 with expected global performance in 2023 of only 1 12 relative to alternatives a2 and a3 the contribution to global improvement is minimal indicating that these types of interventions are punctual and are insufficient to improve performance optimisation of the hydraulic turbine a3 operation only impacts excess energy ah16 in contrast the replacement of water metres a2 besides a slight impact on non revenue water ah04 also impacts the energy in excess ah16 to some extent with water metre replacement the energy in excess reduces since authorised consumption increases due to a decrease in water metering errors while most of the authorised billed consumption about 70 of consumption is measured using old neyrpic modules in network area s2 and the alternative a2 focus only on replacing paddle wheel water metres thus future comparative analysis should study the replacement of neyrpic modules alternatives a1 a4 and a5 show a better global assessment in 2023 especially in the infrastructure value index ah05 the water losses due to canal leakage ah09 both with good performance and the efficiency of water resources ah14 with fair performance compared to the alternative a0 status quo the rehabilitation of the main canal a1 involves an initial reduction of approximately 40 of water losses due to canal discharges a11 with fair performance relatively to alternative a0 however non revenue water ah04 and the energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 continue with poor performance in 2023 these results indicate that additional measures to alternatives a1 a4 or a5 would be necessary to improve water and energy efficiency e g enhance monitoring and control of discharges and rehabilitation of pumping stations fig 2a presents the progress of the non revenue water ah04 fig 2b the energy supplied in excess ah16 during the analysis period and fig 2c the cost of the alternatives versus the average global assessment in the evolution of both pis fig 2a b a significant decrease is observed until the end of the implementation of canal rehabilitation 2023 in alternatives involving canal rehabilitation a1 a4 and a5 the behaviour until 2023 is due to a reduction in water losses due to canal leakage ah09 and water discharges ah11 since intervention involved canal waterproofing and better control of water discharges since water losses also contribute to reducing energy in excess ah16 these alternatives also positively influence energy efficiency after the rehabilitation period it was considered that water losses increased at a similar rate as in a0 in the network area s2 indicating that it is necessary to maintain a continuous practice of rehabilitation the assumption relative to the evolution of water losses can be improved by considering different rates for rehabilitated and non rehabilitated components the interventions cost was estimated based on the information and rehabilitation budgets provided by the water utility for the non revenue water despite maintaining an unsatisfactory performance the alternatives a1 and a5 present the best performance in the analysis horizon period with its minimum value in 2023 fig 2a after implementation regarding the energy in excess as for the non revenue water the alternatives a1 a4 and a5 will involve higher performance enhancement even though presenting a fair performance during the analysis period fig 2b however the gradual performance decrease in both pis between 2023 and 2039 highlights the importance of the water utility continuing to rehabilitate network area s2 gradually the comparative performance analysis fig 2c allows identifying the alternatives a1 a4 a1 a2 and a5 a1 a2 a3 with a similar value for global assessment approximately 1 30 as the best solutions for network area s2 fig 2c for the global evaluation pis expressed in different units and judged by reference values were converted into performance indices through the application of performance levels 0 1 poor performance 1 2 fair performance 2 3 good performance thereby in fig 2c the red area corresponds to poor the yellow area to the fair and the green area to good performance in terms of the global assessment these solutions will significantly reduce losses and energy in excess and increase authorised consumption and efficiency in water resources although the cost investment of a1 and a4 is similar 16 6 m and the cost of a5 is higher 17 7 m for a similar global performance specific interventions in equipment a2 and a3 have a punctual impact on some performance indicators in this study relative to the economic feasibility of the proposed alternatives three economic indicators were adopted namely the net present value the internal rate of return and the payback period based on these indicators alternatives a2 payback period 4 years and a3 payback period 9 years would be viable solutions for the 20 year analysis horizon the remaining alternatives require a more extended period to recover the initial investment nevertheless the payback period is smaller 34 years when considering the three options combined a5 due to increased efficiency in real and apparent losses and recovered energy relative to alternative a1 41 years therefore using the proposed pas it was possible the analysis interventions in terms of performance and cost that will support wuas in prioritisation moreover it was demonstrated the importance of rehabilitation measures to improve water and energy efficiency in cis 3 3 comparative analysis between ciss 3 3 1 water utility and ciss profiles the comparative analysis between ciss was performed considering the gravity cis previously described in 3 1 and a pressurised cis this comparative analysis exemplifies the differences between a traditional and a more recent cis and tests the proposed pas the irrigation period in 2018 for the gravity and the pressurised ciss was 174 and 365 days respectively the pressurised cis began its exploration in 1981 and presents a more reduced dimension with 1500 ha of irrigation area and 108 irrigation users relative to the gravity system see 3 1 1 in the pressurised cis the pipe conveyance and distribution system collects water from a reservoir receives additional energy from a pumping station installed downstream and is set up by two network areas c1 and c2 during 2014 and 2015 57 4 of the pipe network was rehabilitated corresponding to the entire network area c2 and part of c1 overall the gravity cis has a higher dimension especially regarding agricultural beneficiaries irrigation users human resources and the total and average authorised consumption volume tables 5 and 6 furthermore the average billed authorised consumption in the gravity cis where the irrigated area for rice crops predominates was almost three times the billed consumption of the pressurised cis where the irrigated area for olive crops dominates between 2016 and 2018 fig 3a in the gravity system the average billed authorised consumption was similar in 2016 and 2018 average precipitation 628 mm and increased in 2017 average precipitation 331 mm this latter was the driest year in the period of analysis in this cis which entailed a greater crop water demand in terms of energy costs fig 3b the pressurised cis shows much higher energy costs up to 50 of operational costs than the gravity system energy costs less than 10 of operational costs the pressurised cis presents a higher dependency on electrical energy varying the energy cost between 34 2 and 49 8 of operational cost during the analysed period in this system the low precipitation in 2018 average precipitation 359 mm lead to higher crop water demand thus more intensive use of pumping groups led to increased energy costs this year 3 3 2 comparative analysis based on the pas application a benchmarking analysis at the global level regarding the main water losses and energy inefficiency problems is presented table 11 presents the comparative analysis between the gravity and the pressurised ciss for the reference year 2018 in the economic financial sustainability the performance is fair or poor in terms of total adhesion ah03 and non revenue water ah04 in both systems the extensive irrigated area outside the equipped area highlights the need to incorporate areas with non beneficiaries in these ciss moreover as suggested in previous studies zema et al 2018 the increase in service coverage is very important for the cost recovery of wuas concerning non revenue water both systems show poor performance even though the causes for this problem may be different in the gravity system the high water losses due to discharges i e ah11 with poor performance due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 and ah10 with fair performance associated with the low value of the infrastructure value index ah05 with fair performance suggest insufficient network monitoring and control of discharges and an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions in the pressurised system the low water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 with good performance the good efficiency of water resources use ah14 with good performance and the high value of the infrastructure value index ah05 with fair performance indicate other problems of non revenue water since the existing water metres are recent and respective errors reduced the utility stated that the main issue might be pipe discharges for cleaning and unblocking the network unbilled unmeasured authorised consumption concerning infrastructural sustainability network failures ah07 represent the main problem of the pressurised cis with poor performance in 2018 despite a recent network ah05 0 74 due to significant pipe rehabilitation carried out between 2014 and 2015 problems persist due to the poor infrastructural condition of the remaining network without rehabilitation with high pipe failures relatively to the infrastructure value index ah05 although indicating a recent network the fair performance highlights the importance of phased planning avoiding future concentrated rehabilitation the gravity system has an ageing network ah05 0 28 with fair performance with the potential to improve water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 ah10 with fair performance indicating possible infrastructural problems and the relevance of planning rehabilitation interventions in this system in terms of operational and maintenance sustainability the water losses due to discharges in the gravity system are significant ah11 with poor performance there is a lack of data about failures in measurement control and cleaning equipment and pumping groups for both systems the gravity system shows a fair performance relative to water use efficiency whereas the pressurised system s performance is good there is potential to improve energy efficiency in both systems ah15 ah16 with fair or poor performance in the pressurised system with energy costs representing up to 50 of operational costs measures to improve energy efficiency e g installation of variable speed devices replacement of old pumping groups pressure management network sectorization suggested in previous studies rodríguez díaz et al 2011 are particularly relevant however further analysis would be necessary to evaluate the adequacy of these measures and their impact on water and energy efficiency in the gravity system energy costs represented less than 10 regarding service accessibility the performance was good in own water capacity ah17 and similar in water charges ah18 in both systems service interruptions ah19 have poor performance in terms of the quality of service and on demand service is absent ah20 in the gravity system in opposition to the pressurised system therefore the comparative analysis carried out in this paper suggests that the proposed pas applies to different ciss with different contexts these promising results constitute a first step for establishing a general pas for ciss similar to the urban water sector experience where a framework of pis was established for application worldwide alegre et al 2017 and adopted as a reference for regulation of the quality of service in different countries namely in portugal 4 conclusions a novel pas to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems was proposed in this study aligned with the water users association objectives it integrates the water utility profile the collective irrigation system profile a set of criteria and respective performance indicators pis with reference values applicable to gravity pressurised or combined ciss based on previous studies an approach for diagnosis and planning measures to improve water and energy efficiency using the pas is also proposed the pas application for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency was firstly tested under a traditional gravity cis secondly the pas was used to compare gravity and pressurised ciss the pas application for global analysis indicated significant canal and pipe leakage possible due to an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions for the gravity system in the second place considerable water losses due to canal and intermediate reservoir discharges indicate the potential to improve network monitoring and control thereby with relevant real losses due to canal and pipe leakage and discharges the efficiency of water resources has a significant potential to improve besides the economic impact of water losses it was possible to assess the effect on energy efficiency poor efficiency in pumping stations and performance in real losses lead to high energy in excess supply to the system possible cross cutting measures to increase water and energy efficiency were proposed from the global analysis improving water metres billing and customer data management installing water in all irrigation users inventory data about the network failure events and rehabilitation interventions and monitoring the main canal discharges at the network area level network area s2 with the potential to improve canal and pipe leakage and pump efficiency and responsible for 63 of water losses due to canal discharges in 2018 was identified with the highest priority for intervention based on the performance and economic analysis the alternative combining rehabilitation of the main canal replacing water metres and optimising the hydraulic turbine will further improve the performance of network area s2 based on the pas application and the comparative analysis between the gravity and the pressurised ciss both systems present poor performance in non revenue water impairing economic sustainability in the gravity system the most relevant component of non revenue water corresponds to real losses possible due to an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions and insufficient monitoring and control of discharges in the pressurised system with a recent pipe network the high number of network failures in the pressurised system indicates that some infrastructure problems persist despite the intense rehabilitation carried out by the wua with good pipe leakage performance and water resources efficiency the most relevant component of non revenue water is due to authorised unbilled consumption for network maintenance and cleaning due to water quality problems concerning energy efficiency both systems show potential to improve energy efficiency in pumping stations and reduce energy in excess in the pressurised system measures to improve energy efficiency e g installation of variable speed devices replacement of old pumping groups pressure management are particularly relevant since energy costs represent up to 50 of operational costs in contrast the gravity system represents less than 10 this paper demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed pas for diagnosing ciss at the global and network area levels decision making to improve water and energy efficiency and comparing different cis considering the different contexts nevertheless future work should include the application of the pas for diagnosis and decision support in an extensive set of ciss from other contexts e

9192,in regions with a strong seasonal or interannual asymmetry in the distribution of precipitation and higher frequency of droughts collective irrigation systems are vital infrastructures for agricultural activity although operating for decades several systems have ageing infrastructures with relevant water losses and pumping energy inefficiencies consequently the systems are not adequately designed or operated to meet current and future water demand therefore rehabilitation to improve water and energy efficiency while ensuring infrastructure economic sustainability and service quality is crucial in this sense comprehensive approaches using performance assessment to support the planning process or benchmarking between water users associations play an essential role in improving efficiency in collective irrigation systems however few methodologies assess interdependencies between water losses energy efficiency infrastructure condition service quality economic and operational dimensions additionally these approaches rarely were applied to the different stages of the planning process diagnosis planning monitoring and reviewing the impact of measures and to different types of collective irrigation systems gravity pressurised combined for comparative analysis this paper presents a comprehensive performance assessment system pas for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems afterwards the pas is applied for diagnosis and prioritisation of alternatives to enhance the efficiency of a gravity system the results indicate significant water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges and leakage in canals and low pressure pipes related to network ageing and insufficient flow monitoring and control for the gravity system ranking allowed identifying the gravity network area with high priority of intervention due to poor performance in non revenue water water losses due to discharges energy efficiency of pumping stations and system energy in excess several alternatives were studied for this network area and infrastructural solutions involving canal rehabilitation and water discharge control significantly impact global performance improvement besides the substantial investment associated subsequently the pas is used for comparing gravity and pressurised systems in opposition to gravity the pressurised system with efficient use of water resources presents a poor performance in pumping energy efficiency furthermore the significant energy costs indicate the importance of energy improvement measures for the pressurised system besides assessing water and energy efficiency the novel pas may help managers and policymakers identify every system s best practices and weak points keywords collective irrigation systems ciss diagnosis decision support performance assessment system pas water and energy efficiency water users association wua data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction and review agriculture and public urban water supply are the primary sources of pressure on freshwater resources over 40 of the eu s water use is on agriculture irrigation eprs 2019 and global demand for agricultural products is foreseen to increase by 15 by 2028 worldwide oecd fao 2021 which might intensify irrigation portugal whose water demand represents between 40 and 80 of its average annual water availability presents high exposure to water stress in the future due to recurrent drought events and increased water consumption gassert et al 2013 according to the national water plan decree law no 76 2016 in dr 2016 the agriculture and livestock sector used 3390 hm3 year corresponding to 74 of the available water volume between 2012 and 2016 moreover climate scenarios for the next decades indicate a reduction in precipitation which might reach between 15 and 30 in the southern region fcg 2020 a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature leads to an increase in evapotranspiration and higher demand for irrigation therefore problems related to water scarcity due to environmental challenges and climate variability and ageing irrigation infrastructures highlight the need to improve efficiency in water and energy use in collective irrigation systems ciss and private irrigation systems as identified by the common agricultural policy strategic plan gpp 2020 and the national strategy for irrigation until 2050 fenareg 2019 in portugal the equipped area for irrigation corresponds to 626 820 ha 5 of the national territory the equipped area in public ciss private ciss and private systems represent 40 10 and 50 of the total equipped area respectively gpp 2020 public ciss correspond to national infrastructures for abstraction transport and water distribution to users e g irrigators industry users owned by the national authority for irrigation and managed by water users associations wuas in contrast private ciss are owned and managed by privates private systems correspond to water distribution systems for crops owned and operated by the irrigators the average water consumption in portugal for irrigation decreased from 15 000 m3 ha year to 4 000 m3 ha year in the last 60 years 70 of water consumption reduction edia 2021 however in the same period the energy consumption for irrigation increased from 200 kwh ha year to 1 750 kwh ha year more than eight times the initial energy consumption fenareg 2022 the modernisation from gravity to pressurised systems without a comprehensive assessment of the impact of improvement measures ought to contribute to the observed energy increase in recent decades wuas and the end users namely the irrigators have focused on irrigation systems modernisation to improve water use efficiency and ensure on demand service without a relevant concern for energy consumption and efficiency rocamora et al 2013 levidow et al 2014 tarjuelo et al 2015 furthermore main efforts to improve efficiency in water use have been focused on the farmer level bjornlund et al 2009 speelman et al 2008 benouniche et al 2014 thereby it is essential to efficiently manage ciss for higher water and energy savings in abstraction storage transport and water distribution to end users however unlike the urban water systems there is a lack of integrated approaches that systematically quantify water and energy inefficiencies identify network areas with high priority for intervention and support planning and monitoring improvement measures in those infrastructures for instance speelman et al 2008 nam et al 2016 and zema et al 2019 focus on the water use related aspects namely the water delivery quantification and low cost measures neglecting the importance of integrated quantification of the water and energy inefficiencies in addition isolated and decoupled solutions may conflict with wuas objectives e g like for like pump replacement without reducing downstream water losses may lead to high investment and operation costs compared to an alternative involving water loss control and adequate pump design and replacement wuas benchmarking focusing on service performance comprises a step forward for modern irrigation systems malano and burton 2001 moreover performance assessment for diagnosis planning monitoring and revising the impact of implementing measures in wuas constitutes a step forward a performance assessment system pas is driven by the service objectives of wuas criteria for assessing the fulfilment of each objective performance indicators pis the core elements of a pas and context information following the principles of the iso 24500 standards iso 2007a 2007b 2007c aligned with these standards and alegre et al 2017 assessment criteria correspond to points of view that allow the assessment of the objectives pis are expressed by the ratio between two variables of the same nature in essence the numerator expresses the objective of the indicator e g real losses network failures and the denominator represents a related system scale e g network length loureiro et al 2020 the pis are calculated for a reference period generally one year and the value found does not issue judges requiring comparison with a reference reference values can be proposed based on legislation recommendations from regulatory entities literature or historical data previous studies have successfully adopted pas for evaluating and monitoring water utilities in different contexts ersar and lnec 2021 the pas application to support diagnosis and decision making represents a common practice across the urban water sector identifying adequate measures and prioritising interventions in line with the need to provide adequate service levels a structured pas for strategic infrastructure assessment management was developed by alegre and coelho 2012 and alegre et al 2013 in addition different pas were developed for the diagnosis of water losses and energy inefficiencies in drinking water systems mamade et al 2017 undue inflows and systems functioning aspects in wastewater and stormwater systems almeida et al 2017 santos 2021 and energy inefficiencies in urban water systems loureiro et al 2020 in irrigation performance assessment in water and energy use has been proposed in some studies malano and burton 2001 malano et al 2004 córcoles et al 2010 borgia et al 2013 2020 however some are focused only on the irrigator level rodriguez diaz et al 2011 parra et al 2020 even when specific pis to evaluate water and energy use have been developed in ciss córcoles et al 2010 rodriguez diaz et al 2011 fernández pacheco et al 2015 zema et al 2018 the impact of water losses network layout and operation on energy efficiency was not assessed disregarding the water and energy nexus existing pis for ciss do not consider water loss components e g evaporation real losses due to discharges and leakage metering errors and the energy inefficiency components e g pump and hydropower inefficiencies energy dissipated due to water and head losses that occur throughout the network until the water intakes i e point of delivery to users recent contributions to water and energy balance for collective irrigation systems allow estimating these components during the irrigation period and enable the calculation of new pis cunha et al 2019a 2019b the water balance cunha et al 2019a estimates billed authorised consumption and non revenue components i e the volume associated with unbilled authorised consumption evaporation losses apparent losses and real losses relative to system input volume apparent losses include inaccuracies related to users metering and unauthorised consumption whereas real losses include canal and pipe leakage and discharges in canals and intermediate reservoirs the energy balance cunha et al 2019b mamade et al 2017 allows for estimating the minimum required energy to ensure the service to users and energy supplied in excess relative to system input energy i e natural shaft input energy the energy supplied in excess may be associated with water losses dissipated due to head losses or energy inefficiencies in pumping stations or hydraulic turbines first steps were given to establish a pas for ciss córcoles et al 2010 rodríguez díaz et al 2011 zema et al 2018 these studies also performed useful statistical analysis to reduce the number of pis and group wuas these studies constitute important steps for developing a pas with essential information and defining reference values however besides the economic impact of water and energy inefficiencies the relations with other dimensions should also be assessed namely on operation and infrastructure resources efficiency and quality of service thus a comprehensive pas to support planning in wuas or comparative analysis between utilities of cis from different contexts is still missing this paper presents and tests a pas for water and energy efficiency assessment based on trustworthy and well organised information for collective irrigation systems the pas was developed under a co production environment of researchers irrigation systems managers and irrigators in the scope of a research project aligned with the objectives of wuas this pas integrates a water utility profile a cis profile a set of criteria and a set of new pis to assess the impact of water and energy inefficiencies in economic infrastructural operational resources efficiency and quality of service dimensions and reference values that consider different types of ciss gravity pressurised combined the main contributions of this paper correspond to the proposal and application of a comprehensive framework for assessing the water and energy efficiency use and its practical application in a cis to support diagnosis and decision about measures to improve water and energy efficiency and for comparative analysis between ciss this work was motivated by the lack of a framework for systematic assessment of water and energy inefficiencies and their relations with economic infrastructural and service dimensions and support the management of ciss infrastructures associated with abstraction intermediate storage transport and distribution of water to end users this pas brings a new mindset to the irrigation market at the national and international levels to support benchmarking between wuas and planning of water and energy efficiency measures considering the impact on the multiple dimensions of the service provided besides the current section this paper presents the pas developed for ciss and the approach for diagnosis and decision support in the material and methods section in the results section two different applications of the assessment system are discussed the first application involves applying the pas for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve efficiency in a gravity cis the second application presents a comparative analysis between ciss considering the corporate objectives to highlight the significant water losses and energy inefficiency problems two ciss were selected for demonstration in this latter application a traditional gravity system and a pressurised gravity system finally the conclusions are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 performance assessment system pas the pas proposed in this study is driven by the organisational objectives of wuas and based on clearly defined data internal or external to the water utility including assessment criteria pis and reference values focused on the efficiency and effectiveness assessment according to each criterion only essential and complementary pis were selected for the evaluation avoiding redundant information consequently diagnosis and decision making should be based on the joint analysis of pis that integrate the pas considering context information provided in water utility and cis profiles fig 1 besides the water and energy efficiency dimensions the pas proposes a comprehensive set of pis that influence water losses and energy inefficiencies e g infrastructural dimension or are influenced by these inefficiency problems e g economic quality of service dimensions a comprehensive assessment system ensures that efficiency issues are not seen in isolation and that improvement solutions do not conflict with wuas objectives pis were proposed based on the preliminary diagnosis of three different cis gravity pressurised combined in the scope of a national research project about assessment of water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems agir afterwards pis formulation and results were discussed with a panel of specialists in ciss from the national authority for irrigation wuas irrigators national associations in the sector and academic institutions within the scope of the research project to have a first perception of the application in different ciss and contexts the pas comprises 14 variables describing the water utility profile 19 variables in the cis profile and 20 pis a schematic representation of the pas components and data flow is presented in fig 1 the water utility profile table 1 includes essential information about the water utility responsible for the service the contract period and end users types since the focus is on the water utility the number of irrigators deg07 the billed authorised consumption dbh02 pah01 pah02 and the average irrigated area pah03 also cover information about irrigated areas that collect water from the system but do not benefit from the irrigation infrastructure moreover since the objective is to assess energy costs and consumption for cis operation relatively to annual operational costs and energy produced by the water utility these last variables pah04 pa05 are calculated for the analysis year and not only for the irrigation period besides the regional aspects the collective irrigation system profile table 2 includes information about the licence for the use of water resources the operation start date characteristics of the water supply infrastructure for irrigation including abstraction conveyance and distribution area equipped with a collective irrigation system irrigation period and volume licensed for water abstraction it also includes some variables that characterise the coverage of end use points with water metres annual irrigation shortage and the potential to use water for reuse the pis are the key elements of the pas and they were established according to wuas service objectives i sustainability of service provision obj 1 ii sustainability in the use of water and energy obj 2 iii adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users obj 3 the objectives were defined under a co production environment of researchers wuas and irrigators during the agir project the objectives reflect the vision and mission of water utilities not only water and energy efficiency goals a set of relevant dimensions assessment criteria to assess objectives and respective performance indicators pis are proposed to measure the water and energy efficiency and effectiveness in the service provided table 3 for the criteria identification the first digit corresponds to the respective objective pis should be assessed for the year relative to the irrigation period under analysis the total costs coverage ah01 infrastructure value index ah05 pumping groups value index ah06 and network rehabilitation ah08 based on ersar and lnec 2021 should be calculated with yearly data rehabilitation interventions may occur outside the irrigation period and should be considered in the analysis year to ensure the service during the irrigation period additionally since the irrigation period varies between years for the same cis and between ciss network failures ah07 failures in pumping groups ah13 and service interruptions ah19 adapted from alegre et al 2017 were normalised for a one year time interval the pas encompass novel pis to highlight the main components of water losses in ciss due to canal or pipe leakage ah09 ah10 associated with infrastructural sustainability and water discharges in canals and reservoirs ah11 related to operational and maintenance sustainability criterium also non revenue water ah04 i e the volume due to authorised unbilled consumption evaporation apparent and real losses is used to assess the economic financial sustainability traducing an essential relationship between water and energy efficiency and the sustainability of service provision in addition water loss components responsible for the efficiency in the use of water resources real and evaporation losses ah14 is also considered to assess the fulfilment in terms of sustainability in the use of water and energy cunha et al 2019a presented a comprehensive approach for water balance calculation and estimating water loss variables used in the pis listed in table 3 the infrastructure value index ah05 represents the average age of the pipe and canal network through the devaluation degree alegre et al 2014 values close to 1 mean that the network is new and low values i e below 0 2 indicate that the average age of the network is high and significant investment in rehabilitation may be necessary ideally the value should be close to 0 5 the same rationale was adopted for pumping groups value index failures in canals pipes valves and fittings that require interruption of transport and distribution service should be considered for the calculation of ah07 independently of duration in contrast service interruption with a duration higher than one day and independent of the cause internal or external to the cis should be considered to calculate service interruptions ah19 besides assessing pump equipment efficiency ah15 the energy supplied in excess ah16 requires energy balance calculation cunha et al 2019b it includes the energy associated with water losses inefficiencies in pumping stations and hydraulic turbines continuous and singular head losses and the surplus energy delivered relevant in the case of pressurised irrigation systems table 4 proposes reference values for each pi reference values can be expressed into performance intervals and have the same units of the respective pi these reference values allow converting pis into a three level grade good green circle fair yellow circle poor red circle by comparing each pi value with the reference values some pis have different reference values regarding the cis type gravity pressurised or combined even though the conveyance and distribution networks are generally in canal low pressure pipe networks e g 1 m may also exist in the gravity system the pipe network can also have punctual pumping pressurised systems have high pressure conveyance and distribution pipe networks e g above 30 m in combined systems gravity and pressurised systems can coexist for ah04 ah10 ah11 ah14 and ah16 pis reference intervals for combined systems depend on the reference values for gravity and pressurised systems weighted by the respective network length according to 1 where α is the proportion of network length in gravity given by l g l g l p l g and l p km the network length in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g good and ll p good are the lower and ul g good and ul p good the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with good performance in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g fair and ll p fair are the lower and ul g fair and ul p fair the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with fair performance in gravity and pressurised respectively the l l g poor and ll p poor are the lower and ul g poor and ul p poor the upper limits of the performance intervals graded with poor performance in gravity and pressurised respectively for example using equation 1 the reference values associated with non revenue water ah04 in a combined system with a network with 100 km in gravity and 300 km in pressure are the following values were estimated based on the references mentioned in table 4 for some pis ah12 ah13 ah18 and ah20 reference values were not proposed due to a lack of data in the bibliography or relative to the case studies 2 2 approach for diagnosis and decision support in a planning process a pas constitutes a core instrument for diagnosis planning monitoring and revising the impact of actions to improve water and energy efficiency in ciss in the medium term 3 5 years time horizon the water utility and the cis profiles are oriented to collect relevant information for the pas application based on alegre and coelho 2012 and alegre et al 2013 the proposed approach focuses on diagnosing and planning measures to improve water and energy efficiency in a three year to five year planning horizon before diagnosis data collection is carried out according to the variables required in the water utility profile table 1 the cis profile table 2 and the pis that integrate the pas table 3 for global system analysis since the focus is on improving water and energy efficiency the calculation of several pis ah04 ah09 ah10 ah11 ah14 ah15 and ah16 requires a prior calculation of the annual water and energy balances cunha et al 2019a 2019b diagnosis encompasses a first step dedicated to a global analysis to identify the main problems and possible cross cutting system measures e g inventory data improvement monitoring of system input volume and water discharges flow metering calibration using the performance assessment panel tables 3 and 4 and analysis of context information from the water utility and cis profiles tables 1 and 2 the second step of diagnosis consists in identifying priority network areas for a more detailed diagnosis and planning interventions through pas application to each network area for prioritisation the analysis involves a possible selection of pis from table 3 to highlight the differences between network areas before the analysis each network area water and energy balance calculation is carried out for network area prioritisation using multiple pis a ranking is established based on the overall assessment the ranking is based on the methodology proposed by alegre and coelho 2012 therefore the pis expressed in different units and judged by reference values are converted into performance indices dimensionless through the application of performance levels 0 1 poor performance 1 2 fair performance 2 3 good performance the global assessment corresponds to the average of normalised pis or a weighting average if the relative importance of each pi is different diagnosis takes into consideration the performance in the current situation reference year s and the expected performance in the future 20 years time horizon for a more informative diagnosis about current problems and their evolution probable scenarios e g demographic trends and regulatory changes corresponding to conditions not controlled by the wuas and impacting performance evolution should be considered alegre et al 2012 moreover internal factors in the wuas e g already planned interventions might also influence performance in each scenario thereby performance assessment in future is carried out for each probable scenario and considering the impact of internal factors both depend on the specific context and should be identified in articulation with the utility a set of assumptions were established to assess future cis performance which depends on the wua and cis contexts and should be tailored e g water and energy prices water demand the evolution of apparent and real water loss components pump efficiency degradation and maintenance costs for planning improvement measures the pas table 3 is applied to the network area with a high priority of intervention for a detailed diagnosis afterwards the analysis of improvement measures includes i identification of alternatives which may correspond to a combination of measures ii comparative analysis of alternatives in terms of performance assessment iii comparative economic analysis of alternatives and iv prioritisation of alternatives for global assessment of each alternative using multiple pis it is necessary to convert them into performance levels as described previously in addition the global assessment takes into consideration the performance in the current situation reference year s and the expected performance in the future 20 years time horizon similarly to diagnosis in terms of economic analysis besides estimating intervention costs based on the information and rehabilitation budgets provided by the water utility some economic indicators were adopted namely the net present value the internal rate of return and the payback period furthermore the proposed water utility and collective irrigation profiles tables 1 and 2 and the performance assessment panel tables 3 and 4 have an additional application they can be transferable for global analysis of different cis i e gravity pressurised or combined systems to highlight the main problems in these systems and support public policies 3 results 3 1 system diagnosis 3 1 1 water utility and cis profiles the proposed approach for water and efficiency diagnosis and decision support was applied in a gravity system in portugal the analysed system includes the conveyance and distribution infrastructures from the water intakes in reservoirs to the water delivery point to beneficiaries and non beneficiaries the irrigation period for analysis was established based on the availability of the service to the users the gravity flow system began operating in 1959 presents a total irrigated area of 16 351 ha and had 947 irrigation users in 2018 the conveyance system is an open canal and the distribution system integrates canals and low pressure pipes three reservoirs supply this system with associated hydropower stations and 13 pumping stations the gravity flow system comprises five network areas s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 network areas s1 s2 s3 and s4 are interconnected and network area s5 is independent due to infrastructure ageing some rehabilitation interventions were already implemented corresponding mainly to the complete rehabilitation of the canal network in s5 area in 2001 tables 5 and 6 list the water utility and conveyance and distribution system profiles for the gravity flow system for the reference year 2018 with a contract period of 20 years the water utility provides water to 947 irrigators still it only ensures the service to 906 beneficiaries 895 agricultural and 11 non agricultural covered by the area equipped with the collective irrigation system 16 351 ha the energy costs and the own energy production variables calculated annually indicate that the proportion of energy costs concerning the operation of the cis is reduced 6 9 with 13 pumping stations in operation the energy production represented 8 5 times the energy consumption for pumping which is relevant for the utility s economic and natural resources sustainability in operation since 1959 it includes three water intakes in reservoirs six in watercourses and a total network length of 402 4 km in 2018 the irrigation period corresponded to 174 days and the annual irrigation shortage represented only 16 6 relative to the average potential evapotranspiration for the estimation of evapotranspiration the well established penman monteith method was adopted allen et al 1998 3 1 2 global analysis the pas application is presented to identify the main water and energy efficiency problems and possible cross cutting measures for the gravity cis the global analysis includes assessing the service provided for the reference situation 2018 and analysis horizon 2038 based on scenarios and the expected changes in the internal context of the water utility table 7 enhancing the infrastructural operational and maintenance sustainability and water and energy efficiency represent the main improvement opportunities relative to economic financial sustainability the non revenue water ah04 39 8 with poor performance i e above 35 of the system input volume table 4 indicates a potential to reduce unbilled authorised consumption and water losses significant water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 and ah10 with fair performance and the ageing canal and pipe network ah05 with fair performance indicate that infrastructural problems are already noticeable the rehabilitation rate in the last five years ah08 with good performance suggests that infrastructural intervention is already a concern for the wua and should be continued for infrastructure sustainability water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges estimated according to cunha et al 2019a are also significant ah11 above 30 of the water input volume with poor performance indicating problems with operation and maintenance however further work is recommended to identify the most relevant discharges with the support of operators for temporary or permanent flow monitoring to validate this water loss component as such identifying solutions to improve canal operational control is required to reduce this volume of water losses moreover fernández pacheco et al 2015 demonstrated that automation systems for remote monitoring and control in wuas may correspond to low cost investments with large water and energy savings benefits for more information about water loss estimates in this case study see cunha et al 2019a this study lacked historical databases about failures in measurement control and cleaning equipment and pumping groups ah12 ah13 regarding water use efficiency the fair performance in efficiency in water resources ah14 together with the fair performance in water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 ah10 and the poor performance in water losses due to discharges ah11 indicate a significant potential to improve real losses significant water losses contribute to high energy in excess ah16 with fair performance in addition the low efficiency of pumping stations ah15 with poor performance also indicates a potential to reduce energy supplied in excess by improving pump efficiency and water loss control the pumping groups value index ah06 s good performance indicates that pumping groups are globally new therefore the low pumping stations efficiency ah15 with poor performance suggests the opportunity to improve the operation and maintenance of pumping groups for higher efficiency finally with the expected evolution in performance for ah06 and ah15 the oldest equipment with low efficiency should be replaced by new equipment with adequate design relative to the adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users the results highlight that own water capacity was adequate ah17 with good performance indicating the availability of water resources to ensure demand in 2018 however the number of service interruptions was significant ah19 with poor performance which might compromise the quality of service additionally most interruptions were due to infrastructure problems e g pipe or canal bursts impacting water losses and the service provided to users concerning the expected evolution three probable scenarios were established together with the wua i maintain current water availability and demand for irrigation ii increase demand for irrigation due to installation of more water intensive crops iii decrease water abstraction from reservoirs due to a new dam in the region located upstream of the cis the expected qualitative performance evolution for the first scenario and the internal factors is shown in table 7 the wua is planning changes in the internal context namely the rehabilitation of approximately 37 of the canal network and only about 11 of the pipe network in the next ten years these interventions also involve installing devices for automatic monitoring and control of discharges and replacing irrigators water metres to improve metering accuracy and billed consumption thus a performance improvement is expected namely in non revenue water ah04 infrastructure value index ah05 water losses due to canal leakage ah09 and due to discharges ah11 efficiency in water resources ah14 energy in excess ah16 and service interruptions ah19 moreover with a partial network modernisation to a pressurised system it is expected to increase the area irrigated with on demand service ah20 however lower performance in the pumping groups value index ah06 and water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 is expected indicating the importance of identifying those with high priority for intervention planning in terms of energy consumption and costs only 6 9 in 2018 table 5 an increase is expected due to pump efficiency degradation of existing groups and the installation of new pumping stations associated with network modernisation network rehabilitation performance is likely to decrease in the long term after the first ten years future interventions should be planned gradually to ensure an adequate quality of service based on the global analysis of the gravity system considering the initial reference situation and its expected evolution several cross cutting measures to increase water and energy efficiency were identified table 8 3 1 3 network area prioritisation the pas application at the network area level allows for identifying the areas with high priority for intervention for prioritising a set of pis was selected from criteria relative to the sustainability of service provision obj 1 and sustainability in water and energy obj 2 pis relative to the adequacy of the service provided to irrigation users objective obj 3 were not differentiating among the areas and were not considered for prioritisation table 9 presents the results of network area analysis for the reference year 2018 classifying the areas in terms of priority for intervention i e the area with lower global performance assessment is of high priority since pis are expressed in different units the global assessment was determined by converting pis into performance indices as described in section 2 2 from the global performance assessment network areas s1 to s4 show a fair performance particularly s1 and s2 with a lower global performance level indicating a high priority for a more detailed diagnosis and planning interventions network area s5 entirely rehabilitated in the last 20 years shows a good performance level above 2 0 the main problems identified in s1 to s4 correspond to the high non revenue water ah04 water losses due to discharges ah11 and energy in excess ah16 and the low energy efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 network area s2 1st priority presents the highest values in non revenue water ah04 and water losses due to discharges in intermediate reservoirs and canals ah11 furthermore the fair performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 water losses due to canal ah09 and pipe leakage ah10 and efficiency in water resources ah14 with poor performance indicate an ageing network with possible problems in infrastructure condition and network operation and control this area also presents poor performance relative to the energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 and energy in excess ah16 the significant water losses and the low efficiency in pumping stations contribute noticeably to the energy supplied in excess network area s1 2nd priority although with similar problems to s2 the poor performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 and the canal ah09 and pipe leakage ah10 with fair performance indicate that network rehabilitation is crucial in this network area though with fair performance in water losses due to discharges in intermediate reservoirs and canals ah11 the value is lower relative to s2 indicating the operational issues are less relevant in s1 this network area also presents potential to improve pump efficiency similarly to s2 network area s4 3rd priority presents the second highest value of non revenue water ah04 and stands out for its high water losses due to discharges ah11 with good performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 i e more recent network than s1 and s2 it is crucial to analyse measures to improve canals operational control to improve performance in water losses due to discharges it stands out that the energy efficiency of pumping stations is good ah15 in this network area thereby the major contribution to the energy supplied in excess may be due to water losses regarding network area s3 4th priority even though its non revenue water ah04 is lower than in s1 s2 and s4 it presents a fair performance in water losses due to discharges ah11 and poor performance in energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 and energy in excess ah16 besides the need to improve network operation the lowest efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 in the middle of their useful life ah06 highlights the high need to verify the operation practices e g installation of variable speed devices finally network area s5 with a good performance level stands out for the low efficiency of the pumping stations ah15 which are in the middle of their useful life ah06 besides a fair performance in water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 therefore improving the operating control and practices is important as analysing the need to install variable speed devices 3 2 network area diagnosis and prioritisation of improvement measures after identifying s2 as the priority network area the most extensive network with 115 km of canals and 91 km of pipes the diagnosis at network area level is developed to identify the main problems and measures to improve water and energy efficiency network area s2 was responsible for 63 of the volume of water losses due to canal discharges in 2018 which corresponded to approximately 30 hm3 furthermore the fair performance in the infrastructure value index ah05 in table 9 indicates that some water losses may relate to the ageing and degraded infrastructure on the other hand energy consumption in pumping stations represented 31 of the energy consumption in the water utility in 2018 this high consumption and the poor performance in pumping stations efficiency ah15 in table 9 highlight the need to adopt specific measures to improve the efficiency of this equipment secondly the efficiency of the francis turbine installed upstream of network area s2 was low in 2018 63 according to liu et al 2015 which indicates the potential to improve energy production from the natural energy supplied to the system for the analysis horizon changes in the wua internal context will involve the phased rehabilitation of 43 8 of the total canal extension of s2 in 10 years contributing to a better performance in the infrastructure value index for the future long term behaviour performance improvement is expected mainly in water losses due to canal leakage and discharges improving efficiency in water resources and non revenue water nevertheless performance in terms of pumping groups value index ah06 water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 and energy efficiency in pumping stations ah15 will decrease or maintain due to the lack of rehabilitation in the components moreover it also identified the need to improve the efficiency of the hydraulic turbine to improve energy production and related revenues five exploratory alternatives were identified in collaboration with the wua where a4 and a5 correspond to a combination of interventions in network area s2 alternative a0 status quo not considering interventions and maintaining the current operation and maintenance practices alternative a1 rehabilitation of 50 3 km of the main canal in 5 years 2019 2023 alternative a2 replace 149 old paddle wheel water metres with a nominal diameter dn150 and dn200 alternative a3 optimisation of the operation of the hydraulic turbine francis alternative a4 combination of alternatives a1 and a2 a1 a2 alternative a5 combination of alternatives a1 a2 and a3 a1 a2 a3 the prioritisation was developed based on the comparative analysis in terms of performance and economic viability of the proposed alternatives in a 20 years analysis horizon the same pis selected for prioritising network areas table 9 were adopted for comparative performance analysis between alternatives table 10 illustrates the global performance level for each solution analysed in 2023 i e after the implementation period of alternatives despite a fair performance the global assessment 1 43 indicates that canal rehabilitation alternative a1 has a relevant positive impact relative to a0 with expected global performance in 2023 of only 1 12 relative to alternatives a2 and a3 the contribution to global improvement is minimal indicating that these types of interventions are punctual and are insufficient to improve performance optimisation of the hydraulic turbine a3 operation only impacts excess energy ah16 in contrast the replacement of water metres a2 besides a slight impact on non revenue water ah04 also impacts the energy in excess ah16 to some extent with water metre replacement the energy in excess reduces since authorised consumption increases due to a decrease in water metering errors while most of the authorised billed consumption about 70 of consumption is measured using old neyrpic modules in network area s2 and the alternative a2 focus only on replacing paddle wheel water metres thus future comparative analysis should study the replacement of neyrpic modules alternatives a1 a4 and a5 show a better global assessment in 2023 especially in the infrastructure value index ah05 the water losses due to canal leakage ah09 both with good performance and the efficiency of water resources ah14 with fair performance compared to the alternative a0 status quo the rehabilitation of the main canal a1 involves an initial reduction of approximately 40 of water losses due to canal discharges a11 with fair performance relatively to alternative a0 however non revenue water ah04 and the energy efficiency of pumping stations ah15 continue with poor performance in 2023 these results indicate that additional measures to alternatives a1 a4 or a5 would be necessary to improve water and energy efficiency e g enhance monitoring and control of discharges and rehabilitation of pumping stations fig 2a presents the progress of the non revenue water ah04 fig 2b the energy supplied in excess ah16 during the analysis period and fig 2c the cost of the alternatives versus the average global assessment in the evolution of both pis fig 2a b a significant decrease is observed until the end of the implementation of canal rehabilitation 2023 in alternatives involving canal rehabilitation a1 a4 and a5 the behaviour until 2023 is due to a reduction in water losses due to canal leakage ah09 and water discharges ah11 since intervention involved canal waterproofing and better control of water discharges since water losses also contribute to reducing energy in excess ah16 these alternatives also positively influence energy efficiency after the rehabilitation period it was considered that water losses increased at a similar rate as in a0 in the network area s2 indicating that it is necessary to maintain a continuous practice of rehabilitation the assumption relative to the evolution of water losses can be improved by considering different rates for rehabilitated and non rehabilitated components the interventions cost was estimated based on the information and rehabilitation budgets provided by the water utility for the non revenue water despite maintaining an unsatisfactory performance the alternatives a1 and a5 present the best performance in the analysis horizon period with its minimum value in 2023 fig 2a after implementation regarding the energy in excess as for the non revenue water the alternatives a1 a4 and a5 will involve higher performance enhancement even though presenting a fair performance during the analysis period fig 2b however the gradual performance decrease in both pis between 2023 and 2039 highlights the importance of the water utility continuing to rehabilitate network area s2 gradually the comparative performance analysis fig 2c allows identifying the alternatives a1 a4 a1 a2 and a5 a1 a2 a3 with a similar value for global assessment approximately 1 30 as the best solutions for network area s2 fig 2c for the global evaluation pis expressed in different units and judged by reference values were converted into performance indices through the application of performance levels 0 1 poor performance 1 2 fair performance 2 3 good performance thereby in fig 2c the red area corresponds to poor the yellow area to the fair and the green area to good performance in terms of the global assessment these solutions will significantly reduce losses and energy in excess and increase authorised consumption and efficiency in water resources although the cost investment of a1 and a4 is similar 16 6 m and the cost of a5 is higher 17 7 m for a similar global performance specific interventions in equipment a2 and a3 have a punctual impact on some performance indicators in this study relative to the economic feasibility of the proposed alternatives three economic indicators were adopted namely the net present value the internal rate of return and the payback period based on these indicators alternatives a2 payback period 4 years and a3 payback period 9 years would be viable solutions for the 20 year analysis horizon the remaining alternatives require a more extended period to recover the initial investment nevertheless the payback period is smaller 34 years when considering the three options combined a5 due to increased efficiency in real and apparent losses and recovered energy relative to alternative a1 41 years therefore using the proposed pas it was possible the analysis interventions in terms of performance and cost that will support wuas in prioritisation moreover it was demonstrated the importance of rehabilitation measures to improve water and energy efficiency in cis 3 3 comparative analysis between ciss 3 3 1 water utility and ciss profiles the comparative analysis between ciss was performed considering the gravity cis previously described in 3 1 and a pressurised cis this comparative analysis exemplifies the differences between a traditional and a more recent cis and tests the proposed pas the irrigation period in 2018 for the gravity and the pressurised ciss was 174 and 365 days respectively the pressurised cis began its exploration in 1981 and presents a more reduced dimension with 1500 ha of irrigation area and 108 irrigation users relative to the gravity system see 3 1 1 in the pressurised cis the pipe conveyance and distribution system collects water from a reservoir receives additional energy from a pumping station installed downstream and is set up by two network areas c1 and c2 during 2014 and 2015 57 4 of the pipe network was rehabilitated corresponding to the entire network area c2 and part of c1 overall the gravity cis has a higher dimension especially regarding agricultural beneficiaries irrigation users human resources and the total and average authorised consumption volume tables 5 and 6 furthermore the average billed authorised consumption in the gravity cis where the irrigated area for rice crops predominates was almost three times the billed consumption of the pressurised cis where the irrigated area for olive crops dominates between 2016 and 2018 fig 3a in the gravity system the average billed authorised consumption was similar in 2016 and 2018 average precipitation 628 mm and increased in 2017 average precipitation 331 mm this latter was the driest year in the period of analysis in this cis which entailed a greater crop water demand in terms of energy costs fig 3b the pressurised cis shows much higher energy costs up to 50 of operational costs than the gravity system energy costs less than 10 of operational costs the pressurised cis presents a higher dependency on electrical energy varying the energy cost between 34 2 and 49 8 of operational cost during the analysed period in this system the low precipitation in 2018 average precipitation 359 mm lead to higher crop water demand thus more intensive use of pumping groups led to increased energy costs this year 3 3 2 comparative analysis based on the pas application a benchmarking analysis at the global level regarding the main water losses and energy inefficiency problems is presented table 11 presents the comparative analysis between the gravity and the pressurised ciss for the reference year 2018 in the economic financial sustainability the performance is fair or poor in terms of total adhesion ah03 and non revenue water ah04 in both systems the extensive irrigated area outside the equipped area highlights the need to incorporate areas with non beneficiaries in these ciss moreover as suggested in previous studies zema et al 2018 the increase in service coverage is very important for the cost recovery of wuas concerning non revenue water both systems show poor performance even though the causes for this problem may be different in the gravity system the high water losses due to discharges i e ah11 with poor performance due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 and ah10 with fair performance associated with the low value of the infrastructure value index ah05 with fair performance suggest insufficient network monitoring and control of discharges and an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions in the pressurised system the low water losses due to pipe leakage ah10 with good performance the good efficiency of water resources use ah14 with good performance and the high value of the infrastructure value index ah05 with fair performance indicate other problems of non revenue water since the existing water metres are recent and respective errors reduced the utility stated that the main issue might be pipe discharges for cleaning and unblocking the network unbilled unmeasured authorised consumption concerning infrastructural sustainability network failures ah07 represent the main problem of the pressurised cis with poor performance in 2018 despite a recent network ah05 0 74 due to significant pipe rehabilitation carried out between 2014 and 2015 problems persist due to the poor infrastructural condition of the remaining network without rehabilitation with high pipe failures relatively to the infrastructure value index ah05 although indicating a recent network the fair performance highlights the importance of phased planning avoiding future concentrated rehabilitation the gravity system has an ageing network ah05 0 28 with fair performance with the potential to improve water losses due to canal and pipe leakage ah09 ah10 with fair performance indicating possible infrastructural problems and the relevance of planning rehabilitation interventions in this system in terms of operational and maintenance sustainability the water losses due to discharges in the gravity system are significant ah11 with poor performance there is a lack of data about failures in measurement control and cleaning equipment and pumping groups for both systems the gravity system shows a fair performance relative to water use efficiency whereas the pressurised system s performance is good there is potential to improve energy efficiency in both systems ah15 ah16 with fair or poor performance in the pressurised system with energy costs representing up to 50 of operational costs measures to improve energy efficiency e g installation of variable speed devices replacement of old pumping groups pressure management network sectorization suggested in previous studies rodríguez díaz et al 2011 are particularly relevant however further analysis would be necessary to evaluate the adequacy of these measures and their impact on water and energy efficiency in the gravity system energy costs represented less than 10 regarding service accessibility the performance was good in own water capacity ah17 and similar in water charges ah18 in both systems service interruptions ah19 have poor performance in terms of the quality of service and on demand service is absent ah20 in the gravity system in opposition to the pressurised system therefore the comparative analysis carried out in this paper suggests that the proposed pas applies to different ciss with different contexts these promising results constitute a first step for establishing a general pas for ciss similar to the urban water sector experience where a framework of pis was established for application worldwide alegre et al 2017 and adopted as a reference for regulation of the quality of service in different countries namely in portugal 4 conclusions a novel pas to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems was proposed in this study aligned with the water users association objectives it integrates the water utility profile the collective irrigation system profile a set of criteria and respective performance indicators pis with reference values applicable to gravity pressurised or combined ciss based on previous studies an approach for diagnosis and planning measures to improve water and energy efficiency using the pas is also proposed the pas application for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency was firstly tested under a traditional gravity cis secondly the pas was used to compare gravity and pressurised ciss the pas application for global analysis indicated significant canal and pipe leakage possible due to an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions for the gravity system in the second place considerable water losses due to canal and intermediate reservoir discharges indicate the potential to improve network monitoring and control thereby with relevant real losses due to canal and pipe leakage and discharges the efficiency of water resources has a significant potential to improve besides the economic impact of water losses it was possible to assess the effect on energy efficiency poor efficiency in pumping stations and performance in real losses lead to high energy in excess supply to the system possible cross cutting measures to increase water and energy efficiency were proposed from the global analysis improving water metres billing and customer data management installing water in all irrigation users inventory data about the network failure events and rehabilitation interventions and monitoring the main canal discharges at the network area level network area s2 with the potential to improve canal and pipe leakage and pump efficiency and responsible for 63 of water losses due to canal discharges in 2018 was identified with the highest priority for intervention based on the performance and economic analysis the alternative combining rehabilitation of the main canal replacing water metres and optimising the hydraulic turbine will further improve the performance of network area s2 based on the pas application and the comparative analysis between the gravity and the pressurised ciss both systems present poor performance in non revenue water impairing economic sustainability in the gravity system the most relevant component of non revenue water corresponds to real losses possible due to an ageing network with poor infrastructural conditions and insufficient monitoring and control of discharges in the pressurised system with a recent pipe network the high number of network failures in the pressurised system indicates that some infrastructure problems persist despite the intense rehabilitation carried out by the wua with good pipe leakage performance and water resources efficiency the most relevant component of non revenue water is due to authorised unbilled consumption for network maintenance and cleaning due to water quality problems concerning energy efficiency both systems show potential to improve energy efficiency in pumping stations and reduce energy in excess in the pressurised system measures to improve energy efficiency e g installation of variable speed devices replacement of old pumping groups pressure management are particularly relevant since energy costs represent up to 50 of operational costs in contrast the gravity system represents less than 10 this paper demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed pas for diagnosing ciss at the global and network area levels decision making to improve water and energy efficiency and comparing different cis considering the different contexts nevertheless future work should include the application of the pas for diagnosis and decision support in an extensive set of ciss from other contexts e

9193,timely and accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc is essential for efficient irrigation management at the farmland scale however effective decision making for irrigation scheduling requires high spatiotemporal resolution data to provide within field heterogeneity information the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of optical and thermal information obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle uav to quantify maize zea mays l etc within the framework of the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach canopy temperature based crop water stress index cwsi and number of degrees above canopy threshold dact were used to determine the stress coefficient ks three types of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and enhanced vegetation index evi were adopted to determine basal crop coefficient kcb then the two forms of stress coefficient in combination with three vegetation indices vis were evaluated to estimate daily crop etc under different irrigation treatments over two years in the southwest region of inner mongolia china the results demonstrated that the combination of ndvi and cwsi produced the best estimates of maize etc with r2 of 0 84 and root mean square error rmse of 0 50 mm day the dact based model also performed well with r2 of 0 77 0 80 and rmse of 0 53 mm day although the results varied with irrigation levels the daily mean bias error of etc predictions over different years indicated acceptable accuracy with a mean bias error mbe of 0 48 mm day sensitivity analyses indicated that etc models were most sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis followed by soil evaporation constant and influential factor in ks dact from this study the combinations of vegetation index and cwsi as well as dact were recommended as alternative approaches for estimating etc due to intrinsic simplicity and easy interpretation these etc models relying on uav based multi sensor data thus show promising potential in farmland scale applications keywords unmanned aerial vehicle uav evapotranspiration vegetation index fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach water stress coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity will increase rapidly in irrigated agriculture due to population growth and an increase in food demand by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 elliott et al 2014 molden 2007 ray et al 2013 in semi arid and arid areas the use of deficit irrigation has been proposed to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields ali et al 2007 farre et al 2009 fereres et al 2007 tari et al 2016 a key aspect for deficit irrigation relies on precise information about crop water requirements including timely and accurate crop evapotranspiration etc estimation helman et al 2019 conventionally etc can be monitored using in situ measurements such as weighing lysimeters lopez urrea et al 2012 eddy covariance systems liu et al 2013 and large aperture scintillometers hemakumara et al 2003 however such methods are not suitable for large scale estimates of etc due to their substantial expense and land surface heterogeneity a practical and commonly accepted indirect approach the fao 56 method estimates etc by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto by a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 kc represents characteristics of a specific crop with respect to canopy properties ground cover and aerodynamic resistance however in situ measurement of it still cannot describe the spatial variation of etc within a farm anderson et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 testi et al 2004 pereira et al 2015 significant advances in remote sensing technology have provided temporally and spatially distributed information regarding crops combining remote sensing based data with the fao 56 method makes it possible to monitor large scale etc in support of irrigation management relevant studies have been conducted over the past two decades bausch 1995 calera belmonte et al 2003 campos et al 2010 2017 choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 furthermore numerous other studies have investigated approaches using satellite based vegetation indices vis for etc prediction of annual crops in a simple robust and operational manner campos et al 2010 2017 jin et al 2017a 2017b mateos et al 2013 nevertheless satellite data cannot obtain timely crop growth information during the entire growing season and cannot describe the detailed variation of etc at the farmland scale due to low resolution and variable weather conditions wan et al 2020 recent developments in the miniaturization of sensors and energy storage technology have led to the current explosion in the applications of unmanned aerial vehicles uav for data acquisition for precision agriculture because of their high spatio temporal resolution compared with satellite platforms colomina and molina 2014 hill et al 2017 sidike et al 2018 the uav imagery based multispectral vis have exhibited a relatively high prediction accuracy with regard to estimating kc at farmland scale shao et al 2021 utilized different types of vis extracted from uav based multispectral imagery to monitor maize kc during an entire growing season uav based systems have the advantage of rapidly mapping the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a significant relationship between ndvi and the kc in maize zea mays l was observed over the entire growing season zhang et al 2019 the combined use of vis derived from uav based multispectral images was also applied to predict etc with the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach in maize tang et al 2019 but the prediction accuracy was low with the root mean square error rmse of 0 95 mm day various studies demonstrated that appropriate vis ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and enhanced vegetation index evi can be used to efficiently monitor kc compared with traditional measurements pôças et al 2020 however the application of vis for the prediction of actual kc values is not successful the main problem is that most of the commonly used vis represent the effects of potential growth reduction but often lose sensitivity to water stress when its effect is only noticeable on the transpiration rates pôças et al 2020 due to the relationship between vegetation surface temperature and transpiration thermal based methods are highly suited for the detection of water stress status han et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 pôças et al 2020 veysi et al 2017 kullberg et al 2017 compared several indices including the crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature ratio tcratio degrees above non stressed dans and degrees above canopy threshold dact based on canopy temperature for assessing the crop water stress coefficient ks and resulting etc using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach olivera guerra et al 2020 developed a new irrigation retrieval method at the landsat pixel scale based on optical and thermal data and the ks derived from land surface temperature data currently the use of satellite coincident optical and thermal data is still hampered by the lack of fine spatial and temporal resolutions at the farmland scale wulder et al 2019 in addition uav based thermal imagery has been applied for crop water status detection martinez et al 2017 santesteban et al 2017 l zhang et al 2019 y zhang et al 2019 but has not been tested to estimate etc from thermal based ks as stated above ks can be quantified by crop canopy temperature therefore it is necessary to investigate which simple method is better for assessing ks and etc around solar noon on sunny days on a farmland scale in addition the great potential of using combined data from multiple sensors to detect ks and improve etc assessment has not been well studied using uavs here we utilized uav based vis and crop canopy temperature products to conduct a two year study over a maize farm the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the potential of low cost uav based imagery for maize etc estimation 2 compare the accuracy of each method to predict daily etc through a combination of three methods ndvi savi and evi to determine basal crop coefficient kcb and two different forms cwsi and dact of ks methods and 3 evaluate the robustness and adaptability of uav based etc estimation model across different irrigation treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental design a two year field experiment was conducted on a 1 13 ha farm field situated in zhaojun town in the southwest region of inner mongolia china 40 26 0 29 n 109 36 25 99 e the climate is semi arid and the soil type is loamy sand a more

was planted in mid may tasseled in july and harvested for silage in september 2018 and 2019 inter row spacing was 0 58 m and row direction was east west to avoid plant nutrient stress and weeds fertilizer and herbicide were applied according to local farmer practices in both years of the experiment there were five treatments and five levels of irrigation each of the treatments was replicated three times with an individual plot size of 6 6 m treatment 1 was applied irrigation to fully satisfy crop water requirements during the whole growing season in 2018 due to frequent rainfall during the entire growing season deficit irrigation treatments were only applied during the rapid and middle growth stages in 2019 the deficit irrigation treatments were applied during the entire growing season around 90 of field water holding capacity was the benchmark of abundant irrigation the amount of irrigation table 1 in each treatment was measured by rain gauge cylinders with three replications meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located on a 1 ha alfalfa plot adjacent to the research field the time courses of precipitation and maximum air temperature during the maize growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 2 the total precipitation in the period was 272 mm and 113 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively the daily maximum air temperature ranged between 20 and 36 c in both years 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 uav based data collection two uavs were used to capture images between 11 00 and 14 00 local time over the entire maize growing season in 2018 and

ardupilot the flight heights were set at 60 and 70 m agl for thermal and multispectral images respectively and the flight path resulted in 85 front and side overlap providing ground sampling distances

the uav flight more detailed calibration information for the uav based thermal imagery is provided in zhang et al 2019 to optimize the geo referencing of the images acquired from the multi sensor uav

spectral and thermal information extraction uav based vis were extracted from the raw spectral bands red green blue near infrared and red edge and used as canopy spectral features additionally three kinds of vis previously used to estimate kcb were calculated table 3 fractional vegetation cover fc and maize canopy temperature were estimated using the red green ratio index rgri otsu method zhang et al 2019 the formulas for rgri calculation are presented in table 3 additionally fc the percentage of vegetation area per ground surface area was extracted from rgb imagery using the rgri method classified maize pixels were divided by the total number of pixels in the plot to calculate fc the maize pixels value 255 in the rgb images could be classified with the otsu method the classification image values were multiplied by the corresponding thermal infrared image values to extract the temperature of maize canopy t the workflow of temperature extraction is shown in fig 4 two water stress indices cwsi and dact were used to calculate ks the formulas for cwsi and dact calculations are presented in table 3 the dact was calculated using the canopy temperature and the canopy temperature threshold tcritical tcritical is a known constant for a given crop for maize 28 c has been suggested by the ars plant stress and water conservation laboratory evett et al 2000 dejonge et al 2015 the cwsi where dtm dtll and dtul are the actual measurement lower limit and upper limit of the canopy air temperature difference tc ta respectively cwsi can be simplified by taking 5 ºc as the constant dtul cohen et al 2015 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 in this study dtll has been established for 2018 and 2019 zhang et al 2022 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d t l

4 calculation of evapotranspiration and crop coefficient daily etc was estimated by the soil water balance equation 4 e t c i p i i i d r i d r i 1 d p i r o i c r i where etc i is evapotranspiration for the day of interest mm i pi is precipitation for the day of interest mm ii is irrigation for the day of interest mm dr i is deficit for the day of interest mm dr i 1 is deficit for the previous day of interest mm dp i is deep percolation for the day of interest mm roi is surface runoff for the day of interest mm and cri is the capillary rise from the deep water table for the day of interest mm runoff and capillary rise were ignored due to no slope on the plot area and deep groundwater table the dp was calculated using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 following irrigation or heavy rain swc in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some of them may go down into deeper soil layers it was assumed that the soil water content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event so the dr i will be zero etc i was estimated by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 5 d p i p i r o i i i e t c i d r i 1 the basal crop coefficient kcb and the crop water stress coefficient ks were calculated using the fao 56 procedures jensen and allen 2016 under standard conditions rhmin 45 u2 2 m s the three key values looking up table in fao 56 for the basal crop coefficient kcb tab of maize were determined as 0 15 at the rapid 1 15 at the middle and 0 15 at the late growth stage respectively for calculating the daily actual value of kcb the standardized kcb values are adjusted according to observed lai and h values pereira et al 2020 the modified fao 56 kcb value can be calculated by eqs 6 and 7 6 k c b a d j u s t k c b t a b h 3 0 3 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 7 k c b a k c min k c b a d j u s t k c min 1 exp k l a i where kcb adjust is the kcb corrected by meteorological factors kcb tab is the value for kcb under the above referred standard climate h is the average plant height m u2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m above the crop canopy m s rhmin is the minimum relative humidity when the crop dries in the field kcb 0 45 the adjustment by eq 6 is not required kcb a indicates the kcb modified by the lai kc min is the minimum value for bare soil 0 15 and k is the canopy attenuation coefficient of radiation and the value of k is 0 7 by ding et al 2013 the crop water stress coefficient ks can be expressed as a simple linear model following the procedures described in fao 33 which is equal to the fao 56 ks procedure jensen and allen 2016 8 k s 1 θ θ t θ θ wp θ t θ w p θ w p θ θ t 0 θ θ w p 9 θ t 1 p θ f c θ w p θ w p where θ is the mean volumetric soil water in the root zone m3m 3 θt is the threshold water content m3m 3 θwp is the permanent wilting point m3m 3 θfc is the field capacity m3m 3 p is the average fraction of available soil water that can be deleted from the root zone before moisture stress and is 0 55 for maize as previously recommended allen et al 1998 values for eqs 8 and 9 are listed in table 4 2 5 uav based etc estimation methods based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach according to the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach etc is defined as follows 10 e t c k s k c b k e e t 0 where ks is the soil water stress coefficient representing the influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration kcb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration under no stress ke is the soil evaporation coefficient et0 is the reference evapotranspiration we evaluated two different forms of the ks model in combination with three types of kcb approaches the two forms of the ks model employed thermal information first cwsi was used to quantify ks according to jackson et al 1981 the first model was 11 k s c w s i 1 c w s i the second model employed dact to calculate ks on the condition that dact was 0 for no stress and positive infinity for high stress the normalized relationship between ks and dact found in kullberg et al 2017 can be expressed as 12 k s d a c t max 1 d a c t a 0 a is a variable optimized to reduce the rmse between ks determined from dact ndvi savi and evi were used for the estimation of kcb in this study the linear function of the kcb vi approach can be given as 13 k c b v i b 0 v i b 1 finally we assumed constant rates of soil water evaporation and ke values were related to fc according to er raki et al 2007 therefore ke values were derived as 14 k e c 1 f c the value c was based on the frequency of irrigation and rainfall from the early stage start until the ndvimax doy 161 202 in 2018 and doy 159 207 in 2019 13 and 7 irrigation rainfall events of 0 2 et0 occurred for relevant rainfall events see allen et al 2006 p 153 this was equivalent to rainfall events every 3 days in 2018 and 7 days in 2019 with an average et0 of 3 8 mm day and 4 0 mm day during the growing season this corresponds to a coefficient of 0 8 in 2018 and 0 3 in 2019 in order to analyze the effect a particular kcb method may have on the accuracy of each ks method each stress coefficient was applied with each of vis ndvi savi and evi based kcb values etc using all combinations of the two ks methods and three kcb methods were compared to etc from the observed tdr and soil water balance measurements model performance was quantified by using the coefficient of determination r2 rmse the mean bias error mbe and the relative root mean square error rrmse the detailed workflow from feature extraction to model building and evaluation is presented in fig 5 there was a total of 100 samples collected from 2018 to 2019 in which 70 samples selected randomly were the training set and the remaining 30 samples were the validation set for estimation models of the ks kcb and etc 70 of the total samples in 2018 and 2019 were used as the training set and the remaining samples were used as the validation set 2 6 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the etc models three parameters a b 0 and c were subjected to a sensitivity analysis a is a key influential factor in ks dact b 0 is slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis c is soil evaporation constant applied in ke calculation in the analysis the values of these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values and the simulated and original etc values were then compared to determine the influence of these parameters on the models 3 results 3 1 validation of soil water content by tdr and temperature measured by a thermal infrared camera the gravimetric method was used as the standard method to measure swc at different depths in four of the measurement times with tdr and the relationship was analyzed using linear regression with the data obtained from two methods the measurements of tdr had higher accuracy with r2 of 0 95 fig 6 the ground measured temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures in the uav thermal imagery to convert to a surface level temperature through a linear model fig 7 3 2 characterization of maize growth under different irrigation treatments fig 8 shows the effects of different levels of deficit irrigation on kcb fao ks fao and vegetation indices as shown in fig 8a and b kcb fao gradually increased during the early stage peaked at the middle stage and decreased thereafter at the late stage compared with kcb fao in 2018 fig 8a kcb fao in 2019 fig 8b increased with increasing irrigation levels for instance the average of kcb fao were 0 89 0 85 and 0 79 for tr 6 7 and 8 respectively compared with ks fao in 2019 fig 8c ks fao in 2018 fig 8d was overall higher due to the large rainfall events occurring during the early to middle growth stage uav vis and thermal data were selected and conducted to investigate which parameters were sensitive to irrigation levels as shown in fig 8c j the vis increased gradually until the middle growth stage and then slightly decreased compared with savi and evi a significant saturation phenomenon was observed for ndvi at the late growth stage the vis in 2018 showed no obvious differences among the five irrigation levels during the entire growing season while the vis in 2019 increased with increasing irrigation levels the results indicate that ndvi savi and evi are suitable for monitoring kcb during entire growing season additionally the changing pattern of canopy temperature t contrasts with the changes of ks fao e g the average of t were 26 8 and 32 8 for tr 1 and 4 while the average of ks fao were 0 95 and 0 87 indicating that t can be used to monitor ks fao and is closely related to irrigation level during the entire growing season fig 8k and l 3 3 results of ks and kcb estimation to convert cwsi and dact into ks the relationships between ks fao values and two indices are shown in fig 9a and b moreover the relationships between kcb fao and the three vis are shown in fig 9c e the positive correlation between kcb fao and vis ndvi savi and evi was shown the estimated model parameters as well as the accuracy evaluation for the uav based ks kcb models are shown in table 5 compared with the ks dact model the ks cwsi model performed better rmse was 0 09 all the vi based kcb models exhibited very close performance rmse was 0 08 0 09 3 4 evaluation of etc estimates the predicted etc using all combinations of the two ks methods and three kcb methods is compared with tdr derived etc as shown by scatterplots fig 10 that include bias measurements via best fit lines assuming intercept of 0 r2 and rmse for each method satisfactory results from the etc assessment based on ks cwsi model were achieved using kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi methods with slope r2 and rmse of 1 02 0 84 and 0 50 mm day 0 99 0 83 and 0 50 mm day and 0 924 0 751 and 0 663 mm day respectively fig 10a c fig 10d f show that ks dact model also provided comparable estimates of etc ndvi slope 1 04 r2 0 80 and rmse 0 53 mm day savi slope 1 00 r2 0 77 and rmse 0 53 mm day evi slope 1 01 r2 0 77 and rmse 0 53 mm day both ks cwsi and ks dact models had more scatters at higher etc values compared with the daily etc values from the tdr soil water balance rmse values for each combination of ks and kcb method in 2018 and 2019 are shown in table 6 for both ks methods in 2018 the kcb savi method provided the best prediction accuracy with an average rmse of 0 49 mm day while using evi resulted in greater errors compared with other vis an average of 0 59 mm day in 2018 the two ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy the two ks methods performed at different levels of accuracy and the lower rmse of cwsi compared with dact in 2019 indicates that cwsi has more potential to be used as a stress coefficient under stressed conditions evi exhibited the poorest performance in 2019 with an average rmse of 0 67 mm day despite the potential for integrating multi temporal uav based image data for assessment of etc was confirmed the influence of different irrigation levels on the performance of etc prediction is still unclear fig 11a shows the prediction results under different irrigation levels the rmse of using ks dact was slightly increased for the more stressed treatments in 2019 an average of 0 81 mm day the ks cwsi model performed well at all treatments an average of 0 48 mm day compared with the rmse values for the two methods in the less stressed treatments the ks dact model exhibited a relatively poorer prediction result than the ks cwsi in more stressed treatments fig 11b shows the mbe of daily etc estimates over the study period all combinations of ks and kcb methods overestimated etc moreover the two ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy and the low mbe values with ks dact and ks cwsi models indicate that these indices have the potential to be used to estimate cumulative water use 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the etc models fig 12 shows the sensitivity analysis of different etc models toward changing parameters a b 0 and c no sensitivity analysis was done for parameter a in ks cwsi model as it was estimated independently as a function of vpd different etc models exhibited similar behaviors with changing parameters the sensitivity analysis reveals that the decreasing of 50 of parameters a and c resulted in a reduction of 9 and 18 in 2018 etc respectively and a reduction of 21 and 10 in 2019 etc respectively regardless of etc models in 2018 when the value of parameter b 0 was reduced by 50 both ks based etc decreased by 33 35 and 24 for kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi models respectively in 2019 when the value of parameter b 0 was reduced by 50 both ks based etc decreased by 40 43 and 32 for kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi models respectively in general etc models were most sensitive to parameter b 0 in both years indicating that the major differences in these models are their different descriptions of the kcb additionally the importance of water stress in etc models was higher than soil evaporation under water deficit conditions fig 12d vs f 4 discussion the spectral information used to calculate vis from remote sensing data has shown potential for etc prediction but the reliability and the accuracy of these predictions have not been satisfactory under water stress condition pocas et al 2020 tang et al 2019 for instance tang et al 2019 reported that vis based etc prediction model produced low accuracy with rmse of 0 95 1 25 mm day under different levels of deficit irrigation this is mainly due to three problems 1 the vis easily saturate under high biomass conditions thenkabail et al 2000 fu et al 2014 2 most commonly used vis are not responsive to early stages of crop water stress campos et al 2013 pocas et al 2015 and 3 the developed etc prediction models are not robust enough to assess the etc of contrasting climate years pereira et al 2020 pocas et al 2020 in this study we proposed the integration of optical and thermal information to overcome the vi saturation issue extraction of a thermal based water stress indicator and development of a prediction model to improve the robustness of response to climate change 4 1 relationship between uav based vis and kcb ks remote sensing based vis have been employed to assess kcb and irrigation requirements campos et al 2010 2017 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 padilla et al 2011 but it has been unclear whether uav based image data could monitor crop growth to forecast crop coefficients in different years as shown in fig 8 both kcb fao and uav based image data provided time course plots of maize under different water applications uav based vis data were not sensitive to the slight water stress condition especially at the middle and late growth stage due to the saturation at high canopy coverage and the results are consistent with previous studies becker reshef et al 2010 vergara diaz et al 2016 wan et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 in the performance of each kcb estimate method we found that the correlations between kcb with ndvi savi and evi were robust regardless of growing season and irrigation treatment with rmse ranging from 0 07 to 0 12 fig 13a in this study the temperature changes showed an opposite trend to ks fao suggesting that temperature could monitor maize water status moreover the close linkages between thermal based temperature and water stress coefficients have been shown in many previous studies colaizzi et al 2003 kullberg et al 2017 olivera guerra et al 2020 however the correlation between ks and dact were more susceptible to climate factors and irrigation treatments in the performance of each ks estimate method especially under water stress conditions fig 13b this indicated that the normalization equations or methodology of ks dact may need to be calibrated by applying more severe stressed treatments and different climactic conditions uav based optical and thermal remote sensing can provide a more comprehensive description of maize growth by combining different image parameters most importantly uav based optical and thermal remote sensing could generate high resolution diagnostic etc maps at different growth stages to support precision field management and decision making 4 2 performance of regression methods in maize etc prediction previous studies have demonstrated that spectral based indicators vis and thermal based indicators cwsi and dact extracted from remote sensing images were linked to etc mahmoud and gan 2019 mokhtari et al 2018 olivera guerra et al 2020 pocas et al 2020 our study proved that ndvi savi evi cwsi and dact from uav images could provide good characterizations of maize evapotranspiration but they provided different prediction results regarding kcb regression methods kcb ndvi and kcb savi methods generally exhibited very close performance in both ks methods cwsi and dact for the two different years table 6 kcb ndvi model performed slightly better in each ks based etc prediction in 2019 while kcb savi model performed better in 2018 however evi performed slightly worse than the other two methods in both 2018 and 2019 regardless of thermal based indicators table 6 this result agrees with previous studies pereira et al 2015 shao et al 2021 that ndvi and savi were superior to evi in maize etc estimation applications because of the actual vegetation cover conditions reflected by these indices additionally relatively lower rmse values were achieved for ks cwsi regression in combination with three kcb methods compared with the ks dact method table 6 this is likely attributable to the fact that cwsi obtained from in situ data produced more accurate values than dact for the prediction of crop water stress taghvaeian et al 2014 dejonge et al 2015 the best performance for etc prediction was the ks cwsi method combined with kcb ndvi achieving an r2 of 0 84 and rmse of 0 50 mm day fig 10a furthermore compared with cwsi dact more consistently overestimated etc on days with higher etc values one reason could be that dact underestimated water stress status and the normalization equation used in this study for maize still might not be adequate as found in previous studies regarding optimal empirical values and stress levels dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 the different irrigation levels produced distinct maize canopy characteristics resulting in different spatial and spectral features in the uav based images consequently the prediction accuracy of etc would vary with irrigation levels and the mild stressed irrigation treatments in both years exhibited better performance regardless of the ks methods fig 11a in addition all treatments produced slightly higher errors from the ks dact model in 2019 the reason why the prediction accuracy decreased may be also related to the impact of soil evaporation soil evaporation is low under water stress conditions and constant evaporation rates cannot reflect the role of soil evaporation especially at early growth stages furthermore the daily mbe values for etc prediction over 2018 and 2019 from the ks cwsi model and the ks dact model combined with the kcb vi methods were similar fig 11b this result agrees with previous studies kullberg et al 2017 that dact had the same performance as cwsi in predicting cumulative etc consequently we concluded that the proposed models were robust in predicting etc between different years 4 3 uncertainty and future works under the current framework the etc models have the potential to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely managing crop stress and water supply however it still has some weaknesses that should be noted the etc calculation was based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach although the model validation was satisfactory there still exist fitting parameters a b 0 and c in the model that need calibration as the parameters may differ in crop type irrigation management and climatic conditions pocas et al 2020 the water stress was calculated using stress index equations further work is suggested to investigate other stress indices for ks evaluation without local calibration which may reduce limitations in practical applications the soil evaporation parameter c was set to be a constant value with the frequency of irrigation and rainfall further soil evaporation models can be developed to use uav synthetic aperture radar data for estimating ke under partial and full cover conditions moreover the use of weighing lysimeters to validate daily etc values increases the reliability of these results for the maize etc estimation models generated in the study the effects of irrigation amount and sensitivity of parameters were analyzed over two years future work is needed to test the performance of etc models in other climatological conditions to determine the applicability and transferability of these methods 5 conclusions the ability of optical and thermal information derived from multiple uav based sensors to monitor crop etc under different levels of deficit irrigation was evaluated using vis and temperature based water stress indices we found that uav based canopy temperature measurements were suitable for monitoring crop water status as well as ks during the entire maize growing season two types of stress coefficient models based on 1 cwsi and 2 dact were evaluated and found to provid the best results for crop etc assessment in combination with kcb vi approaches in 2018 and 2019 r2 of 0 84 and 0 80 rmse of 0 50 mm day and 0 53 mm day respectively compared with ndvi and savi the empirical kcb evi model showed a relatively poorer prediction result although results varied with irrigation levels daily mbe values of etc prediction indicated that the proposed methods performed robustly over different years sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the parameters in etc models and the models were highly sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis followed by soil evaporation constant and influential factor in ks dact the developed approach for estimating maize etc at the field scale with high spatial temporal resolution can improve irrigation management with precision agriculture future work is needed to investigate the combined use of ancillary models radar based models and soil water balance models to retrieve soil evaporation values to further increase the accuracy of etc estimation credit authorship contribution statement yu

9193,timely and accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc is essential for efficient irrigation management at the farmland scale however effective decision making for irrigation scheduling requires high spatiotemporal resolution data to provide within field heterogeneity information the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of optical and thermal information obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle uav to quantify maize zea mays l etc within the framework of the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach canopy temperature based crop water stress index cwsi and number of degrees above canopy threshold dact were used to determine the stress coefficient ks three types of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and enhanced vegetation index evi were adopted to determine basal crop coefficient kcb then the two forms of stress coefficient in combination with three vegetation indices vis were evaluated to estimate daily crop etc under different irrigation treatments over two years in the southwest region of inner mongolia china the results demonstrated that the combination of ndvi and cwsi produced the best estimates of maize etc with r2 of 0 84 and root mean square error rmse of 0 50 mm day the dact based model also performed well with r2 of 0 77 0 80 and rmse of 0 53 mm day although the results varied with irrigation levels the daily mean bias error of etc predictions over different years indicated acceptable accuracy with a mean bias error mbe of 0 48 mm day sensitivity analyses indicated that etc models were most sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis followed by soil evaporation constant and influential factor in ks dact from this study the combinations of vegetation index and cwsi as well as dact were recommended as alternative approaches for estimating etc due to intrinsic simplicity and easy interpretation these etc models relying on uav based multi sensor data thus show promising potential in farmland scale applications keywords unmanned aerial vehicle uav evapotranspiration vegetation index fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach water stress

demand by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 elliott et al 2014 molden 2007 ray et al 2013 in semi arid and arid areas the use of deficit irrigation has been proposed to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields ali et al 2007 farre et al 2009 fereres et al 2007 tari et al 2016 a key aspect for deficit irrigation relies on precise information about crop water requirements including timely and accurate crop evapotranspiration etc estimation helman et al 2019 conventionally etc can be monitored using in situ measurements such as weighing lysimeters lopez urrea et al 2012 eddy covariance systems liu et al 2013 and large aperture scintillometers hemakumara et al 2003 however such methods are not suitable for large scale estimates of etc due to their substantial expense and land surface heterogeneity a practical and commonly accepted indirect approach the fao 56 method estimates etc by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto by a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 kc represents characteristics of a specific crop with respect to canopy properties ground cover and aerodynamic resistance however in situ measurement of it still cannot describe the spatial variation of etc within a farm anderson et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 glenn et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 testi et al 2004 pereira et al 2015 significant advances in remote sensing technology have provided temporally and spatially distributed information regarding crops combining remote sensing based data with the fao 56 method makes it possible to monitor large scale etc in support of irrigation management relevant studies have been conducted over the past two decades bausch 1995 calera belmonte et al 2003 campos et al 2010 2017 choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 pôças et al 2015 furthermore numerous other studies have investigated approaches using satellite based vegetation indices vis for etc prediction of annual crops in a simple robust and operational manner campos et al 2010 2017 jin et al 2017a 2017b mateos et al 2013 nevertheless satellite data cannot obtain timely crop growth information during the entire growing season and cannot describe the detailed variation of etc at the farmland scale due to low resolution and variable weather conditions wan et al 2020 recent developments in the miniaturization of sensors and energy storage technology have led to the current explosion in the applications of unmanned aerial vehicles uav for data acquisition for precision agriculture because of their high spatio temporal resolution compared with satellite platforms colomina and molina 2014 hill et al 2017 sidike et al 2018 the uav imagery based multispectral vis have exhibited a relatively high prediction accuracy with regard to estimating kc at farmland scale shao et al 2021 utilized different types of vis extracted from uav based multispectral imagery to monitor maize kc during an entire growing season uav based systems have the advantage of rapidly mapping the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a significant relationship between ndvi and the kc in maize zea mays l was observed over the entire growing season zhang et al 2019 the combined use of vis derived from uav based multispectral images was also applied to predict etc with the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach in maize tang et al 2019 but the prediction accuracy was low with the root mean square error rmse of 0 95 mm day various studies demonstrated that appropriate vis ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and enhanced vegetation index evi can be used to efficiently monitor kc compared with traditional measurements pôças et al 2020 however the application of vis for the prediction of actual kc values is not successful the main problem is that most of the commonly used vis represent the effects of potential growth reduction but often lose sensitivity to water stress when its effect is only noticeable on the transpiration rates pôças et al 2020 due to the relationship between vegetation surface temperature and transpiration thermal based methods are highly suited for the detection of water stress status han et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 pôças et al 2020 veysi et al 2017 kullberg et al 2017 compared several indices including the crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature ratio tcratio degrees above non stressed dans and degrees above canopy threshold dact based on canopy temperature for assessing the crop water stress coefficient ks and resulting etc using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach olivera guerra et al 2020 developed a new irrigation retrieval method at the landsat pixel scale based on optical and thermal data and the ks derived from land surface temperature data currently the use of satellite coincident optical and thermal data is still hampered by the lack of fine spatial and temporal resolutions at the farmland scale wulder et al 2019 in addition uav based thermal imagery has been applied for crop water status detection martinez et al 2017 santesteban et al 2017 l zhang et al 2019 y zhang et al 2019 but has not been tested to estimate etc from thermal based ks as stated above ks can be quantified by crop canopy temperature therefore it is necessary to investigate which simple method is better for assessing ks and etc around solar noon on sunny days on a farmland scale in addition the great potential of using combined data from multiple sensors to detect ks and improve etc assessment has not been well studied using uavs here we utilized uav based vis and crop canopy temperature products to conduct a two year study over a maize farm the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the potential of low cost uav based imagery for maize etc estimation 2 compare the accuracy of each method to predict daily etc through a combination of three methods ndvi savi and evi to determine basal crop coefficient kcb and two different forms cwsi and dact of ks methods and 3 evaluate the robustness and adaptability of uav based etc estimation model across different irrigation treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental design a two year field experiment was

detailed description of the site is provided by zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the field was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system valmont industries inc nebraska usa fig 1 maize cv junkai 918 was planted in mid may tasseled in july and harvested for silage in september 2018 and 2019 inter row spacing was 0 58 m and row direction was east west to avoid plant nutrient stress and weeds fertilizer and herbicide were applied according to local farmer practices in both years of the experiment there were five treatments and five levels of irrigation each of the treatments was replicated three times with an individual plot size of 6 6 m treatment 1 was applied irrigation to fully satisfy crop water requirements during the whole growing season in 2018 due to frequent rainfall during the entire growing season deficit irrigation treatments were only applied during the rapid and middle growth stages in 2019 the deficit irrigation treatments were applied during the entire growing season around 90 of field water holding capacity was the benchmark of abundant irrigation the amount of irrigation table 1 in each treatment was measured by rain gauge cylinders with three replications meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located on a 1 ha alfalfa plot adjacent to the research field the time courses of precipitation and maximum air temperature during the maize growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 2 the total precipitation in the period was 272 mm and 113 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively the daily maximum air temperature ranged between 20 and 36 c in both years 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 uav based data collection two uavs were used to capture images between 11 00 and 14 00 local time over the entire maize growing season in 2018 and

the uav flight more detailed calibration information for the uav based thermal imagery is provided in zhang et al 2019 to optimize the geo referencing of the images acquired from the multi sensor uav five ground control points gcps were positioned throughout the field the precise centroid coordinates of the gcp targets were obtained with a kolida rtk differential gnss device kolida instrument co ltd guangzhou china 2 2 2 field data collection field measurements obtained after the uav flights include soil water content canopy height and leaf area index volumetric water contents at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm in the soil profile were measured by using the traditional gravimetric method with three measurements in each plot the dates of in situ soil moisture observations were shown in table 2 each time domain reflectometry tdr tdr 315 l acclima meridian idaho usa was used to record volumetric soil water content every 30 min at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm in each irrigation treatment plant

spectral and thermal information extraction uav based vis were extracted from the raw spectral bands red green blue near infrared and red edge and used as canopy spectral features additionally three kinds of vis previously used to estimate kcb were calculated table 3 fractional vegetation cover fc and maize canopy temperature were estimated using the red green ratio index rgri otsu method zhang et al 2019 the formulas for rgri calculation are presented in table 3 additionally fc the percentage of vegetation area per ground surface area was extracted from rgb imagery using the rgri method classified maize pixels were divided by the total number of pixels in the plot to calculate fc the maize pixels value 255 in the rgb images could be classified with the otsu method the classification image values were multiplied by the corresponding thermal infrared image values to extract the temperature of maize canopy t the workflow of temperature extraction is shown in fig 4 two water stress indices cwsi and dact were used to calculate ks the formulas for cwsi and dact calculations are presented in table 3 the dact was calculated using the canopy temperature and the canopy temperature threshold tcritical tcritical is a known constant for a given crop for maize 28 c has been suggested by the ars plant stress and water conservation laboratory evett et al 2000 dejonge et al 2015 the cwsi where dtm dtll and dtul are the actual measurement lower limit and upper limit of the canopy air temperature difference tc ta respectively cwsi can be simplified by taking 5 ºc as the constant dtul cohen et al 2015 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 in this study dtll has been established for 2018 and 2019 zhang et al 2022 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d t l

4 calculation of evapotranspiration and crop coefficient daily etc was estimated by the soil water balance equation 4 e t c i p i i i d r i d r i 1 d p i r o i c r i where etc i is evapotranspiration for the day of interest mm i pi is precipitation for the day of interest mm ii is irrigation for the day of interest mm dr i is deficit for the day of interest mm dr i 1 is deficit for the previous day of interest mm dp i is deep percolation for the day of interest mm roi is surface runoff for the day of interest mm and cri is the capillary rise from the deep water table for the day of interest mm runoff and capillary rise were ignored due to no slope on the plot area and deep groundwater table the dp was calculated using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 following irrigation or heavy rain swc in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some of them may go down into deeper soil layers it was assumed that the soil water content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event so the dr i will be zero etc i was estimated by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 5 d p i p i r o i i i e t c i d r i 1 the basal crop coefficient kcb and the crop water stress coefficient ks were calculated using the fao 56 procedures jensen and allen 2016 under standard conditions rhmin 45 u2 2 m s the three key values looking up table in fao 56 for the basal crop coefficient kcb tab of maize were determined as 0 15 at the rapid 1 15 at the middle and 0 15 at the late growth stage respectively for calculating the daily actual value of kcb the standardized kcb values are adjusted according to observed lai and h values pereira et al 2020 the modified fao 56 kcb value can be calculated by eqs 6 and 7 6 k c b a d j u s t k c b t a b h 3 0 3 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 7 k c b a k c min k c b a d j u s t k c min 1 exp k l a i where kcb adjust is the kcb corrected by meteorological factors kcb tab is the value for kcb under the above referred standard climate h is the average plant height m u2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m above the crop canopy m s rhmin is the minimum relative humidity when the crop dries in the field kcb 0 45 the adjustment by eq 6 is not required kcb a indicates the kcb modified by the lai kc min is the minimum value for bare soil 0 15 and k is the canopy attenuation coefficient of radiation and the value of k is 0 7 by ding et al 2013 the crop water stress coefficient ks can be expressed as a simple linear model following the procedures described in fao 33 which is equal to the fao 56 ks procedure jensen and allen 2016 8 k s 1 θ θ t θ θ wp θ t θ w p θ w p θ θ t 0 θ θ w p 9 θ t 1 p θ f c θ w p θ w p where θ is the mean volumetric soil water in the root zone m3m 3 θt is the threshold water content m3m 3 θwp is the permanent wilting point m3m 3 θfc is the field capacity m3m 3 p is the average fraction of available soil water that can be deleted from the root zone before moisture stress and is 0 55 for maize as previously recommended allen et al 1998 values for eqs 8 and 9 are listed in table 4 2 5 uav based etc estimation methods based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach according to the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach etc is defined as follows 10 e t c k s k c b k e e t 0 where ks is the soil water stress coefficient representing the influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration kcb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration under no stress ke is the soil evaporation coefficient et0 is the reference evapotranspiration we evaluated two different forms of the ks model in combination with three types of kcb approaches the two forms of the ks model employed thermal information first cwsi was used to quantify ks according to jackson et al 1981 the first model was 11 k s c w s i 1 c w s i the second model employed dact to calculate ks on the condition that dact was 0 for no stress and positive infinity for high stress the normalized relationship between ks and dact found in kullberg et al 2017 can be expressed as 12 k s d a c t max 1 d a c t a 0 a is a variable optimized to reduce the rmse between ks determined from dact ndvi savi and evi were used for the estimation of kcb in this study the linear function of the kcb vi approach can be given as 13 k c b v i b 0 v i b 1 finally we assumed constant rates of soil water evaporation and ke values were related to fc according to er raki et al 2007 therefore ke values were derived as 14 k e c 1 f c the value c was based on the frequency of irrigation and rainfall from the early stage start until the ndvimax doy 161 202 in 2018 and doy 159 207 in 2019 13 and 7 irrigation rainfall events of 0 2 et0 occurred for relevant rainfall events see allen et al 2006 p 153 this was equivalent to rainfall events every 3 days in 2018 and 7 days in 2019 with an average et0 of 3 8 mm day and 4 0 mm day during the growing season this corresponds to a coefficient of 0 8 in 2018 and 0 3 in 2019 in order to analyze the effect a particular kcb method may have on the accuracy of each ks method each stress coefficient was applied with each of vis ndvi savi and evi based kcb values etc using all combinations of the two ks methods and three kcb methods were compared to etc from the observed tdr and soil water balance measurements model performance was quantified by using the coefficient of determination r2 rmse the mean bias error mbe and the relative root mean square error rrmse the detailed workflow from feature extraction to model building and evaluation is presented in fig 5 there was a total of 100 samples collected from 2018 to 2019 in which 70 samples selected randomly were the training set and the remaining 30 samples were the validation set for estimation models of the ks kcb and etc 70 of the total samples in 2018 and 2019 were used as the training set and the remaining samples were used as the validation set 2 6 sensitivity analysis to explore the relative importance of the parameters in the etc models three parameters a b 0 and c were subjected to a sensitivity analysis a is a key influential factor in ks dact b 0 is slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis c is soil evaporation constant applied in ke calculation in the analysis the values of these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 of their original values and the simulated and original etc values were then compared to determine the influence of these parameters on the models 3 results 3 1 validation of soil water content by tdr and temperature measured by a thermal infrared camera the gravimetric method was used as the standard method to measure swc at different depths in four of the measurement times with tdr and the relationship was analyzed using linear regression with the data obtained from two methods the measurements of tdr had higher accuracy with r2 of 0 95 fig 6 the ground measured temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures in the uav thermal imagery to convert to a surface level temperature through a linear model fig 7 3 2 characterization of maize growth under different irrigation treatments fig 8 shows the effects of different levels of deficit irrigation on kcb fao ks fao and vegetation indices as shown in fig 8a and b kcb fao gradually increased during the early stage peaked at the middle stage and decreased thereafter at the late stage compared with kcb fao in 2018 fig 8a kcb fao in 2019 fig 8b increased with increasing irrigation levels for instance the average of kcb fao were 0 89 0 85 and 0 79 for tr 6 7 and 8 respectively compared with ks fao in 2019 fig 8c ks fao in 2018 fig 8d was overall higher due to the large rainfall events occurring during the early to middle growth stage uav vis and thermal data were selected and conducted to investigate which parameters were sensitive to irrigation levels as shown in fig 8c j the vis increased gradually until the middle growth stage and then slightly decreased compared with savi and evi a significant saturation phenomenon was observed for ndvi at the late growth stage the vis in 2018 showed no obvious differences among the five irrigation levels during the entire growing season while the vis in 2019 increased with increasing irrigation levels the results indicate that ndvi savi and evi are suitable for monitoring kcb during entire growing season additionally the changing pattern of canopy temperature t contrasts with the changes of ks fao e g the average of t were 26 8 and 32 8 for tr 1 and 4 while the average of ks fao were 0 95 and 0 87 indicating that t can be used to monitor ks fao and is closely related to irrigation level during the entire growing season fig 8k and l 3 3 results of ks and kcb estimation to convert cwsi and dact into ks the relationships between ks fao values and two indices are shown in fig 9a and b moreover the relationships between kcb fao and the three vis are shown in fig 9c e the positive correlation between kcb fao and vis ndvi savi and evi was shown the estimated model parameters as well as the accuracy evaluation for the uav based ks kcb models are shown in table 5 compared with the ks dact model the ks cwsi model performed better rmse was 0 09 all the vi based kcb models exhibited very close performance rmse was 0 08 0 09 3 4 evaluation of etc estimates the predicted etc using all combinations of the two ks methods and three kcb methods is compared with tdr derived etc as shown by scatterplots fig 10 that include bias measurements via best fit lines assuming intercept of 0 r2 and rmse for each method satisfactory results from the etc assessment based on ks cwsi model were achieved using kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi methods with slope r2 and rmse of 1 02 0 84 and 0 50 mm day 0 99 0 83 and 0 50 mm day and 0 924 0 751 and 0 663 mm day respectively fig 10a c fig 10d f show that ks dact model also provided comparable estimates of etc ndvi slope 1 04 r2 0 80 and rmse 0 53 mm day savi slope 1 00 r2 0 77 and rmse 0 53 mm day evi slope 1 01 r2 0 77 and rmse 0 53 mm day both ks cwsi and ks dact models had more scatters at higher etc values compared with the daily etc values from the tdr soil water balance rmse values for each combination of ks and kcb method in 2018 and 2019 are shown in table 6 for both ks methods in 2018 the kcb savi method provided the best prediction accuracy with an average rmse of 0 49 mm day while using evi resulted in greater errors compared with other vis an average of 0 59 mm day in 2018 the two ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy the two ks methods performed at different levels of accuracy and the lower rmse of cwsi compared with dact in 2019 indicates that cwsi has more potential to be used as a stress coefficient under stressed conditions evi exhibited the poorest performance in 2019 with an average rmse of 0 67 mm day despite the potential for integrating multi temporal uav based image data for assessment of etc was confirmed the influence of different irrigation levels on the performance of etc prediction is still unclear fig 11a shows the prediction results under different irrigation levels the rmse of using ks dact was slightly increased for the more stressed treatments in 2019 an average of 0 81 mm day the ks cwsi model performed well at all treatments an average of 0 48 mm day compared with the rmse values for the two methods in the less stressed treatments the ks dact model exhibited a relatively poorer prediction result than the ks cwsi in more stressed treatments fig 11b shows the mbe of daily etc estimates over the study period all combinations of ks and kcb methods overestimated etc moreover the two ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy and the low mbe values with ks dact and ks cwsi models indicate that these indices have the potential to be used to estimate cumulative water use 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the etc models fig 12 shows the sensitivity analysis of different etc models toward changing parameters a b 0 and c no sensitivity analysis was done for parameter a in ks cwsi model as it was estimated independently as a function of vpd different etc models exhibited similar behaviors with changing parameters the sensitivity analysis reveals that the decreasing of 50 of parameters a and c resulted in a reduction of 9 and 18 in 2018 etc respectively and a reduction of 21 and 10 in 2019 etc respectively regardless of etc models in 2018 when the value of parameter b 0 was reduced by 50 both ks based etc decreased by 33 35 and 24 for kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi models respectively in 2019 when the value of parameter b 0 was reduced by 50 both ks based etc decreased by 40 43 and 32 for kcb ndvi kcb savi and kcb evi models respectively in general etc models were most sensitive to parameter b 0 in both years indicating that the major differences in these models are their different descriptions of the kcb additionally the importance of water stress in etc models was higher than soil evaporation under water deficit conditions fig 12d vs f 4 discussion the spectral information used to calculate vis from remote sensing data has shown potential for etc prediction but the reliability and the accuracy of these predictions have not been satisfactory under water stress condition pocas et al 2020 tang et al 2019 for instance tang et al 2019 reported that vis based etc prediction model produced low accuracy with rmse of 0 95 1 25 mm day under different levels of deficit irrigation this is mainly due to three problems 1 the vis easily saturate under high biomass conditions thenkabail et al 2000 fu et al 2014 2 most commonly used vis are not responsive to early stages of crop water stress campos et al 2013 pocas et al 2015 and 3 the developed etc prediction models are not robust enough to assess the etc of contrasting climate years pereira et al 2020 pocas et al 2020 in this study we proposed the integration of optical and thermal information to overcome the vi saturation issue extraction of a thermal based water stress indicator and development of a prediction model to improve the robustness of response to climate change 4 1 relationship between uav based vis and kcb ks remote sensing based vis have been employed to assess kcb and irrigation requirements campos et al 2010 2017 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 padilla et al 2011 but it has been unclear whether uav based image data could monitor crop growth to forecast crop coefficients in different years as shown in fig 8 both kcb fao and uav based image data provided time course plots of maize under different water applications uav based vis data were not sensitive to the slight water stress condition especially at the middle and late growth stage due to the saturation at high canopy coverage and the results are consistent with previous studies becker reshef et al 2010 vergara diaz et al 2016 wan et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 in the performance of each kcb estimate method we found that the correlations between kcb with ndvi savi and evi were robust regardless of growing season and irrigation treatment with rmse ranging from 0 07 to 0 12 fig 13a in this study the temperature changes showed an opposite trend to ks fao suggesting that temperature could monitor maize water status moreover the close linkages between thermal based temperature and water stress coefficients have been shown in many previous studies colaizzi et al 2003 kullberg et al 2017 olivera guerra et al 2020 however the correlation between ks and dact were more susceptible to climate factors and irrigation treatments in the performance of each ks estimate method especially under water stress conditions fig 13b this indicated that the normalization equations or methodology of ks dact may need to be calibrated by applying more severe stressed treatments and different climactic conditions uav based optical and thermal remote sensing can provide a more comprehensive description of maize growth by combining different image parameters most importantly uav based optical and thermal remote sensing could generate high resolution diagnostic etc maps at different growth stages to support precision field management and decision making 4 2 performance of regression methods in maize etc prediction previous studies have demonstrated that spectral based indicators vis and thermal based indicators cwsi and dact extracted from remote sensing images were linked to etc mahmoud and gan 2019 mokhtari et al 2018 olivera guerra et al 2020 pocas et al 2020 our study proved that ndvi savi evi cwsi and dact from uav images could provide good characterizations of maize evapotranspiration but they provided different prediction results regarding kcb regression methods kcb ndvi and kcb savi methods generally exhibited very close performance in both ks methods cwsi and dact for the two different years table 6 kcb ndvi model performed slightly better in each ks based etc prediction in 2019 while kcb savi model performed better in 2018 however evi performed slightly worse than the other two methods in both 2018 and 2019 regardless of thermal based indicators table 6 this result agrees with previous studies pereira et al 2015 shao et al 2021 that ndvi and savi were superior to evi in maize etc estimation applications because of the actual vegetation cover conditions reflected by these indices additionally relatively lower rmse values were achieved for ks cwsi regression in combination with three kcb methods compared with the ks dact method table 6 this is likely attributable to the fact that cwsi obtained from in situ data produced more accurate values than dact for the prediction of crop water stress taghvaeian et al 2014 dejonge et al 2015 the best performance for etc prediction was the ks cwsi method combined with kcb ndvi achieving an r2 of 0 84 and rmse of 0 50 mm day fig 10a furthermore compared with cwsi dact more consistently overestimated etc on days with higher etc values one reason could be that dact underestimated water stress status and the normalization equation used in this study for maize still might not be adequate as found in previous studies regarding optimal empirical values and stress levels dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 the different irrigation levels produced distinct maize canopy characteristics resulting in different spatial and spectral features in the uav based images consequently the prediction accuracy of etc would vary with irrigation levels and the mild stressed irrigation treatments in both years exhibited better performance regardless of the ks methods fig 11a in addition all treatments produced slightly higher errors from the ks dact model in 2019 the reason why the prediction accuracy decreased may be also related to the impact of soil evaporation soil evaporation is low under water stress conditions and constant evaporation rates cannot reflect the role of soil evaporation especially at early growth stages furthermore the daily mbe values for etc prediction over 2018 and 2019 from the ks cwsi model and the ks dact model combined with the kcb vi methods were similar fig 11b this result agrees with previous studies kullberg et al 2017 that dact had the same performance as cwsi in predicting cumulative etc consequently we concluded that the proposed models were robust in predicting etc between different years 4 3 uncertainty and future works under the current framework the etc models have the potential to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely managing crop stress and water supply however it still has some weaknesses that should be noted the etc calculation was based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach although the model validation was satisfactory there still exist fitting parameters a b 0 and c in the model that need calibration as the parameters may differ in crop type irrigation management and climatic conditions pocas et al 2020 the water stress was calculated using stress index equations further work is suggested to investigate other stress indices for ks evaluation without local calibration which may reduce limitations in practical applications the soil evaporation parameter c was set to be a constant value with the frequency of irrigation and rainfall further soil evaporation models can be developed to use uav synthetic aperture radar data for estimating ke under partial and full cover conditions moreover the use of weighing lysimeters to validate daily etc values increases the reliability of these results for the maize etc estimation models generated in the study the effects of irrigation amount and sensitivity of parameters were analyzed over two years future work is needed to test the performance of etc models in other climatological conditions to determine the applicability and transferability of these methods 5 conclusions the ability of optical and thermal information derived from multiple uav based sensors to monitor crop etc under different levels of deficit irrigation was evaluated using vis and temperature based water stress indices we found that uav based canopy temperature measurements were suitable for monitoring crop water status as well as ks during the entire maize growing season two types of stress coefficient models based on 1 cwsi and 2 dact were evaluated and found to provid the best results for crop etc assessment in combination with kcb vi approaches in 2018 and 2019 r2 of 0 84 and 0 80 rmse of 0 50 mm day and 0 53 mm day respectively compared with ndvi and savi the empirical kcb evi model showed a relatively poorer prediction result although results varied with irrigation levels daily mbe values of etc prediction indicated that the proposed methods performed robustly over different years sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the parameters in etc models and the models were highly sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between kcb and vis followed by soil evaporation constant and influential factor in ks dact the developed approach for estimating maize etc at the field scale with high spatial temporal resolution can improve irrigation management with precision agriculture future work is needed to investigate the combined use of ancillary models radar based models and soil water balance models to retrieve soil evaporation values to further increase the accuracy of etc estimation credit authorship contribution statement yu

9194,ebb and flow irrigation system is a closed loop efficient subirrigation system in this study a numerical model ebman hp has been presented for simulation of all components variations of water depth in supply tank and concrete floor tank and all phases of flood floor bench ebb and flow subirrigation systems the model benefits from a fine tuned computational algorithm for hysteresis module the model can simulate both time specified and sensor based irrigation scheduling since ebb and flow irrigation system incorporates numerous pots richards equation should be solved for several pots to obtain sufficient understanding of the whole system therefore the proposed model benefits from openmp parallel programming to speed up the execution time besides a novel parallel tdma solver have been presented that accelerates the computation speed by breaking a large system of equations into several simultaneously solved portions the model has been validated and verified against several analytical numerical and experimental test cases the results showed hysteresis module can completely remove artificial pumping error in two critical test cases the parallel tdma solver was shown to be able to reach to the speedup of about 90 the model was shown to perform faster than hydrus 1d even in serial mode for coarser grids about 52 faster in average of 8 test cases and similar to hydrus 1d for dense grids about 6 faster in average of 4 test cases with the perfect agreement nse between 0 999 and 1 000 and the average difference in mbe less than 0 1 for 12 cases parallel model could boost the models performance to about 500 using 6 processors finally comprehensive illustrative example has been shown to present almost all capabilities of model keywords richards equation parallel programming hysteresis irrigation data availability data will be made available on request the data and codes used to support the findings of this study are either included within the article or is available by request from corresponding author 1 introduction ebb and flow subirrigation systems are commonly admired in greenhouse irrigation systems due to their benefits such as water conservation comparing to conventional irrigation methods jani et al 2021 higher plant quality and shortening plant cycle ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017 to further improve the capabilities of the ebb and flow system it can be automated by low cost instruments ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c although number of experimental researches have been conducted on the different aspects of ebb and flow subirrigation systems ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c macan et al 2020 few works have focused on the process based simulation of these systems e g otten 1994 anlauf and rehrmann 2013 ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c naghedifar et al 2020b otten 1994 employed swatre soil water and transpiration rate extended for simulation of ficus benjamina grown using ebb and flow benches in this study the deficiency of the model was that it did not include a process based function to account for actual evaporation root water and nutrient uptake therefore the above mentioned processes were measured and forced to the model as a sink term on the other hand the studies of anlauf et al 2012 and anlauf and rehrmann 2013 showed that the necessary slope 0 2 0 4 of the flood floor has an impact on the plant growth which was neglected in the simulations of ebb and flow benches by otten 1994 anlauf et al 2012 and anlauf and rehrmann 2013 employed hydrus 1d to simulate flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation experiment conducted on an in lab setup and reported that the position of pots on the sloping flooded floor has a considerable effect on the total absorbed water by the substrate however they only simulated one irrigation cycle without considering the presence of the plant in the substrate finally naghedifar et al 2020b developed a physically based model hereinafter called ebman by coupling water flow and solute transport equations and incorporating root water and nutrient uptake modules to simulate sensor based flood floor ebb and flow irrigation system with saline water they also used a small scale optimization technique i e so called taguchi approach taguchi and konishi 1987 naghedifar et al 2018 to investigate the optimal state of sensor position within a pot and in the flood floor leaching time triggering and cutoff sensor thresholds their optimization procedure on a hypothetical crop which was assumed to be sensitive to drought and salinity stresses revealed that the highest transpiration and uniformity is obtained when the sensor is installed at the upper half of a pot the optimal position of the pot was close to the center position of the flood floor with triggering and cutoff matric potential thresholds of 10 m close to wilting point and 2 m close to field capacity the deficiency of the naghedifar et al 2020b s model was that it was limited to non hysteretic growing media non negligible researches witness the presence of hysteresis in the horticultural substrates bougoul et al 2005 naasz et al 2005 londra 2010 many hysteretic models have been developed by the researchers for agricultural and geotechnical uses pham et al 2005 reviewed and compared several hysteretic models of soil water retention curve and divided these models into two categories of physically based domain or conceptual and empirical models the former is based on the integration of pore radii distribution functions of soil while the latter relies on the linear rudiyanto et al 2020 or nonlinear nuth and laloui 2008 scaling of main drying or drainage and wetting or imbibition curves to obtain the so called scanning curves scarfone et al 2020 i e the curves describing the transition between the main curves empirical hysteretic models are comparatively simpler and hence are commonly employed in numerical models werner and lockington 2005 however these models may suffer from a so called artificial pumping error werner and lockington 2005 or pumping effect šimůnek et al 2018 the artificial pumping error causes the scanning curves to move unrealistically beyond the main scanning curves to address this deficiency parker and lenhard 1987 s formulation enforces the closure of scanning curves at the previous and preceding reversal points thereby removing pumping error at the cost of high memory capacity to store reversal points of all computational nodes according to the antecedent studies there exists several deficiencies in the simulation of ebb and flow modeling first there is not a specific model that simulates all mechanisms of ebb and flow subirrigation system and the simulation of ebb and flow subirrigation system is only focused on the cultivation pots and the remaining components of the ebb and flow are either neglected or considered as the boundary conditions of the pots the underlying assumption of such modeling procedures is that water is always available in the supply tank therefore the resulting simulation cannot give a perspective of water consumption in the system water consumption and quality is mostly monitored inside the reservoir which is commonly neglected in the simulations on the other hand the heterogeneity of the water delivered by the pots lied at the edge and center of the sloped flood floor provides dissimilar water uptake by the pots therefore the pots throughout the flood floor experience different water movement regimes during a season this fact highlights the importance of involving dynamics of ponding water on the flood floor which has also been ignored in the previous numerical studies secondly the latter implies that the simulation of flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation system requires running richards equation and if required for fertigation purposes advection dispersion equation for each pot during the whole growing season on the flood floor therefore the numerical models which were developed using serial programming e g swatre belmans et al 1983 hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 and ebman naghedifar et al 2020b are inefficient for simulation of ebb and flow irrigation system to address this deficiency parallel programming can be used as a promising solution the novelties of the presented model hereinafter referred to as ebman hp comparing to the available models or researches can be presented as follows 1 to develop a novel numerical model designed specifically for simulation of flood floor bench ebb and flow by considering all major components processes of the system such as variations of water volume inside supply tank and flooded floor bench all components are modeled by means of physically based ordinary partial differential equations 2 in opposition to naghedifar et al 2020a and otten 1994 the model employs parker and lenhard 1987 s hysteretic functions that is free from artificial pumping error 3 employing open multi processing openmp directives to develop a parallel numerical scheme to solve richards equation for multiple pots under ebb and flow subirrigation system accompanied with a parallel tdma i e tri diagonal matrix algorithm solver 2 materials and methods 2 1 saturated unsaturated subsurface flow water movement within the saturated unsaturated porous media of soil can be described by richards equation richards 1931 this equation is derived by combining mass conservation law and darcy buckingham flux buckingham 1907 and is in form of diffusive partial differential equation the one dimensional mixed form of richards equation is as follows 1 θ t z k ψ z k q sub w where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 ψ soil water matric potential l k is saturated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z is vertical space coordinate l and q sub w is the sink source term l 3 l 3 t 1 which can represent actual root water uptake the first term of eq 1 is the storage term and the second term is called the diffusive term in order to solve the partial differential eq 1 along with initial and boundary conditions one requires to define θ ψ soil water retention curve and k ψ constitutive relations in this study van genuchten 1980 functions for water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity have been employed 2 s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ λ ϕ 3 k ψ k s s l 1 1 s 1 ϕ ϕ 2 where s is effective saturation l 3 l 3 θ s and θ r are saturated and residual water contents respectively l 3 l 3 α inverse of air entry value l 1 λ 1 and ϕ are pore size distribution indices l is pore connectivity index and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 note that in this study ϕ is not necessarily related to λ i e ϕ 1 1 λ and may be considered as an independent value by means of ebb and flow subirrigation system water is supplied from the bottom of the pots at the flooding phase and is drained out of the pots at the drainage phase the boundary condition at the bottom should be able to reflect these two phases for the lower boundary condition an improved version of seepage face boundary condition is selected at the unsaturated state the boundary considers no flow condition and at the saturated state the pressure head adjacent to the lower boundary of pots is set as the specified head boundary condition the pressure head at the flooding phase is equal to the depth of water in the flood floor bench and at the drainage phase the pots are considered to be exposed to atmosphere at the top boundary the atmospheric boundary condition has been set for all pots this boundary condition can simulate variations of water pond and evaporation from the soil or substrate air interface ponded water if any is imposed at the top boundary through a dirichlet type boundary for which the depth of ponded water is calculated at each time step using a reservoir equation for simulation of evaporation at the soil surface a neumann type boundary condition with potential evaporation rate is set on the soil surface as long as water content is more than a prescribed threshold representing air dried soil water content as water content falls below this threshold a dirichlet type boundary condition is set at the soil air interface with constant pressure head equivalent to the air dried soil water content 2 2 root water uptake module root water uptake is embedded in the ebman hp model using the procedure described by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the root water uptake module was described in naghedifar et al 2020b for ebman herein it is only summarized for the sake of completeness the actual root water uptake is calculated as follows 4 q sub w z t α w z ψ β z t p t where α w is the dimensionless stress function is the normalized water uptake distribution function l 1 and t p is the potential transpiration rate l t 1 the potential evapotranspiration can be calculated through well known equations such as fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 valipour 2017 el shirbeny et al 2022 in order to partition the potential evapotranspiration to potential evaporation and potential transpiration dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 2005 or equations using leaf area index lai such as ritchie 1972 can be employed the stress function is commonly described by the piecewise function of feddes et al 1978 as follows 5 α w z ψ 0 ψ h 1 o r ψ h 4 ψ h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 ψ h 1 1 h 3 ψ h 2 ψ h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 ψ h 3 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are crop specific thresholds of stress function l normalized water uptake distribution function was considered which was proposed by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 as follows 6 β z 1 667 l r z l t 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l t z l r l t l r z l t 0 2 l r 0 z l t l r where l t is the total soil depth l l r is the rooting depth l 2 3 hysteretic constitutive relation ebb and flow subirrigation systems are mainly accompanied with the horticultural substrates non negligible bibliography has shown that horticultural substrates show considerable hysteresis when irrigated by ebb and flow subirrigation system otten 1994 anlauf and rehrmann 2013 herein the constitutive hysteretic relations of parker and lenhard 1987 has been adopted as follows 7 s ψ s p ψ s p ψ l 1 sf l l 1 s l 1 where p d w is a direction free index representing the state of main or scanning curves i e drying drainage scanning curve d or wetting imbibition scanning curve w the drying and wetting states are determined by the sign of storage term of richards equation at each time step at the wetting state θ t 0 at the drying state θ t 0 and at the situations θ t 0 the prevailing state remains unchanged s l ψ l and s l 1 ψ l 1 are the most recent and preceding reversal points respectively s p ψ is the effective saturation obtained by eq 7 main drying and main wetting scanning curves are formulated as eq 1 sf l l 1 is the scaling factor i e the ratio of the difference between effective saturation at the most recent and preceding reversal points and their corresponding values on the main wetting and main drying curves defined as follows 8 sf l l 1 s l s l 1 s p ψ l s p ψ l 1 from the mathematical viewpoint the simulation of water movement in a hysteretic substrate starts from a point on the main drying wetting curves once the sign of the storage term changes to the opposite the last ψ s point is assumed as the reversal point the wetting drying curve departed from the first reversal point attached to the main drying wetting curve is called primary wetting drying scanning curve if the primary scanning curve is truncated by another reversal point the resulted scanning curve provides a hysteretic loop with preceding curve water capacity function i e c w l 1 of the hysteretic water retention curves of parker and lenhard 1987 can be presented as follows 9 c w c w p sf l l 1 where c w p is the water capacity function of main wetting or main drying curves i e d θ d ψ from eq 2 using the modified picard iteration of celia et al 1990 c w plays an intermediate role in the calculation procedure and disappears from the computation scheme at the convergence on the other hand this function has a discontinuous nature for the hysteretic water retention curves at the reversal points and follows different paths at each scanning curve by the numerical experiments results not shown here it was distinguished that this function destabilizes the numerical scheme therefore in ebman hp model water capacity function of main drying curve has been employed instead of hysteretic water capacity function the rationale behind using main drying curve not main wetting curve is that the water capacity function of main wetting curve always has more nonlinearity and hence imposes more computational cost and may cause instabilities 2 4 dynamic time stepping divergence control and adaptive under relaxation techniques naghedifar et al 2020b examined ebman against different test cases and the model experienced no instability in any of the cases however it was experienced that by adding hysteretic retention curves model may suffer from instabilities when using seepage face at the bottom boundary due to the fact that two adjacent reversal points may be produced with a very small difference and hence the vulgar fraction in eq 7 may approach infinity or for the cases including infiltration into very dry substrate the critical case occurs for the substrates with the suddenly dropping retention curves since they will have very nonlinear water capacity function to avoid the above mentioned instabilities the ebman hp employs several techniques dynamic time stepping was shown to be an effective approach to avoid instabilities which has been employed by researchers for simulation of variably saturated soils an and yu 2014 herein a common time stepping approach is employed by means of which the time step is determined considering the number of iterations at the previous time step naghedifar et al 2020a the previous time step is multiplied by a factor more than 1 commonly between 1 1 and 1 3 providing the number of iterations at the previous time step is less than a lower bound commonly between 3 and 5 under the condition that the iterations are more than an upper bound commonly between 5 and 7 the time step is multiplied by a prescribed value less than 1 commonly between 0 7 and 0 9 if the number of iterations lies between the upper and lower bounds the time step remains unchanged two criteria were considered to show convergence of 1d richards equation huang et al 1996 zha et al 2017 10 δ ψ k 1 k max ψ n m ψ n m 1 ε ψ 11 δ θ k 1 k max θ n m θ n m 1 ε θ where δ ψ l and δ θ l 3 l 3 are the errors of pressure head and soil water content respectively and ε ψ l and ε θ l 3 l 3 convergence tolerances for pressure head and soil water content respectively n is the time step and m is the iteration the performance of iterative solver to obtain more smooth convergence can be boosted by means of under relaxation or divergence controlling techniques to this end the adaptive under relaxation coefficient of durbin and delemos 2007 was employed in the improved form as follows 12 φ φ m i n φ m a x φ m i n e x p ω δ ψ ε ψ δ ψ ε ψ φ m a x δ ψ ε ψ where φ min and φ max are the minimum and maximum values of under relaxation coefficient ω is a shape factor controlling the falling rate of under relaxation factor if φ max 1 the model prevents under relaxed scheme when approaching convergence which was the approach employed by durbin and delemos 2007 using eq 12 the under relaxation factor is scaled to φ min as the error increases the rationale behind choosing δ ψ not δ θ is that the modified picard scheme of celia et al 1990 chosen to solve richards equation in both ebman and ebman hp uses pressure head as primary variable in the iterative process on the other hand zha et al 2017 presented an algorithm to help model avoid divergence when dry soil is exposed to a constant flux inflow they showed that when pressure head jumps from a dry state determined by ψ dry and was defined as the pressure head whose corresponding water capacity value is between 10 3 10 5 m 1 to wet state determined by ψ wet which was defined as the pressure head whose corresponding water capacity value is half of the maximum value in two adjacent iterations the iterative process is very likely to diverge zha et al 2017 presented a simple algorithm that takes the jumped pressure head back to the vicinity of its preceding location however their algorithm was examined for non hysteretic water retention curves in order to improve zha et al 2017 s algorithm to account for hysteretic water retention curve of parker and lenhard 1987 i e eq 7 taylor series for s n m should be expanded as follows 13 s n m s n m 1 s θ n m 1 θ ψ n m 1 ψ n m ψ n m 1 considering eqs 7 9 eq 13 is transformed to the following form 14 s n m s n m 1 sf l l 1 s p ψ c w n m 1 ψ n m ψ n m 1 subsequently the pressure head can be calculated using the inverse of water retention function derived from eq 7 as follows 15 ψ s 1 α p s s l 1 sf l l 1 s p ψ l 1 1 ϕ p 1 1 λ p 2 5 coupling procedure of supply tank flood floor and richards equation ebman was only focused on the simulation of cultivation pots and the whole subirrigation system consisting of supplying tank and flood floor were neglected however from the irrigation scheduling viewpoint considering the interactions of other parts of subirrigation system with cultivation pots can help better understand the dynamics of the whole system moreover monitoring water depth or solution concentration at the supply tank is easier comparing to the soil water content and solute concentration for verification validation or real time management purposes therefore ebman hp involves an integrated system of equations for supply tank flood floor and cultivation pots to capture more realistic view of ebb and flow irrigation system the underlying assumption of the coupled system of the aforementioned equations is as follows 1 the water released from the supply tank to the flood floor at the beginning of the flooding phase and from the flood floor to the supply tank at the drainage phase was assumed to be instantaneous since water depth in the ebb and flow irrigation system is not high no more than a few millimeters and furthermore water is mainly pumped with a considerable rate to the floor or bench the water release time can be neglected 2 the evaporation of the released pond on the floor was not calculated directly but embedded inside a water loss coefficient the ponding phase of the ebb and flow irrigation system is very short about 15 20 min and furthermore the ebb and flow irrigation system is commonly used inside greenhouse where temperature and humidity is controlled by monitoring systems therefore the evaporated water at the ponding phase is negligible 3 the effluent from the substrates cultivation pots at the drainage phase does not return back to the supply tank but extracted from the system except for the a few millimeters of pots that are submerged in the flooding phase the rest of the substrates is unlikely to be satiated therefore a very small amount of water and solutes is leaked out of pots at the drainage phase 4 at the ponding phase water does not leak back from pots to the floor since ebb and flow irrigation system is triggered when the pots are relatively dry it is expected that water movement is governed by soil water matric potential gradient which is mostly in upward direction 5 the floors and benches of ebb and flow irrigation system are inundated in a relatively short time and at the ponding phase water is kept almost stationary moreover ponded water is relatively shallow therefore it can be assumed that at the ponding phase water in the flood floor does not flow laterally and the water pressure is at static vertical distribution fig 1 illustrates the coupling procedure for three main components of flooded bench and flood floor ebb and flow irrigation system the water inflow and outflow from the supply tank into the flooded floor and in turn into the pots is controlled by two prescribed triggering ψ trig l or θ trig l 3 l 3 and cutoff ψ cut l or θ cut l 3 l 3 thresholds for pressure head or water content the pressure head thresholds i e ψ trig and ψ cut can be monitored by tensiometer cormier et al 2020 while medium moisture thresholds i e θ trig and θ cut can be measured by water content sensors ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017 the triggering and cutoff thresholds can be defined as the average of sensor readings installed at different pots or a single optimal pot ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c naghedifar et al 2020 according to the ebman hp s algorithm water from supply tank is released to the floor or bench when the predefined triggering threshold is reached in the monitored pot s and the system switches off when either the cutoff water content pressure head is reached or the ponding phase lasted more than a predefined period of time t cut t in the automated irrigation scheduling the system may experience frequent unwanted triggering events that imposes unscheduled energy consumption therefore a maximum irrigation frequency value f max t 1 can be defined to have both on demand predetermined interval irrigation scheduling setting a large value for f max can yield pure on demand scheduling while by setting triggering values lower larger absolute values than h crit l a predefined minimum value of pressure head at medium surface which is commonly set as the pressure head of air dried medium ebman hp switches to pure predetermined interval scheduling h crit l is the pressure head equivalent to the water content of the air dried substrate defined in atmospheric boundary condition when the system triggers an irrigation event depending on the water remained in the supply tank at the previous time step v st n 1 either the full water requirement v req l 3 or the whole remained water is depleted from the supply tank the former occurs providing v req v st n 1 and the latter occurs when there is not enough water to fulfill the water requirement therefore the volume of released water i e v re l 3 can be formulated as follows 16 v re v r e q v r e q v s t n 1 v s t n 1 v r e q v s t n 1 the volume of required water v req l 3 at each irrigation interval is set for ebman hp as an input using the geometry of the flood floor bench 17 v req l f w f 2 h e w f s f 2 where the parameters l f l w f l and s f define the geometry of the flood floor as defined in fig 1 and h e is the depth of water at the edge position of the flooded floor for flooded benches s f 0 in eq 17 the water head at the center position of the flooded floor h c l as a function of volume of released water can be calculated as follows 18 h c v r e w f l f w f s f 2 v r e 0 5 w f 2 s f l f 2 v r e s f l f v r e 0 5 w f 2 s f l f this equation assumes a trapezoidal prism for the shape of ponded water at full inundation i e h e 0 and a triangular prism at the partial inundation note that for the flooded bench assuming s f 0 only the first condition of eq 18 is used since the second condition of the equation results in trivial values using assumption 5 the water head at each point of the flooded floor h d l can be immediately calculated as follows 19 h d max h c z f 0 0 max h c y s f 0 0 where z f l is the elevation of flood floor at each point from the base line i e the baseline can be assumed as the elevation of center position and y is the cartesian coordinate shown in fig 1 during flooding phase the pots absorb the ponded water on the flooded floor or bench and at each time step the change of water content in all pots i e θ l 3 is calculated as follows 20 θ n i 1 n p i j 1 n p j k 1 k max a i j k θ i j k n θ i j k n 1 δ z i j k where δ z l is the vertical dimension of each control volume in each pot a l 2 is the average cross sectional surface of pots at each control volume n p i is number of pots in x direction and n p j is the number of pots in y direction the advantage of eq 20 is that it can involve different shapes of pots the water content at each time level is obtained by solving richards equation for each pot separately considering the water depth at each location on the flood floor in order to enhance the efficiency of model the richards equation for all pots was solved in parallel using openmp which is described in the upcoming section when the system switches off the remained water in the floor or bench flows back to the supply tank however in practice the supply tank does not receive the ponded water completely and a fraction should be considered as water loss η at this moment the volume of water inside supply tank at the end of time step v st n l 3 is equal to the sum of released water and the remained water inside supply tank at the previous time step considering water loss in the flood floor bench and the change of water content in all pots during that time step 21 v st n v st n 1 1 η v re θ n noteworthy h d v re 0 when the irrigation system is off and when the supply tank is empty it is refilled to the full capacity 2 6 parallel programming using openmp since ebb and flow subirrigation system applies iterative scheme on several pots the solution scheme may be inefficient in serial mode the prevailing code i e ebman hp employs parallel programming to improve the efficiency of model in this study the parallel programming is fulfilled via openmp openmp is a standard parallelization tool for the shared memory platforms afzal et al 2017 openmp is preferred to message passing interface mpi as it requires minimal changes to the serial version of the program and it is easy to implement leandro et al 2014 ebman hp solves a separate richards equation for each pot using implicit scheme by means of parallel programming this model aims to improve efficiency of the calculations using openmp directives the performance of model can be boosted provided that the proposed scheme suits the nature of the ebb and flow subirrigation system to the experience of the authors there were two strategies for parallelization of the ebb and flow subirrigation system first to solve several independent richards equations simultaneously i e the compiler runs the code blocks of the richards equation including linearization calculations of hysteresis module matrix storage and the solver for system of linear equations for each pot serially using an independent processor therefore computational steps of each pot runs in parallel to the other pots second to mix the code blocks for all pots and running each block in parallel this approach results in a large system of equations consisting of the nodes of all pots that can be solved using a parallel tdma solver the former is prone to several pitfalls in openmp large do loops are hard to handle and susceptible of false sharing on the other hand pots locating at the edge position of ebb and flow irrigation receive less irrigation depth compared to those at the center position therefore the differently positioned pots are likely to require different number of iterations at a particular time step considering the fact that at each time step the reservoir equation should be updated after all richards equations took one step forward the aforementioned heterogeneous share of work for each processor may impose latency on the solution of richards equations in other words the delay of the slowest processor slows down the performance of all processors therefore the ebman hp model is established based on the latter approach of parallelization one of the time consuming components of the selected parallelization scheme is the iterative solver for system of equations as mentioned the iterative tdma solver of the presented model should be employed frequently at each time step in order to accelerate the tdma solver an algorithm is proposed that breaks the large system of equations into several smaller system of equations the small systems of equations are solved simultaneously using openmp directives fig 2 shows the idea behind the parallel tdma solver employed in this study as shown the large system of equations a k max p max k max p max x k max p max 1 b k max p max 1 where a is the matrix of coefficients x is the matrix of unknowns and b is the right hand side matrix k max is the number of computational nodes for each cultivation pot and p max is the total number of pots is composed of p max independent elements each can be solved independently in a small system of equations shown by j in fig 2 below each j represents the system of equations for solving richards equation of one pot it is also possible to divide the large system of equations into groups of j s and call each group a solpor i e solver portion in fig 2 below each group or solpor includes two j s hence solpo r 1 involves j 1 and j 2 solpo r 2 involves j 3 and j 4 and solpo r n involves j 2 n 1 and j 2 n in general each solpor may include an arbitrary number of j s hereinafter called n j provided that p max is divisible by n j the large system of equations is broken into solpo r max small systems of equations of form a k max n j k max n j x k max n j 1 b k max n j 1 each small system of equations can be solved separately by a processor in parallel and independent of other small systems to this end an openmp do loop directive with dynamic schedule clause is used to solve all small systems concurrently the rationale behind choosing dynamic clause is that this clause makes a sequence of processes or so called chunks mattson et al 2019 and the chunks are placed in a queue the processors take one or more chunk s at each turn as the computational task for a processor is accomplished the idle processor goes to the queue to take another chunk therefore the solver suits both clusters in which there may exist a number of processors with different processing speed and personal laptops with a few processors while having the same speed 2 7 statistical indices for model evaluation the accuracy of model is evaluated using three statistical indices namely rmse root mean squared error mae mean absolute error and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency which are defined as follows 22 rmse 1 n max n 1 n max x sim x ref n 2 23 mae 1 n max n 1 n max x sim x ref n 24 nse 1 n 1 n max x sim x ref n 2 n 1 n max x obs x ref n 2 where x sim is the simulated value x ref is the reference value i e analytical solution or measured value x ref is the average of reference values additionally another parameter was considered to examine the ability of model to conserve the continuity of mass in the solution domain during the simulation time i e mass balance mb as follows šimůnek et al 2018 25 mb t 100 v k t v k 0 0 t q sub w dt 0 t q topbc q botbc dt 100 max k 1 k max v k t v k 0 0 t q sub w dt 0 t q topbc q botbc dt where v k 0 and v k t is the volume of water at the beginning and at an arbitrary time for the kth control volume respectively q topbc and q botbc are the water flux across the top and bottom boundaries respectively mb can be reported as an integrated value at the final time step by calculating the total flux into out of the domain as well as the total mass added to exploited from the domain from the beginning up to nth time step an et al 2010 naghedifar et al 2019 eq 25 was used in the well known software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 in section 3 4 the mb of the presented model is compared to hydrus 1d finally amdahl s law was employed to examine the maximum possible speedup s am concerning parallel computing this index yields the potential speedup can be achieved providing a proportion of the program remains serial α s and the program is run by n p processors amdahl s law can be shown as follows mattson et al 2019 26 s am t s t p 1 α s 1 α s n p where t s is the time of running the program in serial mode and t p is the time of running the program in ideally parallelized mode the actual speedup the ratio of the execution time by serial mode to actual parallel mode can be presented in the dimensionless form using amdahl s law herein the ratio of the actual speedup to s am that is equivalent to the ideally parallelized execution time to the actual parallel mode is termed normalized speedup the above mentioned indices can help evaluate ebman hp model in terms of accuracy with respect to reference values such as analytical solutions or measured data i e rmse mae and nse stability i e mb and speedup i e sam 2 8 model evaluation in order to ensure the performance of different components of ebman hp it has been verified and validated against several test cases model evaluation test cases involve validation of ebman hp with analytical solution as well as hydrus 1d furthermore the performance of model is investigated in terms of speed and elimination of artificial pumping error the constant parameters of the parker and lenhard 1987 s water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of van genuchten 1980 are presented in table 1 all execution times and speedup tests in this study was conducted on an intel coretm i7 cpu x980 with speed of 3 3 ghz and installed memory of 12 gb with windows 7 enterprise operating system all codes were developed in fortran programming language 2 8 1 verification the capability of model to eliminate artificial pumping error the main objective of this section is examination of hysteretic water retention modules of ebman hp to eliminate artificial pumping error in consecutive drying wetting loops to this end two patterns of dampening and heightening amplitude cosine waves are considered for the matric pressure head as input and the resulting effective saturation has been monitored these patterns may imply infiltration and redistribution under periodic irrigation werner and lockington 2006 two media were involved in this section medium no 1 and 2 in table 1 the cosine waves of pressure head were continued for more than 6000 time steps for each soil that yielded about 25 and 28 loops for medium no 1 and 2 respectively it should be noted that since high order 3 scanning curves are weakly hysteretic they are commonly considered as non hysteretic werner and lockington 2006 however in this section the scanning curves whose order are higher than 100 are considered as non hysteretic to allow model simulate all cycles 2 8 2 validation simulation of hysteretic loops with primary drying and wetting scanning curves in order to validate the hysteretic water retention curve module of ebman hp the experimental data of huang et al 2005 have been employed as a validation benchmark huang et al 2005 provided two sets of data regarding scanning curves beginning with primary wetting i e departed from main drying curve and primary drying i e departed from main wetting curve scanning curves medium no 3 table 1 the constant parameters of main drying and wetting curves were obtained by fitting eq 2 on the measured data of huang et al 2005 using retc van genuchten et al 1991 subsequently the scanning curves were simulated by the hysteretic modules of ebman hp using eq 8 both experiments involve three successive scanning curves that the first two of which make a closed loop and the last curve continues beyond the close loop to near saturation fig 4 a and near dry fig 4 b water contents 2 8 3 validation and application comparison with an analytical steady solution to examine the performance of parallel tdma solver the objective of this section is not only validating the results of ebman hp with an analytical solution but to assess the performance of parallel tdma solver considering its boundary conditions the analytical solution employed in this section is analogous to the nature of ebb and flow irrigation system yuan and lu 2005 presented an analytical solution for both steady state and transient conditions influenced by 1d root water uptake from a soil block whose lower boundary restricted by constant head dirichlet type condition and is exposed to a constant flux neumann type at the top boundary the solutions presented by yuan and lu 2005 have made a basis for the solutions of feng et al 2019 the root can be expanded into the soil with different shapes i e different root density functions including uniform stepwise and exponential functions herein the root density distribution is assumed to be exponential shaped whose root water uptake function was defined by yuan and lu 2005 as 27 q sub w q sub w 0 exp β r z l t where q sub w 0 is the maximum uptake at the soil surface t 1 and β r is the distribution constant showing the rate of reduction in root uptake l 1 the solutions of yuan and lu 2005 were presented in terms of matric flux potential φ l which is defined as follows suk and park 2019 28 φ z ψ k ψ d ψ k ψ α g where α g is the gardner s constant parameter the second equity is obtained providing that hydraulic conductivity is defined by the gardner s exponential function gardner 1958 the gardner s constitutive relationships describe soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as follows 29 s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r exp α g ψ 30 k ψ k s exp α g ψ the analytical solution for the steady state under the assumption that an exponential root water uptake function extracts water from the soil block eq 27 was obtained by yuan and lu 2005 as follows 31 φ z k s α g exp α g ψ bc z q

boundary involves ponded pots in addition to the pots with lower boundary at the unsaturated state hence the lower boundary condition changes between 0 1 and 0 1 m fig 5 a a constant flux of 1 mm hr was applied at the upper boundary of the 1 m deep soil block and the total number of computational nodes was assumed to be 200 in all pots maximum uptake at the soil surface was considered to be q sub w 0 1 mm hr and distribution constant β r 6 m 1 after validation this test case was used to assess the performance of tdma solver in terms of number of processors therefore although the steady state solution was obtained after a few iterations the iterative process was continued for 1 10 6 iterations to reach a comprehensive view of the performance of parallel tdma solver a variety of values for p max 16 32 64 128 256 and solpor were examined solpor values were defined such that they are divisible to p max as follows 32 solpo r i i 1 1 log 2 p max 2 i 1 i z the above mentioned cases were run by ebman hp model and the performance was investigated by increasing the number of processors 2 8 4 validation and application comparison of model s speed and accuracy with hydrus 1d in this section the performance of the ebman hp is compared with hydrus 1d a well known numerical model for simulation of variably saturated flow šimůnek et al 2018 hydrus 1d has been verified through a number of on field in lab measurements turco et al 2017 er raki et al 2021 and analytical solutions zlotnik et al 2007 this model can simulate the hysteretic water flow using parker and lenhard 1987 functions hydrus 1d is limited to simulation of only one computational domain at a time and consequently cannot be used for verification of all capabilities of ebman hp such as running multiple pots or simulation of variations of water inside supply tank and on the ebb and flow flood floor bench considering these facts the main objective of this section is to assess the accuracy and speed of all sections of the ebman hp code except tdma solver which was run in the previous section to run a hysteretic problem over a long time two different soil textures have been considered in this section avondale clay loam soil texture rudiyanto et al 2020 and medium sand texture zhai et al 2020 to represent fine and coarse textured soils respectively the hydraulic and hysteretic characteristics of the soils are presented in table 1 medium no 5 and 6 respectively to compare the performance of the model a single soil block of 1 m depth is considered whose bottom boundary is constrained with constant pressure head and its top boundary is governed by a variable pressure head i e ψ topbc t the general formulation of the variable pressure head for the two test cases were defined as follows 33 ψ topbc t max e μ t a m cos π t 86400 t ψ 0 ψ 0 where μ t 1 is the damping coefficient a m l is the amplitude of the waves t t is the period of the function ψ 0 l is the intercept and ψ 0 l is a threshold for pressure head the total simulation time was assumed to be 100 days ε ψ 1 10 3 m and ε θ 1 10 3 and time step 0 05 s t 60 s to obtain a comprehensive comparison between ebman hp and hydrus 1d twelve numerical experiments were implemented that involved different grid densities i e 100 200 300 400 600 800 nodes different variable pressure head boundary conditions and soil types table 2 2 8 5 application performance of ebman hp model for simulation of flood floor subirrigation system in this section different capabilities of ebman hp have been examined through a complete simulation test case in this test case a sensor based flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation system has been simulated for cultivation of strawberry the flood floor is 10 m long and 8 m wide with slope of 0 02 the size of the floor suggested by lumis et al 2000 was 5 m 9 m however in this section a larger floor was considered so that more number of pots can be positioned on the floor to make better perspective of the model s performance a cylindrical tank with 0 4 m radius and 1 5 m height supplied water to the concrete flood floor the pots were also assumed to be cylindrical with 10 cm radius and 30 cm height the pots were filled by peat substrate medium no 7 in table 1 whose hydraulic properties proposed by cormier et al 2020 cormier et al 2020 employed this substrate for cultivation of strawberry thirty two pots were positioned along the width of the flood floor and forty pots along the length of the flood floor the irrigation is triggered when the pressure head of the substrate is about 15 cm at the location of sensor and the flooding phase is terminated when the substrate at the same location experiences a pressure head of 10 cm the close triggering termination criteria is due to the steep slope of the water retention curve for the peat which can be recognized through the high values of α w and α d table 1 the water content sensor is assumed to be installed into the pot positioned at the center of the floor following fig 1 c of ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c the sensor is installed horizontally at the bottom of the aforementioned pot along with the water content based trigger termination criteria temporal thresholds were also assumed at each event providing water content did not reach the termination criteria flooding phase stops after 15 min anlauf and rehrmann 2013 furthermore to avoid unwanted successive irrigation events the irrigation cannot be triggered sooner than 24 hr from the previous event at each irrigation event 224 l water is released on the flood floor to inundate the flood floor the total simulation time was 70 days the variations of potential evaporation and transpiration is presented in fig 10 the plant root is totally expanded in pots to the depth of 30 cm eq 6 and its stress function parameters are presented in table 4 3 results the water flow solute transport root water and nutrient uptake modules of ebman were validated against analytical solutions in lab measurements as well as the results obtained by the well established models naghedifar et al 2020 the validation test cases approved the accuracy of model since ebman was only presented for soil cultures and it was developed in serial mode in the following verification and validation sections are focused on hysteretic module and parallel mode 3 1 verification the capability of model to eliminate artificial pumping error fig 3 a and c illustrate the variations of pressure head imposed as input to the water retention modules of ebman hp to form hysteretic loops the equations of the cosine pressure head waves are also presented in fig 3 a and c the parameters of the equations are chosen such that high frequency waves are obtained as inputs this type of waves will examine the hysteretic water retention modules under a condition susceptible of artificial pumping error fig 3 b and d demonstrates the closed loops of scanning curves for both soil textures under variations of pressure head to ensure that model does not suffer from artificial pumping error a zoom in view has been also presented in fig 3 b and d as shown the closure of loops eliminates artificial pumping error and the scanning curves does not deviate from the main drying wetting curves 3 2 validation simulation of hysteretic loops with primary drying and wetting scanning curves in fig 4 a the simulation starts from the main drying curve and continues towards the first reversal point at this point the primary wetting scanning curve departs towards the saturation point in the meanwhile the primary scanning curve is truncated by a reversal point the resulted drying scanning curve is again truncated by an intermediate reversal point that provides a closed loop with the preceding scanning curve this is due to the fact that no more truncation happens at the wetting scanning curve and the soil water content pressure head curve goes beyond the preceding reversal point the last scanning wetting curve is not defined beyond the reversal point and hence it joins the primary wetting curve at the rest of the wetting path the same trend occurs in fig 4 b for the hysteretic experiment initiated from the main wetting the primary drying scanning curve departs from the main wetting curve the next two scanning curves make a closed loop since the hysteretic curve goes beyond the pressure head of the latest reversal point it passes through this point to join the primary drying curve as shown in fig 4 both hysteretic scanning curves were simulated accurately with nse 0 94 showing the capability of model to simulate the hysteresis process in wide range of pressure heads 3 3 validation and application comparison with an analytical steady solution to examine the performance of parallel tdma solver as mentioned the objective of this section is to assess the parallel tdma solver hence the steady state solution has been chosen so that the computational cost for the other calculation procedures such as updating soil hydraulic properties and matrix storage approaches to minima noteworthy the analytical solution of yuan and lu 2005 does not involve hysteresis therefore in this section it has been assumed that the soil water variations only follow main drying or wetting curve the proposed analytical solution is incorporated in a numerical experiment describing a wide range of bottom boundary conditions fig 5 b compares the results of simulation of the test case obtained by the model with analytical solution the error indices suggest that the simulations are in perfect agreement with the analytical solution at different lower boundary conditions in all numerical experiments in this section more than 99 65 of the execution time was devoted to the parallel tdma solver fig 6 describes the influence of number of processors solpor and the number of pots i e size of the problem on the execution time of the simulations in fig 7 the influence of the same parameters is shown on the normalized speedup in the serial mode shown in fig 6a e in dark blue by increasing number of solpor s the execution time is not reduced this is attributed to the fact that the chunks of dynamic schedule clause are only passed to the master thread and no slave thread is defined in this mode therefore the workshares are queued to be performed by only one thread and breaking the system of linear equations into several chunks while they are not computed simultaneously does not accelerate the calculations on the other hand when increasing the number of processors but employing only a single solpor the execution time is not reduced since the parallel tdma solver is unable to share the chunks of schedule clause to the involved threads in other words although there exist several slave threads they all fight over one piece of work the winner takes the workshare and the other processors are detained up to the time it accomplishes the task however when solpor is increased to two with two processors the execution time decreases to almost half in parallel mode note that in fig 6 z axis have been presented in logarithmic scale with normalized speedup of about 100 fig 7a e which is equivalent to maximum possible speedup determined by amdahl s law this trend can be observed free from p max however by increasing the number of solpor s with two processors no significant change in execution time and normalized speedup is obtained for all p max the purple bars in fig 7a e and fig 6a e similar to the serial mode by increasing the number of solpor s the two processors are overloaded by several workshares therefore breaking the chunks into smaller pieces does not help improve the efficiency of the scheme this result was predictable because when maximum possible normalized speedup obtained by two solpor s no more improvements could be reached by two processors the scalability of model can be shown more considerably by enhancing the number of processors involved in the parallel solver this is because when the number of processors are increased the parallel do loop outperforms by receiving more chunks at the same time generally in all cases of p max by increasing number of processors and solpor s the execution time shows a decreasing trend while normalized speedup approaches to its maximum value in other words referring to amdahl s law by involving more processors there is more potential for reducing execution time however this is the number of solpor s that helps parallel tdma solver achieve maximum possible speedup for instance using 3 and 4 processors normalized speedup could reach 97 5 and 93 2 respectively fig 7a e for the largest system of equations p max 256 moreover it is observed that the performance of the parallel tdma solver increases in the large system of equations in all cases the best overall normalized speedup has been obtained in the largest system of equations p max 256 or p max 128 e g in fig 7 e there exists a few anomalies in the results i e increasing number of solpor s when using a specific number of processors does not help the solver s speedup or it slightly deteriorates its performance this observations can be attributed to the false sharing of the computational tasks over the involved processors which is inherent in a parallel code 3 4 validation and application comparison of model s speed and accuracy with hydrus 1d as mentioned earlier in this section ebman hp is compared with the well known code hydrus 1d whose performance have been examined in several papers šimůnek et al 2008 to ensure about the accuracy of ebman hp the variations of soil pressure head soil water content and effective saturation at different depths of the soil block is compared with those obtained by hydrus 1d fig 8 fig 8 clarifies that the results of the models are in perfect agreement in all soil layers noteworthy fig 8 illustrates the results in serial mode rmse mae and nse of ebman hp for all grid densities in serial mode are presented in table 3 table 3 also compares the execution time relative iterations the ratio of the total iterations for ebman hp to that of hydrus 1d and mb of ebman hp and hydrus 1d for the twelve numerical tests from the standpoint of models speed ebman hp performed better than hydrus 1d in almost all cases and only for dense grid 800 nodes of the medium sand hydrus 1d has performed better comparing to ebman hp in the case of avondale clay loam the models speed approached to each other while the grid became dense it should be noted that ebman hp is mainly designed to simulate water flow within small scale domains i e ebb and flow subirrigation pots and the grid density required for this domain does not exceed a few hundred nodes for which ebman hp performed better than hydrus 1d in all cases the rationale behind higher speed of the ebman hp can be attributed to the number of iterations table 3 as shown in all cases the total number of iterations for ebman hp is less than 76 of hydrus 1d for the cases ebman hp s iterations are less than 65 of hydrus 1d it performs faster to observe the ability of ebman hp model to preserve continuity of mass mb of the models has been also compared in table 3 it can be concluded that hydrus 1d preserves perfect mass balance in all cases mb of ebman hp is very close to that of hydrus 1d and about 0 2 error was reported at maximum finally rmse mae and nse of ebman hp s results for water content and effective saturation shows that in all cases the model has perfect agreement with hydrus 1d with nse between 0 999 and 1 000 rmse of 0 0003 0 0006 c m 3 c m 3 for avondale clay loam and 0 0003 0 0015 for medium sand and mae of 0 0012 0 0026 c m 3 c m 3 for avondale clay loam and 0 0011 0 0057 for medium sand subsequent to the serial mode ebman hp was run through the parallel mode the models performance have been compared in fig 9 it can be observed that in all grid densities by adding number of processors ebman hp model results in much lower simulation time fig 9 proves the scalability of different sections of ebman hp code by increasing number of processors the important point is that ebman hp s scalability is more distinguished by increasing number of nodes the execution time for simulation of water flow within avondale clay loam discretized by 100 nodes is 13 01 s and 4 61 s when using single and six processors respectively which represents a ratio the ratio of execution time for serial run to that of parallel run with six processors by ebman hp of about 2 82 the same values for medium sand are 13 70 s 4 85 s and 2 82 respectively however when the number of nodes increased to 800 the execution time for avondale clay loam at the serial and 6 processor modes are 165 88 s and 37 78 s which yields a ratio of 4 39 while the same values for medium sand are 202 75 s 52 44 s and 3 87 these results clarify that the model s scalability is more considerable at the dense domains while bringing enough efficiency at the sparse domains 3 5 application performance of ebman hp model for simulation of flood floor subirrigation system the information mentioned in section 2 8 4 were introduced to ebman hp to involve almost all capabilities of the model the variations of soil water pressure head and water content at the location of water content sensor can be observed in fig 11 a and b as shown in fig 11 a 43 irrigation events have been occurred during the simulation period the water content sensor triggers irrigation as the pressure head achieves the triggering threshold however considering the location of the sensor water content exceeds the termination threshold excluding a warmup period of about 48 hr these pressure head thresholds keep the water content of the substrate between 55 and 72 with time averaged water content of about 57 on the other hand fig 11 c shows the variations of volume of water in the storage tank in high and low resolution outputs the high resolution output presents details of variations of volume of water at the storage tank including the drop of the volume of water at the triggering time and during the flooding phase as well as the increasing step of the volume at the termination time when water drains back from the flooded floor to the storage tank the details of a flooding drainage phase of the ebb and flow subirrigation system have been shown in the a b zoom in view of fig 11 c as shown the 224 l of the water released to the flooded floor and 166 l of which returned back to the storage tank after termination time due to the decline of the water in the storage tank it required to be refilled twice during total 70 days after about 20 5 and 58 3 days the volume of water at the supply tank dropped below the 224 l required at each irrigation event therefore the volume of water applied to the flooded floor was less than the required water at these two times the applied water was 212 l and 207 l respectively it is observed that during the simulation period system triggers at the prescribed triggering threshold i e 0 15 m however after the second refilling pressure head at the triggering time drops below the triggering threshold at this period of time the irrigation events were not able to fulfill water requirements and therefore the system triggered once a day the denser irrigation events allowed by irrigation scheduling described above the rationale behind it can be explained by focusing on the potential evaporation and potential transpiration rates shown in fig 10 b and c in these zoom in views it can be observed that the first refill occurs when the potential evaporation and potential transpiration are on the falling limb and consequently the deficit in volume of water applied to the flood floor does not influence the triggering pressure head however at the second refilling time the potential evaporation and potential transpiration were on the rising limb and it amplified the effect of water deficit in the pots finally the test case was run in both serial and parallel modes and the results were illustrated in fig 12 the results clarify that less than 6 of the execution time is spent at the serial sections of the code moreover it can be referred that model keeps the execution time at the ideal point up to 4 processors and it could accelerate the execution time up to about 400 using 6 processors while equivalent amdahl s speedup was 460 4 discussion ebman hp is a physically based numerical model for simulation of all major components of ebb and flow subirrigation system employing hysteretic water flow and openmp directives due to the high difference between the water contents of main wetting and drying curves involving hysteretic water content functions has been proved to be necessary by the experimental investigations of water flow within horticultural substrates anlauf and rehrmann 2012 furthermore numerical investigations of arrey et al 2018 have clarified that even though hysteresis can be ignored in large scale studies over a catchment with the soil textures of the similar classes its role is of high importance in the case of water movement within stratified soil profiles however as suggested by anlauf et al 2016 the heterogeneity of the horticultural substrates in the pots is likely to be inconsiderable therefore in the validation verification test cases the substrate inside pots was always assumed to be homogeneous according to the experimental measurements of wen et al 2020 the size of the hysteretic loops after 4 or 5 drying wetting cycles becomes unchanged however as shown in section 3 1 of the current study the non hysteretic cycle depends on the constant parameters of the pressure head waves not he number of wetting drying cycles fig 3a and c on the other hand kargas et al 2021 verified the implications of including hysteresis in light of different boundary conditions kargas et al 2021 reported that during the evaporation or infiltration hysteresis is not necessary to be taken into account since the water content experiences a monotonic decrease or increase at the boundary respectively however when an atmospheric or a periodic boundary condition is set at the boundary the influence of hysteresis is highlighted on water movement within the porous media the latter atmospheric and periodic boundary conditions is the case for the boundary conditions of the pots in ebb and flow subirrigation system therefore the capability of model to handle atmospheric and periodic boundary conditions was examined in the sections 3 1 3 4 and 3 5 kargas et al 2021 also proved that the redistribution phase is delayed by hysteresis since the soil pressure head gradient becomes zero right after the end of infiltration furthermore it was mentioned that hysteresis controls the availability of water for plants that directly affects the plant growth and stresses model s speedup was the second issue addressed by means of openmp directives in the prevailing study in several studies solution scheme of multi dimensional richards equation has been boosted by parallel programming orgogozo 2015 2022 however to the best of the authors knowledge the presented parallel schemes are developed for non hysteretic richards equation the scheme of egidi et al 2020 was proposed for solving three dimensional richards equation this scheme was claimed to be adaptable to the parallel programming simulations of egidi et al 2020 by means of intel core i7 3 4 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram showed that the model could accelerate the procedure for 5 32 times with 8 threads comparing to serial run for a landslide hazard evaluation on a geographical area consisting of sandy soil texture in this study openmp directives were used for parallelization of the model the richardsfoam presented by orgogozo et al 2014 respectively obtained up to 90 efficiency using 1024 processors for watershed modeling two more versions of this code were presented afterwards named richardsfoam2 and 3 orgogozo 2015 2022 finally opencal was presented by de rango et al 2021 which was used to solve three dimensional richards equation using openmp the other models such as those of hwang et al 2014 and wu et al 2021 among others have developed for modeling non hysteretic coupled overland subsurface water flow 5 conclusions in this study a physically based model was presented for simulation of flood floor bench ebb and flow subirrigation system by which every major component of the system can be simulated including the variations of water depth inside inclined flat flood floor bench and also water head fluctuations inside water tank along with the components of the system all phases of irrigation including flooding and drainage phases can be described by model model benefits from the hysteretic constitutive relationships which has been reported to be necessary for simulation of water movement within horticultural substrates furthermore the model s performance was improved by means openmp directives through which a parallel numerical scheme to solve richards equation and a novel scalable tdma solver have been developed the examination of model s performance showed that the hysteretic water retention module can eliminate artificial pumping error and the scanning curves can be simulated with high accuracy in wide range of pressure heads nse 0 94 from the standpoint of model s speedup it was clarified that ebman hp could run faster than hydrus 1d in both serial mode at the scale of a few hundred nodes and much faster in parallel mode with all examined grid densities ebman hp could reach about 45 and 600 less execution times in serial and parallel modes using 6 processors respectively relative to hydrus 1d it was also shown that the idea behind breaking the large system of equations into simultaneously solved smaller systems was of high efficiency to speed up the tdma solver it was concluded that by increasing the number of processors and solpor s the tdma solver shows a improving trend in the execution time and normalized speedup finally ebman hp was employed to run a comprehensive illustrative example in which flood floor under sensor based subirrigation system was simulated in which different capabilities of model were challenged it was shown that the model s speed up could reach between 84 and 100 of maximum possible speedup suggested by amdahl s law therefore the above mentioned examinations proved the scalability of ebman hp solution scheme this paper was focused on the numerical development of the model and its applications using in lab or in situ measurements remains a topic of ongoing research other types of root water uptake modules including root architecture models can be investigated in the future studies the presented model provides a tool for design and assessment of greenhouse irrigation systems and encourages the involvement of openmp directives to increase the efficiency of codes developed for simulation of ebb and flow subirrigation systems this model can also be embedded in a data assimilation system or can be used for training of neural network for online smart irrigation scheduling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9194,ebb and flow irrigation system is a closed loop efficient subirrigation system in this study a numerical model ebman hp has been presented for simulation of all components variations of water depth in supply tank and concrete floor tank and all phases of flood floor bench ebb and flow subirrigation systems the model benefits from a fine tuned computational algorithm for hysteresis module the model can simulate both time specified and sensor based irrigation scheduling since ebb and flow irrigation system incorporates numerous pots richards equation should be solved for several pots to obtain sufficient understanding of the whole system therefore the proposed model benefits from openmp parallel programming to speed up the execution time besides a novel parallel tdma solver have been presented that accelerates the computation speed by breaking a large system of equations into several simultaneously solved portions the model has been validated and verified against several analytical numerical and experimental test cases the results showed hysteresis module can completely remove artificial pumping error in two critical test cases the parallel tdma solver was shown to be able to reach to the speedup of about 90 the model was shown to perform faster than hydrus 1d even in serial mode for coarser grids about 52 faster in average of 8 test cases and similar to hydrus 1d for dense grids about 6 faster in average of 4 test cases with the perfect agreement nse between 0 999 and 1 000 and the average difference in mbe less than 0 1 for 12 cases parallel model could boost the models performance to about 500 using 6 processors finally comprehensive illustrative example has been shown to present almost all capabilities of model keywords richards equation parallel programming hysteresis irrigation data availability data will be made available on request the data and codes used to support the findings of this study are either included within the article or is available by request from corresponding author 1 introduction ebb and flow subirrigation systems are commonly admired in greenhouse irrigation systems due to their benefits such as water conservation comparing to conventional irrigation methods jani et al 2021 higher plant quality and shortening plant cycle ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017 to further improve the capabilities of the ebb and flow system it can be automated by low cost instruments ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c although number of experimental researches have been conducted on the different aspects of ebb and flow subirrigation systems ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c macan et al 2020 few works have focused on the process based simulation of these systems e g otten 1994 anlauf and rehrmann 2013 ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c naghedifar et al 2020b otten 1994 employed swatre soil water and transpiration rate extended for simulation of ficus benjamina grown using ebb and flow benches in this study the deficiency of the model was that it did not include a process based function to account for actual evaporation root water and nutrient uptake therefore the above mentioned processes were measured and forced to the model as a sink term on the other hand the studies of anlauf et al 2012 and anlauf and rehrmann 2013 showed that the necessary slope 0 2 0 4 of the flood floor has an impact on the plant growth which was neglected in the simulations of ebb and flow benches by otten 1994 anlauf et al 2012 and anlauf and rehrmann 2013 employed hydrus 1d to simulate flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation experiment conducted on an in lab setup and reported that the position of pots on the sloping flooded floor has a considerable effect on the total absorbed water by the substrate however they only simulated one irrigation cycle without considering the presence of the plant in the substrate finally naghedifar et al 2020b developed a physically based model hereinafter called ebman by coupling water flow and solute transport equations and incorporating root water and nutrient uptake modules to simulate sensor based flood floor ebb and flow irrigation system with saline water they also used a small scale optimization technique i e so called taguchi approach taguchi and konishi 1987 naghedifar et al 2018 to investigate the optimal state of sensor position within a pot and in the flood floor leaching time triggering and cutoff sensor thresholds their optimization procedure on a hypothetical crop which was assumed to be sensitive to drought and salinity stresses revealed that the highest transpiration and uniformity is obtained when the sensor is installed at the upper half of a pot the optimal position of the pot was close to the center position of the flood floor with triggering and cutoff matric potential thresholds of 10 m close to wilting point and 2 m close to field capacity the deficiency of the naghedifar et al 2020b s model was that it was limited to non hysteretic growing media non negligible researches witness the presence of hysteresis in the horticultural substrates bougoul et al 2005 naasz et al 2005 londra 2010 many hysteretic models have been developed by the researchers for agricultural and geotechnical uses pham et al 2005 reviewed and compared several hysteretic models of soil water retention curve and divided these models into two categories of physically based domain or conceptual and empirical models the former is based on the integration of pore radii distribution functions of soil while the latter relies on the linear rudiyanto et al 2020 or nonlinear nuth and laloui 2008 scaling of main drying or drainage and wetting or imbibition curves to obtain the so called scanning curves scarfone et al 2020 i e the curves describing the transition between the main curves empirical hysteretic models are comparatively simpler and hence are commonly employed in numerical models werner and lockington 2005 however these models may suffer from a so called artificial pumping error werner and lockington 2005 or pumping effect šimůnek et al 2018 the artificial pumping error causes the scanning curves to move unrealistically beyond the main scanning curves to address this deficiency parker and lenhard 1987 s formulation enforces the closure of scanning curves at the previous and preceding reversal points thereby removing pumping error at the cost of high memory capacity to store reversal points of all computational nodes according to the antecedent studies there exists several deficiencies in the simulation of ebb and flow modeling first there is not a specific model that simulates all mechanisms of ebb and flow subirrigation system and the simulation of ebb and flow subirrigation system is only focused on the cultivation pots and the remaining components of the ebb and flow are either neglected or considered as the boundary conditions of the pots the underlying assumption of such modeling procedures is that water is always available in the supply tank therefore the resulting simulation cannot give a perspective of water consumption in the system water consumption and quality is mostly monitored inside the reservoir which is commonly neglected in the simulations on the other hand the heterogeneity of the water delivered by the pots lied at the edge and center of the sloped flood floor provides dissimilar water uptake by the pots therefore the pots throughout the flood floor experience different water movement regimes during a season this fact highlights the importance of involving dynamics of ponding water on the flood floor which has also been ignored in the previous numerical studies secondly the latter implies that the simulation of flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation system requires running richards equation and if required for fertigation purposes advection dispersion equation for each pot during the whole growing season on the flood floor therefore the numerical models which were developed using serial programming e g swatre belmans et al 1983 hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 and ebman naghedifar et al 2020b are inefficient for simulation of ebb and flow irrigation system to address this deficiency parallel programming can be used as a promising solution the novelties of the presented model hereinafter referred to as ebman hp comparing to the available models or researches can be presented as follows 1 to develop a novel numerical model designed specifically for simulation of flood floor bench ebb and flow by considering all major components processes of the system such as variations of water volume inside supply tank and flooded floor bench all components are modeled by means of physically based ordinary partial differential equations 2 in opposition to naghedifar et al 2020a and otten 1994 the model employs parker and lenhard 1987 s hysteretic functions that is free from artificial pumping error 3 employing open multi processing openmp directives to develop a parallel numerical scheme to solve richards equation for multiple pots under ebb and flow subirrigation system accompanied with a parallel tdma i e tri diagonal matrix algorithm solver 2 materials and methods 2 1 saturated unsaturated subsurface flow water movement within the saturated unsaturated porous media of soil can be described by richards equation richards 1931 this equation is derived by combining mass conservation law and darcy buckingham flux buckingham 1907 and is in form of diffusive partial differential equation the one dimensional mixed form of richards equation is as follows 1 θ t z k ψ z k q sub w where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 ψ soil water matric potential l k is saturated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z is vertical space coordinate l and q sub w is the sink source term l 3 l 3 t 1 which can represent actual root water uptake the first term of eq 1 is the storage term and the second term is called the diffusive term in order to solve the partial differential eq 1 along with initial and boundary conditions one requires to define θ ψ soil water retention curve and k ψ constitutive relations in this study van genuchten 1980 functions for water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity have been employed 2 s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ λ ϕ 3 k ψ k s s l 1 1 s 1 ϕ ϕ 2 where s is effective saturation l 3 l 3 θ s and θ r are saturated and residual water contents respectively l 3 l 3 α inverse of air entry value l 1 λ 1 and ϕ are pore size distribution indices l is pore connectivity index and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 note that in this study ϕ is not necessarily related to λ i e ϕ 1 1 λ and may be considered as an independent value by means of ebb and flow subirrigation system water is supplied from the bottom of the pots at the flooding phase and is drained out of the pots at the drainage phase the boundary condition at the bottom should be able to reflect these two phases for the lower boundary condition an improved version of seepage face boundary condition is selected at the unsaturated state the boundary considers no flow condition and at the saturated state the pressure head adjacent to the lower boundary of pots is set as the specified head boundary condition the pressure head at the flooding phase is equal to the depth of water in the flood floor bench and at the drainage phase the pots are considered to be exposed to atmosphere at the top boundary the atmospheric boundary condition has been set for all pots this boundary condition can simulate variations of water pond and evaporation from the soil or substrate air interface ponded water if any is imposed at the top boundary through a dirichlet type boundary for which the depth of ponded water is calculated at each time step using a reservoir equation for simulation of evaporation at the soil surface a neumann type boundary condition with potential evaporation rate is set on the soil surface as long as water content is more than a prescribed threshold representing air dried soil water content as water content falls below this threshold a dirichlet type boundary condition is set at the soil air interface with constant pressure head equivalent to the air dried soil water content 2 2 root water uptake module root water uptake is embedded in the ebman hp model using the procedure described by šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the root water uptake module was described in naghedifar et al 2020b for ebman herein it is only summarized for the sake of completeness the actual root water uptake is calculated as follows 4 q sub w z t α w z ψ β z t p t where α w is the dimensionless stress function is the normalized water uptake distribution function l 1 and t p is the potential transpiration rate l t 1 the potential evapotranspiration can be calculated through well known equations such as fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 valipour 2017 el shirbeny et al 2022 in order to partition the potential evapotranspiration to potential evaporation and potential transpiration dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 2005 or equations using leaf area index lai such as ritchie 1972 can be employed the stress function is commonly described by the piecewise function of feddes et al 1978 as follows 5 α w z ψ 0 ψ h 1 o r ψ h 4 ψ h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 ψ h 1 1 h 3 ψ h 2 ψ h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 ψ h 3 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are crop specific thresholds of stress function l normalized water uptake distribution function was considered which was proposed by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 as follows 6 β z 1 667 l r z l t 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l t z l r l t l r z l t 0 2 l r 0 z l t l r where l t is the total soil depth l l r is the rooting depth l 2 3 hysteretic constitutive relation ebb and flow subirrigation systems are mainly accompanied with the horticultural substrates non negligible bibliography has shown that horticultural substrates show considerable hysteresis when irrigated by ebb and flow subirrigation system otten 1994 anlauf and rehrmann 2013 herein the constitutive hysteretic relations of parker and lenhard 1987 has been adopted as follows 7 s ψ s p ψ s p ψ l 1 sf l l 1 s l 1 where p d w is a direction free index representing the state of main or scanning curves i e drying drainage scanning curve d or wetting imbibition scanning curve w the drying and wetting states are determined by the sign of storage term of richards equation at each time step at the wetting state θ t 0 at the drying state θ t 0 and at the situations θ t 0 the prevailing state remains unchanged s l ψ l and s l 1 ψ l 1 are the most recent and preceding reversal points respectively s p ψ is the effective saturation obtained by eq 7 main drying and main wetting scanning curves are formulated as eq 1 sf l l 1 is the scaling factor i e the ratio of the difference between effective saturation at the most recent and preceding reversal points and their corresponding values on the main wetting and main drying curves defined as follows 8 sf l l 1 s l s l 1 s p ψ l s p ψ l 1 from the mathematical viewpoint the simulation of water movement in a hysteretic substrate starts from a point on the main drying wetting curves once the sign of the storage term changes to the opposite the last ψ s point is assumed as the reversal point the wetting drying curve departed from the first reversal point attached to the main drying wetting curve is called primary wetting drying scanning curve if the primary scanning curve is truncated by another reversal point the resulted scanning curve provides a hysteretic loop with preceding curve water capacity function i e c w l 1 of the hysteretic water retention curves of parker and lenhard 1987 can be presented as follows 9 c w c w p sf l l 1 where c w p is the water capacity function of main wetting or main drying curves i e d θ d ψ from eq 2 using the modified picard iteration of celia et al 1990 c w plays an intermediate role in the calculation procedure and disappears from the computation scheme at the convergence on the other hand this function has a discontinuous nature for the hysteretic water retention curves at the reversal points and follows different paths at each scanning curve by the numerical experiments results not shown here it was distinguished that this function destabilizes the numerical scheme therefore in ebman hp model water capacity function of main drying curve has been employed instead of hysteretic water capacity function the rationale behind using main drying curve not main wetting curve is that the water capacity function of main wetting curve always has more nonlinearity and hence imposes more computational cost and may cause instabilities 2 4 dynamic time stepping divergence control and adaptive under relaxation techniques naghedifar et al 2020b examined ebman against different test cases and the model experienced no instability in any of the cases however it was experienced that by adding hysteretic retention curves model may suffer from instabilities when using seepage face at the bottom boundary due to the fact that two adjacent reversal points may be produced with a very small difference and hence the vulgar fraction in eq 7 may approach infinity or for the cases including infiltration into very dry substrate the critical case occurs for the substrates with the suddenly dropping retention curves since they will have very nonlinear water capacity function to avoid the above mentioned instabilities the ebman hp employs several techniques dynamic time stepping was shown to be an effective approach to avoid instabilities which has been employed by researchers for simulation of variably saturated soils an and yu 2014 herein a common time stepping approach is employed by means of which the time step is determined considering the number of iterations at the previous time step naghedifar et al 2020a the previous time step is multiplied by a factor more than 1 commonly between 1 1 and 1 3 providing the number of iterations at the previous time step is less than a lower bound commonly between 3 and 5 under the condition that the iterations are more than an upper bound commonly between 5 and 7 the time step is multiplied by a prescribed value less than 1 commonly between 0 7 and 0 9 if the number of iterations lies between the upper and lower bounds the time step remains unchanged two criteria were considered to show convergence of 1d richards equation huang et al 1996 zha et al 2017 10 δ ψ k 1 k max ψ n m ψ n m 1 ε ψ 11 δ θ k 1 k max θ n m θ n m 1 ε θ where δ ψ l and δ θ l 3 l 3 are the errors of pressure head and soil water content respectively and ε ψ l and ε θ l 3 l 3 convergence tolerances for pressure head and soil water content respectively n is the time step and m is the iteration the performance of iterative solver to obtain more smooth convergence can be boosted by means of under relaxation or divergence controlling techniques to this end the adaptive under relaxation coefficient of durbin and delemos 2007 was employed in the improved form as follows 12 φ φ m i n φ m a x φ m i n e x p ω δ ψ ε ψ δ ψ ε ψ φ m a x δ ψ ε ψ where φ min and φ max are the minimum and maximum values of under relaxation coefficient ω is a shape factor controlling the falling rate of under relaxation factor if φ max 1 the model prevents under relaxed scheme when approaching convergence which was the approach employed by durbin and delemos 2007 using eq 12 the under relaxation factor is scaled to φ min as the error increases the rationale behind choosing δ ψ not δ θ is that the modified picard scheme of celia et al 1990 chosen to solve richards equation in both ebman and ebman hp uses pressure head as primary variable in the iterative process on the other hand zha et al 2017 presented an algorithm to help model avoid divergence when dry soil is exposed to a constant flux inflow they showed that when pressure head jumps from a dry state determined by ψ dry and was defined as the pressure head whose corresponding water capacity value is between 10 3 10 5 m 1 to wet state determined by ψ wet which was defined as the pressure head whose corresponding water capacity value is half of the maximum value in two adjacent iterations the iterative process is very likely to diverge zha et al 2017 presented a simple algorithm that takes the jumped pressure head back to the vicinity of its preceding location however their algorithm was examined for non hysteretic water retention curves in order to improve zha et al 2017 s algorithm to account for hysteretic water retention curve of parker and lenhard 1987 i e eq 7 taylor series for s n m should be expanded as follows 13 s n m s n m 1 s θ n m 1 θ ψ n m 1 ψ n m ψ n m 1 considering eqs 7 9 eq 13 is transformed to the following form 14 s n m s n m 1 sf l l 1 s p ψ c w n m 1 ψ n m ψ n m 1 subsequently the pressure head can be calculated using the inverse of water retention function derived from eq 7 as follows 15 ψ s 1 α p s s l 1 sf l l 1 s p ψ l 1 1 ϕ p 1 1 λ p 2 5 coupling procedure of supply tank flood floor and richards equation ebman was only focused on the simulation of cultivation pots and the whole subirrigation system consisting of supplying tank and flood floor were neglected however from the irrigation scheduling viewpoint considering the interactions of other parts of subirrigation system with cultivation pots can help better understand the dynamics of the whole system moreover monitoring water depth or solution concentration at the supply tank is easier comparing to the soil water content and solute concentration for verification validation or real time management purposes therefore ebman hp involves an integrated system of equations for supply tank flood floor and cultivation pots to capture more realistic view of ebb and flow irrigation system the underlying assumption of the coupled system of the aforementioned equations is as follows 1 the water released from the supply tank to the flood floor at the beginning of the flooding phase and from the flood floor to the supply tank at the drainage phase was assumed to be instantaneous since water depth in the ebb and flow irrigation system is not high no more than a few millimeters and furthermore water is mainly pumped with a considerable rate to the floor or bench the water release time can be neglected 2 the evaporation of the released pond on the floor was not calculated directly but embedded inside a water loss coefficient the ponding phase of the ebb and flow irrigation system is very short about 15 20 min and furthermore the ebb and flow irrigation system is commonly used inside greenhouse where temperature and humidity is controlled by monitoring systems therefore the evaporated water at the ponding phase is negligible 3 the effluent from the substrates cultivation pots at the drainage phase does not return back to the supply tank but extracted from the system except for the a few millimeters of pots that are submerged in the flooding phase the rest of the substrates is unlikely to be satiated therefore a very small amount of water and solutes is leaked out of pots at the drainage phase 4 at the ponding phase water does not leak back from pots to the floor since ebb and flow irrigation system is triggered when the pots are relatively dry it is expected that water movement is governed by soil water matric potential gradient which is mostly in upward direction 5 the floors and benches of ebb and flow irrigation system are inundated in a relatively short time and at the ponding phase water is kept almost stationary moreover ponded water is relatively shallow therefore it can be assumed that at the ponding phase water in the flood floor does not flow laterally and the water pressure is at static vertical distribution fig 1 illustrates the coupling procedure for three main components of flooded bench and flood floor ebb and flow irrigation system the water inflow and outflow from the supply tank into the flooded floor and in turn into the pots is controlled by two prescribed triggering ψ trig l or θ trig l 3 l 3 and cutoff ψ cut l or θ cut l 3 l 3 thresholds for pressure head or water content the pressure head thresholds i e ψ trig and ψ cut can be monitored by tensiometer cormier et al 2020 while medium moisture thresholds i e θ trig and θ cut can be measured by water content sensors ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017 the triggering and cutoff thresholds can be defined as the average of sensor readings installed at different pots or a single optimal pot ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c naghedifar et al 2020 according to the ebman hp s algorithm water from supply tank is released to the floor or bench when the predefined triggering threshold is reached in the monitored pot s and the system switches off when either the cutoff water content pressure head is reached or the ponding phase lasted more than a predefined period of time t cut t in the automated irrigation scheduling the system may experience frequent unwanted triggering events that imposes unscheduled energy consumption therefore a maximum irrigation frequency value f max t 1 can be defined to have both on demand predetermined interval irrigation scheduling setting a large value for f max can yield pure on demand scheduling while by setting triggering values lower larger absolute values than h crit l a predefined minimum value of pressure head at medium surface which is commonly set as the pressure head of air dried medium ebman hp switches to pure predetermined interval scheduling h crit l is the pressure head equivalent to the water content of the air dried substrate defined in atmospheric boundary condition when the system triggers an irrigation event depending on the water remained in the supply tank at the previous time step v st n 1 either the full water requirement v req l 3 or the whole remained water is depleted from the supply tank the former occurs providing v req v st n 1 and the latter occurs when there is not enough water to fulfill the water requirement therefore the volume of released water i e v re l 3 can be formulated as follows 16 v re v r e q v r e q v s t n 1 v s t n 1 v r e q v s t n 1 the volume of required water v req l 3 at each irrigation interval is set for ebman hp as an input using the geometry of the flood floor bench 17 v req l f w f 2 h e w f s f 2 where the parameters l f l w f l and s f define the geometry of the flood floor as defined in fig 1 and h e is the depth of water at the edge position of the flooded floor for flooded benches s f 0 in eq 17 the water head at the center position of the flooded floor h c l as a function of volume of released water can be calculated as follows 18 h c v r e w f l f w f s f 2 v r e 0 5 w f 2 s f l f 2 v r e s f l f v r e 0 5 w f 2 s f l f this equation assumes a trapezoidal prism for the shape of ponded water at full inundation i e h e 0 and a triangular prism at the partial inundation note that for the flooded bench assuming s f 0 only the first condition of eq 18 is used since the second condition of the equation results in trivial values using assumption 5 the water head at each point of the flooded floor h d l can be immediately calculated as follows 19 h d max h c z f 0 0 max h c y s f 0 0 where z f l is the elevation of flood floor at each point from the base line i e the baseline can be assumed as the elevation of center position and y is the cartesian coordinate shown in fig 1 during flooding phase the pots absorb the ponded water on the flooded floor or bench and at each time step the change of water content in all pots i e θ l 3 is calculated as follows 20 θ n i 1 n p i j 1 n p j k 1 k max a i j k θ i j k n θ i j k n 1 δ z i j k where δ z l is the vertical dimension of each control volume in each pot a l 2 is the average cross sectional surface of pots at each control volume n p i is number of pots in x direction and n p j is the number of pots in y direction the advantage of eq 20 is that it can involve different shapes of pots the water content at each time level is obtained by solving richards equation for each pot separately considering the water depth at each location on the flood floor in order to enhance the efficiency of model the richards equation for all pots was solved in parallel using openmp which is described in the upcoming section when the system switches off the remained water in the floor or bench flows back to the supply tank however in practice the supply tank does not receive the ponded water completely and a fraction should be considered as water loss η at this moment the volume of water inside supply tank at the end of time step v st n l 3 is equal to the sum of released water and the remained water inside supply tank at the previous time step considering water loss in the flood floor bench and the change of water content in all pots during that time step 21 v st n v st n 1 1 η v re θ n noteworthy h d v re 0 when the irrigation system is off and when the supply tank is empty it is refilled to the full capacity 2 6 parallel programming using openmp since ebb and flow subirrigation system applies iterative scheme on several pots the solution scheme may be inefficient in serial mode the prevailing code i e ebman hp employs parallel programming to improve the efficiency of model in this study the parallel programming is fulfilled via openmp openmp is a standard parallelization tool for the shared memory platforms afzal et al 2017 openmp is preferred to message passing interface mpi as it requires minimal changes to the serial version of the program and it is easy to implement leandro et al 2014 ebman hp solves a separate richards equation for each pot using implicit scheme by means of parallel programming this model aims to improve efficiency of the calculations using openmp directives the performance of model can be boosted provided that the proposed scheme suits the nature of the ebb and flow subirrigation system to the experience of the authors there were two strategies for parallelization of the ebb and flow subirrigation system first to solve several independent richards equations simultaneously i e the compiler runs the code blocks of the richards equation including linearization calculations of hysteresis module matrix storage and the solver for system of linear equations for each pot serially using an independent processor therefore computational steps of each pot runs in parallel to the other pots second to mix the code blocks for all pots and running each block in parallel this approach results in a large system of equations consisting of the nodes of all pots that can be solved using a parallel tdma solver the former is prone to several pitfalls in openmp large do loops are hard to handle and susceptible of false sharing on the other hand pots locating at the edge position of ebb and flow irrigation receive less irrigation depth compared to those at the center position therefore the differently positioned pots are likely to require different number of iterations at a particular time step considering the fact that at each time step the reservoir equation should be updated after all richards equations took one step forward the aforementioned heterogeneous share of work for each processor may impose latency on the solution of richards equations in other words the delay of the slowest processor slows down the performance of all processors therefore the ebman hp model is established based on the latter approach of parallelization one of the time consuming components of the selected parallelization scheme is the iterative solver for system of equations as mentioned the iterative tdma solver of the presented model should be employed frequently at each time step in order to accelerate the tdma solver an algorithm is proposed that breaks the large system of equations into several smaller system of equations the small systems of equations are solved simultaneously using openmp directives fig 2 shows the idea behind the parallel tdma solver employed in this study as shown the large system of equations a k max p max k max p max x k max p max 1 b k max p max 1 where a is the matrix of coefficients x is the matrix of unknowns and b is the right hand side matrix k max is the number of computational nodes for each cultivation pot and p max is the total number of pots is composed of p max independent elements each can be solved independently in a small system of equations shown by j in fig 2 below each j represents the system of equations for solving richards equation of one pot it is also possible to divide the large system of equations into groups of j s and call each group a solpor i e solver portion in fig 2 below each group or solpor includes two j s hence solpo r 1 involves j 1 and j 2 solpo r 2 involves j 3 and j 4 and solpo r n involves j 2 n 1 and j 2 n in general each solpor may include an arbitrary number of j s hereinafter called n j provided that p max is divisible by n j the large system of equations is broken into solpo r max small systems of equations of form a k max n j k max n j x k max n j 1 b k max n j 1 each small system of equations can be solved separately by a processor in parallel and independent of other small systems to this end an openmp do loop directive with dynamic schedule clause is used to solve all small systems concurrently the rationale behind choosing dynamic clause is that this clause makes a sequence of processes or so called chunks mattson et al 2019 and the chunks are placed in a queue the processors take one or more chunk s at each turn as the computational task for a processor is accomplished the idle processor goes to the queue to take another chunk therefore the solver suits both clusters in which there may exist a number of processors with different processing speed and personal laptops with a few processors while having the same speed 2 7 statistical indices for model evaluation the accuracy of model is evaluated using three statistical indices namely rmse root mean squared error mae mean absolute error and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency which are defined as follows 22 rmse 1 n max n 1 n max x sim x ref n 2 23 mae 1 n max n 1 n max x sim x ref n 24 nse 1 n 1 n max x sim x ref n 2 n 1 n max x obs x ref n 2 where x sim is the simulated value x ref is the reference value i e analytical solution or measured value x ref is the average of reference values additionally another parameter was considered to examine the ability of model to conserve the continuity of mass in the solution domain during the simulation time i e mass balance mb as follows šimůnek et al 2018 25 mb t 100 v k t v k 0 0 t q sub w dt 0 t q topbc q botbc dt 100 max k 1 k max v k t v k 0 0 t q sub w dt 0 t q topbc q botbc dt where v k 0 and v k t is the volume of water at the beginning and at an arbitrary time for the kth control volume respectively q topbc and q botbc are the water flux across the top and bottom boundaries respectively mb can be reported as an integrated value at the final time step by calculating the total flux into out of the domain as well as the total mass added to exploited from the domain from the beginning up to nth time step an et al 2010 naghedifar et al 2019 eq 25 was used in the well known software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018 in section 3 4 the mb of the presented model is compared to hydrus 1d finally amdahl s law was employed to examine the maximum possible speedup s am concerning parallel computing this index yields the potential speedup can be achieved providing a proportion of the program remains serial α s and the program is run by n p processors amdahl s law can be shown as follows mattson et al 2019 26 s am t s t p 1 α s 1 α s n p where t s is the time of running the program in serial mode and t p is the time of running the program in ideally parallelized mode the actual speedup the ratio of the execution time by serial mode to actual parallel mode can be presented in the dimensionless form using amdahl s law herein the ratio of the actual speedup to s am that is equivalent to the ideally parallelized execution time to the actual parallel mode is termed normalized speedup the above mentioned indices can help evaluate ebman hp model in terms of accuracy with respect to reference values such as analytical solutions or measured data i e rmse mae and nse stability i e mb and speedup i e sam 2 8 model evaluation in order to ensure the performance of different components of ebman hp it has been verified and validated against several test cases model evaluation test cases involve validation of ebman hp with analytical solution as well as hydrus 1d furthermore the performance of model is investigated in terms of speed and elimination of artificial pumping error the constant parameters of the parker and lenhard 1987 s water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of van genuchten 1980 are presented in table 1 all execution times and speedup tests in this study was conducted on an intel coretm i7 cpu x980 with speed of 3 3 ghz and installed memory of 12 gb with windows 7 enterprise operating system all codes were developed in fortran programming language 2 8 1 verification the capability of model to eliminate artificial pumping error the main objective of this section is examination of hysteretic water retention modules of ebman hp to eliminate artificial pumping error in consecutive drying wetting loops to this end two patterns of dampening and heightening amplitude cosine waves are considered for the matric pressure head as input and the resulting effective saturation has been monitored these patterns may imply infiltration and redistribution under periodic irrigation werner and lockington 2006 two media were involved in this section medium no 1 and 2 in table 1 the cosine waves of pressure head were continued for more than 6000 time steps for each soil that yielded about 25 and 28 loops for medium no 1 and 2 respectively it should be noted that since high order 3 scanning curves are weakly hysteretic they are commonly considered as non hysteretic werner and lockington 2006 however in this section the scanning curves whose order are higher than 100 are considered as non hysteretic to allow model simulate all cycles 2 8 2 validation simulation of hysteretic loops with primary drying and wetting scanning curves in order to validate the hysteretic water retention curve module of ebman hp the experimental data of huang et al 2005 have been employed as a validation benchmark huang et al 2005 provided two sets of data regarding scanning curves beginning with primary wetting i e departed from main drying curve and primary drying i e departed from main wetting curve scanning curves medium no 3 table 1 the constant parameters of main drying and wetting curves were obtained by fitting eq 2 on the measured data of huang et al 2005 using retc van genuchten et al 1991 subsequently the scanning curves were simulated by the hysteretic modules of ebman hp using eq 8 both experiments involve three successive scanning curves that the first two of which make a closed loop and the last curve continues beyond the close loop to near saturation fig 4 a and near dry fig 4 b water contents 2 8 3 validation and application comparison with an analytical steady solution to examine the performance of parallel tdma solver the objective of this section is not only validating the results of ebman hp with an analytical solution but to assess the performance of parallel tdma solver considering its boundary conditions the analytical solution employed in this section is analogous to the nature of ebb and flow irrigation system yuan and lu 2005 presented an analytical solution for both steady state and transient conditions influenced by 1d root water uptake from a soil block whose lower boundary restricted by constant head dirichlet type condition and is exposed to a constant flux neumann type at the top boundary the solutions presented by yuan and lu 2005 have made a basis for the solutions of feng et al 2019 the root can be expanded into the soil with different shapes i e different root density functions including uniform stepwise and exponential functions herein the root density distribution is assumed to be exponential shaped whose root water uptake function was defined by yuan and lu 2005 as 27 q sub w q sub w 0 exp β r z l t where q sub w 0 is the maximum uptake at the soil surface t 1 and β r is the distribution constant showing the rate of reduction in root uptake l 1 the solutions of yuan and lu 2005 were presented in terms of matric flux potential φ l which is defined as follows suk and park 2019 28 φ z ψ k ψ d ψ k ψ α g where α g is the gardner s constant parameter the second equity is obtained providing that hydraulic conductivity is defined by the gardner s exponential function gardner 1958 the gardner s constitutive relationships describe soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as follows 29 s θ ψ θ r θ s θ r exp α g ψ 30 k ψ k s exp α g ψ the analytical solution for the steady state under the assumption that an exponential root water uptake function extracts water from the soil block eq 27 was obtained by yuan and lu 2005 as follows 31 φ z k s α g exp α g ψ bc z q sub w 0 α g exp α g z 1 q sub w 0 α g β r exp β r z l t exp α g z β r l t exp α g z 1 q sub w 0 α g α g β r exp β r z l t inspired from the flooded floor ebb and flow irrigation system the bottom boundary involves ponded pots in addition to the pots with lower boundary at the unsaturated state hence the lower boundary condition changes between 0 1 and 0 1 m fig 5 a a constant flux of 1 mm hr was applied at the upper boundary of the 1 m deep soil block and the total number of computational nodes was assumed to be 200 in all pots maximum uptake at the soil surface was considered to be q sub w 0 1 mm hr and distribution constant β r 6 m 1 after validation this test case was used to assess the performance of tdma solver in terms of number of processors therefore although the steady state solution was obtained after a few iterations the iterative process was continued for 1 10 6 iterations to reach a comprehensive view of the performance of parallel tdma solver a variety of values for p max 16 32 64 128 256 and solpor were examined solpor values were defined such that they are divisible to p max as follows 32 solpo r i i 1 1 log 2 p max 2 i 1 i z the above mentioned cases were run by ebman hp model and the performance was investigated by increasing the number of processors 2 8 4 validation and application comparison of model s speed and accuracy with hydrus 1d in this section the performance of the ebman hp is compared with hydrus 1d a well known numerical model for simulation of variably saturated flow šimůnek et al 2018 hydrus 1d has been verified through a number of on field in lab measurements turco et al 2017 er raki et al 2021 and analytical solutions zlotnik et al 2007 this model can simulate the hysteretic water flow using parker and lenhard 1987 functions hydrus 1d is limited to simulation of only one computational domain at a time and consequently cannot be used for verification of all capabilities of ebman hp such as running multiple pots or simulation of variations of water inside supply tank and on the ebb and flow flood floor bench considering these facts the main objective of this section is to assess the accuracy and speed of all sections of the ebman hp code except tdma solver which was run in the previous section to run a hysteretic problem over a long time two different soil textures have been considered in this section avondale clay loam soil texture rudiyanto et al 2020 and medium sand texture zhai et al 2020 to represent fine and coarse textured soils respectively the hydraulic and hysteretic characteristics of the soils are presented in table 1 medium no 5 and 6 respectively to compare the performance of the model a single soil block of 1 m depth is considered whose bottom boundary is constrained with constant pressure head and its top boundary is governed by a variable pressure head i e ψ topbc t the general formulation of the variable pressure head for the two test cases were defined as follows 33 ψ topbc t max e μ t a m cos π t 86400 t ψ 0 ψ 0 where μ t 1 is the damping coefficient a m l is the amplitude of the waves t t is the period of the function ψ 0 l is the intercept and ψ 0 l is a threshold for pressure head the total simulation time was assumed to be 100 days ε ψ 1 10 3 m and ε θ 1 10 3 and time step 0 05 s t 60 s to obtain a comprehensive comparison between ebman hp and hydrus 1d twelve numerical experiments were implemented that involved different grid densities i e 100 200 300 400 600 800 nodes different variable pressure head boundary conditions and soil types table 2 2 8 5 application performance of ebman hp model for simulation of flood floor subirrigation system in this section different capabilities of ebman hp have been examined through a complete simulation test case in this test case a sensor based flood floor ebb and flow subirrigation system has been simulated for cultivation of strawberry the flood floor is 10 m long and 8 m wide with slope of 0 02 the size of the floor suggested by lumis et al 2000 was 5 m 9 m however in this section a larger floor was considered so that more number of pots can be positioned on the floor to make better perspective of the model s performance a cylindrical tank with 0 4 m radius and 1 5 m height supplied water to the concrete flood floor the pots were also assumed to be cylindrical with 10 cm radius and 30 cm height the pots were filled by peat substrate medium no 7 in table 1 whose hydraulic properties proposed by cormier et al 2020 cormier et al 2020 employed this substrate for cultivation of strawberry thirty two pots were positioned along the width of the flood floor and forty pots along the length of the flood floor the irrigation is triggered when the pressure head of the substrate is about 15 cm at the location of sensor and the flooding phase is terminated when the substrate at the same location experiences a pressure head of 10 cm the close triggering termination criteria is due to the steep slope of the water retention curve for the peat which can be recognized through the high values of α w and α d table 1 the water content sensor is assumed to be installed into the pot positioned at the center of the floor following fig 1 c of ferrarezi et al 2015a 2015b 2015c the sensor is installed horizontally at the bottom of the aforementioned pot along with the water content based trigger termination criteria temporal thresholds were also assumed at each event providing water content did not reach the termination criteria flooding phase stops after 15 min anlauf and rehrmann 2013 furthermore to avoid unwanted successive irrigation events the irrigation cannot be triggered sooner than 24 hr from the previous event at each irrigation event 224 l water is released on the flood floor to inundate the flood floor the total simulation time was 70 days the variations of potential evaporation and transpiration is presented in fig 10 the plant root is totally expanded in pots to the depth of 30 cm eq 6 and its stress function parameters are presented in table 4 3 results the water flow solute transport root water and nutrient uptake modules of ebman were validated against analytical solutions in lab measurements as well as the results obtained by the well established models naghedifar et al 2020 the validation test cases approved the accuracy of model since ebman was only presented for soil cultures and it was developed in serial mode in the following verification and validation sections are focused on hysteretic module and parallel mode 3 1 verification the capability of model to eliminate artificial pumping error fig 3 a and c illustrate the variations of pressure head imposed as input to the water retention modules of ebman hp to form hysteretic loops the equations of the cosine pressure head waves are also presented in fig 3 a and c the parameters of the equations are chosen such that high frequency waves are obtained as inputs this type of waves will examine the hysteretic water retention modules under a condition susceptible of artificial pumping error fig 3 b and d demonstrates the closed loops of scanning curves for both soil textures under variations of pressure head to ensure that model does not suffer from artificial pumping error a zoom in view has been also presented in fig 3 b and d as shown the closure of loops eliminates artificial pumping error and the scanning curves does not deviate from the main drying wetting curves 3 2 validation simulation of hysteretic loops with primary drying and wetting scanning curves in fig 4 a the simulation starts from the main drying curve and continues towards the first reversal point at this point the primary wetting scanning curve departs towards the saturation point in the meanwhile the primary scanning curve is truncated by a reversal point the resulted drying scanning curve is again truncated by an intermediate reversal point that provides a closed loop with the preceding scanning curve this is due to the fact that no more truncation happens at the wetting scanning curve and the soil water content pressure head curve goes beyond the preceding reversal point the last scanning wetting curve is not defined beyond the reversal point and hence it joins the primary wetting curve at the rest of the wetting path the same trend occurs in fig 4 b for the hysteretic experiment initiated from the main wetting the primary drying scanning curve departs from the main wetting curve the next two scanning curves make a closed loop since the hysteretic curve goes beyond the pressure head of the latest reversal point it passes through this point to join the primary drying curve as shown in fig 4 both hysteretic scanning curves were simulated accurately with nse 0 94 showing the capability of model to simulate the hysteresis process in wide range of pressure heads 3 3 validation and application comparison with an analytical steady solution to examine the performance of parallel tdma solver as mentioned the objective of this section is to assess the parallel tdma solver hence the steady state solution has been chosen so that the computational cost for the other calculation procedures such as updating soil hydraulic properties and matrix storage approaches to minima noteworthy the analytical solution of yuan and lu 2005 does not involve hysteresis therefore in this section it has been assumed that the soil water variations only follow main drying or wetting curve the proposed analytical solution is incorporated in a numerical experiment describing a wide range of bottom boundary conditions fig 5 b compares the results of simulation of the test case obtained by the model with analytical solution the error indices suggest that the simulations are in perfect agreement with the analytical solution at different lower boundary conditions in all numerical experiments in this section more than 99 65 of the execution time was devoted to the parallel tdma solver fig 6 describes the influence of number of processors solpor and the number of pots i e size of the problem on the execution time of the simulations in fig 7 the influence of the same parameters is shown on the normalized speedup in the serial mode shown in fig 6a e in dark blue by increasing number of solpor s the execution time is not reduced this is attributed to the fact that the chunks of dynamic schedule clause are only passed to the master thread and no slave thread is defined in this mode therefore the workshares are queued to be performed by only one thread and breaking the system of linear equations into several chunks while they are not computed simultaneously does not accelerate the calculations on the other hand when increasing the number of processors but employing only a single solpor the execution time is not reduced since the parallel tdma solver is unable to share the chunks of schedule clause to the involved threads in other words although there exist several slave threads they all fight over one piece of work the winner takes the workshare and the other processors are detained up to the time it accomplishes the task however when solpor is increased to two with two processors the execution time decreases to almost half in parallel mode note that in fig 6 z axis have been presented in logarithmic scale with normalized speedup of about 100 fig 7a e which is equivalent to maximum possible speedup determined by amdahl s law this trend can be observed free from p max however by increasing the number of solpor s with two processors no significant change in execution time and normalized speedup is obtained for all p max the purple bars in fig 7a e and fig 6a e similar to the serial mode by increasing the number of solpor s the two processors are overloaded by several workshares therefore breaking the chunks into smaller pieces does not help improve the efficiency of the scheme this result was predictable because when maximum possible normalized speedup obtained by two solpor s no more improvements could be reached by two processors the scalability of model can be shown more considerably by enhancing the number of processors involved in the parallel solver this is because when the number of processors are increased the parallel do loop outperforms by receiving more chunks at the same time generally in all cases of p max by increasing number of processors and solpor s the execution time shows a decreasing trend while normalized speedup approaches to its maximum value in other words referring to amdahl s law by involving more processors there is more potential for reducing execution time however this is the number of solpor s that helps parallel tdma solver achieve maximum possible speedup for instance using 3 and 4 processors normalized speedup could reach 97 5 and 93 2 respectively fig 7a e for the largest system of equations p max 256 moreover it is observed that the performance of the parallel tdma solver increases in the large system of equations in all cases the best overall normalized speedup has been obtained in the largest system of equations p max 256 or p max 128 e g in fig 7 e there exists a few anomalies in the results i e increasing number of solpor s when using a specific number of processors does not help the solver s speedup or it slightly deteriorates its performance this observations can be attributed to the false sharing of the computational tasks over the involved processors which is inherent in a parallel code 3 4 validation and application comparison of model s speed and accuracy with hydrus 1d as mentioned earlier in this section ebman hp is compared with the well known code hydrus 1d whose performance have been examined in several papers šimůnek et al 2008 to ensure about the accuracy of ebman hp the variations of soil pressure head soil water content and effective saturation at different depths of the soil block is compared with those obtained by hydrus 1d fig 8 fig 8 clarifies that the results of the models are in perfect agreement in all soil layers noteworthy fig 8 illustrates the results in serial mode rmse mae and nse of ebman hp for all grid densities in serial mode are presented in table 3 table 3 also compares the execution time relative iterations the ratio of the total iterations for ebman hp to that of hydrus 1d and mb of ebman hp and hydrus 1d for the twelve numerical tests from the standpoint of models speed ebman hp performed better than hydrus 1d in almost all cases and only for dense grid 800 nodes of the medium sand hydrus 1d has performed better comparing to ebman hp in the case of avondale clay loam the models speed approached to each other while the grid became dense it should be noted that ebman hp is mainly designed to simulate water flow within small scale domains i e ebb and flow subirrigation pots and the grid density required for this domain does not exceed a few hundred nodes for which ebman hp performed better than hydrus 1d in all cases the rationale behind higher speed of the ebman hp can be attributed to the number of iterations table 3 as shown in all cases the total number of iterations for ebman hp is less than 76 of hydrus 1d for the cases ebman hp s iterations are less than 65 of hydrus 1d it performs faster to observe the ability of ebman hp model to preserve continuity of mass mb of the models has been also compared in table 3 it can be concluded that hydrus 1d preserves perfect mass balance in all cases mb of ebman hp is very close to that of hydrus 1d and about 0 2 error was reported at maximum finally rmse mae and nse of ebman hp s results for water content and effective saturation shows that in all cases the model has perfect agreement with hydrus 1d with nse between 0 999 and 1 000 rmse of 0 0003 0 0006 c m 3 c m 3 for avondale clay loam and 0 0003 0 0015 for medium sand and mae of 0 0012 0 0026 c m 3 c m 3 for avondale clay loam and 0 0011 0 0057 for medium sand subsequent to the serial mode ebman hp was run through the parallel mode the models performance have been compared in fig 9 it can be observed that in all grid densities by adding number of processors ebman hp model results in much lower simulation time fig 9 proves the scalability of different sections of ebman hp code by increasing number of processors the important point is that ebman hp s scalability is more distinguished by increasing number of nodes the execution time for simulation of water flow within avondale clay loam discretized by 100 nodes is 13 01 s and 4 61 s when using single and six processors respectively which represents a ratio the ratio of execution time for serial run to that of parallel run with six processors by ebman hp of about 2 82 the same values for medium sand are 13 70 s 4 85 s and 2 82 respectively however when the number of nodes increased to 800 the execution time for avondale clay loam at the serial and 6 processor modes are 165 88 s and 37 78 s which yields a ratio of 4 39 while the same values for medium sand are 202 75 s 52 44 s and 3 87 these results clarify that the model s scalability is more considerable at the dense domains while bringing enough efficiency at the sparse domains 3 5 application performance of ebman hp model for simulation of flood floor subirrigation system the information mentioned in section 2 8 4 were introduced to ebman hp to involve almost all capabilities of the model the variations of soil water pressure head and water content at the location of water content sensor can be observed in fig 11 a and b as shown in fig 11 a 43 irrigation events have been occurred during the simulation period the water content sensor triggers irrigation as the pressure head achieves the triggering threshold however considering the location of the sensor water content exceeds the termination threshold excluding a warmup period of about 48 hr these pressure head thresholds keep the water content of the substrate between 55 and 72 with time averaged water content of about 57 on the other hand fig 11 c shows the variations of volume of water in the storage tank in high and low resolution outputs the high resolution output presents details of variations of volume of water at the storage tank including the drop of the volume of water at the triggering time and during the flooding phase as well as the increasing step of the volume at the termination time when water drains back from the flooded floor to the storage tank the details of a flooding drainage phase of the ebb and flow subirrigation system have been shown in the a b zoom in view of fig 11 c as shown the 224 l of the water released to the flooded floor and 166 l of which returned back to the storage tank after termination time due to the decline of the water in the storage tank it required to be refilled twice during total 70 days after about 20 5 and 58 3 days the volume of water at the supply tank dropped below the 224 l required at each irrigation event therefore the volume of water applied to the flooded floor was less than the required water at these two times the applied water was 212 l and 207 l respectively it is observed that during the simulation period system triggers at the prescribed triggering threshold i e 0 15 m however after the second refilling pressure head at the triggering time drops below the triggering threshold at this period of time the irrigation events were not able to fulfill water requirements and therefore the system triggered once a day the denser irrigation events allowed by irrigation scheduling described above the rationale behind it can be explained by focusing on the potential evaporation and potential transpiration rates shown in fig 10 b and c in these zoom in views it can be observed that the first refill occurs when the potential evaporation and potential transpiration are on the falling limb and consequently the deficit in volume of water applied to the flood floor does not influence the triggering pressure head however at the second refilling time the potential evaporation and potential transpiration were on the rising limb and it amplified the effect of water deficit in the pots finally the test case was run in both serial and parallel modes and the results were illustrated in fig 12 the results clarify that less than 6 of the execution time is spent at the serial sections of the code moreover it can be referred that model keeps the execution time at the ideal point up to 4 processors and it could accelerate the execution time up to about 400 using 6 processors while equivalent amdahl s speedup was 460 4 discussion ebman hp is a physically based numerical model for simulation of all major components of ebb and flow subirrigation system employing hysteretic water flow and openmp directives due to the high difference between the water contents of main wetting and drying curves involving hysteretic water content functions has been proved to be necessary by the experimental investigations of water flow within horticultural substrates anlauf and rehrmann 2012 furthermore numerical investigations of arrey et al 2018 have clarified that even though hysteresis can be ignored in large scale studies over a catchment with the soil textures of the similar classes its role is of high importance in the case of water movement within stratified soil profiles however as suggested by anlauf et al 2016 the heterogeneity of the horticultural substrates in the pots is likely to be inconsiderable therefore in the validation verification test cases the substrate inside pots was always assumed to be homogeneous according to the experimental measurements of wen et al 2020 the size of the hysteretic loops after 4 or 5 drying wetting cycles becomes unchanged however as shown in section 3 1 of the current study the non hysteretic cycle depends on the constant parameters of the pressure head waves not he number of wetting drying cycles fig 3a and c on the other hand kargas et al 2021 verified the implications of including hysteresis in light of different boundary conditions kargas et al 2021 reported that during the evaporation or infiltration hysteresis is not necessary to be taken into account since the water content experiences a monotonic decrease or increase at the boundary respectively however when an atmospheric or a periodic boundary condition is set at the boundary the influence of hysteresis is highlighted on water movement within the porous media the latter atmospheric and periodic boundary conditions is the case for the boundary conditions of the pots in ebb and flow subirrigation system therefore the capability of model to handle atmospheric and periodic boundary conditions was examined in the sections 3 1 3 4 and 3 5 kargas et al 2021 also proved that the redistribution phase is delayed by hysteresis since the soil pressure head gradient becomes zero right after the end of infiltration furthermore it was mentioned that hysteresis controls the availability of water for plants that directly affects the plant growth and stresses model s speedup was the second issue addressed by means of openmp directives in the prevailing study in several studies solution scheme of multi dimensional richards equation has been boosted by parallel programming orgogozo 2015 2022 however to the best of the authors knowledge the presented parallel schemes are developed for non hysteretic richards equation the scheme of egidi et al 2020 was proposed for solving three dimensional richards equation this scheme was claimed to be adaptable to the parallel programming simulations of egidi et al 2020 by means of intel core i7 3 4 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram showed that the model could accelerate the procedure for 5 32 times with 8 threads comparing to serial run for a landslide hazard evaluation on a geographical area consisting of sandy soil texture in this study openmp directives were used for parallelization of the model the richardsfoam presented by orgogozo et al 2014 respectively obtained up to 90 efficiency using 1024 processors for watershed modeling two more versions of this code were presented afterwards named richardsfoam2 and 3 orgogozo 2015 2022 finally opencal was presented by de rango et al 2021 which was used to solve three dimensional richards equation using openmp the other models such as those of hwang et al 2014 and wu et al 2021 among others have developed for modeling non hysteretic coupled overland subsurface water flow 5 conclusions in this study a physically based model was presented for simulation of flood floor bench ebb and flow subirrigation system by which every major component of the system can be simulated including the variations of water depth inside inclined flat flood floor bench and also water head fluctuations inside water tank along with the components of the system all phases of irrigation including flooding and drainage phases can be described by model model benefits from the hysteretic constitutive relationships which has been reported to be necessary for simulation of water movement within horticultural substrates furthermore the model s performance was improved by means openmp directives through which a parallel numerical scheme to solve richards equation and a novel scalable tdma solver have been developed the examination of model s performance showed that the hysteretic water retention module can eliminate artificial pumping error and the scanning curves can be simulated with high accuracy in wide range of pressure heads nse 0 94 from the standpoint of model s speedup it was clarified that ebman hp could run faster than hydrus 1d in both serial mode at the scale of a few hundred nodes and much faster in parallel mode with all examined grid densities ebman hp could reach about 45 and 600 less execution times in serial and parallel modes using 6 processors respectively relative to hydrus 1d it was also shown that the idea behind breaking the large system of equations into simultaneously solved smaller systems was of high efficiency to speed up the tdma solver it was concluded that by increasing the number of processors and solpor s the tdma solver shows a improving trend in the execution time and normalized speedup finally ebman hp was employed to run a comprehensive illustrative example in which flood floor under sensor based subirrigation system was simulated in which different capabilities of model were challenged it was shown that the model s speed up could reach between 84 and 100 of maximum possible speedup suggested by amdahl s law therefore the above mentioned examinations proved the scalability of ebman hp solution scheme this paper was focused on the numerical development of the model and its applications using in lab or in situ measurements remains a topic of ongoing research other types of root water uptake modules including root architecture models can be investigated in the future studies the presented model provides a tool for design and assessment of greenhouse irrigation systems and encourages the involvement of openmp directives to increase the efficiency of codes developed for simulation of ebb and flow subirrigation systems this model can also be embedded in a data assimilation system or can be used for training of neural network for online smart irrigation scheduling declaration of competing
