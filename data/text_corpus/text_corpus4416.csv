22080,wave driven flow over the reef flat plays an essential role in shaping the morphology of coral reefs whose biological ecological and geological processes are significantly affected by the water exchange between the open sea and the reef flat in this study detailed flow measurements are conducted to investigate the vertical flow structure in the surf zone associated with a plunging breaker over an idealized fringing reef profile with and without a reef crest a two dimensional vertical 2dv numerical wave tank which solves the navier stokes equations with a buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence closure is developed to reproduce the laboratory experiments the free surface is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method laboratory measurements of the waves and the flows are used to validate the numerical model the model is then applied to examine the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone the results suggest that the reef crest causes strong reverse mean flow in the vicinity of the reef edge and it also blocks the flow leeside of the crest the cross shore radiation stress in the reef surf zone is consistently larger than that predicted by the linear wave theory keywords wave driven current undertow surf zone navier stokes equations fringing reef 1 introduction wave breaking over coral reefs parallels that on sandy or muddy beaches but reef profiles are significantly different from beaches in some aspects as steep fore reef slope normally it is steeper than 1 20 and horizontal reef flat hence there is no swash zone incident waves break around the reef edge dissipating a large portion of energy and causing an increase of mean water level known as wave induced setup a mechanism described firstly by munk and sargent 1948 for a barrier reef separated from the mainland or island by a deep lagoon wave setup is able to drive a cross shore current on the reef flat and an alongshore current in the lagoon the current eventually exits the lagoon through rip channels connecting the lagoon with the open sea resulting in a horizontally two dimensional 2dh circulation in the reef lagoon channel system hearn 1999 for a fringing reef attached directly to the coastal landmass the water exchange with the surrounding ocean is significantly restricted by friction through narrow rough and sometimes tortuous channels lowe et al 2009a thus wave driven current may sometimes return offshore though the undertow current e g vetter et al 2010 activities of flows associated with ocean waves over coral reefs have profound biological ecological and geomorphic implications for example wave driven current has significant impact on the nearshore circulations thus the transport of organisms nutrients and larval corals hench et al 2008 water movement is also important for sediment transport in reef areas which ultimately contributes to reef organism distribution geomorphic development of reef system and stability of shoreline kench and brander 2006 while a larger amount of field observations of waves and currents over coral reefs have been reported in the literature hench et al 2008 lowe et al 2009a monismith et al 2013 symonds et al 2011 taebi et al 2011 and many others laboratory studies on wave interaction with reef profiles are relatively fewer most previous experimental studies concentrated on the horizontally one dimensional 1dh wave dynamics such as the breaking wave characteristics in the reef surf zone e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2019a wave induced setup on the reef flat e g buckley et al 2015 gourlay 1996 seelig 1983 yao et al 2017 infragravity wave motions on the reef flat buckley et al 2018 demirbilek et al 2007 yao et al 2019b and solitary wave transformation and run up over coral reefs quiroga and cheung 2013 roeber et al 2010 yao et al 2018a to the best of the authors knowledge gourlay 1996 was the pioneer to conduct a set of laboratory experiments to measure the wave driven flow on the reef flat he found that wave driven current was small when the reef flat water level was either shallow or deep the maximum current was found at an intermediate reef flat water depth recently yao et al 2018b experimentally measured the wave induced setup and wave driven flow in the reef lagoon channel system the channel current was modelled in a wave flume by a pile connecting the lagoon and the open sea similar conclusions about the wave driven current as found by gourlay 1996 were reported however the flow measurements on the reef flat in both above studies were taken at limited cross shore locations and only at the middle depth the detailed current information in the surf zone has not been reported yet in the existing laboratory studies conventionally following the beach studies analytical solutions based on the radiation stress concept as introduced by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 have been developed to study 1dh wave driven current over reefs e g gourlay and colleter 2005 hearn 1999 symonds et al 1995 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 the effects of complex morphology and ocean forcing at the field scale have been modelled using 2dh or three dimensional 3d numerical models to study both the waves and the flows and normally the waves and the mean flows are coupled by the radiation stress douillet et al 2001 kraines et al 1998 1999 lowe et al 2009b van dongeren et al 2013 and many others at the laboratory scale the boussinesq type models which are computationally efficient and phased resolving are the most prevailing the boussinesq equations assume a polynomial approximation to the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity thus reducing the dimensions of a 3d problem by one they can capture both nonlinear and dispersive effects at intermediate water levels boussinesq models have been proved to be capable of simulating the motions of monochromatic waves e g skotner and apelt 1999 yao et al 2012 spectral waves e g nwogu and demirbilek 2010 yao et al 2016 2019b solitary waves e g roeber et al 2010 roeber and cheung 2012 yao et al 2018a and infragravity waves e g su et al 2015 su and ma 2018 on different reef profiles however there are still several disadvantages of applying such kind of models 1 boussinesq equations cannot resolve the undertow current very accurately because of the aforementioned polynomial approximation to the velocity profile along water depth although some improvements have been made by using the multi layer model e g lynett and liu 2004 or by relaxing the assumption of irrotational flow e g brocchini 2013 2 boussinesq equations are subjected to the mild slope assumption hence they are questionable when using at the steep fore reef slope as well as the sharp reef crest 3 breaking waves cannot be inherently captured by the boussinesq equations hence an empirical model or a dedicated numerical treatment is commonly required for wave breaking when modeling the surf zone process over coral reefs local but strong turbulence in the vicinity of the reef edge where the energetic wave breaking occurs needs to be resolved therefore a 3d model which can solve the rotational flow should be appropriate to remedy the deficiencies of boussinesq type models as recent advancement in computer technology the most advanced navier stokes approaches although less computationally efficient are widely used in exploring similar coastal problems such as waves interaction with plane beaches e g christensen 2006 lin and liu 1998 barred beaches e g jacobsen et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and mangrove forests e g maza et al 2013 2015 a review by hearn 2011 also pointed out that the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods which solve the navier stokes equations are one of the future directions of studying coral reef hydrodynamics however in the literature we are only aware that franklin et al 2013 conducted 1dh wave reef simulations by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the effects of reef roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were investigated however their simulated currents were not validated by the laboratory data and the vertical flow structure in the surf zone was not analyzed as well more recently osorio cano et al 2018 applied the large eddy simulation les to reproduce the wave energy dissipation process over reefs with explicit accounting for the complexities of coral shape such as the coral colonies their model was validated by the field data from a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea therefore to understand the wave driven flow characteristics associated with breaking waves over fringing reefs we conduct detailed flow measurements around the surf zone over an idealized fringing reef model subjected to a typical plunging breaker the vertical flow structure around the surf zone in the absence presence of a reef crest located at the reef edge is analyzed subsequently to conquer the current deficiencies of using boussinesq type models to simulate wave processes over fringing reefs we also validate a navier stokes equation based model based on the well known cfd tool openfoam the rans equations for an incompressible fluid are solved a buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is used for the turbulence closure this approach is reported to be able to improve the excessive wave damping as commonly found in the traditional rans models with two phase flow solvers devolder et al 2018 the free surface motions are tracked by the commonly used vof method in this study we firstly validate the adopted numerical model with our laboratory measurements the model robustness in reproducing the cross shore variations of the free surface velocity and the undertow profile around the surf zone is demonstrated the model is then applied to examine the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone the rest of this paper is organized as follows laboratory setup is described in section 2 governing equations and numerical settings are presented in section 3 experimental measurements and model predictions are compared in section 4 model applications for which laboratory data are unavailable are performed in section 5 major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 experimental setup 2 1 physical model design a set of laboratory experiments are implemented at the hydraulic modeling laboratory nanyang technological university singapore referring to fig 1 all the tests are performed in a wave flume which is 36 m long 0 55 m wide and 0 60 m deep a piston type wavemaker is installed at one end of the flume to generate the designed waves at the other end a beach with a slope of 1v 8h covered with porous materials is constructed to reduce the wave reflection to replicate a fore reef slope a plane slope of 1v 6h with its toe placed at 16 35 m from the wavemaker is built which is followed by a 7 m horizontal reef flat located 0 35 m above the bottom of the flume both the fore reef slope and the reef flat are constructed by pvc plates with their width matching the flume inner width a rectangular reef crest which is 55 cm long 50 cm wide and 5 cm high is placed on the reef flat with its front face aligned to the reef edge the reef crest configuration is designed to mimic a prototype reef crest 10 m wide and 1 m high at moorea french polynesia hench et al 2008 the size of the reef crest the water level on the reef flat and the incident wave height are selected based on the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 20 the laboratory experiments are conducted to provide insight into the flow characteristics around the surf zone rather than reproduce the prototype reef at exact model scale given the laboratory reef flat of 7 m the corresponding prototype reef flat width is 40 m which is significantly less than the moorea reef flat of around 1 km however our pilot tests find that this width is sufficiently long to complete the surfzone process on the reef flat reproducing the reef surface roughness of natural reef flat is also not attempted in our experiments by considering that the dominant energy dissipation mechanism in the surf zone is wave breaking rather than bottom friction 2 2 wave measurements as also shown in fig 1 four acoustic wave sensors w9 w12 general acoustics co ltd germany are used to measure the water surfaces these sensors are almost equally spaced on the reef flat for wave measurements in the region around the reef edge where the acoustic waves cannot function well due to breaking wave induced air bubbles in water five resistance type wave gauges w4 w8 hr wallingford co ltd uk are employed with w4 located at the edge meanwhile two gauges w1 and w2 are set offshore of fore reef slope to separate the incident waves and the reflected waves via the method of goda 2000 in addition one gauge w3 is placed on the fore reef slope to record the shoaling waves all wave measurements are sampled for 200 wave cycles at 50 hz through a data acquisition system a high speed video camera fastec imaging co ltd singapore with a frame acquisition rate of 50 fps is also utilized to record the breaking waves around the reef edge when wave field on the reef flat has reached a quasi steady state plunging breakers are very common on a steep reef profile gourlay 1994 a typical monochromatic wave condition reef flat water level h r 0 10 m incident deep water wave height h 0 0 087 m and incident wave period t 1 25 s is tested for the reef profile with without the reef crest such wave condition produces a representative plunging breaker on our tested reef profile when waves break around the reef edge its surf zone process extends over certain cross shore distance starting from the incipient breaking point to a point where energy dissipation by wave breaking ceases lowe et al 2005 a practical criterion to judge the termination of a surf zone is the disappearance of whitecaps generated by the propagating bore and the reformation of oscillatory waves propagating shoreward thus unlike waves break on beaches swash zone does not exists when waves break on the horizontal reef flat gourlay 1994 has divided the surf zone over reefs into an outer surf zone and an inner surf zone and a transition from the outer to the inner surf zone appears right shoreward of the splashing point following galvin 1969 the incipient breaking point is defined as the point where a large portion of the front face of a wave becomes nearly vertical the plunging point is defined as the point where the wave crest curls over and touches the water surface in front of it the splashing point is defined as the point where the water mass displaced upward by the plunging wave strikes the water surface these characteristic surf zone points under our tested wave condition are given in table 1 for both reefs with and without the reef crest 2 3 flow measurements subsequently to investigate the wave generated flow around the reef surf zone an area starting from 0 75 m seaside of the reef edge in the shoaling zone on the fore reef slope and ending at 3 675 m leeside of the reef edge some distance shoreward of the surf zone on the reef flat is selected the mean current at a specific location is sampled via an electromagnetic flow meter kenek co ltd japan the meter probe is 5 mm in diameter with a l shape tip thus it is more suitable than the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to measure the shallow waters on the reef flat during the experiments the probe is adjusted both horizontally and vertically through a moving frame two instantaneous velocity components streamwise and vertical are measured with a sampling frequency of 50 hz the probe could only function smoothly below the wave trough as well as outside the region with air bubble entrainment detailed velocity distributions along the water depth are sampled at 13 representative cross shore positions along the flume centerline see tables 2 and 3 for their detailed locations the velocity profiles for the two reefs with without the reef crest are not necessarily taken at the same cross shore positions over the reef in that their surfzone widths are different special attention is paid to the vicinity of reef edge where the flow transition may be significant however the area between the plunging point and the splashing point is skipped due to strong air bubble effect for each cross shore location we measured the velocities from 5 mm above the reef surface to 5 mm below the wave trough at an interval of 5 mm within the same run after the measurements at one cross shore location complete the probe is shifted to the next location the flow measurements start after the wavemaker runs for more than half hour to guarantee that waves and mean currents are in a quasi steady state we measured the mean flow profiles at all locations within the same run for the reef profile without or with the reef crest generally we observe that a recording duration of 1 5 min is sufficient to obtain a stable mean current at any elevation below the wave trough except for those around the splashing point where the air entrainment is strong and the measurement is extended to 3 min 3 numerical model 3 1 governing equations the rans solver was used in this study to simulate the unsteady and incompressible viscous fluids the governing equations written in einstein summation notation are given by 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u

turbulence model e g menter 1994 3 2 volume of fluid vof method the interface between water and air is tracked by the vof method a volume fraction α is used in this method it equals to 0 for a dry cell and 1 for a wet cell as well as a value between 0 and 1 for an interface cell containing both water and air α is solved by an advection equation 13 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 the third term

for solid boundaries they are modelled as no slip walls on which the wall functions are activated for k and ω the wall boundary condition for k is a wrapped zero gradient boundary condition and the corresponding wall boundary treatment for ω is a standard blending switching scheme implemented following the approach proposed by menter and esch 2001 wave generation and absorption are essentials for a numerical wave tank two existing third party modules e g waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 and ih foam higuera et al 2013 have been developed in this study we choose ih foam in that it employs an active wave absorbing boundary and does not need a relaxation zone thus the domain size is substantially reduced moreover it supports a number of wave theories including the stokes wave theory wave generation involves setting the values of free surface elevation and velocity at the boundary 3 4 numerical settings the 2dv numerical computational domain in this study is established to mimic the main aspects of the laboratory settings in fig 1 the deep section of the wave flume is truncated at 10 m from the wavemaker to save the computational cost the aforementioned wave absorbing boundary is employed at the inlet of the domain where the stokes 1st order linear wave theory is used for the tested monochromatic wave condition h r 0 10 m h 0 0 087 m and t 1 25 s the other boundary conditions of the computational domain are free to the atmosphere at the top boundary no slip wall conditions at the flume bottom the reef surface and the end of back reef beach as well as the empty boundary in openfoam for the two side faces to simulate the 2dv reef configuration structured grid is employed to discretize the numerical domain the grid size has only one layer of 4 mm in the spanwise y direction and it varies in the streamwise x direction in order to cut down the total number of cells from the wave generation boundary to the fore reef slope toe δ x reduces slowly from 20 mm to 4 mm the core region covering from the fore reef slope to the back reef beach kept a constant cell size of δ x 4 mm grid refinement is conducted in x direction at the core region by reducing the grid size to one quarter of its original size i e δ x 2 mm in the vertical z direction the grid size is set to be δ z 4 mm in the entire domain grid refinements near the free surface and near the solid bottom are also performed across the domain by reducing the grid size to δ z 2 mm the total number of mesh cells is 1 58 million 1 57 million for the reef without with the reef crest the simulation duration is appointed to be 100 wave cycles and only the last 10 waves are used for subsequent analysis the time step is automatically adjusted during simulation based on a constant courant number of 0 25 it takes approximately 7 days by parallel computing on a cluster server with 28 cpus intel xeon platinum 8173m 2 0 ghz our pilot tests find that there is no notable improvement of the simulations with further refinement of the grid across the reef profile to test the convergence of grid size we take the scenario for the reef without the reef crest as an example we only vary the grid across the reef profile where the effect of grid size on the simulations is supposed to be the most influential both streamwise and vertical grid sizes δ x and δ z ranging from 8 mm down to 1 mm are examined the simulations in the inner reef flat in terms of dimensionless maximum free surface elevation at w11 and mid depth streamwise velocity at c13 are shown in fig 2 and the predicted vertical undertow profiles around the reef surf zone are compared in fig 3 in general only less than 5 differences in terms of wave instantaneous current and mean current could be observed with the grid size varying from 2 mm to 1 mm suggesting that our selection of grid size δ x δ z 2 mm is sufficient for the current simulations a detailed analysis of the undertow current will be given in section 4 3 4 comparison between laboratory measurements and numerical simulations 4 1 evolution of the cross shore free surface elevations around the reef edge fig 4 illustrates wave transformation and breaking around the reef edge in the presence absence of the reef crest under the investigated monochromatic waves based on the camera images four stages are shown starting from the instant when breaker lip hits the water surface ahead of it for the reef without the reef crest breaking wave plunges onto the reef flat at t t 0 and the breaker induced splash up jet produces an air water mixture of foams bubbles and whitecaps at t t 1 4 after half wave period t t 1 2 a fully turbulent bore forms and transforms across the surf zone at t t 3 4 the bore is almost dissipated and the reformed wave on the reef flat propagates further shoreward reverse current is found at such moment before next incident wave arrives as for a reef crest existing at the reef edge the incipient breaking point shifts to the offshore side wave breaking strikes the seaside face of reef crest and then plunges onto the top of the crest resulting in stronger turbulence and air entrainment nevertheless the surf zone process is otherwise identical to that for the reef without the reef crest subjected to the same waves the computed free surface elevations are also superposed on the images for comparison overall the numerical simulations satisfactorily reproduce the evolution of free surfaces including the curling of the breaker lip and the movement of some air bubbles around the reef edge however detailed air bubble interaction associated with the moving bore could not be resolved by the adopted turbulence model and vof method 4 2 time series of the free surface elevations and velocities across the reef measured time series wave records from representative wave gauges for both reefs with and without the reef crest are compared fig 5 at the offshore location w1 stokes waves that have short peaky crests and longer shallower toughs can be found waves become more asymmetric and skewed as they shoal on the fore reef slope w3 breaking waves with typical saw tooth shapes can be observed at w5 and w7 in that there are located in the surf zone for both reefs on the inner reef flat w9 and w11 the transmitted waves are very small compared to the incident waves and the secondary peaks in their profiles are due to higher harmonic waves generated around the reef edge yao 2012 the computed surface elevations at these locations for both reefs are also presented fig 5 very good agreements between the measurements and the computations are observed at most gauge positions for both reefs notable mismatch of the wave profile only appears at deeper section of flume w1 and w3 because water level setdown in this area which is required to balance the wave setup on the reef flat due to mass conservation in a closed laboratory domain is not mimicked by the model in that we truncate the numerical domain in the deep section of the flume this is particularly true on the reef where wave setup on the reef flat thus the setdown in the deep section of the flume is increased by the presence of a reef crest yao et al 2012 slight disagreement appears at w5 and w7 in the surf zone this is anticipated because of the air bubble effect on wave measurement of the instruments on the reef flat w9 and w11 some secondary peaks in the wave profiles caused by the higher harmonic waves are not accurately captured particularly at w11 we then examine the instantaneous measured streamwise flow velocity u from the middle depth of selected sampling locations for both reefs with and without the reef crest fig 6 the evolutionary behavior of velocities generally follows that of the free surface elevations in fig 5 at c1 on the fore reef slope prior to wave breaking the measured velocity profiles get steepened associated with the shoaling waves very close to the breaking point c4 the saw tooth shaped profiles can be observed starting from l4 to the inner surf zone shoreward of splashing points c9 the velocities become more or less irregular because there are both effects of strong turbulence and air bubbles entrained by breaking waves on the flow measurements the velocities become more organized further shoreward of the surf zone c13 there are also secondary peaks in their profiles due to the aforementioned higher harmonics the simulated velocity time series for both reefs are also presented in fig 6 satisfactory agreements between the predictions and measurements at c1 in the shoaling zone can be observed in the surfzone locations c4 c6 and c9 the predictions are less satisfactory with some mismatch of the velocity magnitude which are primarily attributed to the aforementioned measurement error due to air bubbles however further shoreward of the surf zone as waves become organized again the model reproduces the temporal variation of current at l13 reasonably well 4 3 the undertow current for a 2dv fringing reef configuration the conservation of mass requires that the wave driven forward current stokes drift must be balanced by an underneath return flow undertow therefore in this section our flow measurements below the wave trough around the surf zone are further analyzed the mean streamwise velocity profiles along the water depth at all flow sampling locations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively for the reef without and with the reef crest for each measurement position its phase averaged velocity is determined by taking the mean of the sampled instantaneous velocities within a wave cycle the mean current and its measurement error at that position are calculated by the ensemble average and the standard derivation of the phase averaged velocities in the timeseries of wave record respectively the obtained mean currents range from 0 to 50 cm s the sampling errors indicated by the error bars in figs 7 and 8 are relatively larger around the splashing points e g at c7 and c8 where more air bubbles are entrained in the water regarding the reef without the reef crest fig 7 the mean flows in the shoaling zone c1 c3 are offshore directed undertow their magnitudes increase linearly upwards from the reef surface in the outer surf zone before the plunging point c4 and c5 the undertow currents increase all the way from the bed to the wave troughs the maximum normalized seaward currents appear near the wave troughs at both c4 and c5 which are around 0 15 in the inner surf zone shoreward of the splashing point c6 c11 where the breaking wave propagates shoreward in the form of a moving bore the variation of undertow current with water depth reverses with the maximum undertow occurring near the bottom and shoreward mass transport occurring very close to the wave trough see e g c7 and c8 a cross shore reduction in magnitude of the mean current can be also observed as the moving bore decays from c6 to c11 at the locations outside the surf zone c12 and c13 the mean velocities along the depth become near zero suggesting that the circulation is weak shoreward of the surf zone on the reef flat for the present fringing reef profile as for the reef with the reef crest fig 8 the mean flow profiles at both c1 and c2 are similar to those without the reef crest however the vertical flow structure at c3 prior to wave breaking is notably altered by the reef crest for the locations at the top of shallower reef crest subjected to the breaking waves c4 c6 the offshore directed mean currents are again found and the maximum value is almost tripled around 0 45 at c4 compared to those without the reef crest the position c7 is on the reef crest top in the vicinity of splashing point the mean current profile at c7 resembles that at c6 but its velocity magnitude is much smaller the mean velocity reduces slowly from c8 to c11 in the inner surf zone behind the reef crest with the maximum undertow appears near the reef surface and shoreward current close to the wave trough the mean velocities are again very weak at both c12 and c13 shoreward of the surf zone unlike laboratory instrument which is unable to measure the flow above the wave trough the adopted numerical model can reproduce entire mean current profile along the water depth both below and above the wave trough these computed profiles for the two reefs without and with the reef crest are also shown in figs 7 and 8 overall the model satisfactorily reproduces the mass balance between the shoreward currents and the undertows at each measurement location for both reefs model performances for the undertow profiles in the shoaling zone as well as in the outer surf zone are fairly good in the inner surf zone although the qualitative behavior of undertow profile is reasonably captured the model notably over predicts the magnitude of the currents for those locations beyond the surf zone where the measured mean currents are very small the simulated currents are also over predicted which means that the simulated surfzone process extends further shoreward on the reef flat similar degree of the over prediction of undertow current could be also found when using the rans turbulence models e g brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 jacobsen et al 2012 to simulate the plunging breakers on plane beaches this is largely due to the over production of the turbulent kinetic energy a common issue when applying rans turbulence modelling see e g devolder et al 2018 which could increase the roller effect see section 5 2 on the radiation stress that drives the mean flow on the reef flat finally to validate our adopted model among different navier stokes equation based models additional simulations are conducted by using the les turbulence model and the laminar model with the same grid settings as for the buoyancy modified k ω sst model in openfoam their results in view of the undertow current are compared with those of the buoyancy modified k ω sst model fig 9 in general the predictions of k ω sst model agree better with the laboratory measurements than those from laminar and les models at almost all sampling locations 5 model applications 5 1 mean current field around the reef surf zone compared to traditional plane beaches the 2dv mean flow associated with breaking waves over the reef profile has not been fully understood in the literature in this section the mean current fields around the surf zone for both reefs without and with the reef crest are numerically investigated overall the mean flows for the reef without the reef crest fig 10 a are consistent with those obtained for a plane beach subjected to a plunging breaker ting and kirby 1994 the observed dominant offshore directed mean currents are largely due to the closed 2dv domain the wave driven shoreward mass transport stokes drift must be compensated by the seaward return current undertow so that the net mass transport is zero both the largest shoreward mass transport and the undertow appear in the inner surf zone because there is significant transition of shoreward mass transport to the undertow around the splashing point we remark that this kind of 2dv numerical setup is more closer to those fringing reef sites where the effects of rip channels are small and the alongshore currents are weak for example the guam reef as reported by vetter et al 2010 when the reef crest is present fig 10b wave breaking is enhanced on the reef crest where water depth becomes shallower the forward mass transport increases accordingly resulting in strong reverse flow at the seaside edge of reef crest leeside of the reef crest since most of surf zone process has completed on the reef crest both the intensity and extent of the forward mass transport thus the undertow decreases on the reef flat compared to the reef without reef crest this blockage effect suggests that the reef crest functions in a way similar to a broad crested weir in an open channel flow it can lead to upstream water piling up and flow retention in ecological sense this means that the water exchange between the reef flat and the offshore is impeded our analysis also implies that the availability of high resolution bathymetry around a reef crest is necessary for accurate modeling the wave induced current over coral reefs 5 2 the cross shore variation of radiation stress the radiation stress concept is interpreted as the excess flux of horizontal momentum due to the presence of waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 this concept is widely used in the study of wave dynamics over coral reefs in that the cross shore gradient of the radiation stress in the reef surf zone is able to produce a wave setup on the reef flat which is the driver of nearshore circulation in the reef area the cross shore component of the radiation stress tensor is defined as see e g svendsen 2006 16 s x x h η ρ u w 2 ρ w w 2 d z 1 2 ρ g η 2 where u w and w w are the streamwise and the vertical components of wave orbital velocity and the over bar denotes an average over one wave period by using the shallow water linear wave theory eq 16 is approximated to longuet higgins and stewart 1964 17 s x x 3 16 ρ g h 2 0 1875 ρ g h 2 the above expression has been widely used in the nearshore hydrodynamic models for coral reefs to predict wave induced setup and wave driven current e g hearn 1999 symonds et al 1995 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 in that it only relies on the wave height however the above expression is suitable for linear non breaking wave travelling on a flat bottom and most of these assumptions are clearly violated for the surf zone waves in this study s x x at any cross shore location can be evaluated by using the exact definition i e eq 16 in that the detailed free surface and velocity are obtained via numerical simulations including those velocities difficult to be measured between the wave crest and trough following svendsen and putrevu 1993 we calculate the cross shore variation of the dimensionless radiation stress s x x is normalized by ρ g h 2 for both reef without and with the reef crest and the results are given by fig 11 also shown in fig 11 is the value of p based on the linear shallow water wave theory when there is no reef crest fig 11a although the cross shore variation of p is affected by a partial standing wave pattern due to wave reflection at the fore reef slope a decrease of p for shoaling waves on the fore reef could still be observed and its value reaches around 0 1 smaller than 0 1875 as predicted by linear wave theory prior to the breaking point this is because the near breaking wave has more sharp crest and flat trough compared to the linear wave with the same height similar to the previous studies for plane beaches e g svendsen and putrevu 1993 a notable increase of p to 0 5 in the outer surf zone is found after wave breaking which is primarily contributed by the rollers as well as the nonuniform velocity and pressure distribution in the surf zone svendsen 2006 such kind of effects are inherently included in our simulations via using the turbulence model after that the magnitude of p gradually deceases along the reef flat and reduces to about 0 2 in the inner surf zone this value is very close to the representative value of p 0 22 for the surfzone saw tooth shaped waves svendsen 2006 shoreward of the surf zone p value approaches to the linear expression of 0 1875 when the reef crest exists fig 11b it enhances both wave reflection on the fore reef slope and intensity of wave breaking near the reef edge thus more fluctuant variation of p as well as larger p value can be found before the breaking point and in the surf zone respectively on the reef flat p value is consistently larger than that without the reef crest after re examining eq 16 we find that this is primarily due to the increased water level wave setup on the reef flat by the presence of reef crest yao et al 2012 which contributes the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 we finally remark that this section confirms the necessity of including surf zone corrections in the linear expression of s x x in order to improve the predictions of cross shore wave induced setup and wave driven flow on the reef flat in existing hydrodynamic models 6 conclusions to investigate the wave driven flow characteristics around the surf zone over fringing reefs detailed flow measurements over water depth are performed at selected locations in a wave flume experimental results are reported for both idealized reef profiles with and without a rectangle reef crest locating at the reef edge under a monochromatic wave condition data analyses show that the cross shore undertow profiles subjected to the plunging breaker for the idealized fringing reef in the absence of the reef crest are similar to those for plane beach the existence of a reef crest increases the undertow around the reef crest and it also causes a flow retention on the leeside of reef crest to remedy the deficiencies of bousinessq type models a 2dv numerical wave tank based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study the navier stokes equations for two phase incompressible flow are solved using the buoyancy modified k w sst approach as the turbulence closure as well as the vof method to track the free surface laboratory measurements of the waves and flows both the instantaneous and the mean are used to validate the numerical model the model is then applied to investigate the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone numerical results suggest that a reef crest alters the mean current field only in the vicinity of the reef edge and it blocks the flow leeside of the crest in a manner identical to a broad crested weir controlling the flow in an open channel the cross shore radiation stress tensor in the surf zone which includes the effects of wave nonlinearity and rollers is found to consistently larger than that predicted by the linear wave theory laboratory dataset reported in this study could be potentially used for validating other analytical or numerical models developed for modeling waves and flows over fringing reefs comparing among three types of navier stokes equation based models this study also indicates that the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is a good choice to simulate wave dynamics over fringing reefs with steep reef crest configurations at least at a laboratory scale natural reefs are more complicated than those modelled in our laboratory experiments the reef surface roughness lagoon and rip channel configurations etc may also affect the wave driven flows over realistic reef sites

22080,wave driven flow over the reef flat plays an essential role in shaping the morphology of coral reefs whose biological ecological and geological processes are significantly affected by the water exchange between the open sea and the reef flat in this study detailed flow measurements are conducted to investigate the vertical flow structure in the surf zone associated with a plunging breaker over an idealized fringing reef profile with and without a reef crest a two dimensional vertical 2dv numerical wave tank which solves the navier stokes equations with a buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence closure is developed to reproduce the laboratory experiments the free surface is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method laboratory measurements of the waves and the flows are used to validate the numerical model the model is then applied to examine the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone the results suggest that the reef crest causes strong reverse mean flow in the vicinity of the reef edge and it also blocks the flow leeside of the crest the cross shore radiation stress in the reef surf zone is consistently larger than that predicted by the linear wave theory keywords wave driven current undertow surf zone navier stokes equations fringing reef 1 introduction wave breaking over coral reefs parallels that on sandy or muddy beaches but reef profiles are significantly different from beaches in some aspects as steep fore reef slope normally it is steeper than 1 20 and horizontal reef flat hence there is no swash zone incident waves break around the reef edge dissipating a large portion of energy and causing an increase of mean water level known as wave induced setup a mechanism described firstly by munk and sargent 1948 for a barrier reef separated from the mainland or island by a deep lagoon wave setup is able to drive a cross shore current on the reef flat and an alongshore current in the lagoon the current eventually exits the lagoon through rip channels connecting the lagoon with the open sea resulting in a horizontally two dimensional 2dh circulation in the reef lagoon channel system hearn 1999 for a fringing reef attached directly to the coastal landmass the water exchange with the surrounding ocean is significantly restricted by friction through narrow rough and sometimes tortuous channels lowe et al 2009a thus wave driven current may sometimes return offshore though the undertow current e g vetter et al 2010 activities of flows associated with ocean waves over coral reefs have profound biological ecological and geomorphic implications for example wave driven current has significant impact on the nearshore circulations thus the transport of organisms nutrients and larval corals hench et al 2008 water movement is also important for sediment transport in reef areas which ultimately contributes to reef organism distribution geomorphic development of reef system and stability of shoreline kench and brander 2006 while a larger amount of field observations of waves and currents over coral reefs have been reported in the literature hench et al 2008 lowe et al 2009a monismith et al 2013 symonds et al 2011 taebi et al 2011 and many others laboratory studies on wave interaction with reef profiles are relatively fewer most previous experimental studies concentrated on the horizontally one dimensional 1dh wave dynamics such as the breaking wave characteristics in the reef surf zone e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2019a wave induced setup on the reef flat e g buckley et al 2015 gourlay 1996 seelig 1983 yao et al 2017 infragravity wave motions on the reef flat buckley et al 2018 demirbilek et al 2007 yao et al 2019b and solitary wave transformation and run up over coral reefs quiroga and cheung 2013 roeber et al 2010 yao et al 2018a to the best of the authors knowledge gourlay 1996 was the pioneer to conduct a set of laboratory experiments to measure the wave driven flow on the reef flat he found that wave driven current was small when the reef flat water level was either shallow or deep the maximum current was found at an intermediate reef flat water depth recently yao et al 2018b experimentally measured the wave induced setup and wave driven flow in the reef lagoon channel system the channel current was modelled in a wave flume by a pile connecting the lagoon and the open sea similar conclusions about the wave driven current as found by gourlay 1996 were reported however the flow measurements on the reef flat in both above studies were taken at limited cross shore locations and only at the middle depth the detailed current information in the surf zone has not been reported yet in the existing laboratory studies conventionally following the beach studies analytical solutions based on the radiation stress concept as introduced by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 have been developed to study 1dh wave driven current over reefs e g gourlay and colleter 2005 hearn 1999 symonds et al 1995 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 the effects of complex morphology and ocean forcing at the field scale have been modelled using 2dh or three dimensional 3d numerical models to study both the waves and the flows and normally the waves and the mean flows are coupled by the radiation stress douillet et al 2001 kraines et al 1998 1999 lowe et al 2009b van dongeren et al 2013 and many others at the laboratory scale the boussinesq type models which are computationally efficient and phased resolving are the most prevailing the boussinesq equations assume a polynomial approximation to the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity thus reducing the dimensions of a 3d problem by one they can capture both nonlinear and dispersive effects at intermediate water levels boussinesq models have been proved to be capable of simulating the motions of monochromatic waves e g skotner and apelt 1999 yao et al 2012 spectral waves e g nwogu and demirbilek 2010 yao et al 2016 2019b solitary waves e g roeber et al 2010 roeber and cheung 2012 yao et al 2018a and infragravity waves e g su et al 2015 su and ma 2018 on different reef profiles however there are still several disadvantages of applying such kind of models 1 boussinesq equations cannot resolve the undertow current very accurately because of the aforementioned polynomial approximation to the velocity profile along water depth although some improvements have been made by using the multi layer model e g lynett and liu 2004 or by relaxing the assumption of irrotational flow e g brocchini 2013 2 boussinesq equations are subjected to the mild slope assumption hence they are questionable when using at the steep fore reef slope as well as the sharp reef crest 3 breaking waves cannot be inherently captured by the boussinesq equations hence an empirical model or a dedicated numerical treatment is commonly required for wave breaking when modeling the surf zone process over coral reefs local but strong turbulence in the vicinity of the reef edge where the energetic wave breaking occurs needs to be resolved therefore a 3d model which can solve the rotational flow should be appropriate to remedy the deficiencies of boussinesq type models as recent advancement in computer technology the most advanced navier stokes approaches although less computationally efficient are widely used in exploring similar coastal problems such as waves interaction with plane beaches e g christensen 2006 lin and liu 1998 barred beaches e g jacobsen et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and mangrove forests e g maza et al 2013 2015 a review by hearn 2011 also pointed out that the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods which solve the navier stokes equations are one of the future directions of studying coral reef hydrodynamics however in the literature we are only aware that franklin et al 2013 conducted 1dh wave reef simulations by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the effects of reef roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were investigated however their simulated currents were not validated by the laboratory data and the vertical flow structure in the surf zone was not analyzed as well more recently osorio cano et al 2018 applied the large eddy simulation les to reproduce the wave energy dissipation process over reefs with explicit accounting for the complexities of coral shape such as the coral colonies their model was validated by the field data from a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea therefore to understand the wave driven flow characteristics associated with breaking waves over fringing reefs we conduct detailed flow measurements around the surf zone over an idealized fringing reef model subjected to a typical plunging breaker the vertical flow structure around the surf zone in the absence presence of a reef crest located at the reef edge is analyzed subsequently to conquer the current deficiencies of using boussinesq type models to simulate wave processes over fringing reefs we also validate a navier stokes equation based model based on the well known cfd tool openfoam the rans equations for an incompressible fluid are solved a buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is used for the turbulence closure this approach is reported to be able to improve the excessive wave damping as commonly found in the traditional rans models with two phase flow solvers devolder et al 2018 the free surface motions are tracked by the commonly used vof method in this study we firstly validate the adopted numerical model with our laboratory measurements the model robustness in reproducing the cross shore variations of the free surface velocity and the undertow profile around the surf zone is demonstrated the model is then applied to examine the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone the rest of this paper is organized as follows laboratory setup is described in section 2 governing equations and numerical settings are presented in section 3 experimental measurements and model predictions are compared in section 4 model applications for which laboratory data are unavailable are performed in section 5 major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 experimental setup 2 1 physical model design a set of laboratory experiments are implemented at the hydraulic modeling laboratory nanyang technological university singapore referring to fig 1 all the tests are performed in a wave flume which is 36 m long 0 55 m wide and 0 60 m deep a piston type wavemaker is installed at one end of the flume to generate the designed waves at the other end a beach with a slope of 1v 8h covered with porous materials is constructed to reduce the wave reflection to replicate a fore reef slope a plane slope of 1v 6h with its toe placed at 16 35 m from the wavemaker is built which is followed by a 7 m horizontal reef flat located 0 35 m above the bottom of the flume both the fore reef slope and the reef flat are constructed by pvc plates with their width matching the flume inner width a rectangular reef crest which is 55 cm long 50 cm wide and 5 cm high is placed on the reef flat with its front face aligned to the reef edge the reef crest configuration is designed to mimic a prototype reef crest 10 m wide and 1 m high at moorea french polynesia hench et al 2008 the size of the reef crest the water level on the reef flat and the incident wave height are selected based on the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 20 the laboratory experiments are conducted to provide insight into the flow characteristics around the surf zone rather than reproduce the prototype reef at exact model scale given the laboratory reef flat of 7 m the corresponding prototype reef flat width is 40 m which is significantly less than the moorea reef flat of around 1 km however our pilot tests find that this width is sufficiently long to complete the surfzone process on the reef flat reproducing the reef surface roughness of natural reef flat is also not attempted in our experiments by considering that the dominant energy dissipation mechanism in the surf zone is wave breaking rather than bottom friction 2 2 wave measurements as also shown in fig 1 four acoustic wave sensors w9 w12 general acoustics co ltd germany are used to measure the water surfaces these sensors are almost equally spaced on the reef flat for wave measurements in the region around the reef edge where the acoustic waves cannot function well due to breaking wave induced air bubbles in water five resistance type wave gauges w4 w8 hr wallingford co ltd uk are employed with w4 located at the edge meanwhile two gauges w1 and w2 are set offshore of fore reef slope to separate the incident waves and the reflected waves via the method of goda 2000 in addition one gauge w3 is placed on the fore reef slope to record the shoaling waves all wave measurements are sampled for 200 wave cycles at 50 hz through a data acquisition system a high speed video camera fastec imaging co ltd singapore with a frame acquisition rate of 50 fps is also utilized to record the breaking waves around the reef edge when wave field on the reef flat has reached a quasi steady state plunging breakers are very common on a steep reef profile gourlay 1994 a typical monochromatic wave condition reef flat water level h r 0 10 m incident deep water wave height h 0 0 087 m and incident wave period t 1 25 s is tested for the reef profile with without the reef crest such wave condition produces a representative plunging breaker on our tested reef profile when waves break around the reef edge its surf zone process extends over certain cross shore distance starting from the incipient breaking point to a point where energy dissipation by wave breaking ceases lowe et al 2005 a practical criterion to judge the termination of a surf zone is the disappearance of whitecaps generated by the propagating bore and the reformation of oscillatory waves propagating shoreward thus unlike waves break on beaches swash zone does not exists when waves break on the horizontal reef flat gourlay 1994 has divided the surf zone over reefs into an outer surf zone and an inner surf zone and a transition from the outer to the inner surf zone appears right shoreward of the splashing point following galvin 1969 the incipient breaking point is defined as the point where a large portion of the front face of a wave becomes nearly vertical the plunging point is defined as the point where the wave crest curls over and touches the water surface in front of it the splashing point is defined as the point where the water mass displaced upward by the plunging wave strikes the water surface these characteristic surf zone points under our tested wave condition are given in table 1 for both reefs with and without the reef crest 2 3 flow measurements subsequently to investigate the wave generated flow around the reef surf zone an area starting from 0 75 m seaside of the reef edge in the shoaling zone on the fore reef slope and ending at 3 675 m leeside of the reef edge some distance shoreward of the surf zone on the reef flat is selected the mean current at a specific location is sampled via an electromagnetic flow meter kenek co ltd japan the meter probe is 5 mm in diameter with a l shape tip thus it is more suitable than the acoustic doppler velocimetry adv to measure the shallow waters on the reef flat during the experiments the probe is adjusted both horizontally and vertically through a moving frame two instantaneous velocity components streamwise and vertical are measured with a sampling frequency of 50 hz the probe could only function smoothly below the wave trough as well as outside the region with air bubble entrainment detailed velocity distributions along the water depth are sampled at 13 representative cross shore positions along the flume centerline see tables 2 and 3 for their detailed locations the velocity profiles for the two reefs with without the reef crest are not necessarily taken at the same cross shore positions over the reef in that their surfzone widths are different special attention is paid to the vicinity of reef edge where the flow transition may be significant however the area between the plunging point and the splashing point is skipped due to strong air bubble effect for each cross shore location we measured the velocities from 5 mm above the reef surface to 5 mm below the wave trough at an interval of 5 mm within the same run after the measurements at one cross shore location complete the probe is shifted to the next location the flow measurements start after the wavemaker runs for more than half hour to guarantee that waves and mean currents are in a quasi steady state we measured the mean flow profiles at all locations within the same run for the reef profile without or with the reef crest generally we observe that a recording duration of 1 5 min is sufficient to obtain a stable mean current at any elevation below the wave trough except for those around the splashing point where the air entrainment is strong and the measurement is extended to 3 min 3 numerical model 3 1 governing equations the

turbulence model e g menter 1994 3 2 volume of fluid vof method the interface between water and air is tracked by the vof method a volume fraction α is used in this method it equals to 0 for a dry

for solid boundaries they are modelled as no slip walls on which the wall functions are activated for k and ω the wall boundary condition for k is a wrapped zero gradient boundary condition and the corresponding wall boundary treatment for ω is a standard blending switching scheme implemented following the approach proposed by menter and esch 2001 wave generation and absorption are essentials for a numerical wave tank two existing third party modules e g waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 and ih foam higuera et al 2013 have been developed in this study we choose ih foam in that it employs an active wave absorbing boundary and does not need a relaxation zone thus the domain size is substantially reduced moreover it supports a number of wave theories including the stokes wave theory wave generation involves setting the values of free surface elevation and velocity at the boundary 3 4 numerical settings the 2dv numerical computational domain in this study is established to mimic the main aspects of the laboratory settings in fig 1 the deep section of the wave flume is truncated at 10 m from the wavemaker to save the computational cost the aforementioned wave absorbing boundary is employed at the inlet of the domain where the stokes 1st order linear wave theory is used for the tested monochromatic wave condition h r 0 10 m h 0 0 087 m and t 1 25 s the other boundary conditions of the computational domain are free to the atmosphere at the top boundary no slip wall conditions at the flume bottom the reef surface and the end of back reef beach as well as the empty boundary in openfoam for the two side faces to simulate the 2dv reef configuration structured grid is employed to discretize the numerical domain the grid size has only one layer of 4 mm in the spanwise y direction and it varies in the streamwise x direction in order to cut down the total number of cells from the wave generation boundary to the fore reef slope toe δ x reduces slowly from 20 mm to 4 mm the core region covering from the fore reef slope to the back reef beach kept a constant cell size of δ x 4 mm grid refinement is conducted in x direction at the core region by reducing the grid size to one quarter of its original size i e δ x 2 mm in the vertical z direction the grid size is set to be δ z 4 mm in the entire domain grid refinements near the free surface and near the solid bottom are also performed across the domain by reducing the grid size to δ z 2 mm the total number of mesh cells is 1 58 million 1 57 million for the reef without with the reef crest the simulation duration is appointed to be 100 wave cycles and only the last 10 waves are used for subsequent analysis the time step is automatically adjusted during simulation based on a constant courant number of 0 25 it takes approximately 7 days by parallel computing on a cluster server with 28 cpus intel xeon platinum 8173m 2 0 ghz our pilot tests find that there is no notable improvement of the simulations with further refinement of the grid across the reef profile to test the convergence of grid size we take the scenario for the reef without the reef crest as an example we only vary the grid across the reef profile where the effect of grid size on the simulations is supposed to be the most influential both streamwise and vertical grid sizes δ x and δ z ranging from 8 mm down to 1 mm are examined the simulations in the inner reef flat in terms of dimensionless maximum free surface elevation at w11 and mid depth streamwise velocity at c13 are shown in fig 2 and the predicted vertical undertow profiles around the reef surf zone are compared in fig 3 in general only less than 5 differences in terms of wave instantaneous current and mean current could be observed with the grid size varying from 2 mm to 1 mm suggesting that our selection of grid size δ x δ z 2 mm is sufficient for the current simulations a detailed analysis of the undertow current will be given in section 4 3 4 comparison between laboratory measurements and numerical simulations 4 1 evolution of the cross shore free surface elevations around the reef edge fig 4 illustrates wave transformation and breaking around the reef edge in the presence absence of the reef crest under the investigated monochromatic waves based on the camera images four stages are shown starting from the instant when breaker lip hits the water surface ahead of it for the reef without the reef crest breaking wave plunges onto the reef flat at t t 0 and the breaker induced splash up jet produces an air water mixture of foams bubbles and whitecaps at t t 1 4 after half wave period t t 1 2 a fully turbulent bore forms and transforms across the surf zone at t t 3 4 the bore is almost dissipated and the reformed wave on the reef flat propagates further shoreward reverse current is found at such moment before next incident wave arrives as for a reef crest existing at the reef edge the incipient breaking point shifts to the offshore side wave breaking strikes the seaside face of reef crest and then plunges onto the top of the crest resulting in stronger turbulence and air entrainment nevertheless the surf zone process is otherwise identical to that for the reef without the reef crest subjected to the same waves the computed free surface elevations are also superposed on the images for comparison overall the numerical simulations satisfactorily reproduce the evolution of free surfaces including the curling of the breaker lip and the movement of some air bubbles around the reef edge however detailed air bubble interaction associated with the moving bore could not be resolved by the adopted turbulence model and vof method 4 2 time series of the free surface elevations and velocities across the reef measured time series wave records from representative wave gauges for both reefs with and without the reef crest are compared fig 5 at the offshore location w1 stokes waves that have short peaky crests and longer shallower toughs can be found waves become more asymmetric and skewed as they shoal on the fore reef slope w3 breaking waves with typical saw tooth shapes can be observed at w5 and w7 in that there are located in the surf zone for both reefs on the inner reef flat w9 and w11 the transmitted waves are very small compared to the incident waves and the secondary peaks in their profiles are due to higher harmonic waves generated around the reef edge yao 2012 the computed surface elevations at these locations for both reefs are also presented fig 5 very good agreements between the measurements and the computations are observed at most gauge positions for both reefs notable mismatch of the wave profile only appears at deeper section of flume w1 and w3 because water level setdown in this area which is required to balance the wave setup on the reef flat due to mass conservation in a closed laboratory domain is not mimicked by the model in that we truncate the numerical domain in the deep section of the flume this is particularly true on the reef where wave setup on the reef flat thus the setdown in the deep section of the flume is increased by the presence of a reef crest yao et al 2012 slight disagreement appears at w5 and w7 in the surf zone this is anticipated because of the air bubble effect on wave measurement of the instruments on the reef flat w9 and w11 some secondary peaks in the wave profiles caused by the higher harmonic waves are not accurately captured particularly at w11 we then examine the instantaneous measured streamwise flow velocity u from the middle depth of selected sampling locations for both reefs with and without the reef crest fig 6 the evolutionary behavior of velocities generally follows that of the free surface elevations in fig 5 at c1 on the fore reef slope prior to wave breaking the measured velocity profiles get steepened associated with the shoaling waves very close to the breaking point c4 the saw tooth shaped profiles can be observed starting from l4 to the inner surf zone shoreward of splashing points c9 the velocities become more or less irregular because there are both effects of strong turbulence and air bubbles entrained by breaking waves on the flow measurements the velocities become more organized further shoreward of the surf zone c13 there are also secondary peaks in their profiles due to the aforementioned higher harmonics the simulated velocity time series for both reefs are also presented in fig 6 satisfactory agreements between the predictions and measurements at c1 in the shoaling zone can be observed in the surfzone locations c4 c6 and c9 the predictions are less satisfactory with some mismatch of the velocity magnitude which are primarily attributed to the aforementioned measurement error due to air bubbles however further shoreward of the surf zone as waves become organized again the model reproduces the temporal variation of current at l13 reasonably well 4 3 the undertow current for a 2dv fringing reef configuration the conservation of mass requires that the wave driven forward current stokes drift must be balanced by an underneath return flow undertow therefore in this section our flow measurements below the wave trough around the surf zone are further analyzed the mean streamwise velocity profiles along the water depth at all flow sampling locations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively for the reef without and with the reef crest for each measurement position its phase averaged velocity is determined by taking the mean of the sampled instantaneous velocities within a wave cycle the mean current and its measurement error at that position are calculated by the ensemble average and the standard derivation of the phase averaged velocities in the timeseries of wave record respectively the obtained mean currents range from 0 to 50 cm s the sampling errors indicated by the error bars in figs 7 and 8 are relatively larger around the splashing points e g at c7 and c8 where more air bubbles are entrained in the water regarding the reef without the reef crest fig 7 the mean flows in the shoaling zone c1 c3 are offshore directed undertow their magnitudes increase linearly upwards from the reef surface in the outer surf zone before the plunging point c4 and c5 the undertow currents increase all the way from the bed to the wave troughs the maximum normalized seaward currents appear near the wave troughs at both c4 and c5 which are around 0 15 in the inner surf zone shoreward of the splashing point c6 c11 where the breaking wave propagates shoreward in the form of a moving bore the variation of undertow current with water depth reverses with the maximum undertow occurring near the bottom and shoreward mass transport occurring very close to the wave trough see e g c7 and c8 a cross shore reduction in magnitude of the mean current can be also observed as the moving bore decays from c6 to c11 at the locations outside the surf zone c12 and c13 the mean velocities along the depth become near zero suggesting that the circulation is weak shoreward of the surf zone on the reef flat for the present fringing reef profile as for the reef with the reef crest fig 8 the mean flow profiles at both c1 and c2 are similar to those without the reef crest however the vertical flow structure at c3 prior to wave breaking is notably altered by the reef crest for the locations at the top of shallower reef crest subjected to the breaking waves c4 c6 the offshore directed mean currents are again found and the maximum value is almost tripled around 0 45 at c4 compared to those without the reef crest the position c7 is on the reef crest top in the vicinity of splashing point the mean current profile at c7 resembles that at c6 but its velocity magnitude is much smaller the mean velocity reduces slowly from c8 to c11 in the inner surf zone behind the reef crest with the maximum undertow appears near the reef surface and shoreward current close to the wave trough the mean velocities are again very weak at both c12 and c13 shoreward of the surf zone unlike laboratory instrument which is unable to measure the flow above the wave trough the adopted numerical model can reproduce entire mean current profile along the water depth both below and above the wave trough these computed profiles for the two reefs without and with the reef crest are also shown in figs 7 and 8 overall the model satisfactorily reproduces the mass balance between the shoreward currents and the undertows at each measurement location for both reefs model performances for the undertow profiles in the shoaling zone as well as in the outer surf zone are fairly good in the inner surf zone although the qualitative behavior of undertow profile is reasonably captured the model notably over predicts the magnitude of the currents for those locations beyond the surf zone where the measured mean currents are very small the simulated currents are also over predicted which means that the simulated surfzone process extends further shoreward on the reef flat similar degree of the over prediction of undertow current could be also found when using the rans turbulence models e g brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 jacobsen et al 2012 to simulate the plunging breakers on plane beaches this is largely due to the over production of the turbulent kinetic energy a common issue when applying rans turbulence modelling see e g devolder et al 2018 which could increase the roller effect see section 5 2 on the radiation stress that drives the mean flow on the reef flat finally to validate our adopted model among different navier stokes equation based models additional simulations are conducted by using the les turbulence model and the laminar model with the same grid settings as for the buoyancy modified k ω sst model in openfoam their results in view of the undertow current are compared with those of the buoyancy modified k ω sst model fig 9 in general the predictions of k ω sst model agree better with the laboratory measurements than those from laminar and les models at almost all sampling locations 5 model applications 5 1 mean current field around the reef surf zone compared to traditional plane beaches the 2dv mean flow associated with breaking waves over the reef profile has not been fully understood in the literature in this section the mean current fields around the surf zone for both reefs without and with the reef crest are numerically investigated overall the mean flows for the reef without the reef crest fig 10 a are consistent with those obtained for a plane beach subjected to a plunging breaker ting and kirby 1994 the observed dominant offshore directed mean currents are largely due to the closed 2dv domain the wave driven shoreward mass transport stokes drift must be compensated by the seaward return current undertow so that the net mass transport is zero both the largest shoreward mass transport and the undertow appear in the inner surf zone because there is significant transition of shoreward mass transport to the undertow around the splashing point we remark that this kind of 2dv numerical setup is more closer to those fringing reef sites where the effects of rip channels are small and the alongshore currents are weak for example the guam reef as reported by vetter et al 2010 when the reef crest is present fig 10b wave breaking is enhanced on the reef crest where water depth becomes shallower the forward mass transport increases accordingly resulting in strong reverse flow at the seaside edge of reef crest leeside of the reef crest since most of surf zone process has completed on the reef crest both the intensity and extent of the forward mass transport thus the undertow decreases on the reef flat compared to the reef without reef crest this blockage effect suggests that the reef crest functions in a way similar to a broad crested weir in an open channel flow it can lead to upstream water piling up and flow retention in ecological sense this means that the water exchange between the reef flat and the offshore is impeded our analysis also implies that the availability of high resolution bathymetry around a reef crest is necessary for accurate modeling the wave induced current over coral reefs 5 2 the cross shore variation of radiation stress the radiation stress concept is interpreted as the excess flux of horizontal momentum due to the presence of waves longuet higgins and stewart 1962 this concept is widely used in the study of wave dynamics over coral reefs in that the cross shore gradient of the radiation stress in the reef surf zone is able to produce a wave setup on the reef flat which is the driver of nearshore circulation in the reef area the cross shore component of the radiation stress tensor is defined as see e g svendsen 2006 16 s x x h η ρ u w 2 ρ w w 2 d z 1 2 ρ g η 2 where u w and w w are the streamwise and the vertical components of wave orbital velocity and the over bar denotes an average over one wave period by using the shallow water linear wave theory eq 16 is approximated to longuet higgins and stewart 1964 17 s x x 3 16 ρ g h 2 0 1875 ρ g h 2 the above expression has been widely used in the nearshore hydrodynamic models for coral reefs to predict wave induced setup and wave driven current e g hearn 1999 symonds et al 1995 vetter et al 2010 yao et al 2017 in that it only relies on the wave height however the above expression is suitable for linear non breaking wave travelling on a flat bottom and most of these assumptions are clearly violated for the surf zone waves in this study s x x at any cross shore location can be evaluated by using the exact definition i e eq 16 in that the detailed free surface and velocity are obtained via numerical simulations including those velocities difficult to be measured between the wave crest and trough following svendsen and putrevu 1993 we calculate the cross shore variation of the dimensionless radiation stress s x x is normalized by ρ g h 2 for both reef without and with the reef crest and the results are given by fig 11 also shown in fig 11 is the value of p based on the linear shallow water wave theory when there is no reef crest fig 11a although the cross shore variation of p is affected by a partial standing wave pattern due to wave reflection at the fore reef slope a decrease of p for shoaling waves on the fore reef could still be observed and its value reaches around 0 1 smaller than 0 1875 as predicted by linear wave theory prior to the breaking point this is because the near breaking wave has more sharp crest and flat trough compared to the linear wave with the same height similar to the previous studies for plane beaches e g svendsen and putrevu 1993 a notable increase of p to 0 5 in the outer surf zone is found after wave breaking which is primarily contributed by the rollers as well as the nonuniform velocity and pressure distribution in the surf zone svendsen 2006 such kind of effects are inherently included in our simulations via using the turbulence model after that the magnitude of p gradually deceases along the reef flat and reduces to about 0 2 in the inner surf zone this value is very close to the representative value of p 0 22 for the surfzone saw tooth shaped waves svendsen 2006 shoreward of the surf zone p value approaches to the linear expression of 0 1875 when the reef crest exists fig 11b it enhances both wave reflection on the fore reef slope and intensity of wave breaking near the reef edge thus more fluctuant variation of p as well as larger p value can be found before the breaking point and in the surf zone respectively on the reef flat p value is consistently larger than that without the reef crest after re examining eq 16 we find that this is primarily due to the increased water level wave setup on the reef flat by the presence of reef crest yao et al 2012 which contributes the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 we finally remark that this section confirms the necessity of including surf zone corrections in the linear expression of s x x in order to improve the predictions of cross shore wave induced setup and wave driven flow on the reef flat in existing hydrodynamic models 6 conclusions to investigate the wave driven flow characteristics around the surf zone over fringing reefs detailed flow measurements over water depth are performed at selected locations in a wave flume experimental results are reported for both idealized reef profiles with and without a rectangle reef crest locating at the reef edge under a monochromatic wave condition data analyses show that the cross shore undertow profiles subjected to the plunging breaker for the idealized fringing reef in the absence of the reef crest are similar to those for plane beach the existence of a reef crest increases the undertow around the reef crest and it also causes a flow retention on the leeside of reef crest to remedy the deficiencies of bousinessq type models a 2dv numerical wave tank based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study the navier stokes equations for two phase incompressible flow are solved using the buoyancy modified k w sst approach as the turbulence closure as well as the vof method to track the free surface laboratory measurements of the waves and flows both the instantaneous and the mean are used to validate the numerical model the model is then applied to investigate the mean flow field and the cross shore variation of the radiation stress around the reef surf zone numerical results suggest that a reef crest alters the mean current field only in the vicinity of the reef edge and it blocks the flow leeside of the crest in a manner identical to a broad crested weir controlling the flow in an open channel the cross shore radiation stress tensor in the surf zone which includes the effects of wave nonlinearity and rollers is found to consistently larger than that predicted by the linear wave theory laboratory dataset reported in this study could be potentially used for validating other analytical or numerical models developed for modeling waves and flows over fringing reefs comparing among three types of navier stokes equation based models this study also indicates that the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is a good choice to simulate wave dynamics over fringing reefs with steep reef crest configurations at least at a laboratory scale natural reefs are more complicated than those modelled in our laboratory experiments the reef surface roughness lagoon and rip channel configurations etc may also affect the wave driven flows over realistic reef sites

22081,this paper presents a hybrid monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines it is an ultra high performance concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure cfdst used as a replacement of the conventional steel tube between the water level and the mudline so as to reduce the monopile diameter and thereby reducing the wave loads on the pile to study the feasibility of this monopile the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a conventional monopile is selected as a reference and a three dimensional 3d finite element model is developed the natural frequency the various responses under the serviceability limit state sls and the ultimate limit state uls of the hybrid monopile are presented particularly the effect of varying outer diameter of the cfdst on the structural performance is investigated by applying a consistent accumulated rotation at the mudline under the sls the natural frequency is found to be within a desired range and an optimized embedded length of the hybrid monopile is determined the results indicate that the proposed hybrid monopile is able to meet the design requirements for both sls and uls and the optimization of pile embedded length leads to an efficient and economic monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines keywords offshore wind turbine monopile concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure accumulated rotation natural frequency 1 introduction offshore wind energy has become one of the fastest growing sustainable energy sources at the end of 2017 the global capacity of offshore wind energy reached over 18 8 gw gw nearly 84 of which is located in european countries and the remaining 16 is located mainly in china gwec 2017 the united kingdom maintains the largest offshore wind market accounting for over 36 of installed capacity followed by germany 28 5 while china ranks third in the global offshore rankings accounting for 15 gwec 2017 ren21 2017 windeurope expects that by the year 2020 the total european offshore wind capacity will reach 25 gw gwec 2017 while china s offshore wind target will reach 5 gw ou et al 2018 although offshore wind energy has undergone a rapid development in recent years the levelized cost of energy lcoe for offshore wind turbines is still much higher than that of onshore wind turbines and it is also significantly higher than the lcoe of conventional power plants such as energy from coal or gas andres et al 2017 gentils et al 2017 if offshore wind turbines are installed in deeper waters and on larger scales the lcoe will increase further schwanitz and wierling 2016 this makes it difficult for offshore wind energy to have a competitive price in the energy market bocher et al 2018 for offshore wind turbines the foundation cost amounts to over 20 of the total capital cost gentils et al 2017 kim and kim 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective foundation for offshore wind turbines at present different types of foundations exist for offshore wind turbines such as monopiles tripods suction caissons jackets and gravity foundations o kelly and arshad 2016 among them monopile is the dominant foundation type due to several advantages o kelly and arshad 2016 álamo et al 2018 generally a monopile comprises of a transition piece and a single large diameter open ended tubular steel pipe that is driven drilled or vibrated into the seabed typically monopile diameters vary from 4 to 6 m with the slenderness ratio ratio between the embedded length and the diameter between 4 and 8 most of monopiles are installed in water depths not exceeding 25 m murphy et al 2018 scharff and siems 2013 negro et al 2017 as wind farms move further offshore wind turbines will need to move into much deeper waters and withstand greater loads from waves and winds as a result the cost can increase dramatically therefore many studies have been performed with the aim of reducing the cost of monopiles through structural optimization gentils et al 2017 muskulus and schafhirt 2014 schmoor and achmus 2015 gjersøe et al 2015 kallehave et al 2015 rad et al 2014 while the structural optimization may contribute to finding better and more economic solutions the tendency of rapid increase in monopile cost with the increase in water depth cannot change in the design of monopiles the wave and wind loads are the critical concerns arany et al 2017 morató et al 2017 stansby et al 2013 generally the proportions of wave and wind loads are related to the water depth and the wave loads become significant for greater water depths and wave heights which results in a larger area applying wave loads and a larger moment arm for those wave loads leading to larger mudline stresses in the support structure moreover wave load depends not only on the marine environment but also on the size of the monopile according to dnv gl 2016 the total horizontal force on a monopile due to waves consists of drag force and inertia force the drag force is directly proportional to the diameter of the monopile whereas the inertia force is directly proportional to the square of the diameter of the monopile in this respect a reduction in the diameter of the monopile can reduce the wave load on the monopile the main design considerations for a monopile supported wind turbine include natural frequency stability structural strength and fatigue as well as allowable deformations of the system during operation dnv gl 2016 velarde 2016 typically governed by permanent deformations under the sls and natural frequency velarde 2016 schmoor and achmus 2015 senanayake 2016 in order to reduce the wave loads by reducing the diameter of the monopile while still satisfying the design requirements two measures have been developed one is to reduce the diameter of the monopile only for the portion between the mudline and the water level and the other is to use concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure cfdst for that portion of the monopile cfdst can be regarded as a composite member that is constructed by filling concrete between two concentrically placed steel tubes it utilizes advantages of both steel and concrete han 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang 2017 and has been considered as loading bearing elements in some structural engineering applications such as high piers for bridges columns for high rise buildings support columns for offshore platforms and transmissions towers han et al 2011 hassanein et al 2018 uenaka 2016 compared to pure steel tubular cfdst has a high load bearing capacity high rigidity good energy absorption high fire resistance and construction cost effectiveness wang et al 2018 li et al 2018 therefore the use of cfdst instead of steel tubular can fulfill the capacity and stiffness requirements with a reduced pile diameter if ultra high performance concrete uhpc is used instead of normal strength concrete in cfdst the sectional size of the monopile can be further reduced zhang 2017 chen et al 2018 in this paper we present a feasibility study using cfdst as part of a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is adopted as a reference model we investigated the structural responses using the finite element method fem for two foundation types one is the conventional monopile and the other is the proposed hybrid monopile detailed comparisons are made for both the sls and the uls furthermore attempt is made to optimize the embedded length of the hybrid monopile using the accumulated rotation at mudline and the natural frequency as design driving parameters 2 concept description for hybrid monopile the key idea here is to reduce the diameter of the portion of the monopile between the mudline and the water level by replacing the pure steel tubular structure with the cfdst such that the wave load can be reduced fig 1 compares the geometric shapes of conventional and hybrid monopiles the conventional monopile foundation consists of the pile and the transition piece that connects the pile to the tower the proposed hybrid foundation consists of the pile and the cfdst the outer steel tube of cfdst can be fabricated together with the pile through a conical steel tube in practice the mechanical shear connectors e g eom et al 2019 shimizu et al 2013 thang et al 2016 yan et al 2016 can be used to achieve the composite action in concrete filled double skin steel tubes providing shear resistance and minimizing slip at the steel concrete interface a transition piece is set in the hybrid monopile and grouted to the cfdst the tower is connected to the transition piece by means of bolts on the top flange the details of the cfdst are shown in fig 2 in this paper we focused on a feasibility study using cfdsf as part of a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines the mechanical shear connector and transition piece are not modeled in detail and the tower is connected directly to the outer tube of the cfdst the length of the conical steel tube l t p is set to 7 m gentils et al 2017 the outer diameter of the outer steel tube d o u t e r is smaller than the diameter of the pile and is related to the wall thickness t o u t e r as dnv gl 2016 1 t o u t e r 6 35 d o u t e r 100 m m where d o u t e r is the outer diameter of the outer steel tube of the cfdst the inner steel tube is like a concrete formwork with a constant wall thickness t i n n e r 0 02 m and the outer diameter of the inner steel tube is calculated as follows 2 d i n n e r d o u t e r 2 t o u t e r 2 t c where d i n n e r is the outer diameter of inner steel tube of the cfdst t c is the concrete thickness of cfdst the total second moment of inertia for a cfdst structure can approximately be estimated by the sum of the second moment of inertia for the outer steel tube the concrete and the inner steel tube huang 2005 though cfdst structures have been shown to perform well under a variety of loading conditions liang et al 2019 li et al 2019 wang et al 2016 there is still limited knowledge regarding the interaction between the concrete and the outer and inner steel tubes especially for large diameter monopile structures we used a simple method to approximately estimate the concrete thickness of the cfdst structures the concrete thickness of the cfdst structure is approximately calculated by an equivalent stiffness between the cross section of the cfdst and the pile of the reference monopile which is an input for our fem model the performance of the cfdst structure under different loading conditions is then examined by the comprehensive fem analysis not by the simplified method 3 i c e s i p i l e e s i o u t e r e s i i n n e r e c 4 t c d o u t e r 2 t o u t e r d o u t e r 2

peeringa 2016 the hybrid monopile foundation can be fabricated onshore and transported to designated location using floating method after which it will be upended and vibro driving into the seabed to the required depth maryruth 2014 from the viewpoint of fabrication cost filling the void between the tubes with concrete will lead to thinner shells and smaller diameters of tubes and therefore less steel fabrication costs although use of concrete will add extra fabrication cost compared with the traditional pure steel monopile the tubes themselves act as the concrete formwork and thereby the cost for concrete fabrication is minimal 3 reference model nrel 5 mw turbine supported on oc3 monopile we use the nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 as a reference model this wind turbine has been used as a reference by research teams around the world to quantify the benefits of advanced offshore wind energy technologies gentils et al 2017 morató et al 2017 its main characteristics are described in table 1 the nrel 5 mw is considered to be supported by a monopile foundation with a water depth of 20 m designed during the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project for the international energy agency iea the height of the tower is 77 6 m with a base diameter of 6 m and a top diameter of 3 87 m the monopile has a length of 56 m and a constant section with an outer diameter of 6 m and a thickness of 60 mm the 36 meter monopile was driven into layered sandy soils and the remaining 20 m was from the seabed up to the sea level the dimensions of the pile transition piece and tower and the soil profile are depicted in fig 3 the pile is connected to the tower through a transition piece attached by grout at 10 m above the mean sea level msl the tower is bolted together with a transition pie through the internal flange bolt the material properties of the pile tower and transition piece are based on s355 steel whose density is increased by 8 to account for secondary steel appurtenances coatings and welds in this study a commercial grout material ducorit d4 is selected it is commonly used in grouted connections on offshore wind turbines the mechanical properties of structural steel and grout are summarized in table 2 in order to compare the hybrid and conventional monopile foundations similar wind turbines towers site and met ocean conditions used in the oc3 project are selected for the hybrid monopile study the distance between the mudline and the tower bottom l m p t o p is 30 m and the water depth h w is 20 m the diameter ratio λ is defined as the ratio between the outer tube of the cfdst and the outer diameter of the conventional monopile which is shown as follows 5 λ d o u t e r d where d is the outer diameter of the conventional monopile it is assumed that a kind of ultra high performance concrete uhpc is used to fill into the gap between the outer and inner tubes of the hybrid monopile according to some specifications uhpc

includes a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s under a combined effect of wave and current loads whose return period is 50 years with a load factor of 1 0 for all load categories the other corresponds to the uls and under characteristic load effects similar to the sls the load factors are equal to 1 0 and 1 35 for permanent and environmental loads respectively dnv gl 2016 5 numerical modelling and verification in order to comprehensively analyze the wind turbine pile soil system a three dimensional 3d finite element model fem is constructed using the software abaqus as shown in fig 4 the key geometric parameters are summarized in figs 1 and 2 and tables 1 and 3 the fem model consists of seven main components namely turbine tower steel pile concrete the soil around the pile the soil inside

coulomb constitutive model with an elastic perfectly plastic behavior the elastic plastic behavior is mainly defined by cohesion internal friction angle dilation angle modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as shown in table 5 the piles and tower are assumed to be made of steel material having the typical properties shown in table 2 yielding of the steel is not considered in this study the concrete damaged plasticity model available in abaqus is used to model the infilled concrete this model is a continuum plasticity based damage model for concrete it is assumed that the two main failure mechanisms are tensile cracking and compressive crushing of the concrete material abaqus 2013 four parameters are required to fully describe the yield surface and the flow rule in the three dimensional stress space including the dilation angle ψ the ratio of compressive strength under biaxial loading to uniaxial compressive strength f b 0 f b plastic flow potential eccentricity ε and the ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compress meridian k c the values of these parameters are set as 55 1 1 0 1 and 0 67 krahl et al 2018 shafieifar et al 2017 the concrete between the outer and inner tubes is considered to be confined and an equivalent concrete model is adopted ye et al 2017 the confined concrete is then introduced into abaqus a uniaxial compressive stress σ versus strain ε relationship is given as follows 14 y 2 χ χ 2 χ 1 χ β 0 χ 1 2 χ χ 1 where χ ε ε 0 y σ f c f c is the cylindrical compressive strength of infill concrete in n mm2 and is equal to 0 85 f c u f c u is the cube strength of infill concrete ε 0 and β 0 are determined as 15 ε 0 1300 12 5 f c 800 ξ 0 2 10 6 16 β 0 1 18 10 5 0 25 ξ 0 5 7 f c 0 5 0 12 where ξ is the confinement factor that can be calculated as 17 ξ a s f y s a c f c k where a s and a c are the cross section areas of the outer steel tube and the infill concrete f y s is the yield stress of the steel f c k is the characteristic strength of the infill concrete equivalent to 0 67 f c u the infilled concrete between the outer and inner tubes of cfdst under wave and wind loads may be subjected to tension the simplified stress strain relationship of infill concrete under tension is assumed as follows the tensile stress increases linearly with the increase in tensile strain after concrete cracking it decreases linearly with further increase in strain and approaches zero the ultimate tensile strain of infill concrete is specified as 10 times the cracking strain and the cracking strain is set as 0 0001 mirzazadeh and green 2017 5 3 interaction properties the soil pile and concrete pile interactions are modeled using a surface to surface contact formulation in abaqus standard in this approach the master surface is defined as a surface belonging to the material that is relatively stiff or has finer mesh geometry and the slave surface corresponds to the softer material or material with a coarser mesh johnson et al 2001 the pile surface is defined as the master surface and the soil and concrete surfaces in contact with the pile are defined as the slave surface in the normal direction the interface contact is assumed to be a hard contact and no separation was allowed when the surfaces are in contact any contact pressure can be transmitted between them the surfaces are separated if the contact pressure is reduced to zero in the tangential direction the classical isotropic coulomb friction model is used to simulate the shear resistance interaction johnson et al 2001 strömblad 2014 sheng et al 2005 the friction coefficient μ for the interface between the pile and the soil is simply taken as μ tan 2 3 φ where φ is the friction angle of the soil for the interface between the pile and the concrete values of 0 2 0 3 are typically used as they provide acceptable results compared to experiments in this study the friction coefficient μ between the pile and the concrete is selected as 0 3 hassanein et al 2018 5 4 model validation for the reference wind turbine model compatible with the conventional monopile foundation our fem is validated by comparing the computed results with the field measurements at natural frequencies shirzadeh et al 2013 and with full scale lateral loading test data hokmabadi et al 2012 shirzadeh et al 2013 reported the field measurements of the first fore aft mode frequency for a 3 mw offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile in the belgian north sea the overspeed stop test and ambient excitation were used to estimate the first for aft mode frequency based on the available soil monopile tower and turbine data from shirzadeh et al 2013 a 3d fem is developed using abaqus the comparative results of the finite element analysis with the reported results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that the result of the finite element analysis is in good agreement with that of the reported results hokmabadi et al 2012 reported full scale load tests to investigate the behavior of offshore monopiles in marine sandy soils the length and diameter of the monopile were approximately 34 m and 1 78 m respectively a 3d fem similar to that developed in the present study is established using abaqus for this monopile supported wind turbine with soil and pile properties taken from hokmabadi et al 2012 the result of pile head load versus pile head deflection obtained from the finite element analysis is presented in fig 5 showing a reasonably good agreement 6 results and discussion this section presents the numerical results for hybrid and conventional monopile foundations the results include the horizontal loads the natural frequency the lateral displacement and the rotation of the monopile under the sls the maximum von mises stress of the monopile under the uls the optimum of the embedded length and materials cost of the hybrid monopile the outer diameter ratio λ is a key design parameter that plays an important role in the performance of the hybrid monopile to investigate its influence λ was chosen to be 1 0 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 6 1 horizontal load and bending moment along monopile using the load calculation methods described above the wind wave and current loads are determined based on the met ocean conditions at site nl 1 the total horizontal load and the bending moment along the monopile with different λ values under the sls are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 where the horizontal axis represent the cross sectional load and bending moment at different levels of the monopile respectively it can be seen that the change in λ directly influences the horizontal load and bending moment profiles along the monopile and they all have a decreasing tendency as λ decreases at mudline as the λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 the horizontal load and the bending moment are reduced by almost 41 8 and 19 5 respectively it is indicated that the reduction of the pile diameter can effectively reduce the total external load for the monopile 6 2 natural frequency the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine is a major design driver for the monopile support structure since it defines the dynamic behavior of the structure velarde 2016 the overall natural frequency must not coincide with the excitation frequencies due to wind and waves in design practice the first natural frequency f 1 lies between the frequencies 1p rotor speed frequency and 3p blade passing frequency which is called the soft stiff design o kelly and arshad 2016 based on the rotor speeds as shown in table 1 the first natural frequency f 1 is required to be in a range between 0 202 hz 1p and 0 345 hz 3p to avoid resonance if the calculation uncertainties 5 are included dnv gl 2016 the above range goes from 0 212 hz to 0 328 hz the linear perturbation method is used to determine f 1 and f 2 as shown in table 7 all f 1 fall within the allowable soft stiff region 1p 3p and all f 2 fall well above the maximum limit of the 3p operational 0 636 hz consequently the hybrid monopile can be considered safe from resonance or resonance related effects in table 7 as λ is reduced from 1 0 to 0 7 f 1 is reduced from 0 233 hz to 0 217 hz and f 2 is reduced from 1 447 hz to 1 395 hz by about 6 9 and 3 6 respectively these changes are due to the fact that the stiffness remains constant as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 but the mass of the monopile increases due to the use of cfdst 6 3 pile stress distribution under the uls the stress distribution of the outer steel tube is shown in fig 8 the maximum von mises stresses of the outer steel tube of the hybrid monopile are 142 7 127 8 124 3 and 105 5 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are located at the cross section above the top surface of the concrete these values are below the permissible value of 355 mpa the maximum von mises stress of the pile for λ 1 0 is 82 3 mpa which is located near the mudline fig 9 shows the tensile and compressive stress distribution of the concrete the maximum compressive stresses are far below the compressive strength of the uhpc 150 mpa the maximum tensile stresses are 7 7 7 9 9 4 and 9 5 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are less than the tensile strength of uhpc 10 mpa and therefore the concrete will not crack the stress distributions of the inner steel tube of the hybrid monopile are depicted in fig 10 the maximum cross section von mises stresses are 15 8 27 2 35 6 and 49 4 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are far less than the permissible value of 355 mpa therefore the cfdst structure is safe under the uls 6 4 global buckling check under the uls for the ultimate strength of the monopile the buckling stability should be checked using a rational and justifiable engineering approach dnv gl 2016 buckling refers to sudden collapse of the structure either globally or locally for the hybrid monopile the mechanical shear connectors should be used to achieve the composite action in concrete filled double skin steel tubes and can be beneficial for local buckling prevention eom et al 2019 the local buckling of both steel tubes can be effectively constrained due to the presence of infilled uhpc concrete wang et al 2019 therefore the local buckling will be complicated and delayed such detailed analysis does not included in this paper the global buckling is checked according to standard for design of steel structures gb 50017 2017 and technical specification for concrete filled double skin steel tubular structures cces 2018 as shown in fig 11 the global buckling utilization ratios of the conventional and novel monopiles are far less than 1 0 this indicates the present hybrid monopile is not likely to suffer from global buckling failure 6 5 pile deformation under the sls figs 12 and 13 show the comparison of lateral deflection and rotation along the pile for different λ values under the sls respectively it is obvious that its lateral deformation decreases when λ decreases as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 the lateral deflection and the rotation in the mudline are reduced from 19 3 to 12 8 mm about 33 7 and from 0 104 to 0 072 about 30 8 respectively the critical depth as a transition point from positive to negative displacement is also reduced from 19 to 17 m in addition the lateral deflection and rotation at the pile toe is also reduced from 1 52 to 1 07 mm about 19 6 and from 0 0047 to 0 0021 about 55 these are attributed to the reduction of horizontal wave loads by reducing λ 6 6 permanent accumulated rotation at mudline under the sls in most cases the permanent deformation tolerance of the pile under the sls is design driving for monopiles in sandy soils velarde 2016 schmoor and achmus 2015 senanayake 2016 the deformation tolerances are usually given in the design basis and are often specified in terms of maximum tolerance rotations of the pile at the mudline in a vertical plane typically the tolerance for the total rotation is 0 5 and the installation tolerance is 0 25 then the limit for permanent accumulated rotation becomes 0 25 for sls loads throughout the design life dnv gl 2016 according to schmoor and achmus 2015 the accumulated rotation of the pile at mudline can be estimated with the empirical exponential approach as follows 18 θ n θ 1 ζ s d m where θ n is the pile accumulated rotation by n cycles of lateral load θ 1 is the rotation obtained in the first loading cycle which can be calculated in a static analysis under the sls loads ζ s d m is derived from the stiffness degradation method sdm presented in kuo 2008 and achmus et al 2009 which is 19 ζ s d m e a 1 208 ln h h l p i l e γ d l p i l e 3 b 0 588 1 where l p i l e is the pile embedded length in m h is the horizontal force in kn h is the moment arm in m 31 6 m 36 5 m 38 6 m 40 9 m and 43 6 m for λ 1 0 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively γ 10 k n m 3 is the soil effective unit weight a and b are regression parameters and take values of 1 361 and 1 331 for the sls number of cycles n 100 according to schmoor and achmus 2015 and barari et al 2017 the pile permanent accumulated rotation θ n at mudline under the sls loads is presented in table 8 it can be clearly seen that the overall trend of θ n decreases with λ as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 θ n reduces from 0 145 to 0 095 about 34 5 therefore it is possible to optimize the geometry of the monopile while maintaining a similar accumulated rotation at mudline with that of the conventional monopile λ 1 0 this can lead to a more economical design 7 embedded length optimization for hybrid monopile to compare the embedded length between the hybrid monopile and the conventional monopile oc3 two major design drivers are selected for monopile foundation one is the pile permanent accumulated rotation θ n at mudline under the sls the other is the natural frequency f 1 f 2 of the overall support structure during the comparison process θ n remains similar between the hybrid and the conventional monopile f 1 lies in the desired range i e between 0 212 hz and 0 328 hz f 2 falls above the maximum limit of the 3p operational the diameter and wall thickness of the embedded pile of the hybrid monopile remain constant several embedded pile length ratio β 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 are selected 20 β l p i l e l p i l e o c 3 where l p i l e o c 3 36 m is the pile embedded length for the reference model for different cases of β a total of 20 4 5 finite element models are established for calculating the pile rotation in the first loading cycle θ 1 as shown in table 9 when β is reduced from 1 0 to 0 6 the value of θ 1 is increased by nearly 22 26 27 and 26 2 for λ values of 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively the pile accumulated rotations with different β are calculated with eqs 18 and 19 as shown in fig 14 θ n at mudline increases with decreasing β specifically when λ 0 85 0 80 0 75 and 0 70 β decreases from 1 0 to 0 6 and θ n increases by 48 54 55 7 and 55 respectively this means that the embedded pile length has a significant impact on the pile accumulated rotation the conventional monopile is taken with λ 1 0 and β 1 0 and in this case the accumulated permanent rotation at mudline is 0 145 for the same accumulated permanent rotation at mudline values of λ and β are varied for hybrid monopile and an optimum condition is achieved as shown in fig 14 the results show that the equal accumulated permanent rotation is achieved for λ 0 85 at 75 of the embedded pile length similarly for λ 0 80 0 75 and 0 6 the same accumulated permanent rotation is achieved at 69 65 5 and 61 of the embedded pile length respectively fig 15 shows the first natural frequency of the nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine supported by the hybrid monopile foundation the reduction in β from 1 0 to 0 6 has little effect on the first natural frequency under different λ conditions the first natural frequency is less than that of the comparative model oc3 λ 1 0 β 1 0 on decreasing by 3 7 4 4 5 6 and 7 7 for λ 0 85 0 80 0 75 and 0 70 respectively which are within the desired range of 0 212 hz and 0 328 hz as shown in fig 16 the second natural frequencies are all above the above the maximum limit of the 3p operational 0 636 hz and are less than that of the comparative model 8 cost comparison for hybrid monopile and oc3 monopile in general costs for monopile foundation include those for materials fabrication installation transport and maintenance among them the material weights and costs are relatively straightforward to estimate but costs related to installation manufacturing and transport muskulus and schafhirt 2014 are complicated and depend on many factors in the present study we focus mainly on the comparison of costs of materials for the hybrid type and the conventional type of monopile in doing this a steel weight ratio w s is defined as the ratio between the weight of the hybrid monopile w s t e e l n o v e l and the weight of the conventional monopile w s t e e l o c 3 21 w s w s t e e l n o v e l w s t e e l o c 3 for steel a price of 10000 ton including the cost for raw material and labor miic 2018 is supposed ultra high performance concrete is much more expensive than normal concrete and the price depends on the formulation of products for various applications christopher et al 2017 the price also varies in different markets and regions around the world npca 2015 according to xu 2015 the unit price of uhpc is from 1000 ton to 1200 ton the unit price of nanodur compound 5941 available in the market is about 2800 ton to 3420 ton 366 ton to 446 ton uhpc 2017 therefore a range of values of unit price for uhpc 1500 ton to 3500 ton is used in the cost estimation the total material cost c t o t is calculated as 22 c t o t c c w c c s w s where c c and w c are the unit price and weight of uhpc respectively c s and w s are the unit price and weight of steel respectively fig 17 illustrates the effects of λ on the material weight of the hybrid monopile compared to the conventional monopile the total weight of the hybrid monopile increases nearly by 1 85 times while the steel weight ratio w s decreases by 55 7 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 as a result the total material cost c t o t of the hybrid monopiles is less than that of the convention monopile in most situations fig 18 shows that c t o t increases with the increase of the unit price of uhpc c c and the magnitude of increase becomes larger as λ decreases for example in the case of c c 3500 ton the total material cost for the hybrid monopile is reduced approximately 13 6 18 9 20 7 and 18 3 for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively this suggests that the hybrid type of monopile is a cost effective alternative to the conventional type of monopile for offshore wind turbines 9 conclusions this paper presents a hybrid type of monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines and investigates its feasibility by a comprehensive numerical analysis the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a conventional monopile is used as a reference model for comparison the natural frequency and the structural responses under the sls and uls conditions are computed and compared the main results are summarized as follows a compared to the conventional monopile oc3 λ 1 0 the horizontal load at mudline for the hybrid monopile can be reduced by 22 8 29 5 35 9 and 41 8 respectively at λ values of 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 and the bending moment can be reduced by 10 7 13 7 16 7 and 19 5 respectively this indicates that the hybrid monopile can effectively reduce the total external load on the pile b the first natural frequency of the system decreases by approximately 7 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 and the natural frequencies at various λ values remain between the frequencies 1p rotor speed frequency and 3p blade passing frequency this is due to the fact that the cross sectional stiffness remains unchanged for the hybrid type and the conventional type of monopile but the mass of the hybrid monopile increases c under the ultimate limit state the maximum stresses in the steel tube pile and in the filled concrete do not exceed the permissible stresses d under the serviceability limit state the permanent accumulated rotation at mudline is reduced from 0 145 to 0 095 about 34 5 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 this is mainly due to the reduction of wave loads on the hybrid monopile considering that the permanent accumulated rotation under the sls is a major design driver for monopile foundation the embedded pile length can possibly be optimized to achieve a more economical design e using the proposed optimization criteria the embedded length of the hybrid monopile can be reduced by 25 31 34 5 and 39 for λ being 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively this indicates that the steel weight and the relevant cost can be significantly reduced the hybrid monopile therefore is a cost effective alternative to the conventional monopile for offshore wind turbines last but not least it should be noted that a number of issues need to be studied for practical use of the new type of monopile such as the detailed connection between the concrete and the steel tube the fatigue performance of the concrete and the nonlinear wave theory used for prediction of wave loads on the hybrid

22081,this paper presents a hybrid monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines it is an ultra high performance concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure cfdst used as a replacement of the conventional steel tube between the water level and the mudline so as to reduce the monopile diameter and thereby reducing the wave loads on the pile to study the feasibility of this monopile the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a conventional monopile is selected as a reference and a three dimensional 3d finite element model is developed the natural frequency the various responses under the serviceability limit state sls and the ultimate limit state uls of the hybrid monopile are presented particularly the effect of varying outer diameter of the cfdst on the structural performance is investigated by applying a consistent accumulated rotation at the mudline under the sls the natural frequency is found to be within a desired range and an optimized embedded length of the hybrid monopile is determined the results indicate that the proposed hybrid monopile is able to meet the design requirements for both sls and uls and the optimization of pile embedded length leads to an efficient and economic monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines keywords offshore wind turbine monopile concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure accumulated rotation natural frequency 1 introduction offshore wind energy has become one of the fastest growing sustainable energy sources at the end of 2017 the global capacity of offshore wind energy reached over 18 8 gw gw nearly 84 of which is located in european countries and the remaining 16 is located mainly in china gwec 2017 the united kingdom maintains the largest offshore wind market accounting for over 36 of installed capacity followed by germany 28 5 while china ranks third in the global offshore rankings accounting for 15 gwec 2017 ren21 2017 windeurope expects that by the year 2020 the total european offshore wind capacity will reach 25 gw gwec 2017 while china s offshore wind target will reach 5 gw ou et al 2018 although offshore wind energy has undergone a rapid development in recent years the levelized cost of energy lcoe for offshore wind turbines is still much higher than that of onshore wind turbines and it is also significantly higher than the lcoe of conventional power plants such as energy from coal or gas andres et al 2017 gentils et al 2017 if offshore wind turbines are installed in deeper waters and on larger scales the lcoe will increase further schwanitz and wierling 2016 this makes it difficult for offshore wind energy to have a competitive price in the energy market bocher et al 2018 for offshore wind turbines the foundation cost amounts to over 20 of the total capital cost gentils et al 2017 kim and kim 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective foundation for offshore wind turbines at present different types of foundations exist for offshore wind turbines such as monopiles tripods suction caissons jackets and gravity foundations o kelly and arshad 2016 among them monopile is the dominant foundation type due to several advantages o kelly and arshad 2016 álamo et al 2018 generally a monopile comprises of a transition piece and a single large diameter open ended tubular steel pipe that is driven drilled or vibrated into the seabed typically monopile diameters vary from 4 to 6 m with the slenderness ratio ratio between the embedded length and the diameter between 4 and 8 most of monopiles are installed in water depths not exceeding 25 m murphy et al 2018 scharff and siems 2013 negro et al 2017 as wind farms move further offshore wind turbines will need to move into much deeper waters and withstand greater loads from waves and winds as a result the cost can increase dramatically therefore many studies have been performed with the aim of reducing the cost of monopiles through structural optimization gentils et al 2017 muskulus and schafhirt 2014 schmoor and achmus 2015 gjersøe et al 2015 kallehave et al 2015 rad et al 2014 while the structural optimization may contribute to finding better and more economic solutions the tendency of rapid increase in monopile cost with the increase in water depth cannot change in the design of monopiles the wave and wind loads are the critical concerns arany et al 2017 morató et al 2017 stansby et al 2013 generally the proportions of wave and wind loads are related to the water depth and the wave loads become significant for greater water depths and wave heights which results in a larger area applying wave loads and a larger moment arm for those wave loads leading to larger mudline stresses in the support structure moreover wave load depends not only on the marine environment but also on the size of the monopile according to dnv gl 2016 the total horizontal force on a monopile due to waves consists of drag force and inertia force the drag force is directly proportional to the diameter of the monopile whereas the inertia force is directly proportional to the square of the diameter of the monopile in this respect a reduction in the diameter of the monopile can reduce the wave load on the monopile the main design considerations for a monopile supported wind turbine include natural frequency stability structural strength and fatigue as well as allowable deformations of the system during operation dnv gl 2016 velarde 2016 typically governed by permanent deformations under the sls and natural frequency velarde 2016 schmoor and achmus 2015 senanayake 2016 in order to reduce the wave loads by reducing the diameter of the monopile while still satisfying the design requirements two measures have been developed one is to reduce the diameter of the monopile only for the portion between the mudline and the water level and the other is to use concrete filled double skin steel tubular structure cfdst for that portion of the monopile cfdst can be regarded as a composite member that is constructed by filling concrete between two concentrically placed steel tubes it utilizes advantages of both steel and concrete han 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang 2017 and has been considered as loading bearing elements in some structural engineering applications such as high piers for bridges columns for high rise buildings support columns for offshore platforms and transmissions towers han et al 2011 hassanein et al 2018 uenaka 2016 compared to pure steel tubular cfdst has a high load bearing capacity high rigidity good energy absorption high fire resistance and construction cost effectiveness wang et al 2018 li et al 2018 therefore the use of cfdst instead of steel tubular can fulfill the capacity and stiffness requirements with a reduced pile diameter if ultra high performance concrete uhpc is used instead of normal strength concrete in cfdst the sectional size of the monopile can be further reduced zhang 2017 chen et al 2018 in this paper we present a feasibility study using cfdst as part of a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is adopted as a reference model we investigated the structural responses using the finite element method fem for two foundation types one is the conventional monopile and the other is the proposed hybrid monopile detailed comparisons are made for both the sls and the uls furthermore attempt is made to optimize the embedded length of the hybrid monopile using the accumulated rotation at mudline and the natural frequency as design driving parameters 2 concept description for hybrid monopile the key idea here is to reduce the diameter of the portion of the monopile between the mudline and the water level by replacing the pure steel tubular structure with the cfdst such that the wave load can be reduced fig 1 compares the geometric shapes of conventional and hybrid monopiles the conventional monopile foundation consists of the pile and the transition piece that connects the pile to the tower the proposed hybrid foundation consists of the pile and the cfdst the outer steel tube of cfdst can be fabricated together with the pile through a conical steel tube in practice the mechanical shear connectors e g eom et al 2019 shimizu et al 2013 thang et al 2016 yan et al 2016 can be used to achieve the composite action in concrete filled double skin steel tubes providing shear resistance and minimizing slip at the steel concrete interface a transition piece is set in the hybrid monopile and grouted to the cfdst the tower is connected to the transition piece by means of bolts on the top flange the details of the cfdst are shown in fig 2 in this paper we focused on a feasibility study using cfdsf as part of a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines the mechanical shear connector and transition piece are not modeled in detail and the tower is connected directly to the outer tube of the cfdst the length of the conical steel tube l t p is set to 7 m gentils et al 2017 the outer diameter of the outer steel tube d o u t e r is smaller than the diameter of the pile and is related to the wall thickness t o u t e r as dnv gl 2016 1 t o u t e r 6 35 d o u t e r 100 m m where d o u t e r is the outer diameter of the outer steel tube of the cfdst the inner steel tube is like a concrete formwork with a constant wall thickness t i n n e r 0 02 m and the outer diameter of the inner steel tube is calculated as follows 2 d i n n e r d o u t e r 2 t o u t e r 2 t c where d i n n e r is the outer diameter of inner steel tube of the cfdst t c is the concrete thickness of cfdst the total second moment of inertia for a cfdst structure can approximately be estimated by the sum of the second moment of inertia for the outer steel tube the concrete and the inner steel tube huang 2005 though cfdst structures have been shown to perform well under a variety of loading conditions liang et al 2019 li et al 2019 wang et al 2016 there is still limited knowledge regarding the interaction between the concrete and the outer and inner steel tubes especially for large diameter monopile structures we used a simple method to approximately estimate the concrete thickness of the cfdst structures the concrete thickness of the cfdst structure is approximately calculated by an equivalent stiffness between the cross section of the cfdst and the pile of the reference monopile which is an input for our fem model the performance of the cfdst structure under different loading conditions is then examined by the comprehensive fem analysis not by the simplified method 3 i c e s i p i l e e s i o u t e r e s i i n n e r e c 4 t c d o u t e r 2 t o u t e r d o u t e r 2

peeringa 2016 the hybrid monopile foundation can be fabricated onshore and transported to designated location using floating method after which it will be upended and vibro driving into the seabed to the required depth maryruth 2014 from the viewpoint of fabrication cost filling the void between the tubes with concrete will lead to thinner shells and smaller diameters of tubes and therefore less steel fabrication costs although use of concrete will add extra fabrication cost compared with the traditional pure steel monopile the tubes themselves act as the concrete formwork and thereby the cost for concrete fabrication is minimal 3 reference model nrel 5 mw turbine supported on oc3 monopile we use the nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 as a reference model this wind turbine has been used as a reference by research teams around the world to quantify the benefits of advanced offshore wind energy technologies gentils et al 2017 morató et al 2017 its main characteristics are described in table 1 the nrel 5 mw is considered to be supported by a monopile foundation with a water depth of 20 m designed during the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project for the international energy agency iea the height of the tower is 77 6 m with a base diameter of 6 m and a top diameter of 3 87 m the monopile has a length of 56 m and a constant section with an outer diameter of 6 m and a thickness of 60 mm the 36 meter monopile was driven into layered sandy soils and the remaining 20 m was from the seabed up to the sea level the dimensions of the pile transition piece and tower and the soil profile are depicted in fig 3 the pile is connected to the tower through a transition piece attached by grout at 10 m above the mean sea level msl the tower is bolted together with a transition pie through the internal flange bolt the material properties of the pile tower and transition piece are based on s355 steel whose density is increased by 8 to account for secondary steel appurtenances coatings and welds in this study a commercial grout material ducorit d4 is selected it is commonly used in grouted connections on offshore wind turbines the mechanical properties of structural steel and grout are summarized in table 2 in order to compare the hybrid and conventional monopile foundations similar wind turbines towers site and met ocean conditions used in the oc3 project are selected for the hybrid monopile study the distance between the mudline and the tower bottom l m p t o p is 30 m and the water depth h w is 20 m the diameter ratio λ is defined as the ratio between the outer tube of the cfdst and the outer diameter of the conventional monopile which is shown as follows 5 λ d o u t e r d where d is the outer diameter of the conventional monopile it is assumed that a kind of ultra high performance concrete uhpc is used to fill into the gap between the outer and inner tubes of the hybrid monopile according to some specifications uhpc 2017 jammes et al 2013 the design parameters for uhpc are listed in table 2 the thickness of the concrete ring given in table 3 is calculated by eq 4 4 load determination 4 1 site specific met ocean conditions offshore wind turbine foundations are designed based on the met ocean conditions which highly depend on the location of the project the site considered is located at the dutch sector of the north sea 8 km away from the shore of ijmuiden city and is referred to as the nl 1 location in gentils et al 2017 the general characteristics of the site met ocean conditions are summarized in table 4 4 2 permanent loads permanent load refers to the weight of the complete structure which includes the weights of the tower monopile rotor nacelle assembly rna and blades 4 3 aerodynamic wind loads the wind load acting on the turbine rotors is estimated to be arany et al 2017 6 f v h 0 5 π ρ a r t 2 v h u b 2 c t where f v h is the wind load acting on the hub in n r t is the radius of the rotor in m

and earthquakes 4 5 design load combinations two sets of load combinations are used to assess the feasibility of the new monopile foundation one corresponds to the sls one corresponds to the sls which includes a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s under a combined effect of wave and current loads whose return period is 50 years with a load factor of 1 0 for all load categories the other corresponds to the uls and under characteristic load effects similar to the sls the load factors are equal to 1 0 and 1 35 for permanent and environmental loads respectively dnv gl 2016 5 numerical modelling and verification in order to comprehensively analyze the wind turbine pile soil system a three dimensional 3d finite element model fem is constructed using the software abaqus as shown in fig 4 the key geometric parameters are summarized in figs 1 and 2 and tables 1 and 3 the fem model consists of seven main components namely turbine tower steel pile concrete the soil around the pile the soil inside the pile ma et al 2017 and infinite boundary elements strömblad 2014 the wind turbine load is applied to the finite element model at tower top the tower is divided into nine segments and the wind load acts as a concentrated load at each segment the wave load and current load per unit length are calculated using eq 9 and eq 13 respectively they are assumed to act as uniform load on the surface of the monopile foundation in the fe model two cases of monopile are investigated for comparison purposes one is the conventional monopile and the other case is the hybrid monopile 5 1 geometric configuration the size of the soil domain in the fem is 162 162 72 m 40 46 the lower boundary is fixed against movements in all directions and the 30 m thick layer of infinite soil creates vertical boundaries that do not reflect shear waves in the soil medium the continuum element type c3d8r is used to model the soil the outer layer of the soil is modeled using a single layer of solid infinite element cin3d8 the tower and the piles are modeled using shell elements s4r the concrete is modeled using the continuum element type c3d8r the nacelle is modeled as a lumped mass at the top node of the tower with a rotational inertia as specified in table 1 with contribution from the mass of the rotor nacelle and blades 5 2 material model and properties the soil is simply represented by a mohr coulomb constitutive model with an elastic perfectly plastic behavior the elastic plastic behavior is mainly defined by cohesion internal friction angle dilation angle modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as shown in table 5 the piles and tower are assumed to be made of steel material having the typical properties shown in table 2 yielding of the steel is not considered in this study the concrete damaged plasticity model available in abaqus is used to model the infilled concrete this model is a continuum plasticity based damage model for concrete it is assumed that the two main failure mechanisms are tensile cracking and compressive crushing of the concrete material abaqus 2013 four parameters are required to fully describe the yield surface and the flow rule in the three dimensional stress space including the dilation angle ψ the ratio of compressive strength under biaxial loading to uniaxial compressive strength f b 0 f b plastic flow potential eccentricity ε and the ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compress meridian k c the values of these parameters are set as 55 1 1 0 1 and 0 67 krahl et al 2018 shafieifar et al 2017 the concrete between the outer and inner tubes is considered to be confined and an equivalent concrete model is adopted ye et al 2017 the confined concrete is then introduced into abaqus a uniaxial compressive stress σ versus strain ε relationship is given as follows 14 y 2 χ χ 2 χ 1 χ β 0 χ 1 2 χ χ 1 where χ ε ε 0 y σ f c f c is the cylindrical compressive strength of infill concrete in n mm2 and is equal to 0 85 f c u f c u is the cube strength of infill concrete ε 0 and β 0 are determined as 15 ε 0 1300 12 5 f c 800 ξ 0 2 10 6 16 β 0 1 18 10 5 0 25 ξ 0 5 7 f c 0 5 0 12 where ξ is the confinement factor that can be calculated as 17 ξ a s f y s a c f c k where a s and a c are the cross section areas of the outer steel tube and the infill concrete f y s is the yield stress of the steel f c k is the characteristic strength of the infill concrete equivalent to 0 67 f c u the infilled concrete between the outer and inner tubes of cfdst under wave and wind loads may be subjected to tension the simplified stress strain relationship of infill concrete under tension is assumed as follows the tensile stress increases linearly with the increase in tensile strain after concrete cracking it decreases linearly with further increase in strain and approaches zero the ultimate tensile strain of infill concrete is specified as 10 times the cracking strain and the cracking strain is set as 0 0001 mirzazadeh and green 2017 5 3 interaction properties the soil pile and concrete pile interactions are modeled using a surface to surface contact formulation in abaqus standard in this approach the master surface is defined as a surface belonging to the material that is relatively stiff or has finer mesh geometry and the slave surface corresponds to the softer material or material with a coarser mesh johnson et al 2001 the pile surface is defined as the master surface and the soil and concrete surfaces in contact with the pile are defined as the slave surface in the normal direction the interface contact is assumed to be a hard contact and no separation was allowed when the surfaces are in contact any contact pressure can be transmitted between them the surfaces are separated if the contact pressure is reduced to zero in the tangential direction the classical isotropic coulomb friction model is used to simulate the shear resistance interaction johnson et al 2001 strömblad 2014 sheng et al 2005 the friction coefficient μ for the interface between the pile and the soil is simply taken as μ tan 2 3 φ where φ is the friction angle of the soil for the interface between the pile and the concrete values of 0 2 0 3 are typically used as they provide acceptable results compared to experiments in this study the friction coefficient μ between the pile and the concrete is selected as 0 3 hassanein et al 2018 5 4 model validation for the reference wind turbine model compatible with the conventional monopile foundation our fem is validated by comparing the computed results with the field measurements at natural frequencies shirzadeh et al 2013 and with full scale lateral loading test data hokmabadi et al 2012 shirzadeh et al 2013 reported the field measurements of the first fore aft mode frequency for a 3 mw offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile in the belgian north sea the overspeed stop test and ambient excitation were used to estimate the first for aft mode frequency based on the available soil monopile tower and turbine data from shirzadeh et al 2013 a 3d fem is developed using abaqus the comparative results of the finite element analysis with the reported results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that the result of the finite element analysis is in good agreement with that of the reported results hokmabadi et al 2012 reported full scale load tests to investigate the behavior of offshore monopiles in marine sandy soils the length and diameter of the monopile were approximately 34 m and 1 78 m respectively a 3d fem similar to that developed in the present study is established using abaqus for this monopile supported wind turbine with soil and pile properties taken from hokmabadi et al 2012 the result of pile head load versus pile head deflection obtained from the finite element analysis is presented in fig 5 showing a reasonably good agreement 6 results and discussion this section presents the numerical results for hybrid and conventional monopile foundations the results include the horizontal loads the natural frequency the lateral displacement and the rotation of the monopile under the sls the maximum von mises stress of the monopile under the uls the optimum of the embedded length and materials cost of the hybrid monopile the outer diameter ratio λ is a key design parameter that plays an important role in the performance of the hybrid monopile to investigate its influence λ was chosen to be 1 0 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 6 1 horizontal load and bending moment along monopile using the load calculation methods described above the wind wave and current loads are determined based on the met ocean conditions at site nl 1 the total horizontal load and the bending moment along the monopile with different λ values under the sls are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 where the horizontal axis represent the cross sectional load and bending moment at different levels of the monopile respectively it can be seen that the change in λ directly influences the horizontal load and bending moment profiles along the monopile and they all have a decreasing tendency as λ decreases at mudline as the λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 the horizontal load and the bending moment are reduced by almost 41 8 and 19 5 respectively it is indicated that the reduction of the pile diameter can effectively reduce the total external load for the monopile 6 2 natural frequency the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine is a major design driver for the monopile support structure since it defines the dynamic behavior of the structure velarde 2016 the overall natural frequency must not coincide with the excitation frequencies due to wind and waves in design practice the first natural frequency f 1 lies between the frequencies 1p rotor speed frequency and 3p blade passing frequency which is called the soft stiff design o kelly and arshad 2016 based on the rotor speeds as shown in table 1 the first natural frequency f 1 is required to be in a range between 0 202 hz 1p and 0 345 hz 3p to avoid resonance if the calculation uncertainties 5 are included dnv gl 2016 the above range goes from 0 212 hz to 0 328 hz the linear perturbation method is used to determine f 1 and f 2 as shown in table 7 all f 1 fall within the allowable soft stiff region 1p 3p and all f 2 fall well above the maximum limit of the 3p operational 0 636 hz consequently the hybrid monopile can be considered safe from resonance or resonance related effects in table 7 as λ is reduced from 1 0 to 0 7 f 1 is reduced from 0 233 hz to 0 217 hz and f 2 is reduced from 1 447 hz to 1 395 hz by about 6 9 and 3 6 respectively these changes are due to the fact that the stiffness remains constant as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 but the mass of the monopile increases due to the use of cfdst 6 3 pile stress distribution under the uls the stress distribution of the outer steel tube is shown in fig 8 the maximum von mises stresses of the outer steel tube of the hybrid monopile are 142 7 127 8 124 3 and 105 5 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are located at the cross section above the top surface of the concrete these values are below the permissible value of 355 mpa the maximum von mises stress of the pile for λ 1 0 is 82 3 mpa which is located near the mudline fig 9 shows the tensile and compressive stress distribution of the concrete the maximum compressive stresses are far below the compressive strength of the uhpc 150 mpa the maximum tensile stresses are 7 7 7 9 9 4 and 9 5 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are less than the tensile strength of uhpc 10 mpa and therefore the concrete will not crack the stress distributions of the inner steel tube of the hybrid monopile are depicted in fig 10 the maximum cross section von mises stresses are 15 8 27 2 35 6 and 49 4 mpa for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively which are far less than the permissible value of 355 mpa therefore the cfdst structure is safe under the uls 6 4 global buckling check under the uls for the ultimate strength of the monopile the buckling stability should be checked using a rational and justifiable engineering approach dnv gl 2016 buckling refers to sudden collapse of the structure either globally or locally for the hybrid monopile the mechanical shear connectors should be used to achieve the composite action in concrete filled double skin steel tubes and can be beneficial for local buckling prevention eom et al 2019 the local buckling of both steel tubes can be effectively constrained due to the presence of infilled uhpc concrete wang et al 2019 therefore the local buckling will be complicated and delayed such detailed analysis does not included in this paper the global buckling is checked according to standard for design of steel structures gb 50017 2017 and technical specification for concrete filled double skin steel tubular structures cces 2018 as shown in fig 11 the global buckling utilization ratios of the conventional and novel monopiles are far less than 1 0 this indicates the present hybrid monopile is not likely to suffer from global buckling failure 6 5 pile deformation under the sls figs 12 and 13 show the comparison of lateral deflection and rotation along the pile for different λ values under the sls respectively it is obvious that its lateral deformation decreases when λ decreases as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 the lateral deflection and the rotation in the mudline are reduced from 19 3 to 12 8 mm about 33 7 and from 0 104 to 0 072 about 30 8 respectively the critical depth as a transition point from positive to negative displacement is also reduced from 19 to 17 m in addition the lateral deflection and rotation at the pile toe is also reduced from 1 52 to 1 07 mm about 19 6 and from 0 0047 to 0 0021 about 55 these are attributed to the reduction of horizontal wave loads by reducing λ 6 6 permanent accumulated rotation at mudline under the sls in most cases the permanent deformation tolerance of the pile under the sls is design driving for monopiles in sandy soils velarde 2016 schmoor and achmus 2015 senanayake 2016 the deformation tolerances are usually given in the design basis and are often specified in terms of maximum tolerance rotations of the pile at the mudline in a vertical plane typically the tolerance for the total rotation is 0 5 and the installation tolerance is 0 25 then the limit for permanent accumulated rotation becomes 0 25 for sls loads throughout the design life dnv gl 2016 according to schmoor and achmus 2015 the accumulated rotation of the pile at mudline can be estimated with the empirical exponential approach as follows 18 θ n θ 1 ζ s d m where θ n is the pile accumulated rotation by n cycles of lateral load θ 1 is the rotation obtained in the first loading cycle which can be calculated in a static analysis under the sls loads ζ s d m is derived from the stiffness degradation method sdm presented in kuo 2008 and achmus et al 2009 which is 19 ζ s d m e a 1 208 ln h h l p i l e γ d l p i l e 3 b 0 588 1 where l p i l e is the pile embedded length in m h is the horizontal force in kn h is the moment arm in m 31 6 m 36 5 m 38 6 m 40 9 m and 43 6 m for λ 1 0 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively γ 10 k n m 3 is the soil effective unit weight a and b are regression parameters and take values of 1 361 and 1 331 for the sls number of cycles n 100 according to schmoor and achmus 2015 and barari et al 2017 the pile permanent accumulated rotation θ n at mudline under the sls loads is presented in table 8 it can be clearly seen that the overall trend of θ n decreases with λ as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 θ n reduces from 0 145 to 0 095 about 34 5 therefore it is possible to optimize the geometry of the monopile while maintaining a similar accumulated rotation at mudline with that of the conventional monopile λ 1 0 this can lead to a more economical design 7 embedded length optimization for hybrid monopile to compare the embedded length between the hybrid monopile and the conventional monopile oc3 two major design drivers are selected for monopile foundation one is the pile permanent accumulated rotation θ n at mudline under the sls the other is the natural frequency f 1 f 2 of the overall support structure during the comparison process θ n remains similar between the hybrid and the conventional monopile f 1 lies in the desired range i e between 0 212 hz and 0 328 hz f 2 falls above the maximum limit of the 3p operational the diameter and wall thickness of the embedded pile of the hybrid monopile remain constant several embedded pile length ratio β 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 are selected 20 β l p i l e l p i l e o c 3 where l p i l e o c 3 36 m is the pile embedded length for the reference model for different cases of β a total of 20 4 5 finite element models are established for calculating the pile rotation in the first loading cycle θ 1 as shown in table 9 when β is reduced from 1 0 to 0 6 the value of θ 1 is increased by nearly 22 26 27 and 26 2 for λ values of 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively the pile accumulated rotations with different β are calculated with eqs 18 and 19 as shown in fig 14 θ n at mudline increases with decreasing β specifically when λ 0 85 0 80 0 75 and 0 70 β decreases from 1 0 to 0 6 and θ n increases by 48 54 55 7 and 55 respectively this means that the embedded pile length has a significant impact on the pile accumulated rotation the conventional monopile is taken with λ 1 0 and β 1 0 and in this case the accumulated permanent rotation at mudline is 0 145 for the same accumulated permanent rotation at mudline values of λ and β are varied for hybrid monopile and an optimum condition is achieved as shown in fig 14 the results show that the equal accumulated permanent rotation is achieved for λ 0 85 at 75 of the embedded pile length similarly for λ 0 80 0 75 and 0 6 the same accumulated permanent rotation is achieved at 69 65 5 and 61 of the embedded pile length respectively fig 15 shows the first natural frequency of the nrel 5 mw offshore wind turbine supported by the hybrid monopile foundation the reduction in β from 1 0 to 0 6 has little effect on the first natural frequency under different λ conditions the first natural frequency is less than that of the comparative model oc3 λ 1 0 β 1 0 on decreasing by 3 7 4 4 5 6 and 7 7 for λ 0 85 0 80 0 75 and 0 70 respectively which are within the desired range of 0 212 hz and 0 328 hz as shown in fig 16 the second natural frequencies are all above the above the maximum limit of the 3p operational 0 636 hz and are less than that of the comparative model 8 cost comparison for hybrid monopile and oc3 monopile in general costs for monopile foundation include those for materials fabrication installation transport and maintenance among them the material weights and costs are relatively straightforward to estimate but costs related to installation manufacturing and transport muskulus and schafhirt 2014 are complicated and depend on many factors in the present study we focus mainly on the comparison of costs of materials for the hybrid type and the conventional type of monopile in doing this a steel weight ratio w s is defined as the ratio between the weight of the hybrid monopile w s t e e l n o v e l and the weight of the conventional monopile w s t e e l o c 3 21 w s w s t e e l n o v e l w s t e e l o c 3 for steel a price of 10000 ton including the cost for raw material and labor miic 2018 is supposed ultra high performance concrete is much more expensive than normal concrete and the price depends on the formulation of products for various applications christopher et al 2017 the price also varies in different markets and regions around the world npca 2015 according to xu 2015 the unit price of uhpc is from 1000 ton to 1200 ton the unit price of nanodur compound 5941 available in the market is about 2800 ton to 3420 ton 366 ton to 446 ton uhpc 2017 therefore a range of values of unit price for uhpc 1500 ton to 3500 ton is used in the cost estimation the total material cost c t o t is calculated as 22 c t o t c c w c c s w s where c c and w c are the unit price and weight of uhpc respectively c s and w s are the unit price and weight of steel respectively fig 17 illustrates the effects of λ on the material weight of the hybrid monopile compared to the conventional monopile the total weight of the hybrid monopile increases nearly by 1 85 times while the steel weight ratio w s decreases by 55 7 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 as a result the total material cost c t o t of the hybrid monopiles is less than that of the convention monopile in most situations fig 18 shows that c t o t increases with the increase of the unit price of uhpc c c and the magnitude of increase becomes larger as λ decreases for example in the case of c c 3500 ton the total material cost for the hybrid monopile is reduced approximately 13 6 18 9 20 7 and 18 3 for λ 0 7 0 75 0 8 and 0 85 respectively this suggests that the hybrid type of monopile is a cost effective alternative to the conventional type of monopile for offshore wind turbines 9 conclusions this paper presents a hybrid type of monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines and investigates its feasibility by a comprehensive numerical analysis the nrel 5 mw wind turbine supported by a conventional monopile is used as a reference model for comparison the natural frequency and the structural responses under the sls and uls conditions are computed and compared the main results are summarized as follows a compared to the conventional monopile oc3 λ 1 0 the horizontal load at mudline for the hybrid monopile can be reduced by 22 8 29 5 35 9 and 41 8 respectively at λ values of 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 and the bending moment can be reduced by 10 7 13 7 16 7 and 19 5 respectively this indicates that the hybrid monopile can effectively reduce the total external load on the pile b the first natural frequency of the system decreases by approximately 7 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 and the natural frequencies at various λ values remain between the frequencies 1p rotor speed frequency and 3p blade passing frequency this is due to the fact that the cross sectional stiffness remains unchanged for the hybrid type and the conventional type of monopile but the mass of the hybrid monopile increases c under the ultimate limit state the maximum stresses in the steel tube pile and in the filled concrete do not exceed the permissible stresses d under the serviceability limit state the permanent accumulated rotation at mudline is reduced from 0 145 to 0 095 about 34 5 as λ decreases from 1 0 to 0 7 this is mainly due to the reduction of wave loads on the hybrid monopile considering that the permanent accumulated rotation under the sls is a major design driver for monopile foundation the embedded pile length can possibly be optimized to achieve a more economical design e using the proposed optimization criteria the embedded length of the hybrid monopile can be reduced by 25 31 34 5 and 39 for λ being 0 85 0 8 0 75 and 0 7 respectively this indicates that the steel weight and the relevant cost can be significantly reduced the hybrid monopile therefore is a cost

22082,accurately reproducing multi directional irregular waves in laboratory or numerical wave basin is crucial for in depth study of real wave action on marine structures in this paper the eeed equal energy in each division and ptpd phase time path difference approaches are described and their capability for reconstructing multi directional irregular waves is assessed the key difference between these two methods is the determination of the component wave directions theoretically and arbitrary numerically simulated multi directional waves with different directional distribution width and wave steepness are reconstructed and the latter waves are further reproduced in a numerical wave basin the consistency between the reconstructed and the theoretical measured waves demonstrates the approaches are acceptable furthermore the variation of the quantitative error between the reconstructed and the theoretical measured waves in the spatial domain rr l s is analyzed this variation increases with the size of rr l s but the errors are acceptable as long as this size is reasonable the application ranges are evaluated based on a qualitative comparative analysis between the reconstructed waves and the theoretical measured ones and the quantitative reconstruction error along rr l s the ptpd approach is generally better than eeed method the optimum relative separation for wave gauges using the ptpd approach should be smaller than 0 12l s keywords multi directional irregular waves reconstruction directional distribution width 1 introduction in real ocean conditions sea waves are multi directional irregular waves its wave directionality has an important influence on wave properties and on the wave structure interaction in general wave buoys or wave gauges are used to measure waves at sea and the wave statistical properties in a given region can be represented by the directional spectrum thus estimated this spectrum can be used as an input wave condition to simulate waves or study the wave structure interactions in a laboratory wave basin or a numerical wave tank however for in depth studies of wave properties in ocean engineering reproducing the time series of the measured wave in laboratory basin or numerical wave tank is necessary the deterministic reproduction of arbitrary waves is therefore an important issue in the field of wave simulation the deterministic reproduction of multi directional irregular wave means the reconstruction or reproduction of wave elevation history time series measured at sea or during physical experiments earlier some researchers investigated the reconstruction of 2d unidirectional irregular waves for example based on a fourier series expansion in space and time baldock and swan 1994 constructed a numerical model to solve for the periodic nonlinear unsteady state wave train in water surface elevation their numerical time series was in excellent agreement with laboratory data liang et al 2010 numerically inputted the wave maker motion signals by means of fft decomposition of an experimental wave train into many small amplitude waves with different initial phase angles they successfully reconstructed the experimental wave time series in those sensors and further compared the numerical wave elevation time series with observed data at other gauge stations to reproduce the measured ocean waves at a given location finnegan and goggins 2015 defined the waves by fourier analysis as a summation of uni directional linear waves and inputted the superimposed wave surface as the incident boundary of a 2d cfd model at full scale to perform a numerical calculation of the expected waves at that location based on the analysis of wave elevation time series from one or more probes blondel et al 2010 established the initial conditions of a numerical high order spectral wave model and implemented a numerical simulation of the propagation of a deterministic non linear wave later blondel couprie et al 2013 further validated the model of blondel et al 2010 although a satisfactorily comparison of the predicted and original wave elevation histories were achieved these models are applicable only to the calculation of 2d unidirectional irregular waves published studies on the reproduction of multi directional irregular waves are relatively few most studies on multi directional irregular wave simulation have been mainly focused on satisfying the consistency of the wave statistical parameters and the corresponding directional spectrum such as hashimoto and kobune 1988 li et al 1999 and liu et al 2005 2012 the deterministic reconstruction of multi directional irregular waves is challenging in recent years naaijen and blondel couprie 2012 and blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 used 3d fft method to reconstruct and predict multi directional irregular sea waves over a large area however the reconstruction accuracy for sea waves decreased for longer time periods draycott et al 2015 2016 used a phase time path difference ptpd method to construct a directional spectrum in a circular wave tank the reconstructed wave elevation histories compared well with experimental data however this study did not clarify the wave reconstruction range and a verification of statistical characteristics had to be undertaken including the wave spectrum and the functions of the directional distribution the measured wave elevations in draycott et al 2015 contained reflective components caused by the wave tank boundary and draycott et al 2016 further expanded their research to address issues related to the reflected wave components takagi et al 2017 derived a formulation for predicting multi directional irregular waves using multipoint measured data although good agreement between the predicted waves and the measured wave time series were obtained their formulation was only applicable to prediction areas of dozens of kilometers with infinite water depth in this work multi directional irregular waves are reconstructed or reproduced using a linear superposition model that is implemented using two approaches to verify the effectiveness of the two methods theoretically and numerically simulated arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are reconstructed the simulated waves are then found to be reconstructed reproduced with a reasonable error within an appropriate spatial range 2 methodologies of multi directional wave reconstruction to simulate multi directional irregular waves the single and double summation methods are two commonly used approaches the single summation method assumes that each discrete frequency only propagates along one direction the double summation method however may generate a spatially nonhomogeneous wave field due to the presence of multiple waves at the same frequency with different amplitudes phases and directions this spatially nonhomogeneous wave field phenomenon is called phase locking yu and liu 1991 draycott et al 2016 to avoid this an improved single direction per frequency method was devised by introducing a uniformly distributed random number ran mi in 0 1 and choosing the representative component frequency in the frequency segments yu and liu 1991 the initial frequency increments δf were split up further by draycott et al 2015 2016 to create sub frequency increments δ f δf n θ these new frequencies have a unique wave propagation direction associated with each frequency to explore the reproducibility of multi directional irregular waves in a laboratory basin or a numerical wave tank direct reconstruction of the multi directional irregular waves is investigated based on the given wave time series the free wave surface elevation η x y t of the reconstructed waves can be described by a single summation model as 1 η x y t i 1 n a i cos 2 π f i t k i x cos θ i y sin θ i ε i where n is the number of the component waves a i f i and θ i are the amplitude frequency and wave direction of the ith component wave respectively k i is the corresponding wave number which can be calculated by the dispersion equation and ε i π π is the original phase of the component wave n is assumed to be 2 n 1 where 2 n is the sampling data length ensuring that the fft method can be used during wave reconstruction theoretically a i is related to the wave directional spectrum s f θ which can be generally expressed as the product of the frequency spectrum s f and the directional spreading function g f θ i e 2 s f θ s f g f θ ε i should be uniformly distributed in the range π π however a i θ i and ε i cannot be directly determined based on the given time series in this paper two approaches are described and assessed to reconstruct multi directional irregular waves based on eq 1 the calculation and selection steps of a i θ i and ε i for the methods are described below the wave directional spectrum s f θ is firstly analyzed based on the given wave time series using the bdm method proposed by hashimoto and kobune 1988 to study the energy distribution of the waves generally three or more wave sensors should be used i e in order to reconstruct multi directional waves time series at three or more positions should be given the arrangement of the wave sensors should generally follow the principles proposed by yu and liu 1992 in this paper the wave gauge arrangement known as swoc type is used and shown in fig 1 in which r is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the pentagonal wave gauge arrays assuming that the waves are unidirectional the component wave amplitude a i m 2 s f i m d f and the original phase ε im m o 1 n s 1 where n s is the number of wave gauges can be calculated from fft outputs of the records at each wave gauge liang et al 2010 determination of the comprehensive component wave amplitude a i in eq 1 the comprehensive component wave amplitude a i is determined based on the calculated a im at each wave gauge as an example fig 2 shows a comparison of the fft outputs a im at different wave gauges the results for a i0 and a im show reasonably good agreement hence a i can be calculated from the averaged result of a im i e 3 a i m o n s 1 a i m n s determine the original phase ε i of the component wave in eq 1 the original wave component phases ε im at any position x m y m can be related to each other through the location difference the original phase ε io at position o can be calculated from ε im if the corresponding wave direction θ i is known i e 4 ε i o m ε i m k i x m x 0 cos θ i y m y 0 sin θ i m 1 n s 1 theoretically the re calculated original phase ε i o m obtained from eq 4 and ε io should be identical to each other a typical comparison of the re calculated phases ε i o m is shown in fig 3 in which the component wave direction is calculated based on the methods described hereafter however no significant regularity between the re calculated phases is observed on fig 3 contrary to what was expected this is due to ε im being calculated assuming that the waves are unidirectional and to an inexact determination of some of the θ i corresponding to f i hence a tentative reconstruction and a preliminary comparison of the reproduced and given wave elevation histories was carried out by using the original phase at position o ε i ε io and the average phase as ε i ε i o m 1 n s 1 ε i o m n s it was found that taking ε i ε io is a better choice for wave reconstruction determination of the component wave direction θ i in eq 1 a reconstruction method 1 eeed equal energy in each division approach 1 the component wave direction can be determined by the principle of equal energy in each division yu and liu 1991 the primordial discrete values of the calculated directional distribution g 0 f θ analyzed by the bdm method hashimoto and kobune 1988 can be integrated using the following expression to obtain the cumulative distribution i e 5 p θ π θ g 0 f θ i δ θ p θ should be in the range of 0 1 2 divide the total cumulative probability p π 1 into n parts the total cumulative probability p π is uniformly divided into n parts by the equivalent energy method as shown in fig 4 a to ensure that each energy bin can be used to calculate a directional angle as shown in fig 4 b it should be noted that the division accuracy of the energy bins is closely related to the accuracy of the analyzed g 0 f θ it is therefore very important to accurately calculate g 0 f θ 3 determination of θ i by the equivalent energy method for any f i the corresponding direction θ i is selected randomly from the direction angles as calculated above b reconstruction method 2 ptpd phase time path difference approach as mentioned above the component wave direction θ i is defined based on the equivalent energy method which depends on the analyzed wave directional spreading the ptpd approach is also used to determine the component wave direction this approach was originally proposed by borgman 1974 and esteva 1976 they unambiguously determined the wave direction from the simultaneous time series of surface elevations at three non collinear gauges later fernandes et al 1988 2000 pointed out that the distances between the wave gauges should be less than half a wavelength for the particular frequency band based on this method draycott et al 2015 2016 reconstructed the wave elevation histories of the experimental data the advantage of the ptpd method is that component wave directions can be calculated from the measured wave time series without solving for the wave directional distribution g 0 f θ the solution steps of θ i referring to fernandes et al 1988 2000 are implemented as follows 1 find all three non collinear gauge combinations among m gauges i e c 3 m in this paper m 6 2 find the valid triage bins for f i i e ensuring that the relative separations of l 12 l 13 and l 23 are in the range of 0 01 l i f i and 0 5l i f i where l i is the wave length at frequency f i 3 calculate the cross spectrum between the wave gauges 4 calculate the relative phases ф12 f i and ф13 f i according to the cross spectrum 5 determine the wave direction angle θ i calculated for every triage bins 6 θ i c a l c u l

non collinear wave gauges 6 take the mean angle over all valid triage bins as the representative θ i for the corresponding f i 3 verification of the reconstruction methods 3 1 theoretical multi directional irregular waves to evaluate the effectiveness of the wave reconstruction methods theoretical multi directional irregular waves are first examined as examples four groups of expected theoretical waves are simulated according to the improved single direction per frequency model yu and liu 1991 the free wave surface elevation η x y t is calculated as 8 η x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ a m j cos 2 π f m j k m j x cos θ j y sin θ j ε m j 9 f m j f m 1 2 δ f j 1 r a n m j δ f n θ 10 δ f f h f l m f 11 f m f m 1 f m 2 where m f and n θ are the frequency and the direction composition number respectively a mj f mj and k mj are the amplitude frequency and wave number of the component wave for the mth frequency and the jth direction angle θ j and ε mj is the original phase of the wave components uniformly distributed in the range π π f m is the center frequency of the mth frequency interval and θ min θ max and f l f h are the direction and frequency distribution ranges respectively ran mj is a random number in the range 0 1 a mj can be calculated by the given directional wave spectrum s f θ i e 12 a m j 2 s f m θ j d f d θ 2 s f m g f m θ j d f d θ the frequency spectrum used is

and γ is the peak enhancement factor which is set to 3 3 in this paper the directional spreading function also uses the mistuyasu type spreading function defined by goda 1999 15 g f θ π π cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 d θ 1 cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 where s is called the directional spreading concentration parameter and θ 0 is the principal wave direction table 1 gives the parameters of the theoretical multi directional irregular waves fig 5 shows a comparison of wave directional spreading with different values of s the wave directional spreading width decreases as s increases note that to obtain the original wave elevation histories within a range multiple gauges are arranged at vectors o 1 o 5 see fig 1 first the performance of the wave reconstruction method 1 eeed approach is validated here the θ i are calculated based on the theoretical directional spreading function g 0 f θ ignoring the effect of the errors in analyzing wave directional spectrum as an example fig 6 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s for s 25 for the eeed approach with a spatial reconstruction range of rr l s 0 30 where rr denotes the distance along the radial direction between the position of the reconstructed waves and the center of the considered wave gauge array as shown in fig 1 rr l s c represents the waves being reconstructed at the radius of c times the wave length l s in which l s represents the significant wavelength clearly the reconstructed wave time series are basically identical to the theoretical series on the whole some amplitude and phase reconstruction errors however exist among the reconstructed waves this phenomenon is more prominent at gauges 2 and 5 further some high frequency fluctuations losses can be observed from the figure meaning that compared with the high frequency parts of the reconstructed waves a better result can be observed in the low frequency component parts this may be due to the relative spatial range of the given waves being larger for the high frequency waves accordingly the gauges on the o 5 vector for waves with s 25 using the eeed approach are selected as examples to investigate the variation of the reconstructed waves along with rr l s the results are shown in fig 7 through comparative analysis of the theoretical and reconstructed wave time series the amplitude and phase reconstruction errors for all the reconstructed waves are found to increase as rr l s increases the reconstruction errors for the eeed approach occur mainly because the determined component direction θ i is simply an arbitrarily representative direction rather than the real direction of the component wave with increasing rr l s the influence of the inaccuracy of the determined θ i on the wave reconstruction increases gradually causing the reconstruction errors to increase furthermore to illustrate the effects of directional distribution width on wave reconstruction fig 8 shows a comparison of theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s for waves of different s using the eeed approach with rr l s 0 30 at gauge 5 the amplitude and phase offsets decrease with increasing s which means that the amplitude and phase errors decrease with decreasing directional spreading width and the reconstruction performance is inferior for s 10 and s 25 especially for s 10 for s 50 and s 100 the results of the reconstructed waves are in perfect agreement with the theoretical data this means that the narrower the directional distribution width the smaller will be the wave reconstruction errors this can be attributed to the fact that the determined θ i are relatively concentrated when the wave directional distribution width is narrower a smaller influence of the determined θ i will engender a more precise reconstructed wave the evaluation of the wave reconstruction method 2 ptpd approach is performed similarly to that for the wave reconstruction method 1 eeed approach the variation in wave reconstruction errors along with rr l s and the effects of the wave directional distribution width are also considered for each triage bin and all frequency components the θ i calculated with the ptpd approach is an unambiguously determined direction that is closely related to the relative separations of l 12 l 13 and l 23 the relationship between the relative separations and the representative θ i with the ptpd approach requires further consideration the wave gauge arrangement used to determine θ i with the ptpd approach is shown in fig 1 considering the main energy of the multi directional irregular waves is mainly distributed within the frequency range of f i 0 3f p 4f p as shown in fig 9 fig 10 depicts a consistency comparison of the original calculated θ i calculated for different triage bins for s 25 within f i 0 4f p when r l s values is different r l s c denotes the relative separations of l 12 l 13 cl s where r is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the wave gauge arrays used to calculate the component wave directions as shown in fig 1 the example triage bins used are 1o2 2o3 3o4 4o5 and 1o5 the smaller the r l s for the wave gauge array used the higher the consistency of θ i calculated for every triage bin the θ i calculated for frequencies with r l i 0 5 are basically identical the frequency corresponding to the vertical dashed line represents the critical value of r l i 0 5 moreover the phase error θ er is defined to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the representative θ i as follows 16 θ e r θ i t h e o r y θ i 2 π 360 of which θ i theory is the original component wave directions similarly to figs 10 and 11 shows the variation of θ er within f i 0 4f p for s 25 with different r l s values using the ptpd approach consistently with the results of fig 10 an abrupt increase of θ er is also observed in fig 11 when r l i 0 5 and the vast majority of the θ er with r l i 0 5 is less than 3 when r l s 0 12 for r l s 0 16 however the θ er with r l i 0 5 almost close to 20 this proves that the determined θ i using the ptpd approach with r l s 0 12 has higher accuracy the inconsistency of θ i calculated and the sudden increase of θ er could be attributed to ф12 f i and ф13 f i beyond π π further fig 12 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s with rr l s 0 30 at gauge 5 for the case of s 25 with different r l s using the ptpd approach the agreement of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories seems not to change much when r l s 0 12 but the reconstructed performance is apparently poorer when r l s 0 16 this is mainly due to the accuracy of the determined representative θ i which corresponds to the consistency of the θ i calculated for every triage bin and the magnitude of the wave frequency spectrum s f i when r l s 0 12 the consistency of the θ i calculated for every triage bin is within about 2 2f p which guarantees that the component waves with most of the spectral energy yield a reasonable θ i however as the better consistency of the θ i calculated is within about 1 95f p when r l s 0 16 the remaining scattered θ i calculated for every triage bin may cause more inaccurate representative θ i for the high frequency waves leading to relatively larger wave reconstruction errors accordingly the wave elevation reconstruction results for waves with s 25 on the o 5 vector are taken as an example to further investigate the variation of the wave reconstruction performance along with rr l s for ptpd approach their reconstruction results are shown in fig 13 fig 14 shows a comparison of the reconstructed and theoretical wave surface elevation histories for the cases with different s on the o 5 vector with rr l s 0 30 note that the wave gauge array with r l s 0 06 is used in figs 13 and 14 the amplitude and phase errors for the reconstructed waves increase as rr l s increase and as s decrease which is similar to the results obtained with the eeed approach finally to examine the performance of the described two wave reconstruction methods on a macroscopic scale fig 15 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 40 s with the eeed and ptpd approaches for the case of s 25 with different reconstruction domains the wave gauge array with r l s 0 06 is also used for the ptpd approach seen from the 3d instantaneous free wave surface the wave surface reconstruction accuracy gradually decreases with increasing size of the reconstruction domain on the whole the inaccuracy of the reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surface is mainly reflected in its high frequency parts combining this observation with the reconstruction results from the wave surface elevation histories it can be concluded that the wave reconstruction errors in the high frequency parts are also one of the causes for wave reconstruction accuracy as qualitatively described above reconstruction results of the eeed and ptpd approaches are essentially satisfactory in a certain spatial range around the area of the given wave surface to evaluate the performance of the reconstruction methods quantitatively a reconstruction error er is defined as 17 e r 1 n η max a c t 1 n η a c t η r e p 2 100 where η represents the wave surface elevation history n denotes the sampling data length in section 3 n 16384 and the subscript act and rep represent the theoretical and reconstructed wave data respectively as examples fig 16 a and b shows the variation of er with rr l s for s 25 for the eeed and ptpd approaches r l s 0 06 on vectors o 1 o 5 respectively for both wave reconstruction methods er increases with increasing rr l s evidence from the figures also demonstrates that the larger reconstruction error er occurs at the gauges on the o 2 and o 5 vectors which agrees with the qualitative analysis displayed in fig 6 furthermore to perform a quantitative study of the reconstruction methods the maximum reconstruction error er max among gauges 1 to 5 is specifically considered for different rr l s fig 17 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches where wave gauges array with different r l s are used for ptpd approach the figure clearly shows that er max increases with increasing rr l s overall when r l s 0 12 the wave reconstruction accuracy of the ptpd approach is slightly higher than that of the eeed approach er max for the ptpd approach increases with increasing r l s and does not show significant differences when r l s 0 12 compared with the difference between er max with r l s 0 12 and 0 16 the basic reason explaining this trend for the ptpd approach is the accuracy of the representative θ i within f i 0 3 4f p which covers the vast majority of the wave energy as for r l s 0 12 the θ i calculated with higher consistency corresponds to the major energy of the wave spectrum shown in fig 9 whereas the inaccuracy of the representative θ i corresponding to high frequency energy exhibits slight errors in wave reconstruction nevertheless when r l s 0 16 the higher consistency of the θ i calculated is just about within f i 0 1 95f p and the remaining widely distributed inaccurate representative θ i has a greater effect on the wave reconstruction accuracy in addition er max for the ptpd approach with r l s 0 16 is larger than the er max for the eeed approach when s 50 and s 100 this is explained by the randomly distributed θ i solved by the eeed approach being distributed in a smaller directional domain with a narrower directional distribution width however for the ptpd approach larger r l s could lead to more errors for the determination of the representative θ i for high frequency waves which are scattered over a larger range and extend beyond the scope of the inherent direction distribution width therefore the optimum relative separations of the wave gauges should satisfy r l s 0 12 so as to effectively and accurately use the ptpd approach finally fig 18 illustrates the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches for the waves with different s for the ptpd approach r l s for wave gauge arrays is set to 0 12 consistently with the results of the qualitative analysis er max decreases with decreasing s the absolute difference between er max s 25 s 50 and er max s 50 s 100 is smaller than that of er max s 10 s 25 the narrower the directional distribution width the higher the precision of the reconstructed waves meanwhile it has been found that the er max at s 10 is less than 0 36 and 0 33 for the eeed and the ptpd approach respectively when rr l s 1 0 the er max at s 25 for the eeed approach is less than 0 33 and that of the ptpd approach is less than 0 29 when rr l s 1 0 further when these results are combined with the wave surface elevation histories shown in figs 7 f 13 f and 15 d it can be clear found that the reconstructed waves are in good agreement with the theoretical time series for a certain range of domain sizes this indicates that both reconstruction methods yield acceptable accuracy 3 2 arbitrary multi directional irregular waves sea waves are arbitrary multi directional irregular waves with nonlinear characteristics that have different wave heights periods and directional distribution forms to further evaluate the validity of the two wave reconstruction methods for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves seven groups of such waves are selected from numerical simulation by a model developed by liu et al 2005 based on the modified boussinesq equations of beji and nadaoka 1996 the model is based on an unstructured finite element method fem and has been verified for the simulation of physical experiments with realistic non linear characteristics including wave diffraction through a breakwater gap liu et al 2005 and wave run up in a cylinder group liu et al 2012 in the numerical simulation the incident wave surface elevations η of the multi directional irregular waves are also calculated using the single direction per frequency method li et al 1999 liu et al 2005 described above the velocities u x y t and v x y t are calculated as 18 u x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ 2 π f m j k m j h η i x y t η m j x y t cos θ j 19 v x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ 2 π f m j k m j h η i x y t η m j x y t sin θ j where η m j is the wave surface elevation for the mth frequency and the jth direction angle in general η and u v are set to zero when t 0 when the calculation begins they change abruptly at the incident boundary causing high frequency oscillations at the water surface to avoid this the first one to two waves at a different incident boundary are divided by an attenuation parameter at x j y j li et al 1999 i e 20 a t x i y i exp 2 t δ t 2 t s δ t ln ψ 0 t t s 1 t s t where δt is the numerical time step t s is the total wave attenuation time and ψ is a constant set to 8 in this paper to generate the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves a numerical domain with 20 m long and 45 m wide is set up as shown in fig 19 the left side is the incident wave boundary and the other three boundaries around the calculation domain are the sponge layer liu et al 2005 with a width of 4 0 m to absorb outgoing waves the wave gauges arrangement used for data sampling is similar as that for theoretical multi directional irregular waves shown in fig 1 and the center of the swoc array o x 0 y 0 is at 12 0 m 22 5 m the considered cases are listed in table 2 the data sampling interval for arbitrary waves is consistent with the numerical calculation time interval i e δt 0 012 s the sampling data length is 16384 for case a a total of 202 852 triangle elements and 102 077 nodes are used for the other cases the number of nodes and elements are set to be the same and 62 558 triangle elements and 31 641 nodes are used the time series used for analyzing the directional spectrum is composed of the data at the gauges with r l s 0 30 using the bdm method hashimoto and kobune 1988 and the numerical data sampling begins at t 20 004 s the analyzed directional distributions are shown in fig 20 for the cases the evaluation process for the arbitrary reconstructed waves can imitate that for theoretical multi directional irregular waves and wave reconstruction results for the eeed and ptpd approaches are compared and analyzed simultaneously note that r l s 0 09 is used for the ptpd approach in this section first case b is taken as an example to investigate the variation of the reconstructed waves along with the spatial range fig 21 shows the comparison of the measured numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed wave time series at t 20 40 s with the eeed and ptpd approaches for different rr l s on the o 2 vector the misalignment of the reconstructed waves increases with increasing rr l s for both methods this conclusion is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction results based on theoretical waves it is also apparent that the reconstructed time series from the ptpd approach seems to yield better results than that obtained from the eeed approach however considering the natural nonlinear characteristics of the measured waves and the linear wave reconstruction methods used in the paper the agreement between measured and reconstructed waves is acceptable for arbitrary waves the original phase ε i is an approximate value that ignores the nonlinear characteristics for both methods in the case of the eeed approach not only can the inherent errors of θ i cause reconstruction error but the computation accuracy of the directional distribution is also a factor in the determination of θ i furthermore the effect of the wave steepness h s l s on the reconstruction results is investigated as an example fig 22 shows a comparison of numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed wave surface elevation histories for different wave steepness with the eeed and ptpd approaches for rr l s 0 30 on the o 2 vector in the example the calculated directional distribution widths are nearly identical the reconstructed results agreed well with the numerically simulated waves on the whole and the reconstructed time series from the ptpd approach are always better than those from the eeed approach the variation in h s l s seems to have no significant effect on the wave reconstruction accuracy this may be attributed to the use of the linear summation model for wave reconstruction and the neglect of the wave nonlinear effect during the wave reconstruction process fig 23 exhibits a comparison of numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed results with the eeed and ptpd approaches for rr l s 0 30 on the o 2 vector for different directional distribution widths h s l s for all cases is almost identical the precision of the reconstructed waves increases with decreasing directional distribution width this conforms to the conclusion for theoretical wave reconstruction fig 24 shows a comparison of numerically simulated and reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 80 004 s with eeed and ptpd approaches for case f with different sizes of reconstruction domains again wave surface reconstruction accuracy decreases with increasing size of the reconstruction domain and better reconstructed wave surfaces are obtained in the low frequency parts this conforms to the theoretical reconstruction results similarly as further examples fig 25 shows the variation of er with rr l s on vectors o 1 o 5 for case b with the eeed and ptpd approaches respectively er increases with increasing rr l s for both reconstruction methods and the largest reconstruction errors occurs at the gauges on the o 2 vector these examples are sufficient to indicate that the qualitative wave reconstruction exhibit the largest errors for the wave gauge arrays when rr l s is fixed in addition fig 26 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different h s l s in which the directional distribution widths are basically identical fig 27 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different wave directional distribution widths the ptpd approach clearly shows smaller er max compared with the eeed approach the variation in h s l s has less influence on the accuracy of wave reconstruction than on that of the wave directional distribution width both the inherent nonlinearities and the sampling data length of the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves may have caused this result with increasing wave directional distribution width the wave reconstruction er max increases the variation of wave directional distribution width is the main factor affecting wave reconstruction accuracy for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves of all the wave reconstruction cases the maximum er max occurs at rr l s 0 35 reaching about 0 27 for the eeed approach and 0 22 for the ptpd approach which is similar with that based on theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves with s 10 er max at rr l s 0 35 for the eeed approach is about 0 28 and 0 21 for the ptpd approach for theoretical waves that means the wave reconstruction methods are also effective on arbitrary multi directional irregular waves 4 reconstruction of arbitrary multi directional irregular waves in a numerical basin for accurate study and prediction of the wave climate and its action on marine structures in a certain area it is in general necessary to reproduce the actual arbitrary multi directional irregular wave conditions in a laboratory or a numerical wave tank to evaluate the effectiveness of the reconstruction approaches under such conditions the numerically simulated arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are re simulated in a numerical basin through wave reconstruction the cases b c d f and g listed in table 2 for different h s l s and wave directional distribution widths are considered it should be point out that the numerical model and the numerical set up are similar to those delineated in section 3 2 if the waves at center position o in fig 19 are reconstructed based on the given wave times series as described above the numerically generated incident wave surface elevations η 0 y t and the corresponding averaged water particle velocities u 0 y t and v 0 y t can be written as 21 η 0 y t i 1 n a i cos 2 π f i t k i 0 x 0 cos θ i y y 0 sin θ i ε i 22 u 0 y t i 1 n 2 π f i k i h η i 0 y t η i 0 y t cos θ i 23 v 0 y t i 1 n 2 π f i k i h η i 0 y t η i 0 y t sin θ i where 0 y is the element node coordinate at the incident boundary x 0 y 0 is 12 0 m 22 5 m the coordinates are taken as at position o a i θ i and ε i are the calculated component wave amplitude component wave direction and initial phase of the numerical simulated wave time series as described above and η i is the calculated incident wave surface elevation for the ith frequency the generated waves are reconstructed in the numerical wave basin and the wave reconstruction eeed and ptpd approaches are used and evaluated in parallel taking case f as an example fig 28 shows a comparison of the originally simulated measured waves and their corresponding re simulated wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s in the numerical basin with both approaches for different rr l s on the o 2 vector overall the reconstructed waves in the numerical basin are identical to the originally simulated waves however the consistency of the wave surface elevation decreases with increasing rr l s furthermore fig 29 and fig 30 show the qualitative effects of the variation in h s l s and directional distribution width respectively on the wave reproduction good agreement is observed in general because a linear summation model is used in the two approaches and the nonlinear waves including the bound harmonics are treated as free wave components the variation of h s l s has no significant effect on wave reproduction in the numerical wave basin wave reproduction accuracy however increases with decreasing wave directional distribution width fig 31 shows a comparison of the originally simulated and numerically re simulated 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 60 00 s for case f with the eeed and ptpd approaches for different sizes of reconstruction domain better reproduction of the 3d wave surface is obtained in low frequency areas and the consistency of the wave reproduction surface decreases with increasing size of the domain these results are all in keeping with the conclusions for the wave reconstruction of arbitrary multi directional irregular waves generally the waves numerically re simulated with ptpd are better than those with eeed quantitative wave reproduction errors are also analyzed to ensure that most of the low frequency waves propagated to the study locations data sampling for the numerically re simulated waves began at about t 8 00 s and the sampling data length takes n 15700 figs 32 and 33 display the variation of the maximum numerical reproduction error er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different wave steepness h s l s and different wave directional distribution width respectively because of the existence of nonlinear wave components among the numerically re simulated waves the maximum er max of the re simulated waves does not approach 0 as rr l s comes close to 0 er max increases with increasing rr l s and decreases with narrowing directional distribution width the wave reproduction accuracy using the ptpd approach is always slightly better than that using the eeed approach in comparison with the variation of h s l s the range of the directional distribution width is the dominant factor affecting wave reproduction accuracy and the variation of h s l s has no significant effects on wave reproduction this can be mainly attributed to the different nonlinearities of the original numerically sampled waves furthermore the intrinsic higher order components of the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves at the numerical incident boundary and the nonlinearities in wave propagation are also the factors to be taken into account finally fig 34 shows comparative examples of the variation of er max with rr l s for numerically re simulated and directly reconstructed waves using the ptpd approach as above with different h s l s it is interesting that the maximal er max values for the directly reconstructed and numerically re simulated waves are very close to each other when rr l s 0 20 this shows that arbitrary waves can also be reproduced in the laboratory and the numerical wave basin with reasonable errors 5 conclusions the equal energy in each division approach eeed and phase time path difference ptpd reconstruction approaches for multi directional irregular waves are described using the same single summation model to assess the effectiveness of the wave reconstruction methods a series of qualitative and quantitative comparative analyses are conducted to reconstruct theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves the target waves are directly reconstructed and the variation of the directional distribution width is considered for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves the variations in directional distribution width and wave steepness h s l s associated with wave nonlinearities are further investigated in addition to direct reconstruction arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are re simulated in a numerical wave tank based on a thorough analysis the following conclusions can be drawn out in general the simulated theoretically and numerically simulated and regenerated reconstructed and reproduced wave elevations for a specified area are basically identical although certain amplitude and phase errors exist the wave reconstruction and reproduction errors decrease as the directional distribution width became narrower and increase together with the specified scope rr l s the variation in h s l s has no significant effects on numerical wave reproduction and the range of the directional distribution width is the dominant factor affecting wave reconstruction accuracy the maximum wave reconstruction error er max for the theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves with a relative wider directional distribution width s 10 at rr l s 1 0 for the eeed and ptpd approaches are less than 0 36 and 0 33 respectively the er max of the re simulated multi directional irregular waves in a numerical basin is similar with that based on the directly reconstructed multi directional irregular waves wave reconstruction errors for the two wave reconstruction methods are within acceptable error ranges overall as long as the domain size remains within reasonable dimensions wave reconstruction errors exhibit little differences for the ptpd approach when the relative separations of r l s 0 12 and the accuracy of wave reconstruction for the ptpd approach is generally better than that of the eeed approach at this range of r l s we therefore advise for the optimum relative separations of the wave gauges for the ptpd approach to be kept smaller than 0 12l s as the accuracy of the ptpd approach under a narrow wave distribution width would become poorer than for the eeed approach otherwise it is worth mentioning that ideally the noise should be kept at a negligible level and the probe positioning should be made as accurate as possible in real experiments in order to accurately estimate wave components however as the whole process of these two approaches uses approximations some compromise with regards to measurement conditions in real experiments should be acceptable credit

22082,accurately reproducing multi directional irregular waves in laboratory or numerical wave basin is crucial for in depth study of real wave action on marine structures in this paper the eeed equal energy in each division and ptpd phase time path difference approaches are described and their capability for reconstructing multi directional irregular waves is assessed the key difference between these two methods is the determination of the component wave directions theoretically and arbitrary numerically simulated multi directional waves with different directional distribution width and wave steepness are reconstructed and the latter waves are further reproduced in a numerical wave basin the consistency between the reconstructed and the theoretical measured waves demonstrates the approaches are acceptable furthermore the variation of the quantitative error between the reconstructed and the theoretical measured waves in the spatial domain rr l s is analyzed this variation increases with the size of rr l s but the errors are acceptable as long as this size is reasonable the application ranges are evaluated based on a qualitative comparative analysis between the reconstructed waves and the theoretical measured ones and the quantitative reconstruction error along rr l s the ptpd approach is generally better than eeed method the optimum relative separation for wave gauges using the ptpd approach should be smaller than 0 12l s keywords multi directional irregular waves reconstruction directional distribution width 1 introduction in real ocean conditions sea waves are multi directional irregular waves its wave directionality has an important influence on wave properties and on the wave structure interaction in general wave buoys or wave gauges are used to measure waves at sea and the wave statistical properties in a given region can be represented by the directional spectrum thus estimated this spectrum can be used as an input wave condition to simulate waves or study the wave structure interactions in a laboratory wave basin or a numerical wave tank however for in depth studies of wave properties in ocean engineering reproducing the time series of the measured wave in laboratory basin or numerical wave tank is necessary the deterministic reproduction of arbitrary waves is therefore an important issue in the field of wave simulation the deterministic reproduction of multi directional irregular wave means the reconstruction or reproduction of wave elevation history time series measured at sea or during physical experiments earlier some researchers investigated the reconstruction of 2d unidirectional irregular waves for example based on a fourier series expansion in space and time baldock and swan 1994 constructed a numerical model to solve for the periodic nonlinear unsteady state wave train in water surface elevation their numerical time series was in excellent agreement with laboratory data liang et al 2010 numerically inputted the wave maker motion signals by means of fft decomposition of an experimental wave train into many small amplitude waves with different initial phase angles they successfully reconstructed the experimental wave time series in those sensors and further compared the numerical wave elevation time series with observed data at other gauge stations to reproduce the measured ocean waves at a given location finnegan and goggins 2015 defined the waves by fourier analysis as a summation of uni directional linear waves and inputted the superimposed wave surface as the incident boundary of a 2d cfd model at full scale to perform a numerical calculation of the expected waves at that location based on the analysis of wave elevation time series from one or more probes blondel et al 2010 established the initial conditions of a numerical high order spectral wave model and implemented a numerical simulation of the propagation of a deterministic non linear wave later blondel couprie et al 2013 further validated the model of blondel et al 2010 although a satisfactorily comparison of the predicted and original wave elevation histories were achieved these models are applicable only to the calculation of 2d unidirectional irregular waves published studies on the reproduction of multi directional irregular waves are relatively few most studies on multi directional irregular wave simulation have been mainly focused on satisfying the consistency of the wave statistical parameters and the corresponding directional spectrum such as hashimoto and kobune 1988 li et al 1999 and liu et al 2005 2012 the deterministic reconstruction of multi directional irregular waves is challenging in recent years naaijen and blondel couprie 2012 and blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 used 3d fft method to reconstruct and predict multi directional irregular sea waves over a large area however the reconstruction accuracy for sea waves decreased for longer time periods draycott et al 2015 2016 used a phase time path difference ptpd method to construct a directional spectrum in a circular wave tank the reconstructed wave elevation histories compared well with experimental data however this study did not clarify the wave reconstruction range and a verification of statistical characteristics had to be undertaken including the wave spectrum and the functions of the directional distribution the measured wave elevations in draycott et al 2015 contained reflective components caused by the wave tank boundary and draycott et al 2016 further expanded their research to address issues related to the reflected wave components takagi et al 2017 derived a formulation for predicting multi directional irregular waves using multipoint measured data although good agreement between the predicted waves and the measured wave time series were obtained their formulation was only applicable to prediction areas of dozens of kilometers with infinite water depth in this work multi directional irregular waves are reconstructed or reproduced using a linear superposition model that is implemented using two approaches to verify the effectiveness of the two methods theoretically and numerically simulated arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are reconstructed the simulated waves are then found to be reconstructed reproduced with a reasonable error within an appropriate spatial range 2 methodologies of multi directional wave reconstruction to simulate multi directional irregular waves the single and double summation methods are two commonly used approaches the single summation method assumes that each discrete frequency only propagates along one direction the double summation method however may generate a spatially nonhomogeneous wave field due to the presence of multiple waves at the same frequency with different amplitudes phases and directions this spatially nonhomogeneous wave field phenomenon is called phase locking yu and liu 1991 draycott et al 2016 to avoid this an improved single direction per frequency method was devised by introducing a uniformly distributed random number ran mi in 0 1 and choosing the representative component frequency in the frequency segments yu and liu 1991 the initial frequency increments δf were split up further by draycott et al 2015 2016 to create sub frequency increments δ f δf n θ these new frequencies have a unique wave propagation direction associated with each frequency to explore the reproducibility of multi directional irregular waves in a laboratory basin or a numerical wave tank direct reconstruction of the multi directional irregular waves is investigated based on the given wave time series the free wave surface elevation η x y t of the reconstructed waves can be described by a single summation model as 1 η x y t i 1 n a i cos 2 π f i t k i x cos θ i y sin θ i ε i where n is the number of the component waves a i f i and θ i are the amplitude frequency and wave direction of the ith component wave respectively k i is the corresponding wave number which can be calculated by the dispersion equation and ε i π π is the original phase of the component wave n is assumed to be 2 n 1 where 2 n is the sampling data length ensuring that the fft method can be used during wave reconstruction theoretically a i is related to the wave directional spectrum s f θ which can be generally expressed as the product of the frequency spectrum s f and the directional spreading function g f θ i e 2 s f θ s f g f θ ε i should be uniformly distributed in the range π π however a i θ i and ε i cannot be directly determined based on the given time series in this paper two approaches are described and assessed to reconstruct multi directional irregular waves based on eq 1 the calculation and selection steps of a i θ i and ε i for the methods are described below the wave directional spectrum s f θ is firstly analyzed based on the given wave time series using the bdm method proposed by hashimoto and kobune 1988 to study the energy distribution of the waves generally three or more wave sensors should be used i e in order to reconstruct multi directional waves time series at three or more positions should be given the arrangement of the wave sensors should generally follow the principles proposed by yu and liu 1992 in this paper the wave gauge arrangement known as swoc type is used and shown in fig 1 in which r is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the pentagonal wave gauge arrays assuming that the waves are unidirectional the component wave amplitude a i m 2 s f i m d f and the original phase ε im m o 1 n s 1 where n s is the number of wave gauges can be calculated from fft outputs of the records at each wave gauge liang et al 2010 determination of the comprehensive component wave amplitude a i in eq 1 the comprehensive component wave amplitude a i is determined based on the calculated a im at each wave gauge as an example fig 2 shows a comparison of the fft outputs a im at different wave gauges the results for a i0 and a im show reasonably good agreement hence a i can be calculated from the averaged result of a im i e 3 a i m o n s 1 a i m n s determine the original phase ε i of the component wave in eq 1 the original wave component phases ε im at any position x m y m can be related to each other through the location difference the original phase ε io at position o can be calculated from ε im if the corresponding wave direction θ i is known i e 4 ε i o m ε i m k i x m x 0 cos θ i y m y 0 sin θ i m 1 n s 1 theoretically the re calculated original phase ε i o m obtained from eq 4 and ε io should be identical to each other a typical comparison of the re calculated phases ε i o m is shown in fig 3 in which the component wave direction is calculated based on the methods described hereafter however no significant regularity between the re calculated phases is observed on fig 3 contrary to what was expected this is due to ε im being calculated assuming that the waves are unidirectional and to an inexact determination of some of the θ i corresponding to f i hence a tentative reconstruction and a preliminary comparison of the reproduced and given wave elevation histories was carried out by using the original phase at position o ε i ε io and the average phase as ε i ε i o m 1 n s 1 ε i o m n s it was found that taking ε i ε io is a better choice for wave reconstruction determination of the component wave direction θ i in eq 1 a reconstruction method 1 eeed equal energy in each division approach 1 the component wave direction can be determined by the principle of equal energy in each division yu and liu 1991 the primordial discrete values of the calculated directional distribution g 0 f θ analyzed by the bdm method hashimoto and kobune 1988 can be integrated using the following expression to obtain the cumulative distribution i e 5 p θ π θ g 0 f θ i δ θ p θ should be in the range of 0 1 2 divide the total cumulative probability p π 1 into n parts the total cumulative probability p π is uniformly divided into n parts by the equivalent energy method as shown in fig 4 a to ensure that each energy bin can be used to calculate a directional angle as shown in fig 4 b it should be noted that the division accuracy of the energy bins is closely related to the accuracy of the analyzed g 0 f θ it is therefore very important to accurately calculate g 0 f θ 3 determination of θ i by the equivalent energy method for any f i the corresponding direction θ i is selected randomly from the direction angles as calculated above b reconstruction method 2 ptpd phase time path difference approach as mentioned above the component wave direction θ i is defined based on the equivalent energy method which depends on the analyzed wave directional spreading the ptpd approach is also used to determine the component wave direction this approach was originally proposed by borgman 1974 and esteva 1976 they unambiguously determined the wave direction from the simultaneous time series of surface elevations at three non collinear gauges later fernandes et al 1988 2000 pointed out that the distances between the wave gauges should be less than half a wavelength for the particular frequency band based on this method draycott et al 2015 2016 reconstructed the wave elevation histories of the experimental data the advantage of the ptpd method is that component wave directions can be calculated from the measured wave time series without solving for the wave directional distribution g 0 f θ the solution steps of θ i referring to fernandes et al 1988 2000 are implemented as follows 1 find all three non collinear gauge combinations among m gauges i e c 3 m in this paper m 6 2 find the valid triage bins for f i i e ensuring that the relative separations of l 12 l 13 and l 23 are in the range of 0 01 l i f i and 0 5l i f i where l i is the wave length at frequency f i 3 calculate the cross spectrum between the wave gauges 4 calculate the relative phases ф12 f i and ф13 f i according to the cross spectrum 5 determine the wave direction angle θ i calculated for every triage bins 6 θ i c a l c u l

non collinear wave gauges 6 take the mean angle over all valid triage bins as the representative θ i for the corresponding f i 3 verification of the reconstruction methods 3 1 theoretical multi directional irregular waves to evaluate the effectiveness of the wave reconstruction methods theoretical multi directional irregular waves are first examined as examples four groups of expected theoretical waves are simulated according to the improved single direction per frequency model yu and liu 1991 the free wave surface elevation η x y t is calculated as 8 η x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ a m j cos 2 π f m j k m j x cos θ j y sin θ j ε m j 9 f m j f m 1 2 δ f j 1 r a n m j δ f n θ 10 δ f f h f l m f 11 f m f m 1 f m 2 where m f and n θ are the frequency and the direction composition number respectively a mj f mj and k mj are the amplitude frequency and wave number of the component wave for the mth frequency and the jth direction angle θ j and ε mj is the original phase of the wave components uniformly distributed in the range π π f m is the center frequency of the mth frequency interval and θ min θ max and f l f h are the direction and frequency distribution ranges respectively ran mj is a random number in the range 0 1 a mj can be calculated by the given directional wave spectrum s f θ i e 12 a m j 2 s f m θ j d f d θ 2 s f m g f m θ j d f d θ the frequency spectrum used is

and γ is the peak enhancement factor which is set to 3 3 in this paper the directional spreading function also uses the mistuyasu type spreading function defined by goda 1999 15 g f θ π π cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 d θ 1 cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 where s is called the directional spreading concentration parameter and θ 0 is the principal wave direction table 1 gives the parameters of the theoretical multi directional irregular waves fig 5 shows a comparison of wave directional spreading with different values of s the wave directional spreading width decreases as s increases note that to obtain the original wave elevation histories within a range multiple gauges are arranged at vectors o 1 o 5 see fig 1 first the performance of the wave reconstruction method 1 eeed approach is validated here the θ i are calculated based on the theoretical directional spreading function g 0 f θ ignoring the effect of the errors in analyzing wave directional spectrum as an example fig 6 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s for s 25 for the eeed approach with a spatial reconstruction range of rr l s 0 30 where rr denotes the distance along the radial direction between the position of the reconstructed waves and the center of the considered wave gauge array as shown in fig 1 rr l s c represents the waves being reconstructed at the radius of c times the wave length l s in which l s represents the significant wavelength clearly the reconstructed wave time series are basically identical to the theoretical series on the whole some amplitude and phase reconstruction errors however exist among the reconstructed waves this phenomenon is more prominent at gauges 2 and 5 further some high frequency fluctuations losses can be observed from the figure meaning that compared with the high frequency parts of the reconstructed waves a better result can be observed in the low frequency component parts this may be due to the relative spatial range of the given waves being larger for the high frequency waves accordingly the gauges on the o 5 vector for waves with s 25 using the eeed approach are selected as examples to investigate the variation of the reconstructed waves along with rr l s the results are shown in fig 7 through comparative analysis of the theoretical and reconstructed wave time series the amplitude and phase reconstruction errors for all the reconstructed waves are found to increase as rr l s increases the reconstruction errors for the eeed approach occur mainly because the determined component direction θ i is simply an arbitrarily representative direction rather than the real direction of the component wave with increasing rr l s the influence of the inaccuracy of the determined θ i on the wave reconstruction increases gradually causing the reconstruction errors to increase furthermore to illustrate the effects of directional distribution width on wave reconstruction fig 8 shows a comparison of theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s for waves of different s using the eeed approach with rr l s 0 30 at gauge 5 the amplitude and phase offsets decrease with increasing s which means that the amplitude and phase errors decrease with decreasing directional spreading width and the reconstruction performance is inferior for s 10 and s 25 especially for s 10 for s 50 and s 100 the results of the reconstructed waves are in perfect agreement with the theoretical data this means that the narrower the directional distribution width the smaller will be the wave reconstruction errors this can be attributed to the fact that the determined θ i are relatively concentrated when the wave directional distribution width is narrower a smaller influence of the determined θ i will engender a more precise reconstructed wave the evaluation of the wave reconstruction method 2 ptpd approach is performed similarly to that for the wave reconstruction method 1 eeed approach the variation in wave reconstruction errors along with rr l s and the effects of the wave directional distribution width are also considered for each triage bin and all frequency components the θ i calculated with the ptpd approach is an unambiguously determined direction that is closely related to the relative separations of l 12 l 13 and l 23 the relationship between the relative separations and the representative θ i with the ptpd approach requires further consideration the wave gauge arrangement used to determine θ i with the ptpd approach is shown in fig 1 considering the main energy of the multi directional irregular waves is mainly distributed within the frequency range of f i 0 3f p 4f p as shown in fig 9 fig 10 depicts a consistency comparison of the original calculated θ i calculated for different triage bins for s 25 within f i 0 4f p when r l s values is different r l s c denotes the relative separations of l 12 l 13 cl s where r is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the wave gauge arrays used to calculate the component wave directions as shown in fig 1 the example triage bins used are 1o2 2o3 3o4 4o5 and 1o5 the smaller the r l s for the wave gauge array used the higher the consistency of θ i calculated for every triage bin the θ i calculated for frequencies with r l i 0 5 are basically identical the frequency corresponding to the vertical dashed line represents the critical value of r l i 0 5 moreover the phase error θ er is defined to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the representative θ i as follows 16 θ e r θ i t h e o r y θ i 2 π 360 of which θ i theory is the original component wave directions similarly to figs 10 and 11 shows the variation of θ er within f i 0 4f p for s 25 with different r l s values using the ptpd approach consistently with the results of fig 10 an abrupt increase of θ er is also observed in fig 11 when r l i 0 5 and the vast majority of the θ er with r l i 0 5 is less than 3 when r l s 0 12 for r l s 0 16 however the θ er with r l i 0 5 almost close to 20 this proves that the determined θ i using the ptpd approach with r l s 0 12 has higher accuracy the inconsistency of θ i calculated and the sudden increase of θ er could be attributed to ф12 f i and ф13 f i beyond π π further fig 12 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s with rr l s 0 30 at gauge 5 for the case of s 25 with different r l s using the ptpd approach the agreement of the theoretical and reconstructed wave surface elevation histories seems not to change much when r l s 0 12 but the reconstructed performance is apparently poorer when r l s 0 16 this is mainly due to the accuracy of the determined representative θ i which corresponds to the consistency of the θ i calculated for every triage bin and the magnitude of the wave frequency spectrum s f i when r l s 0 12 the consistency of the θ i calculated for every triage bin is within about 2 2f p which guarantees that the component waves with most of the spectral energy yield a reasonable θ i however as the better consistency of the θ i calculated is within about 1 95f p when r l s 0 16 the remaining scattered θ i calculated for every triage bin may cause more inaccurate representative θ i for the high frequency waves leading to relatively larger wave reconstruction errors accordingly the wave elevation reconstruction results for waves with s 25 on the o 5 vector are taken as an example to further investigate the variation of the wave reconstruction performance along with rr l s for ptpd approach their reconstruction results are shown in fig 13 fig 14 shows a comparison of the reconstructed and theoretical wave surface elevation histories for the cases with different s on the o 5 vector with rr l s 0 30 note that the wave gauge array with r l s 0 06 is used in figs 13 and 14 the amplitude and phase errors for the reconstructed waves increase as rr l s increase and as s decrease which is similar to the results obtained with the eeed approach finally to examine the performance of the described two wave reconstruction methods on a macroscopic scale fig 15 shows a comparison of the theoretical and reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 40 s with the eeed and ptpd approaches for the case of s 25 with different reconstruction domains the wave gauge array with r l s 0 06 is also used for the ptpd approach seen from the 3d instantaneous free wave surface the wave surface reconstruction accuracy gradually decreases with increasing size of the reconstruction domain on the whole the inaccuracy of the reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surface is mainly reflected in its high frequency parts combining this observation with the reconstruction results from the wave surface elevation histories it can be concluded that the wave reconstruction errors in the high frequency parts are also one of the causes for wave reconstruction accuracy as qualitatively described above reconstruction results of the eeed and ptpd approaches are essentially satisfactory in a certain spatial range around the area of the given wave surface to evaluate the performance of the reconstruction methods quantitatively a reconstruction error er is defined as 17 e r 1 n η max a c t 1 n η a c t η r e p 2 100 where η represents the wave surface elevation history n denotes the sampling data length in section 3 n 16384 and the subscript act and rep represent the theoretical and reconstructed wave data respectively as examples fig 16 a and b shows the variation of er with rr l s for s 25 for the eeed and ptpd approaches r l s 0 06 on vectors o 1 o 5 respectively for both wave reconstruction methods er increases with increasing rr l s evidence from the figures also demonstrates that the larger reconstruction error er occurs at the gauges on the o 2 and o 5 vectors which agrees with the qualitative analysis displayed in fig 6 furthermore to perform a quantitative study of the reconstruction methods the maximum reconstruction error er max among gauges 1 to 5 is specifically considered for different rr l s fig 17 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches where wave gauges array with different r l s are used for ptpd approach the figure clearly shows that er max increases with increasing rr l s overall when r l s 0 12 the wave reconstruction accuracy of the ptpd approach is slightly higher than that of the eeed approach er max for the ptpd approach increases with increasing r l s and does not show significant differences when r l s 0 12 compared with the difference between er max with r l s 0 12 and 0 16 the basic reason explaining this trend for the ptpd approach is the accuracy of the representative θ i within f i 0 3 4f p which covers the vast majority of the wave energy as for r l s 0 12 the θ i calculated with higher consistency corresponds to the major energy of the wave spectrum shown in fig 9 whereas the inaccuracy of the representative θ i corresponding to high frequency energy exhibits slight errors in wave reconstruction nevertheless when r l s 0 16 the higher consistency of the θ i calculated is just about within f i 0 1 95f p and the remaining widely distributed inaccurate representative θ i has a greater effect on the wave reconstruction accuracy in addition er max for the ptpd approach with r l s 0 16 is larger than the er max for the eeed approach when s 50 and s 100 this is explained by the randomly distributed θ i solved by the eeed approach being distributed in a smaller directional domain with a narrower directional distribution width however for the ptpd approach larger r l s could lead to more errors for the determination of the representative θ i for high frequency waves which are scattered over a larger range and extend beyond the scope of the inherent direction distribution width therefore the optimum relative separations of the wave gauges should satisfy r l s 0 12 so as to effectively and accurately use the ptpd approach finally fig 18 illustrates the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches for the waves with different s for the ptpd approach r l s for wave gauge arrays is set to 0 12 consistently with the results of the qualitative analysis er max decreases with decreasing s the absolute difference between er max s 25 s 50 and er max s 50 s 100 is smaller than that of er max s 10 s 25 the narrower the directional distribution width the higher the precision of the reconstructed waves meanwhile it has been found that the er max at s 10 is less than 0 36 and 0 33 for the eeed and the ptpd approach respectively when rr l s 1 0 the er max at s 25 for the eeed approach is less than 0 33 and that of the ptpd approach is less than 0 29 when rr l s 1 0 further when these results are combined with the wave surface elevation histories shown in figs 7 f 13 f and 15 d it can be clear found that the reconstructed waves are in good agreement with the theoretical time series for a certain range of domain sizes this indicates that both reconstruction methods yield acceptable accuracy 3 2 arbitrary multi directional irregular waves sea waves are arbitrary multi directional irregular waves with nonlinear characteristics that have different wave heights periods and directional distribution forms to further evaluate the validity of the two wave reconstruction methods for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves seven groups of such waves are selected from numerical simulation by a model developed by liu et al 2005 based on the modified boussinesq equations of beji and nadaoka 1996 the model is based on an unstructured finite element method fem and has been verified for the simulation of physical experiments with realistic non linear characteristics including wave diffraction through a breakwater gap liu et al 2005 and wave run up in a cylinder group liu et al 2012 in the numerical simulation the incident wave surface elevations η of the multi directional irregular waves are also calculated using the single direction per frequency method li et al 1999 liu et al 2005 described above the velocities u x y t and v x y t are calculated as 18 u x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ 2 π f m j k m j h η i x y t η m j x y t cos θ j 19 v x y t m 1 m f j 1 n θ 2 π f m j k m j h η i x y t η m j x y t sin θ j where η m j is the wave surface elevation for the mth frequency and the jth direction angle in general η and u v are set to zero when t 0 when the calculation begins they change abruptly at the incident boundary causing high frequency oscillations at the water surface to avoid this the first one to two waves at a different incident boundary are divided by an attenuation parameter at x j y j li et al 1999 i e 20 a t x i y i exp 2 t δ t 2 t s δ t ln ψ 0 t t s 1 t s t where δt is the numerical time step t s is the total wave attenuation time and ψ is a constant set to 8 in this paper to generate the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves a numerical domain with 20 m long and 45 m wide is set up as shown in fig 19 the left side is the incident wave boundary and the other three boundaries around the calculation domain are the sponge layer liu et al 2005 with a width of 4 0 m to absorb outgoing waves the wave gauges arrangement used for data sampling is similar as that for theoretical multi directional irregular waves shown in fig 1 and the center of the swoc array o x 0 y 0 is at 12 0 m 22 5 m the considered cases are listed in table 2 the data sampling interval for arbitrary waves is consistent with the numerical calculation time interval i e δt 0 012 s the sampling data length is 16384 for case a a total of 202 852 triangle elements and 102 077 nodes are used for the other cases the number of nodes and elements are set to be the same and 62 558 triangle elements and 31 641 nodes are used the time series used for analyzing the directional spectrum is composed of the data at the gauges with r l s 0 30 using the bdm method hashimoto and kobune 1988 and the numerical data sampling begins at t 20 004 s the analyzed directional distributions are shown in fig 20 for the cases the evaluation process for the arbitrary reconstructed waves can imitate that for theoretical multi directional irregular waves and wave reconstruction results for the eeed and ptpd approaches are compared and analyzed simultaneously note that r l s 0 09 is used for the ptpd approach in this section first case b is taken as an example to investigate the variation of the reconstructed waves along with the spatial range fig 21 shows the comparison of the measured numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed wave time series at t 20 40 s with the eeed and ptpd approaches for different rr l s on the o 2 vector the misalignment of the reconstructed waves increases with increasing rr l s for both methods this conclusion is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction results based on theoretical waves it is also apparent that the reconstructed time series from the ptpd approach seems to yield better results than that obtained from the eeed approach however considering the natural nonlinear characteristics of the measured waves and the linear wave reconstruction methods used in the paper the agreement between measured and reconstructed waves is acceptable for arbitrary waves the original phase ε i is an approximate value that ignores the nonlinear characteristics for both methods in the case of the eeed approach not only can the inherent errors of θ i cause reconstruction error but the computation accuracy of the directional distribution is also a factor in the determination of θ i furthermore the effect of the wave steepness h s l s on the reconstruction results is investigated as an example fig 22 shows a comparison of numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed wave surface elevation histories for different wave steepness with the eeed and ptpd approaches for rr l s 0 30 on the o 2 vector in the example the calculated directional distribution widths are nearly identical the reconstructed results agreed well with the numerically simulated waves on the whole and the reconstructed time series from the ptpd approach are always better than those from the eeed approach the variation in h s l s seems to have no significant effect on the wave reconstruction accuracy this may be attributed to the use of the linear summation model for wave reconstruction and the neglect of the wave nonlinear effect during the wave reconstruction process fig 23 exhibits a comparison of numerically simulated waves and their corresponding reconstructed results with the eeed and ptpd approaches for rr l s 0 30 on the o 2 vector for different directional distribution widths h s l s for all cases is almost identical the precision of the reconstructed waves increases with decreasing directional distribution width this conforms to the conclusion for theoretical wave reconstruction fig 24 shows a comparison of numerically simulated and reconstructed 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 80 004 s with eeed and ptpd approaches for case f with different sizes of reconstruction domains again wave surface reconstruction accuracy decreases with increasing size of the reconstruction domain and better reconstructed wave surfaces are obtained in the low frequency parts this conforms to the theoretical reconstruction results similarly as further examples fig 25 shows the variation of er with rr l s on vectors o 1 o 5 for case b with the eeed and ptpd approaches respectively er increases with increasing rr l s for both reconstruction methods and the largest reconstruction errors occurs at the gauges on the o 2 vector these examples are sufficient to indicate that the qualitative wave reconstruction exhibit the largest errors for the wave gauge arrays when rr l s is fixed in addition fig 26 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different h s l s in which the directional distribution widths are basically identical fig 27 shows the variation of er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different wave directional distribution widths the ptpd approach clearly shows smaller er max compared with the eeed approach the variation in h s l s has less influence on the accuracy of wave reconstruction than on that of the wave directional distribution width both the inherent nonlinearities and the sampling data length of the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves may have caused this result with increasing wave directional distribution width the wave reconstruction er max increases the variation of wave directional distribution width is the main factor affecting wave reconstruction accuracy for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves of all the wave reconstruction cases the maximum er max occurs at rr l s 0 35 reaching about 0 27 for the eeed approach and 0 22 for the ptpd approach which is similar with that based on theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves with s 10 er max at rr l s 0 35 for the eeed approach is about 0 28 and 0 21 for the ptpd approach for theoretical waves that means the wave reconstruction methods are also effective on arbitrary multi directional irregular waves 4 reconstruction of arbitrary multi directional irregular waves in a numerical basin for accurate study and prediction of the wave climate and its action on marine structures in a certain area it is in general necessary to reproduce the actual arbitrary multi directional irregular wave conditions in a laboratory or a numerical wave tank to evaluate the effectiveness of the reconstruction approaches under such conditions the numerically simulated arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are re simulated in a numerical basin through wave reconstruction the cases b c d f and g listed in table 2 for different h s l s and wave directional distribution widths are considered it should be point out that the numerical model and the numerical set up are similar to those delineated in section 3 2 if the waves at center position o in fig 19 are reconstructed based on the given wave times series as described above the numerically generated incident wave surface elevations η 0 y t and the corresponding averaged water particle velocities u 0 y t and v 0 y t can be written as 21 η 0 y t i 1 n a i cos 2 π f i t k i 0 x 0 cos θ i y y 0 sin θ i ε i 22 u 0 y t i 1 n 2 π f i k i h η i 0 y t η i 0 y t cos θ i 23 v 0 y t i 1 n 2 π f i k i h η i 0 y t η i 0 y t sin θ i where 0 y is the element node coordinate at the incident boundary x 0 y 0 is 12 0 m 22 5 m the coordinates are taken as at position o a i θ i and ε i are the calculated component wave amplitude component wave direction and initial phase of the numerical simulated wave time series as described above and η i is the calculated incident wave surface elevation for the ith frequency the generated waves are reconstructed in the numerical wave basin and the wave reconstruction eeed and ptpd approaches are used and evaluated in parallel taking case f as an example fig 28 shows a comparison of the originally simulated measured waves and their corresponding re simulated wave surface elevation histories at t 20 40 s in the numerical basin with both approaches for different rr l s on the o 2 vector overall the reconstructed waves in the numerical basin are identical to the originally simulated waves however the consistency of the wave surface elevation decreases with increasing rr l s furthermore fig 29 and fig 30 show the qualitative effects of the variation in h s l s and directional distribution width respectively on the wave reproduction good agreement is observed in general because a linear summation model is used in the two approaches and the nonlinear waves including the bound harmonics are treated as free wave components the variation of h s l s has no significant effect on wave reproduction in the numerical wave basin wave reproduction accuracy however increases with decreasing wave directional distribution width fig 31 shows a comparison of the originally simulated and numerically re simulated 3d instantaneous free wave surfaces at t 60 00 s for case f with the eeed and ptpd approaches for different sizes of reconstruction domain better reproduction of the 3d wave surface is obtained in low frequency areas and the consistency of the wave reproduction surface decreases with increasing size of the domain these results are all in keeping with the conclusions for the wave reconstruction of arbitrary multi directional irregular waves generally the waves numerically re simulated with ptpd are better than those with eeed quantitative wave reproduction errors are also analyzed to ensure that most of the low frequency waves propagated to the study locations data sampling for the numerically re simulated waves began at about t 8 00 s and the sampling data length takes n 15700 figs 32 and 33 display the variation of the maximum numerical reproduction error er max with rr l s for the eeed and ptpd approaches with different wave steepness h s l s and different wave directional distribution width respectively because of the existence of nonlinear wave components among the numerically re simulated waves the maximum er max of the re simulated waves does not approach 0 as rr l s comes close to 0 er max increases with increasing rr l s and decreases with narrowing directional distribution width the wave reproduction accuracy using the ptpd approach is always slightly better than that using the eeed approach in comparison with the variation of h s l s the range of the directional distribution width is the dominant factor affecting wave reproduction accuracy and the variation of h s l s has no significant effects on wave reproduction this can be mainly attributed to the different nonlinearities of the original numerically sampled waves furthermore the intrinsic higher order components of the arbitrary multi directional irregular waves at the numerical incident boundary and the nonlinearities in wave propagation are also the factors to be taken into account finally fig 34 shows comparative examples of the variation of er max with rr l s for numerically re simulated and directly reconstructed waves using the ptpd approach as above with different h s l s it is interesting that the maximal er max values for the directly reconstructed and numerically re simulated waves are very close to each other when rr l s 0 20 this shows that arbitrary waves can also be reproduced in the laboratory and the numerical wave basin with reasonable errors 5 conclusions the equal energy in each division approach eeed and phase time path difference ptpd reconstruction approaches for multi directional irregular waves are described using the same single summation model to assess the effectiveness of the wave reconstruction methods a series of qualitative and quantitative comparative analyses are conducted to reconstruct theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves the target waves are directly reconstructed and the variation of the directional distribution width is considered for arbitrary multi directional irregular waves the variations in directional distribution width and wave steepness h s l s associated with wave nonlinearities are further investigated in addition to direct reconstruction arbitrary multi directional irregular waves are re simulated in a numerical wave tank based on a thorough analysis the following conclusions can be drawn out in general the simulated theoretically and numerically simulated and regenerated reconstructed and reproduced wave elevations for a specified area are basically identical although certain amplitude and phase errors exist the wave reconstruction and reproduction errors decrease as the directional distribution width became narrower and increase together with the specified scope rr l s the variation in h s l s has no significant effects on numerical wave reproduction and the range of the directional distribution width is the dominant factor affecting wave reconstruction accuracy the maximum wave reconstruction error er max for the theoretically simulated multi directional irregular waves with a relative wider directional distribution width s 10 at rr l s 1 0 for the eeed and ptpd approaches are less than 0 36 and 0 33 respectively the er max of the re simulated multi directional irregular waves in a numerical basin is similar with that based on the directly reconstructed multi directional irregular waves wave reconstruction errors for the two wave reconstruction methods are within acceptable error ranges overall as long as the domain size remains within reasonable dimensions wave reconstruction errors exhibit little differences for the ptpd approach when the relative separations of r l s 0 12 and the accuracy of wave reconstruction for the ptpd approach is generally better than that of the eeed approach at this range of r l s we therefore advise for the optimum relative separations of the wave gauges for the ptpd approach to be kept smaller than 0 12l s as the accuracy of the ptpd approach under a narrow wave distribution width would become poorer than for the eeed approach otherwise it is worth mentioning that ideally the noise should be kept at a negligible level and the probe positioning should be made as accurate as possible in real experiments in order to accurately estimate wave components however as the whole process of these two approaches uses approximations some compromise with regards to measurement conditions in real experiments should be acceptable credit

22083,nowadays wind energy plays a great role in the world s energy production detection and experimental measurement of the effective parameters on the transient lift and drag coefficients in the blades are very important in the wind turbine design in this study the aerodynamic coefficients of an oscillating wind turbine airfoil are evaluated due to the unsteady nature of the wind turbine s surrounding flow blades are chosen according to the oscillating motion which creates unsteadiness the experiments are carried out using the constructed system in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university firstly experimental data were validated with the published experimental data these coefficients operate as an oscillating force and result in increasing the fatigue tension therefore the effective parameters in this paper including reduced frequency mean angle of attack amplitude and reynolds number were studied on the hysteresis loops in terms of real experimental conditions furthermore in the last section of the research the airfoil is corrected based on the entropy analyze results afterward the unsteady aerodynamic coefficients corrected airfoil will be measured the results show that a more suitable airfoil could be chosen based on the wind turbine s rotation frequency keywords offshore wind turbine experimental study wind tunnel pitching airfoil reduced frequency amplitude 1 introduction owing to global warming pollution and fossil fuel expiration energy generation using renewable energy resources has become one of the most appealing issues during recent years the most remarkable renewable power generation devices are solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines prasad rao and diez 2018 wind turbines are categorized into onshore and offshore due to installation locations ren et al 2018 the offshore wind turbine is an important feasible and viable source of renewable energy hand et al 2017 the wind turbine industry has been evolved at a significant speed since 1973 and after the energy crisis whereas the lack of information about wind turbines and especially lack of technical science are still observed in iran the wind turbines blades consist of an airfoil similar to an airplane s wing airfoil is considered as one of the essential designing components of the wind turbines blade which has special mechanical and aerodynamic characteristics the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor are extremely dependent on the airfoils shape the duty and performance of the airfoils are to produce a suction zone on the blade in order to create the lift force furthermore the drag force is formed despite our desire wind turbines are considered as the largest rotating machines on the earth which operate inside the lowest height boundary layer the flow field around a wind turbine is basically unsteady which has a direct effect on the output power of the wind turbine gupta and leishman 2006 successful prediction of the unsteady loads and output power of the wind turbines is important for a reliable and inexpensive design soltani and mahmoudi 2010 an aerodynamic understanding of the wind turbines in all operating modes is one of the key factors to improve their performance prediction horizontal axis wind turbines hawt experience unsteady flows during their continuous movement unsteadiness occurs due to the continuous flow field patterns such as wind speed tower effect wake effects and so forth leishman 2002a the mentioned phenomenon effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine s blades flow separation and dynamic stall resulted in the unsteady behavior of the flow lead to fatigue and failure in the wind turbines blades due to the importance of unsteady behavior in the wind turbine design process research has been greatly increased jin et al 2014 masdari et al 2018 regarding the fact that the ambient condition of the wind turbine is out of control the turbine might operate under yaw loads in this case the angle of attack aoa in the airfoil sections of the turbine during the blade rotation will change cyclically when the airfoil s aoa changes with time the airfoil might be exposed to a dynamic stall gharali et al 2018 fig 1 shows the definition of the yaw φ and blade pitch β angles the yaw angle is the angle between the rotor shaft and the freestream direction so the blade pitch angle is defined as the angle between the chord in the blade tip and surface of the rotor li et al 2016 in hawts the pitch motion might be due to the blade rotation around the pitch axis or a change in the wind speed and direction therefore this motion exists in every blade rotation karbasian et al 2014 the performance of these turbines critically depends on the environmental conditions and proper design due to the fact that the ambient conditions such as wind velocity and direction are out of control the turbine might operate under yaw loads fig 2 shows the wind when hits the rotating blades when the two velocity components are not vertical amplify each other in some zones and degrade in another zone therefore the turbine experiences an oscillatory velocity in this situation while the blades rotate the angle of attack of the turbine s airfoil deviate in a cyclic way therefore every section of a turbine blade could be considered such as a moving airfoil with a pitch oscillating exposed to a variable velocity fluid flow the oscillatory variation of flow velocity which is usually neglected has a frequency as same as the oscillation frequency of the angle of attack variation and leads to the creation of the various loads on the blade other researchers have said the same thing gharali et al 2015 gharali and johnson 2014 leishman 2002b hansen 1992 damiani et al 2018a can be expressed if the wind is perpendicular to the wind turbine there will be no component to rotate the blade and the angle of attack will be constant as shown in fig 3 we know that the wind usually hits the wind turbine blades under the yaw angle so it will have a component to rotate the wind turbine see fig 4 this component of the wind velocity affects the rotation speed of the blade the higher the angle of the yaw the more effective it is and therefore the amplitude increases therefore the amplitude is influenced by the value of the yaw angle but this velocity component sometimes amplifies and sometimes weakens it to change the direction of rotation of the blade and at one point because of the 90 degree angle between them they have no effect on each other which is a mean angle of attack and in cases where they amplify each other the angle of attack is higher than mean angle of attack and in cases that weaken each other the angle of attack is lower than mean angle of attack and thus produces a sinusoidal oscillatory motion dynamic stall is considered as a common phenomenon in hawts this happens due to various reasons including dynamic loading of the blades blade structure damage flow turbulence flow field unsteadiness side angle etc when the aoa changes by switching from a static stall angle some vortexes are formed which leads to a change in the stall occurrence mechanism compared to the static condition the boundary layer stays unseparated on the upper surface until a higher aoa compared to the static condition and the lift force increases until a higher aoa after the aoa passes over the static stall angle a low pressure vortex is created from the leading edge and gets developed on the upper airfoil surface and the lift force increases according to fig 2 when the reverse flow reaches the leading edge the separation bubble gets breaking near to the leading edge leads to a vortex formation called dynamic stall vortex this results in an increase in the suction pressure on the airfoil and a lift increase as a consequence while the low pressure vortex is reaching the airfoil s trailing edge the pressure of the upper airfoil surface reduces significantly and a maximum lift force is created in the deep dynamic stall condition afterward the vortex separates from the airfoil s surface and a high pressure vortex is formed from the trailing edge which leads to a sudden lift force reduction in addition after the high pressure vortex separation a secondary vortex is formed from the leading edge and quickly gets developed on the airfoil s surface which again leads to lift force increase gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2012 2013 in the pitching case the force and moment values are shown as a hysteresis function of the instantaneous aoa which is not observed in a static airfoil geng et al 2018 hysteresis in the dynamic condition in addition to the lift and drag force increase is one of the most notable characteristics of this phenomenon this means that at the same aoa the mentioned force values during the airfoil s upstroke movement are not as same as these forces in a downstroke movement this leads to applying sudden inevitable great loads on the blades therefore a wide range of research has been carried out to realize the physic and ways to confront the negative effects of this phenomenon gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2012 2013 mccroskey et al mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 carried out vast scale research on the oscillating airfoil they divided the airfoil pitching in 4 different cases including no stall stall onset light stall and deep stall these cases are shown in fig 5 they stated that when the airfoil is motion the stall would be delayed therefore the dynamic stall would occur in a higher aoa compared with the static stall for the dynamic stall recognition the lift coefficient chart would be used they also claimed that the stall would not happen in low amplitudes with an increase in the amplitude a crossover point would occur in the lift chart which shows the stall onset a light stall occurs with increasing the amplitude resulted from the upstroke and downstroke motion meanwhile with increasing the amplitude maximum lift occurs and then lift will be reduced which specifies the deep stall case the angle whose lift coefficient reaches to its maximum value is called the stall point at this point the separation bubble surrounds the whole airfoil s surface and the lift coefficient reduces after this point see fig 6 choudhuri et al 1994 assessed the pitching of the airfoil in a 2d case using the numerical simulation they explained the steps of the pitching movement of an airfoil according to fig six steps of aoa 0 attached flow reversed flow vortex formation of the leading edge dynamic stall and full stall wernert et al 1996 carried out experimental research to study the dynamic stall on a naca0012 airfoil the experimental measurements were obtained using piv and laser sheet detection methods the reynolds number of free stream and the reduced frequency were considered 3 73 105 and 0 15 respectively the range of airfoil oscillations was between 5 and 25 and the motion was pure pitching the comparison between numerical and experimental approaches was studied in four main phases of the dynamic stall process including attached flow dynamic stall vortex development post stall vortex shedding and reattachment fuchiwaki et al 1999 measured the drag and lift on the oscillating airfoils such as flat plate naca0010 naca0020 naca65 0910 and bte using a six axis sensor inside the water tunnel in low reynolds within different frequencies unsteady lift and drag were compared with the static condition the oscillating movement keeps the lift force higher after the separation occurs in low pitching frequencies the dynamic lift is very close to the static case but with an increase in the frequency like 3hz they are completely different akbari et al akbari and price 2003 simulated an unsteady incompressible laminar viscous flow on naca0012 airfoil and studied on the effects of various parameters they studied on parameters such as reduced frequency mean aoa pitch axis location and reynolds number they observed that the reduced frequency has the most important effect on the flow field lee and gerontakos 2004 presented the characteristics of the unsteady boundary layer and stall on a pitching naca0012 airfoil in re of 1 35 105 using a hot film sensor they evaluated the aerodynamic forces and pitching moment using the measured surface pressure integral and obtained smoke flow visualizations they focused on the transient flow behavior and boundary layer separation and reattachment compared with the static values for the oscillation frequency and amplitude wang et al 2010 assessed a 2d analysis on the dynamic stall phenomenon in unsteady flow for naca0012 airfoil and re 105 the various oscillations with reduced frequency and the mean aoa of the oscillation and amplitude were simulated using the computation fluid dynamics cfd and were compared with the experimental results they explained that the numerical and experimental results are in good conformity except when the blade is located in a very high aoa amiralaei et al 2010 numerically analyzed the pitching airfoil s aerodynamic coefficients in low reynolds numbers they studied the effects of unsteady parameters including amplitude reduced frequency and reynold number on the aerodynamic performance of naca0012 airfoil they stated that these parameters are effective on the maximum lift coefficients hysteresis loop power and a number of produced vortexes in harmonic motion and extent of a figure of eight phenomenon region therefore in order to reach the optimum lift coefficients the precise selection of these items is required rival et al rival and tropea 2010 studied the dynamic stall process for sd7003 airfoil in low reynolds within pitching and plunging conditions using the direct force measurement and flow detection inside the wind tunnel they explained that the reduced frequency has a significant effect on the vertical wake in both pitching and plunging conditions gharali and johnson 2012 carried out an oscillating freestream around an s809 airfoil using the numerical simulation they developed their analyses in various reynolds numbers of 104 to 106 and frequencies 0 026 to 18 respectively the dependence of the results on the reduced frequency and the vortex contours and aerodynamic coefficients were assessed also gharali et al gharali and johnson 2013 analyzed the effects of the freestream velocity oscillation on a naca0012 airfoil using cfd they used the corrected turbulence equations of k ω s s t the most important parameter was the phase difference between the freestream and airfoil oscillations which varies between 0 π the variations of leads to multiple increasements of the dynamic forces when π 2 to multiple reduction of these forces when π 2 until the dynamic stall forces get lower than the static stall forces it could be observed that the variations of are divided into two parts liu et al 2014 simulated a sinusoidal pitch oscillation s809 airfoil in the reduced frequencies mean aoa and various amplitudes in reynolds number of 106 using cfd they also used the reduced order methodology and claimed that the reduced order methodology has less computational costs sangwan et al 2017 numerically studied the incompressible effects on the dynamic stall of a pitching airfoil they obtained the important dynamic stall specifications it was observed that increasing the mach number leads to dynamic stalls with lower aoa the reduction in the size of air load hysteresis loops and the maximum available force coefficient were observed with increasing mach number furthermore with increasing the mach the effect of dynamic stall on the aerodynamic loads reduces guillaud et al 2017 2018 numerically simulated a naca0012 airfoil employing the les method in pitching the case and reynolds of 2 104 they analyzed the effects of the reduced frequency with regard to a delay in lift loss compared with the static case they stated that the vortex of the leading edge grows after a static stall in a higher reduced frequency and leads to a delay in the lift loss occurrence wang et al 2018 carried out a numerical research on the aerodynamic performance of a hydrofoil with a forced pitching movement the experimental pitching movement was chosen non sinusoidal they evaluated the effects of the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation on the aerodynamic coefficients and input power performance the results showed that the time average of the input power increases with the pitching frequency f although with a maximum amplitude of the oscillation reduces salmani and khoshnevis 2018 carried out experimental research on a model of a hawt s blade sections out of nrel airfoil families including the root airfoil of s823 in a wind tunnel they used the hot wire anemometer in order to measure the velocity and turbulence intensity their results showed that in the gaps near the airfoil s trailing edge the flow has an excessive velocity and increasing the aoa leads to increase the value of excessive velocity and increasing the reynolds number leads to a decrease in the excessive velocity value geng et al 2018 numerically analyzed the flow around the pitching naca0012 airfoil in reynolds number of 1 35 105 they studied the dynamic stall in almost a high aoa they claimed that the results were in good conformance with the experimental results in the upstroke motion while some deviations were observed in the downstroke motion chen et al 2018 numerically analyzed a vertical axis turbine with sinusoidal pitching blades liu et al 2019a presented a dynamic stall model of the unsteady aerodynamic forces on the wind turbine s airfoils the proposed model is based on the b l model and is practical for wind turbines lift drag and momentum of s809 airfoil develop inside the stall zone and the deep stall has been predicted the output results were in good conformance with the experimental results qi et al 2019 analyzed the naca0012 hydrofoil in a 2d case using the dynamic mesh and cfd approach they first investigated the effects of oscillation amplitude and reduced frequency for the sinusoidal pitching it was stated that with increasing the reduced frequency the average output power coefficient and optimized amplitude would be increased they also studied the effects of the non sinusoidal pitching liu et al 2019b carried out numerical research on the pitching hydrofoil they used the ansys fluent for their study in this study the effective parameters on the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine s airfoil in harmonically oscillating conditions were assessed the purpose of this research is to reach a better understanding of the effects of some determinative parameters on the instantaneous lift and drag coefficients in an unsteady flow under harmonic pitching oscillations the studied parameters were reduced frequency mean aoa oscillation amplitude and reynolds number the values of these parameters were chosen according to the real wind turbine conditions which are under experiments in hakim sabzevari university reduced frequency is one of the important parameters and has a powerful on the dynamic stall phenomenon the frequency of the rotation has a direct effect on the tip speed ratio and this parameter has a direct effect on the power coefficient therefore according to wind turbine type and number of its blades usually a constant tip speed ratio would be chosen but regarding the various blades lengths and chords reduced frequency is usually in different ranges in this paper the effect of reduced frequency as an effective parameter could be observed which is introduced as follows 1 k π f c u where f is the frequency of oscillations c is the chord s length and u is the freestream velocity the reduced frequency is defined as the flow unsteadiness around the airfoil and blades and is defined as a relation between the convective time scale c u and time scale is 1 ω when the reduced frequency is zero k 0 the flow is in steady state and when 0 k 0 005 the flow is in quasi steady state and when k 0 005 the aerodynamic flow is unsteady choudhry et al 2014 the reynolds number based on the chord would be evaluated as follows 2 r e u c ν the effect of these parameters on the hysteresis loops of the aerodynamic coefficients has been studied the lift and drag forces are the most effective aerodynamic forces on the wind turbine which could be dimensionless using the below formulas 3 c l l 1 2 ρ u 2 a 4 c d d 1 2 ρ u 2 a where l is lift force d is drag force ρ is the fluid density a is the effective airfoil surface span chord and u is the freestream velocity with a precise assessment of these parameters one can reach to an accurate understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic physics around the oscillating airfoil the experimental constructed system in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university will be introduced by the authors in the next section the novelty of the current research is the assessment of the basic parameter effects on the wind turbine operation experimentally a majority of research has been carried out during recent years but none of them has studied all of the parameters the past studies have not analyzed their effects on the lift and drag coefficient which are the most important aerodynamic parameters of an airfoil especially none of the past literature focused on the wind turbine conditions since the purpose of this paper is the assessment of the parameters of the wind turbine which is under construction in the hakim sabzevari university therefore this research has been carried out for the first time the airfoil and chosen conditions are based on the needs of wind turbines under construction and the results have been presented as research furthermore it should be noted that the oscillator system and instantaneous force viewer in every angle was prepared and produced by the authors in addition in this research the corrected airfoil is aerodynamically evaluated based on the past authors papers mamouri et al 2019a 2019b 2 experimental setup the experiments inside the low speed wind tunnel were carried out in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university fig 7 a and b shows the schematic of the wind tunnel this wind tunnel is open type and has a square test section of 40 40 cm2 and a length of 180 cm the contraction ratio of the wind tunnel is 3 1 the amount of freestream turbulence is less than 0 1 which is measured by a hot wire anemometer probe see fig 8 a in a test section without blade within maximum attainable velocity the maximum velocity of the air inside the test section was 30 m s in order to assess the uniformity of the velocity profile in the wind tunnel the average velocity profiles of the freestream along the width of the test section are plotted in fig 8 b whose sensor is located at a point to be far from the wall effects the amount of blockage is retained below 10 in this experiment according to some references kiefer et al 2016 lian 2010 the blockage has appropriate results until it reaches to 10 it should be noted that there has been lots of aerodynamic research in the laboratory which has been presented in the references khoshnevis et al 2016a khoshnevis et al 2017 khoshnevis et al 2016b khoshnevis et al 2016c khoshnevis et al 2015 the chosen airfoils according to fig 9 consist of naca0012 sd7062 and 7062 a in order to compare the selected airfoils all of the airfoils are plotted in fig 10 the naca0012 has just been chosen to validate the results according to the past results mamouri et al 2019a 2019b sd7062 airfoil is chosen as the best airfoil for the wind turbine condition which is under construction in the university of hakim sabzevari 7062 a is as same as sd7062 with minor corrections which has evaluated based on the entropy results and the streamlines the chord length of all airfoils is 10 cm and their span is 38 cm see fig 11 the distance between the airfoil and the wind tunnel wall is less than 10 mm selected to reduce the leakage flow airfoils oscillate in 1 4 of chord from the leading edge the oscillating motion of the airfoil is based on the below relation see fig 12 5 α α 0 d s i n 2 π f t whereas α 0 is the mean aoa d is the amplitude and f is the frequency of motion fig 13 presents the airfoil assemble method inside the wind tunnel from back view of the model the oscillating mechanism in this research is introduced in fig 14 a and b in addition the complete 3d image of this mechanism is presented in fig 15 a and b for the pitch mechanism a servo motor fig 16 a and a flywheel fig 16 b are used the motor is connected to a crank system in order to convert the unidirectional rotation motion to an alternative rotation motion fig 16 c the off center connection gap of the rod connected to the motor shaft adjusts the motion amplitude using an encoder connected to the airfoil shaft the instantaneous aoa is viewed using two s shape load cells fig 16 d horizontal and vertical forces are viewed in a moment in order to connect the airfoil axis to the oscillating system self aligning double row ball bearings and universal ball bearings were used fig 16 e furthermore the whole orders including the motor start reading and recording the results of the encoder and load cell is done with a controller at any time fig 16 f fig 17 a and b represents the image a d no 1 and pitot anemometer which shows the static and total pressure data and also the hot wire data which is digitalized and transferred to a computer the uncertainty in the aerodynamic characteristics is less than 5 the purpose of this system s construction is to analyze the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine airfoil during the pitching motion studying the effects of the amplitude reduced frequency mean aoa and reynolds number could improve the performance and life length of the wind turbine 3 validation in order to identify the wind tunnel s results which has been done in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university first the static state naca0012 airfoil was analyzed in reynolds number of 23000 aerodynamically then the output experimental results would be compared with the results of the xfoil software and the results of kijma et al kojima et al 2013 and cfd results see fig 18 this shows the validity of the obtained experimental results in order to verify the results of the dynamic state experimental system the experimental study of kim et al kim and chang 2014 in 2014 was used this research was done on a naca0012 airfoil in a dynamic state regarding the conditions of the mentioned research the results are obtained in r e 2 3 10 4 and airfoil oscillates as below equation 6 α t 0 6 s i n ω t in this equation reduced frequency is defined as k 0 1 in order to equalize the results the airfoil gets mean aoa 0 and the amplitude is set to 6 to create a reduced frequency of 0 1 the system frequency requires to be adjusted on 1 27hz or 76 rpm in addition to equalize the reynolds number regarding the ambient conditions and chord length the velocity of the wind tunnel is set on 4 m s in order to assess the results equality in various periods of the pitching airfoil the values of lift and drag forces and instantaneous aoa according to period are plotted in fig 19 as it can be observed the force values in various periods are almost the same furthermore the aerodynamic force hysteresis compared to instantaneous aoa and time in one period is plotted in fig 20 fig 21 a and b shows the result comparison of the above study and obtained results of laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university which shows the validity of the results see fig 22 the results show that the percentage of error is less than 5 in the angles close to zero angle and the value of error increases to 10 with going far from the zero angle 4 results and discussion the most important aerodynamic forces applying on the wind turbine s blades are lift and drag forces it is convenient for the wind turbine to create conditions where the lift coefficient increases while the drag coefficient remains small this will generate more energy from the wind while less power will be applied to the wind turbine structure resulting in lower wind turbine construction costs and longer lifespan these forces were measured using the balancing devices in the wind tunnel test the effects of the mean aoa reduced frequency reynolds number and amplitude for both sd7062 and 7062 a were studied the hysteresis chart of the aerodynamic coefficients was plotted for all cases the step by step flow chart is as follows 4 1 the effect of mean angle of attack α 0 in a pitching airfoil mean angle of attack α 0 is considered as one of the effective aerodynamic parameters because with an increase in the mean aoa in a constant amplitude reduced frequency and reynolds number leads to separation and stall as a consequence for this section the amplitude of 10 and a reduced frequency of 0 02 37 rpm and 0 62hz and reynolds number of 100000 15 m s were selected and maintained constant during the experiment in order to check the mean aoa effect it was set to 0 5 and 10 fig 23 shows the deviation curve of lift and drag coefficients according to the aoa α t based on fig 23 a with growing the mean aoa the maximum lift coefficient is also growing accordingly according to fig 23 b with an increase in the mean aoa the maximum drag coefficient is gradually increased whereas the minimum drag coefficient has not been changed significantly in a low mean aoa separation does not occur obviously therefore the effects of rotation lead to retain the lift hysteresis chart in a counter clockwise state in this case with increasing the amplitude the airfoil within the light stall confronts with an upstroke motion at the end of its movement in the zone near the stall the delay in phase and pushing it forward in an upstroke motion lead to form shapes in lift hysteresis curves the stall onset point detection process according to the reference mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 is the crossover point in the hysteresis chart of the lift as stall onset point is shown in fig 23 in every amplitude the dynamic stall would occur with increasing the mean aoa in conclusion the slope of the curve reduces with going to the stall zone furthermore in higher amplitudes a deeper stall will occur also the crossover point moves back which shows a deeper dynamic stall and a delay in the flow reattachment through downstroke motion according to fig 5 and references mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 it could be said that generally the separation bubble gets bigger in higher aoa airfoils and the deviations of lift coefficient in upstroke and downstroke motion grows higher which indicates a deeper stall as fig 23 a shows the lift force experiences a linear increase when the airfoil moves upstroke which is due to pressure difference increase in two sides of the airfoil resulted by leading edge vortex formation on the airfoil s upper surface this increase continues until the leading edge vortex surrounds the whole airfoil s upper surface at that moment the aerodynamic forces reach their maximum values and a dynamic stall occurs gharali et al 2018 see fig 24 afterward the leading edge vortexes start to shedding and the trailing edge vortexes are formed and lead to a loss in lift force the leading edge vortexes are also formed in a downstroke motion and lead to an increase in lift force but its power is not as same as in the upstroke motion karbasian et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 20 with growing the mean aoa from 0 to 5 the maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient will increase to 15 and 50 respectively with growing the mean aoa 5 10 the maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient will increase to 6 and 45 respectively 4 2 the effect of reduced frequency k the reduced frequency could be considered as the most important parameter in pitching airfoil therefore in this section of the experiment three different reduced frequencies with constant mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number on the hysteresis of aerodynamic coefficients were assessed for the pitching airfoils fig 25 shows the hysteresis chart of lift and drag coefficients in various reduced frequencies in this analysis the mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number have been considered as 0 10 and 105 free stream velocity of 15 m s respectively the analyzed frequencies consist of 0 02 37 rpm and 0 62hz 0 1 240 rpm and 4hz and 0 2 354 rpm and 5 9hz the selected frequencies are due to the fact that the wind turbine is under construction the other research also focused have selected the same reduced frequency for their airfoils gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2013 the airfoil s motion is near the stall condition in this experiment regarding the references mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 with a crossover point in the lift hysteresis curve the light stall starts and when there is a deviation between the lift force in upstroke and downstroke motions the airfoil becomes closer to deep stall condition as it can be observed with an increase in the reduced frequency the maximum lift coefficient increases slightly and the chart would be wider with lower slopes the reason for the reduction of the slope is the flow resistance against the vortex shedding which leads to a delay in the dynamic stall furthermore the crossover point which creates shape zone moves forward with growing the reduced frequency this indicates a sooner reattachment of the flow in a downstroke motion at this point the value of lift in downstroke motion exceeds its corresponding value in upstroke motion which might be due to flow reattachment to the upper surface in the downstroke motion or existence of the past vortexes formed in high aoa fig 25 b shows the drag coefficient according to aoa as it can be observed with growing the reduced frequency the maximum drag coefficient increases and the hysteresis loop width would be developed the effects of the reduced frequency during the downstroke motion are higher than the upstroke motion according to fig 25 with an increase in reduced frequency from 0 02 to 0 1 the maximum lift and drag coefficients would increase 15 and 9 respectively on the other hand with an increase in reduced frequency from 0 1 to 0 2 the maximum lift and drag coefficients would increase 2 and 4 respectively the increase in the reduced frequency leads to a delay in the leading edge vortex formation during the upstroke but earlier leading edge vortex formation during the downstroke motion gharali et al 2018 while the pitching airfoil moves the leading edge could be considered as a rotary cylinder which is called the leading edge jet effect fig 26 ericsson and reding 1984 furthermore in an upstroke motion excessive momentum would be transferred to the airfoil s upper surface fig 27 tseng and cheng 2015 the excessive momentum prevents the inverse pressure gradient and leads to more boundary layer resistance created on the airfoil s surface against the separation as a result the boundary layer separation would be delayed which leads to an increase in the maximum lift coefficient and its corresponding aoa the deviations in the maximum lift coefficient and the corresponding aoa in terms of dynamics and statics would be significant with regard to reduced frequency increase choudhry et al 2014 4 3 the effect of reynolds number one of the effective aerodynamic parameters is the reynolds number the airfoil chord depends on the geometry of the airfoil so it only changes with dimensionality for a given airfoil with specific dimensions the cord is always fixed but in the wind turbine blades it varies from root to tip see fig 28 as a result it is necessary to examine the effect of the cord the effect of the cord is effective on the reynolds number which means that with the change of the cord the reynolds number increases as we know the reynolds number depends on the cord density velocity and viscosity of the three parameters for a blade from root to tip only the cord changes so for a wind turbine blade the cord effect is the only factor affecting the reynolds number therefore in this paper we investigate the effects of reynolds number which is effective on cord number variation other articles have examined this effect for example references koca et al 2018 oukassou et al 2019 olson et al 2013 li et al 2019 can be named therefore in this section this parameter is assessed when others are constant the effect of reynolds number on the lift and drag coefficient in reynolds numbers of 50000 7 5 m s 100000 15 m s and 150000 22 5 m s has been investigated this assessment is carried out for a reduced frequency of 0 2 5 9hz and 354 rpm the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 which is shown in fig 29 when reynolds number increases the maximum lift coefficient increases and the momentum also increase with the reynolds number increase as a result the flow resistance against the separation increases and the lift coefficient grows higher an increase in the maximum lift coefficient occurs with a shape phenomenon after passing over the crossover point in an upstroke motion the lift coefficient becomes higher compared to its value in a downstroke motion with the reynolds number reduction the maximum lift coefficient reduces slightly and the shape phenomenon would be eliminated furthermore it is observed that the lift coefficients in upstroke and downstroke motions would become close to each other which might be due to the increase of flow power in higher reynolds and a decrease in the reduced frequency effect fig 29 b shows the drag coefficient according to the aoa for various reynolds numbers as it shows the minimum drag coefficient reduces with the reynolds number increase and it can be said that the drag coefficient reduces significantly with the reynolds number increase the reynolds number increase has positive effects for both aerodynamic forces it increases the lift and reduces the drag which indicates the momentum effect on the separation an increase in the reynolds number leads to an increase in the momentum and the separation effect on the aerodynamic forces as fig 29 shows with an increase in the reynolds number from 50000 to 100000 the maximum lift coefficient increases 19 and the maximum drag coefficient decreases 2 in addition with an increase in the reynolds number from 100000 to 150000 the maximum lift coefficient increase 8 and the maximum drag coefficient reduces 45 4 4 the effect of amplitude d in this section the effects of amplitude for constant mean aoa reduced frequency and reynolds number has been carried out therefore the experiment is done in reynolds number of 100000 15 m s mean aoa α 0 of 0 and the reduced frequency k of 0 1 4hz 240 rpm for amplitudes of 8 10 and 12 as it is observed the increase of amplitude increases the flow unsteadiness and widens the hysteresis chart in fact the increase of the amplitude leads to an increase in the difference between the aerodynamic coefficients in upstroke and downstroke motions which is considered a type of unsteadiness it is shown that while the amplitude is increasing some small deviations occur in the lift curve which is due to the stability of the reduced frequency this is because of the fact that the increase of the reduced frequency leads to a delay in the lift increase and reduction of the lift slope the maximum lift coefficient for higher amplitude moves forward the value of the maximum lift slightly increases with an increase in the amplitude which is due to a delay in the separation and the movement of the dynamic separated vortexes in higher amplitude thanks to the high reduced frequency when the mean aoa is small the airfoil oscillates out of the dynamic stall range therefore the effects of the oscillation lead to a delay in the flow according to the airfoil motion and as a result the counterclockwise zone dominates in the hysteresis loop in the larger amplitude for the same aoa the airfoil creates more lift in its upstroke motion in comparison with the downstroke motion the loops existence is a result of the induced velocities which leads to a difference between the lift coefficient in upstroke and downstroke motions despite the effect of the amplitude on the maximum lift coefficient and the width of the hysteresis loop and amplifying the vortex structure it has not a noticeable effect on the lift curve slope the curve of the drag coefficient according to the aoa is presented in fig 30 b similar to the lift coefficient the maximum value of the drag coefficient in higher amplitude increases furthermore the minimum drag coefficient remains almost constant and does not change noticeably in the aoa of 0 the drag coefficient is almost ineffective by the amplitude as fig 30 shows while the amplitude is growing from 8 to 10 the maximum lift and drag coefficients increase 14 and 80 respectively with an increase in the amplitudes from 10 to 12 the maximum lift and drag coefficients increase 14 and 60 respectively with increasing the amplitudes the distance between the upstroke and downstroke motions increases which indicates approaching the stall condition 4 5 the corrected airfoil aerodynamic analysis the authors have carried out a thermodynamic analysis on the practical airfoils in the wind turbine in their previous research the relationship between the second law efficiency which is directly related to entropy with the aerodynamic coefficients has been thoroughly investigated in the papers of the authors of this paper mamouri et al 2019a 2019b afterward they tried to generate a new geometry based on the minimum entropy generation therefore with the intended circumstances they tried to obtain the optimized airfoil using the entropy reduction so they corrected the geometry of sd7062 airfoil and designed the optimized airfoil in order to entropy assessment the total entropy for both obtained airfoils is divided on the main airfoil s entropy which is presented in fig 31 this figure shows the entropy reduction in the optimized airfoil in order to compute the entropy the presented relation in the reference nazeryan and lakzian 2018 is used 7 s μ t 0 ϕ fig 32 develops an aerodynamic assessment on the corrected airfoils compared to the sd7062 airfoil in this case the reduced frequency is 0 1 4hz 240 rpm reynolds is 100000 15 m s the amplitude is 10 and the mean aoa is considered 0 as it shows the maximum lift coefficient in the corrected airfoil has become a bit more it has increased about 6 5 in an upstroke motion the main and corrected airfoil have almost the same lift coefficient and in a downstroke motion the corrected airfoil has dropped less this might be due to the correction in the lower surface of the airfoil it can also be observed that in the shape phenomenon the crossover point has moved forward slightly which indicates that the flow reattachment to the airfoil occurs in downstroke motion the maximum drag coefficient of the corrected airfoil is slightly less than the maximum drag coefficient of the main airfoil and also in the downstroke motion the drag coefficient of the corrected airfoil is less than the drag coefficient of the main airfoil which shows the improvement in the downstroke motion it should be explained that based on li et al research li and figliola 2004 and monsch et al 2007 and also ghisu et al 2018 there is a direct relation between the entropy generation and drag coefficient as it is observed in this section the entropy generation has an important effect on the drag coefficient the drag coefficient plays an important role in the structure design on the wind turbine the safe performance of the wind turbine requires paying attention to the drag coefficient and safety factor related to it zhou et al 2013 according to fig 32 with airfoil correction the maximum lift coefficient has increased 6 5 and the corresponding drag coefficient has decreased 40 as it is observed in the main airfoil the distance between the lift in upstroke and downstroke motion is more than the optimized airfoil which shows keeping away from the stall in the optimized airfoil 5 conclusion in this research an experimental study was carried out on the effects of the reduced frequency mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number on the hysteresis of the pitching lift and drag coefficients for a wind turbine the curves comparison showed that the mentioned parameters effect on the slope and width of the hysteresis curves and the crossover point location and the direction of rotation 1 with an increase in the mean aoa in the amplitude of 10 reduced frequency of 0 02 and reynolds number of 100000 stall drags into deep stall point and the crossover point moves backward and the maximum lift coefficient increases too because the more the airfoil reaches to deep stall point the more it reaches the maximum lift too furthermore the maximum drag coefficient grows sharply with an increase in the mean aoa 2 an increase in the reduced frequency in the mean aoa of 0 and amplitude of 10 and reynolds number of 100000 leads to an increase in the maximum lift coefficient and the crossover point moves forward which indicates a stall delay the effect of the reduced frequency on the drag coefficient is less and in the downstroke motion increases the drag coefficient slightly 3 with an increase in the reynolds number in reduced frequency of 0 2 the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 the maximum lift coefficient increases and the crossover point moves forward which shows a delay in the stall in addition the minimum drag coefficient reduces with the reynolds increase 4 with an increase in the amplitude reynolds of 100000 mean aoa of 0 and reduced frequency of 0 1 the amount of maximum lift increases slightly and the crossover point moves backward which indicates that stall has come forward despite the earlier stall because a deep stall has not occurred with an increase in the amplitude the airfoil stays longer in the light stall therefore with an increase in the amplitude a higher lift is expected which continues until the deep stall occurs then a sudden lift reduction occurs moreover the maximum drag coefficient increase with an increase in the amplitude 5 the corrected airfoil based on the aerodynamic results has been assessed according to aerodynamic analysis the results show that for the reduced frequency of 0 1 reynolds number of 100000 the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 the lift coefficient improved slightly especially in the downstroke motion on the other hand the drag coefficient has reduced significantly which shows the effect of entropy generation on the drag coefficient according to the mentioned cases it is suggested that regarding of the wind speed rotation frequency and also the geometrical parameters attributed to wind turbines blades the designers and production engineers of the wind turbines check out the lift and drag vs instantaneous aoa curves afterward the appropriate airfoil should be selected based on the dynamic conditions to obtain a

22083,nowadays wind energy plays a great role in the world s energy production detection and experimental measurement of the effective parameters on the transient lift and drag coefficients in the blades are very important in the wind turbine design in this study the aerodynamic coefficients of an oscillating wind turbine airfoil are evaluated due to the unsteady nature of the wind turbine s surrounding flow blades are chosen according to the oscillating motion which creates unsteadiness the experiments are carried out using the constructed system in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university firstly experimental data were validated with the published experimental data these coefficients operate as an oscillating force and result in increasing the fatigue tension therefore the effective parameters in this paper including reduced frequency mean angle of attack amplitude and reynolds number were studied on the hysteresis loops in terms of real experimental conditions furthermore in the last section of the research the airfoil is corrected based on the entropy analyze results afterward the unsteady aerodynamic coefficients corrected airfoil will be measured the results show that a more suitable airfoil could be chosen based on the wind turbine s rotation frequency keywords offshore wind turbine experimental study wind tunnel pitching airfoil reduced frequency amplitude 1 introduction owing to global warming pollution and fossil fuel expiration energy generation using renewable energy resources has become one of the most appealing issues during recent years the most remarkable renewable power generation devices are solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines prasad rao and diez 2018 wind turbines are categorized into onshore and offshore due to installation locations ren et al 2018 the offshore wind turbine is an important feasible and viable source of renewable energy hand et al 2017 the wind turbine industry has been evolved at a significant speed since 1973 and after the energy crisis whereas the lack of information about wind turbines and especially lack of technical science are still observed in iran the wind turbines blades consist of an airfoil similar to an airplane s wing airfoil is considered as one of the essential designing components of the wind turbines blade which has special mechanical and aerodynamic characteristics the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor are extremely dependent on the airfoils shape the duty and performance of the airfoils are to produce a suction zone on the blade in order to create the lift force furthermore the drag force is formed despite our desire wind turbines are considered as the largest rotating machines on the earth which operate inside the lowest height boundary layer the flow field around a wind turbine is basically unsteady which has a direct effect on the output power of the wind turbine gupta and leishman 2006 successful prediction of the unsteady loads and output power of the wind turbines is important for a reliable and inexpensive design soltani and mahmoudi 2010 an aerodynamic understanding of the wind turbines in all operating modes is one of the key factors to improve their performance prediction horizontal axis wind turbines hawt experience unsteady flows during their continuous movement unsteadiness occurs due to the continuous flow field patterns such as wind speed tower effect wake effects and so forth leishman 2002a the mentioned phenomenon effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine s blades flow separation and dynamic stall resulted in the unsteady behavior of the flow lead to fatigue and failure in the wind turbines blades due to the importance of unsteady behavior in the wind turbine design process research has been greatly increased jin et al 2014 masdari et al 2018 regarding the fact that the ambient condition of the wind turbine is out of control the turbine might operate under yaw loads in this case the angle of attack aoa in the airfoil sections of the turbine during the blade rotation will change cyclically when the airfoil s aoa changes with time the airfoil might be exposed to a dynamic stall gharali et al 2018 fig 1 shows the definition of the yaw φ and blade pitch β angles the yaw angle is the angle between the rotor shaft and the freestream direction so the blade pitch angle is defined as the angle between the chord in the blade tip and surface of the rotor li et al 2016 in hawts the pitch motion might be due to the blade rotation around the pitch axis or a change in the wind speed and direction therefore this motion exists in every blade rotation karbasian et al 2014 the performance of these turbines critically depends on the environmental conditions and proper design due to the fact that the ambient conditions such as wind velocity and direction are out of control the turbine might operate under yaw loads fig 2 shows the wind when hits the rotating blades when the two velocity components are not vertical amplify each other in some zones and degrade in another zone therefore the turbine experiences an oscillatory velocity in this situation while the blades rotate the angle of attack of the turbine s airfoil deviate in a cyclic way therefore every section of a turbine blade could be considered such as a moving airfoil with a pitch oscillating exposed to a variable velocity fluid flow the oscillatory variation of flow velocity which is usually neglected has a frequency as same as the oscillation frequency of the angle of attack variation and leads to the creation of the various loads on the blade other researchers have said the same thing gharali et al 2015 gharali and johnson 2014 leishman 2002b hansen 1992 damiani et al 2018a can be expressed if the wind is perpendicular to the wind turbine there will be no component to rotate the blade and the angle of attack will be constant as shown in fig 3 we know that the wind usually hits the wind turbine blades under the yaw angle so it will have a component to rotate the wind turbine see fig 4 this component of the wind velocity affects the rotation speed of the blade the higher the angle of the yaw the more effective it is and therefore the amplitude increases therefore the amplitude is influenced by the value of the yaw angle but this velocity component sometimes amplifies and sometimes weakens it to change the direction of rotation of the blade and at one point because of the 90 degree angle between them they have no effect on each other which is a mean angle of attack and in cases where they amplify each other the angle of attack is higher than mean angle of attack and in cases that weaken each other the angle of attack is lower than mean angle of attack and thus produces a sinusoidal oscillatory motion dynamic stall is considered as a common phenomenon in hawts this happens due to various reasons including dynamic loading of the blades blade structure damage flow turbulence flow field unsteadiness side angle etc when the aoa changes by switching from a static stall angle some vortexes are formed which leads to a change in the stall occurrence mechanism compared to the static condition the boundary layer stays unseparated on the upper surface until a higher aoa compared to the static condition and the lift force increases until a higher aoa after the aoa passes over the static stall angle a low pressure vortex is created from the leading edge and gets developed on the upper airfoil surface and the lift force increases according to fig 2 when the reverse flow reaches the leading edge the separation bubble gets breaking near to the leading edge leads to a vortex formation called dynamic stall vortex this results in an increase in the suction pressure on the airfoil and a lift increase as a consequence while the low pressure vortex is reaching the airfoil s trailing edge the pressure of the upper airfoil surface reduces significantly and a maximum lift force is created in the deep dynamic stall condition afterward the vortex separates from the airfoil s surface and a high pressure vortex is formed from the trailing edge which leads to a sudden lift force reduction in addition after the high pressure vortex separation a secondary vortex is formed from the leading edge and quickly gets developed on the airfoil s surface which again leads to lift force increase gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2012 2013 in the pitching case the force and moment values are shown as a hysteresis function of the instantaneous aoa which is not observed in a static airfoil geng et al 2018 hysteresis in the dynamic condition in addition to the lift and drag force increase is one of the most notable characteristics of this phenomenon this means that at the same aoa the mentioned force values during the airfoil s upstroke movement are not as same as these forces in a downstroke movement this leads to applying sudden inevitable great loads on the blades therefore a wide range of research has been carried out to realize the physic and ways to confront the negative effects of this phenomenon gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2012 2013 mccroskey et al mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 carried out vast scale research on the oscillating airfoil they divided the airfoil pitching in 4 different cases including no stall stall onset light stall and deep stall these cases are shown in fig 5 they stated that when the airfoil is motion the stall would be delayed therefore the dynamic stall would occur in a higher aoa compared with the static stall for the dynamic stall recognition the lift coefficient chart would be used they also claimed that the stall would not happen in low amplitudes with an increase in the amplitude a crossover point would occur in the lift chart which shows the stall onset a light stall occurs with increasing the amplitude resulted from the upstroke and downstroke motion meanwhile with increasing the amplitude maximum lift occurs and then lift will be reduced which specifies the deep stall case the angle whose lift coefficient reaches to its maximum value is called the stall point at this point the separation bubble surrounds the whole airfoil s surface and the lift coefficient reduces after this point see fig 6 choudhuri et al 1994 assessed the pitching of the airfoil in a 2d case using the numerical simulation they explained the steps of the pitching movement of an airfoil according to fig six steps of aoa 0 attached flow reversed flow vortex formation of the leading edge dynamic stall and full stall wernert et al 1996 carried out experimental research to study the dynamic stall on a naca0012 airfoil the experimental measurements were obtained using piv and laser sheet detection methods the reynolds number of free stream and the reduced frequency were considered 3 73 105 and 0 15 respectively the range of airfoil oscillations was between 5 and 25 and the motion was pure pitching the comparison between numerical and experimental approaches was studied in four main phases of the dynamic stall process including attached flow dynamic stall vortex development post stall vortex shedding and reattachment fuchiwaki et al 1999 measured the drag and lift on the oscillating airfoils such as flat plate naca0010 naca0020 naca65 0910 and bte using a six axis sensor inside the water tunnel in low reynolds within different frequencies unsteady lift and drag were compared with the static condition the oscillating movement keeps the lift force higher after the separation occurs in low pitching frequencies the dynamic lift is very close to the static case but with an increase in the frequency like 3hz they are completely different akbari et al akbari and price 2003 simulated an unsteady incompressible laminar viscous flow on naca0012 airfoil and studied on the effects of various parameters they studied on parameters such as reduced frequency mean aoa pitch axis location and reynolds number they observed that the reduced frequency has the most important effect on the flow field lee and gerontakos 2004 presented the characteristics of the unsteady boundary layer and stall on a pitching naca0012 airfoil in re of 1 35 105 using a hot film sensor they evaluated the aerodynamic forces and pitching moment using the measured surface pressure integral and obtained smoke flow visualizations they focused on the transient flow behavior and boundary layer separation and reattachment compared with the static values for the oscillation frequency and amplitude wang et al 2010 assessed a 2d analysis on the dynamic stall phenomenon in unsteady flow for naca0012 airfoil and re 105 the various oscillations with reduced frequency and the mean aoa of the oscillation and amplitude were simulated using the computation fluid dynamics cfd and were compared with the experimental results they explained that the numerical and experimental results are in good conformity except when the blade is located in a very high aoa amiralaei et al 2010 numerically analyzed the pitching airfoil s aerodynamic coefficients in low reynolds numbers they studied the effects of unsteady parameters including amplitude reduced frequency and reynold number on the aerodynamic performance of naca0012 airfoil they stated that these parameters are effective on the maximum lift coefficients hysteresis loop power and a number of produced vortexes in harmonic motion and extent of a figure of eight phenomenon region therefore in order to reach the optimum lift coefficients the precise selection of these items is required rival et al rival and tropea 2010 studied the dynamic stall process for sd7003 airfoil in low reynolds within pitching and plunging conditions using the direct force measurement and flow detection inside the wind tunnel they explained that the reduced frequency has a significant effect on the vertical wake in both pitching and plunging conditions gharali and johnson 2012 carried out an oscillating freestream around an s809 airfoil using the numerical simulation they developed their analyses in various reynolds numbers of 104 to 106 and frequencies 0 026 to 18 respectively the dependence of the results on the reduced frequency and the vortex contours and aerodynamic coefficients were assessed also gharali et al gharali and johnson 2013 analyzed the effects of the freestream velocity oscillation on a naca0012 airfoil using cfd they used the corrected turbulence equations of k ω s s t the most important parameter was the phase difference between the freestream and airfoil oscillations which varies between 0 π the variations of leads to multiple increasements of the dynamic forces when π 2 to multiple reduction of these forces when π 2 until the dynamic stall forces get lower than the static stall forces it could be observed that the variations of are divided into two parts liu et al 2014 simulated a sinusoidal pitch oscillation s809 airfoil in the reduced frequencies mean aoa and various amplitudes in reynolds number of 106 using cfd they also used the reduced order methodology and claimed that the reduced order methodology has less computational costs sangwan et al 2017 numerically studied the incompressible effects on the dynamic stall of a pitching airfoil they obtained the important dynamic stall specifications it was observed that increasing the mach number leads to dynamic stalls with lower aoa the reduction in the size of air load hysteresis loops and the maximum available force coefficient were observed with increasing mach number furthermore with increasing the mach the effect of dynamic stall on the aerodynamic loads reduces guillaud et al 2017 2018 numerically simulated a naca0012 airfoil employing the les method in pitching the case and reynolds of 2 104 they analyzed the effects of the reduced frequency with regard to a delay in lift loss compared with the static case they stated that the vortex of the leading edge grows after a static stall in a higher reduced frequency and leads to a delay in the lift loss occurrence wang et al 2018 carried out a numerical research on the aerodynamic performance of a hydrofoil with a forced pitching movement the experimental pitching movement was chosen non sinusoidal they evaluated the effects of the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation on the aerodynamic coefficients and input power performance the results showed that the time average of the input power increases with the pitching frequency f although with a maximum amplitude of the oscillation reduces salmani and khoshnevis 2018 carried out experimental research on a model of a hawt s blade sections out of nrel airfoil families including the root airfoil of s823 in a wind tunnel they used the hot wire anemometer in order to measure the velocity and turbulence intensity their results showed that in the gaps near the airfoil s trailing edge the flow has an excessive velocity and increasing the aoa leads to increase the value of excessive velocity and increasing the reynolds number leads to a decrease in the excessive velocity value geng et al 2018 numerically analyzed the flow around the pitching naca0012 airfoil in reynolds number of 1 35 105 they studied the dynamic stall in almost a high aoa they claimed that the results were in good conformance with the experimental results in the upstroke motion while some deviations were observed in the downstroke motion chen et al 2018 numerically analyzed a vertical axis turbine with sinusoidal pitching blades liu et al 2019a presented a dynamic stall model of the unsteady aerodynamic forces on the wind turbine s airfoils the proposed model is based on the b l model and is practical for wind turbines lift drag and momentum of s809 airfoil develop inside the stall zone and the deep stall has been predicted the output results were in good conformance with the experimental results qi et al 2019 analyzed the naca0012 hydrofoil in a 2d case using the dynamic mesh and cfd approach they first investigated the effects of oscillation amplitude and reduced frequency for the sinusoidal pitching it was stated that with increasing the reduced frequency the average output power coefficient and optimized amplitude would be increased they also studied the effects of the non sinusoidal pitching liu et al 2019b carried out numerical research on the pitching hydrofoil they used the ansys fluent for their study in this study the effective parameters on the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine s airfoil in harmonically oscillating conditions were assessed the purpose of this research is to reach a better understanding of the effects of some determinative parameters on the instantaneous lift and drag coefficients in an unsteady flow under harmonic pitching oscillations the studied parameters were reduced frequency mean aoa oscillation amplitude and reynolds number the values of these parameters were chosen according to the real wind turbine conditions which are under experiments in hakim sabzevari university reduced frequency is one of the important parameters and has a powerful on the dynamic stall phenomenon the frequency of the rotation has a direct effect on the tip speed ratio and this parameter has a direct effect on the power coefficient therefore according to wind turbine type and number of its blades usually a constant tip speed ratio would be chosen but regarding the various blades lengths and chords reduced frequency is usually in different ranges in this paper the effect of reduced frequency as an effective parameter could be observed which is introduced as follows 1 k π f c u where f is the frequency of oscillations c is the chord s length and u is the freestream velocity the reduced frequency is defined as the flow unsteadiness around the airfoil and blades and is defined as a relation between the convective time scale c u and time scale is 1 ω when the reduced frequency is zero k 0 the flow is in steady state and when 0 k 0 005 the flow is in quasi steady state and when k 0 005 the aerodynamic flow is unsteady choudhry et al 2014 the reynolds number based on the chord would be evaluated as follows 2 r e u c ν the effect of these parameters on the hysteresis loops of the aerodynamic coefficients has been studied the lift and drag forces are the most effective aerodynamic forces on the wind turbine which could be dimensionless using the below formulas 3 c l l 1 2 ρ u 2 a 4 c d d 1 2 ρ u 2 a where l is lift force d is drag force ρ is the fluid density a is the effective airfoil surface span chord and u is the freestream velocity with a precise assessment of these parameters one can reach to an accurate understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic physics around the oscillating airfoil the experimental constructed system in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university will be introduced by the authors in the next section the novelty of the current research is the assessment of the basic parameter effects on the wind turbine operation experimentally a majority of research has been carried out during recent years but none of them has studied all of the parameters the past studies have not analyzed their effects on the lift and drag coefficient which are the most important aerodynamic parameters of an airfoil especially none of the past literature focused on the wind turbine conditions since the purpose of this paper is the assessment of the parameters of the wind turbine which is under construction in the hakim sabzevari university therefore this research has been carried out for the first time the airfoil and chosen conditions are based on the needs of wind turbines under construction and the results have been presented as research furthermore it should be noted that the oscillator system and instantaneous force viewer in every angle was prepared and produced by the authors in addition in this research the corrected airfoil is aerodynamically evaluated based on the past authors papers mamouri et al 2019a 2019b 2 experimental setup the experiments inside the low speed wind tunnel were carried out in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university fig 7 a and b shows the schematic of the wind tunnel this wind tunnel is open type and has a square test section of 40 40 cm2 and a length of 180 cm the contraction ratio of the wind tunnel is 3 1 the amount of freestream turbulence is less than 0 1 which is measured by a hot wire anemometer probe see fig 8 a in a test section without blade within maximum attainable velocity the maximum velocity of the air inside the test section was 30 m s in order to assess the uniformity of the velocity profile in the wind tunnel the average velocity profiles of the freestream along the width of the test section are plotted in fig 8 b whose sensor is located at a point to be far from the wall effects the amount of blockage is retained below 10 in this experiment according to some references kiefer et al 2016 lian 2010 the blockage has appropriate results until it reaches to 10 it should be noted that there has been lots of aerodynamic research in the laboratory which has been presented in the references khoshnevis et al 2016a khoshnevis et al 2017 khoshnevis et al 2016b khoshnevis et al 2016c khoshnevis et al 2015 the chosen airfoils according to fig 9 consist of naca0012 sd7062 and 7062 a in order to compare the selected airfoils all of the airfoils are plotted in fig 10 the naca0012 has just been chosen to validate the results according to the past results mamouri et al 2019a 2019b sd7062 airfoil is chosen as the best airfoil for the wind turbine condition which is under construction in the university of hakim sabzevari 7062 a is as same as sd7062 with minor corrections which has evaluated based on the entropy results and the streamlines the chord length of all airfoils is 10 cm and their span is 38 cm see fig 11 the distance between the airfoil and the wind tunnel wall is less than 10 mm selected to reduce the leakage flow airfoils oscillate in 1 4 of chord from the leading edge the oscillating motion of the airfoil is based on the below relation see fig 12 5 α α 0 d s i n 2 π f t whereas α 0 is the mean aoa d is the amplitude and f is the frequency of motion fig 13 presents the airfoil assemble method inside the wind tunnel from back view of the model the oscillating mechanism in this research is introduced in fig 14 a and b in addition the complete 3d image of this mechanism is presented in fig 15 a and b for the pitch mechanism a servo motor fig 16 a and a flywheel fig 16 b are used the motor is connected to a crank system in order to convert the unidirectional rotation motion to an alternative rotation motion fig 16 c the off center connection gap of the rod connected to the motor shaft adjusts the motion amplitude using an encoder connected to the airfoil shaft the instantaneous aoa is viewed using two s shape load cells fig 16 d horizontal and vertical forces are viewed in a moment in order to connect the airfoil axis to the oscillating system self aligning double row ball bearings and universal ball bearings were used fig 16 e furthermore the whole orders including the motor start reading and recording the results of the encoder and load cell is done with a controller at any time fig 16 f fig 17 a and b represents the image a d no 1 and pitot anemometer which shows the static and total pressure data and also the hot wire data which is digitalized and transferred to a computer the uncertainty in the aerodynamic characteristics is less than 5 the purpose of this system s construction is to analyze the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine airfoil during the pitching motion studying the effects of the amplitude reduced frequency mean aoa and reynolds number could improve the performance and life length of the wind turbine 3 validation in order to identify the wind tunnel s results which has been done in the laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university first the static state naca0012 airfoil was analyzed in reynolds number of 23000 aerodynamically then the output experimental results would be compared with the results of the xfoil software and the results of kijma et al kojima et al 2013 and cfd results see fig 18 this shows the validity of the obtained experimental results in order to verify the results of the dynamic state experimental system the experimental study of kim et al kim and chang 2014 in 2014 was used this research was done on a naca0012 airfoil in a dynamic state regarding the conditions of the mentioned research the results are obtained in r e 2 3 10 4 and airfoil oscillates as below equation 6 α t 0 6 s i n ω t in this equation reduced frequency is defined as k 0 1 in order to equalize the results the airfoil gets mean aoa 0 and the amplitude is set to 6 to create a reduced frequency of 0 1 the system frequency requires to be adjusted on 1 27hz or 76 rpm in addition to equalize the reynolds number regarding the ambient conditions and chord length the velocity of the wind tunnel is set on 4 m s in order to assess the results equality in various periods of the pitching airfoil the values of lift and drag forces and instantaneous aoa according to period are plotted in fig 19 as it can be observed the force values in various periods are almost the same furthermore the aerodynamic force hysteresis compared to instantaneous aoa and time in one period is plotted in fig 20 fig 21 a and b shows the result comparison of the above study and obtained results of laboratory of aerodynamics in the hakim sabzevari university which shows the validity of the results see fig 22 the results show that the percentage of error is less than 5 in the angles close to zero angle and the value of error increases to 10 with going far from the zero angle 4 results and discussion the most important aerodynamic forces applying on the wind turbine s blades are lift and drag forces it is convenient for the wind turbine to create conditions where the lift coefficient increases while the drag coefficient remains small this will generate more energy from the wind while less power will be applied to the wind turbine structure resulting in lower wind turbine construction costs and longer lifespan these forces were measured using the balancing devices in the wind tunnel test the effects of the mean aoa reduced frequency reynolds number and amplitude for both sd7062 and 7062 a were studied the hysteresis chart of the aerodynamic coefficients was plotted for all cases the step by step flow chart is as follows 4 1 the effect of mean angle of attack α 0 in a pitching airfoil mean angle of attack α 0 is considered as one of the effective aerodynamic parameters because with an increase in the mean aoa in a constant amplitude reduced frequency and reynolds number leads to separation and stall as a consequence for this section the amplitude of 10 and a reduced frequency of 0 02 37 rpm and 0 62hz and reynolds number of 100000 15 m s were selected and maintained constant during the experiment in order to check the mean aoa effect it was set to 0 5 and 10 fig 23 shows the deviation curve of lift and drag coefficients according to the aoa α t based on fig 23 a with growing the mean aoa the maximum lift coefficient is also growing accordingly according to fig 23 b with an increase in the mean aoa the maximum drag coefficient is gradually increased whereas the minimum drag coefficient has not been changed significantly in a low mean aoa separation does not occur obviously therefore the effects of rotation lead to retain the lift hysteresis chart in a counter clockwise state in this case with increasing the amplitude the airfoil within the light stall confronts with an upstroke motion at the end of its movement in the zone near the stall the delay in phase and pushing it forward in an upstroke motion lead to form shapes in lift hysteresis curves the stall onset point detection process according to the reference mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 is the crossover point in the hysteresis chart of the lift as stall onset point is shown in fig 23 in every amplitude the dynamic stall would occur with increasing the mean aoa in conclusion the slope of the curve reduces with going to the stall zone furthermore in higher amplitudes a deeper stall will occur also the crossover point moves back which shows a deeper dynamic stall and a delay in the flow reattachment through downstroke motion according to fig 5 and references mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 it could be said that generally the separation bubble gets bigger in higher aoa airfoils and the deviations of lift coefficient in upstroke and downstroke motion grows higher which indicates a deeper stall as fig 23 a shows the lift force experiences a linear increase when the airfoil moves upstroke which is due to pressure difference increase in two sides of the airfoil resulted by leading edge vortex formation on the airfoil s upper surface this increase continues until the leading edge vortex surrounds the whole airfoil s upper surface at that moment the aerodynamic forces reach their maximum values and a dynamic stall occurs gharali et al 2018 see fig 24 afterward the leading edge vortexes start to shedding and the trailing edge vortexes are formed and lead to a loss in lift force the leading edge vortexes are also formed in a downstroke motion and lead to an increase in lift force but its power is not as same as in the upstroke motion karbasian et al 2014 as can be seen in fig 20 with growing the mean aoa from 0 to 5 the maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient will increase to 15 and 50 respectively with growing the mean aoa 5 10 the maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient will increase to 6 and 45 respectively 4 2 the effect of reduced frequency k the reduced frequency could be considered as the most important parameter in pitching airfoil therefore in this section of the experiment three different reduced frequencies with constant mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number on the hysteresis of aerodynamic coefficients were assessed for the pitching airfoils fig 25 shows the hysteresis chart of lift and drag coefficients in various reduced frequencies in this analysis the mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number have been considered as 0 10 and 105 free stream velocity of 15 m s respectively the analyzed frequencies consist of 0 02 37 rpm and 0 62hz 0 1 240 rpm and 4hz and 0 2 354 rpm and 5 9hz the selected frequencies are due to the fact that the wind turbine is under construction the other research also focused have selected the same reduced frequency for their airfoils gharali et al 2018 gharali and johnson 2013 the airfoil s motion is near the stall condition in this experiment regarding the references mccroskey et al 1981 mccroskey 1981 with a crossover point in the lift hysteresis curve the light stall starts and when there is a deviation between the lift force in upstroke and downstroke motions the airfoil becomes closer to deep stall condition as it can be observed with an increase in the reduced frequency the maximum lift coefficient increases slightly and the chart would be wider with lower slopes the reason for the reduction of the slope is the flow resistance against the vortex shedding which leads to a delay in the dynamic stall furthermore the crossover point which creates shape zone moves forward with growing the reduced frequency this indicates a sooner reattachment of the flow in a downstroke motion at this point the value of lift in downstroke motion exceeds its corresponding value in upstroke motion which might be due to flow reattachment to the upper surface in the downstroke motion or existence of the past vortexes formed in high aoa fig 25 b shows the drag coefficient according to aoa as it can be observed with growing the reduced frequency the maximum drag coefficient increases and the hysteresis loop width would be developed the effects of the reduced frequency during the downstroke motion are higher than the upstroke motion according to fig 25 with an increase in reduced frequency from 0 02 to 0 1 the maximum lift and drag coefficients would increase 15 and 9 respectively on the other hand with an increase in reduced frequency from 0 1 to 0 2 the maximum lift and drag coefficients would increase 2 and 4 respectively the increase in the reduced frequency leads to a delay in the leading edge vortex formation during the upstroke but earlier leading edge vortex formation during the downstroke motion gharali et al 2018 while the pitching airfoil moves the leading edge could be considered as a rotary cylinder which is called the leading edge jet effect fig 26 ericsson and reding 1984 furthermore in an upstroke motion excessive momentum would be transferred to the airfoil s upper surface fig 27 tseng and cheng 2015 the excessive momentum prevents the inverse pressure gradient and leads to more boundary layer resistance created on the airfoil s surface against the separation as a result the boundary layer separation would be delayed which leads to an increase in the maximum lift coefficient and its corresponding aoa the deviations in the maximum lift coefficient and the corresponding aoa in terms of dynamics and statics would be significant with regard to reduced frequency increase choudhry et al 2014 4 3 the effect of reynolds number one of the effective aerodynamic parameters is the reynolds number the airfoil chord depends on the geometry of the airfoil so it only changes with dimensionality for a given airfoil with specific dimensions the cord is always fixed but in the wind turbine blades it varies from root to tip see fig 28 as a result it is necessary to examine the effect of the cord the effect of the cord is effective on the reynolds number which means that with the change of the cord the reynolds number increases as we know the reynolds number depends on the cord density velocity and viscosity of the three parameters for a blade from root to tip only the cord changes so for a wind turbine blade the cord effect is the only factor affecting the reynolds number therefore in this paper we investigate the effects of reynolds number which is effective on cord number variation other articles have examined this effect for example references koca et al 2018 oukassou et al 2019 olson et al 2013 li et al 2019 can be named therefore in this section this parameter is assessed when others are constant the effect of reynolds number on the lift and drag coefficient in reynolds numbers of 50000 7 5 m s 100000 15 m s and 150000 22 5 m s has been investigated this assessment is carried out for a reduced frequency of 0 2 5 9hz and 354 rpm the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 which is shown in fig 29 when reynolds number increases the maximum lift coefficient increases and the momentum also increase with the reynolds number increase as a result the flow resistance against the separation increases and the lift coefficient grows higher an increase in the maximum lift coefficient occurs with a shape phenomenon after passing over the crossover point in an upstroke motion the lift coefficient becomes higher compared to its value in a downstroke motion with the reynolds number reduction the maximum lift coefficient reduces slightly and the shape phenomenon would be eliminated furthermore it is observed that the lift coefficients in upstroke and downstroke motions would become close to each other which might be due to the increase of flow power in higher reynolds and a decrease in the reduced frequency effect fig 29 b shows the drag coefficient according to the aoa for various reynolds numbers as it shows the minimum drag coefficient reduces with the reynolds number increase and it can be said that the drag coefficient reduces significantly with the reynolds number increase the reynolds number increase has positive effects for both aerodynamic forces it increases the lift and reduces the drag which indicates the momentum effect on the separation an increase in the reynolds number leads to an increase in the momentum and the separation effect on the aerodynamic forces as fig 29 shows with an increase in the reynolds number from 50000 to 100000 the maximum lift coefficient increases 19 and the maximum drag coefficient decreases 2 in addition with an increase in the reynolds number from 100000 to 150000 the maximum lift coefficient increase 8 and the maximum drag coefficient reduces 45 4 4 the effect of amplitude d in this section the effects of amplitude for constant mean aoa reduced frequency and reynolds number has been carried out therefore the experiment is done in reynolds number of 100000 15 m s mean aoa α 0 of 0 and the reduced frequency k of 0 1 4hz 240 rpm for amplitudes of 8 10 and 12 as it is observed the increase of amplitude increases the flow unsteadiness and widens the hysteresis chart in fact the increase of the amplitude leads to an increase in the difference between the aerodynamic coefficients in upstroke and downstroke motions which is considered a type of unsteadiness it is shown that while the amplitude is increasing some small deviations occur in the lift curve which is due to the stability of the reduced frequency this is because of the fact that the increase of the reduced frequency leads to a delay in the lift increase and reduction of the lift slope the maximum lift coefficient for higher amplitude moves forward the value of the maximum lift slightly increases with an increase in the amplitude which is due to a delay in the separation and the movement of the dynamic separated vortexes in higher amplitude thanks to the high reduced frequency when the mean aoa is small the airfoil oscillates out of the dynamic stall range therefore the effects of the oscillation lead to a delay in the flow according to the airfoil motion and as a result the counterclockwise zone dominates in the hysteresis loop in the larger amplitude for the same aoa the airfoil creates more lift in its upstroke motion in comparison with the downstroke motion the loops existence is a result of the induced velocities which leads to a difference between the lift coefficient in upstroke and downstroke motions despite the effect of the amplitude on the maximum lift coefficient and the width of the hysteresis loop and amplifying the vortex structure it has not a noticeable effect on the lift curve slope the curve of the drag coefficient according to the aoa is presented in fig 30 b similar to the lift coefficient the maximum value of the drag coefficient in higher amplitude increases furthermore the minimum drag coefficient remains almost constant and does not change noticeably in the aoa of 0 the drag coefficient is almost ineffective by the amplitude as fig 30 shows while the amplitude is growing from 8 to 10 the maximum lift and drag coefficients increase 14 and 80 respectively with an increase in the amplitudes from 10 to 12 the maximum lift and drag coefficients increase 14 and 60 respectively with increasing the amplitudes the distance between the upstroke and downstroke motions increases which indicates approaching the stall condition 4 5 the corrected airfoil aerodynamic analysis the authors have carried out a thermodynamic analysis on the practical airfoils in the wind turbine in their previous research the relationship between the second law efficiency which is directly related to entropy with the aerodynamic coefficients has been thoroughly investigated in the papers of the authors of this paper mamouri et al 2019a 2019b afterward they tried to generate a new geometry based on the minimum entropy generation therefore with the intended circumstances they tried to obtain the optimized airfoil using the entropy reduction so they corrected the geometry of sd7062 airfoil and designed the optimized airfoil in order to entropy assessment the total entropy for both obtained airfoils is divided on the main airfoil s entropy which is presented in fig 31 this figure shows the entropy reduction in the optimized airfoil in order to compute the entropy the presented relation in the reference nazeryan and lakzian 2018 is used 7 s μ t 0 ϕ fig 32 develops an aerodynamic assessment on the corrected airfoils compared to the sd7062 airfoil in this case the reduced frequency is 0 1 4hz 240 rpm reynolds is 100000 15 m s the amplitude is 10 and the mean aoa is considered 0 as it shows the maximum lift coefficient in the corrected airfoil has become a bit more it has increased about 6 5 in an upstroke motion the main and corrected airfoil have almost the same lift coefficient and in a downstroke motion the corrected airfoil has dropped less this might be due to the correction in the lower surface of the airfoil it can also be observed that in the shape phenomenon the crossover point has moved forward slightly which indicates that the flow reattachment to the airfoil occurs in downstroke motion the maximum drag coefficient of the corrected airfoil is slightly less than the maximum drag coefficient of the main airfoil and also in the downstroke motion the drag coefficient of the corrected airfoil is less than the drag coefficient of the main airfoil which shows the improvement in the downstroke motion it should be explained that based on li et al research li and figliola 2004 and monsch et al 2007 and also ghisu et al 2018 there is a direct relation between the entropy generation and drag coefficient as it is observed in this section the entropy generation has an important effect on the drag coefficient the drag coefficient plays an important role in the structure design on the wind turbine the safe performance of the wind turbine requires paying attention to the drag coefficient and safety factor related to it zhou et al 2013 according to fig 32 with airfoil correction the maximum lift coefficient has increased 6 5 and the corresponding drag coefficient has decreased 40 as it is observed in the main airfoil the distance between the lift in upstroke and downstroke motion is more than the optimized airfoil which shows keeping away from the stall in the optimized airfoil 5 conclusion in this research an experimental study was carried out on the effects of the reduced frequency mean aoa amplitude and reynolds number on the hysteresis of the pitching lift and drag coefficients for a wind turbine the curves comparison showed that the mentioned parameters effect on the slope and width of the hysteresis curves and the crossover point location and the direction of rotation 1 with an increase in the mean aoa in the amplitude of 10 reduced frequency of 0 02 and reynolds number of 100000 stall drags into deep stall point and the crossover point moves backward and the maximum lift coefficient increases too because the more the airfoil reaches to deep stall point the more it reaches the maximum lift too furthermore the maximum drag coefficient grows sharply with an increase in the mean aoa 2 an increase in the reduced frequency in the mean aoa of 0 and amplitude of 10 and reynolds number of 100000 leads to an increase in the maximum lift coefficient and the crossover point moves forward which indicates a stall delay the effect of the reduced frequency on the drag coefficient is less and in the downstroke motion increases the drag coefficient slightly 3 with an increase in the reynolds number in reduced frequency of 0 2 the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 the maximum lift coefficient increases and the crossover point moves forward which shows a delay in the stall in addition the minimum drag coefficient reduces with the reynolds increase 4 with an increase in the amplitude reynolds of 100000 mean aoa of 0 and reduced frequency of 0 1 the amount of maximum lift increases slightly and the crossover point moves backward which indicates that stall has come forward despite the earlier stall because a deep stall has not occurred with an increase in the amplitude the airfoil stays longer in the light stall therefore with an increase in the amplitude a higher lift is expected which continues until the deep stall occurs then a sudden lift reduction occurs moreover the maximum drag coefficient increase with an increase in the amplitude 5 the corrected airfoil based on the aerodynamic results has been assessed according to aerodynamic analysis the results show that for the reduced frequency of 0 1 reynolds number of 100000 the amplitude of 10 and mean aoa of 0 the lift coefficient improved slightly especially in the downstroke motion on the other hand the drag coefficient has reduced significantly which shows the effect of entropy generation on the drag coefficient according to the mentioned cases it is suggested that regarding of the wind speed rotation frequency and also the geometrical parameters attributed to wind turbines blades the designers and production engineers of the wind turbines check out the lift and drag vs instantaneous aoa curves afterward the appropriate airfoil should be selected based on the dynamic conditions to obtain a

22084,ocean environmental corrosion and mechanical load vibration introduce considerable negative effects caused by the fluid structure environment interaction a new design scheme for a blade with salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance is proposed based on numerical simulation and fatigue tests the one way fluid structure interaction fsi model for an ocean current turbine blade was established and calculated by a computational fluid dynamics cfd solver and finite element method fem solver according to the fsi results the maximum equivalent stress and deformation in extreme operating conditions are found to be within material and structural limits on this basis an aluminum alloy nano particles reinforced polypropylene multilayer composite blade was designed and fatigue tested the results show that an obvious crack resistance effect exists within a certain stress range and there is basically no change in the fatigue crack growth rates of nprp in the four environmental fatigue tests the multilayer composite blades with immersion pretreatment can stand 1 107 cycles of fatigue tensile loads and torque loads without failure the results provide specific theoretical guidance for the optimization of the structural design of ocean current turbine blade in ocean environment keywords ocean current turbine multi layer composite blade fluid structure interaction fatigue experimental test crack resistance effect 1 introduction oceans cover more than 71 of earth s surface and offer significant resources for the production of potential electricity ocean energy resources such as tidal and wave energy are clean and environmentally friendly as an alternative source of renewable energy the use of ocean energy for power generation has large economic benefits and major development prospects e g bahaj et al 2007a b batten et al 2007 researchers around the world have taken many efforts to develop advanced ocean power systems li et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b and ocean current turbine is one way to extract the power from the ocean it is known that the turbine blade as one of the most critical components which determine the hydrodynamic performance of a turbine system ghorashi and moetakef imani 2016 wang et al 2019a b therefore the performance life span and some potential influence factors on turbine blade have attracted much attention of researchers during the operation of ocean current turbines the blades are becoming more susceptible to hydrodynamic issues caused by fsi fluid structure interaction these hydrodynamic issues originate from a variety of sources such as hydrodynamic loads from water streams current speed variational fatigue loads intermittent loads with the effect of rotations gravity like centrifugal and coriolis forces nijssen 2006 and the vibrational natural frequencies induced in an ocean current turbine blade kumar et al 2018 specifically the hydrodynamic issues on the blade may cause blade mechanical load vibration this vibration can in turn lead to additional variation in the flow field resulting in further load alteration after a long period of operation the interaction of fluid and structure may lead to fatigue problems and there could be a possible progressive crack on the turbine blade which could result in a macro fatigue of blade well before that of the yield strength and eventually lead to failure meanwhile a failure of one blade can lead to the total destruction of an ocean current turbine system and widespread damage to the turbine surroundings therefore fsi evaluation on turbine blade is a critical issue in need of concentration fsi modeling requires both hydrodynamic and structural components to establish both hydrodynamic loads and the corresponding structural responses for the hydrodynamic component of fsi modeling the bem blade element momentum model glauert 1935 and cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling tu et al 2018 are common used and for the structural component of fsi modeling beam models and fea finite element analysis models are the two most common approaches e g hansen et al 2006 zhang and huang 2011 currently there are many relevant numerical studies have been carried out on investigating hydrodynamic and structural responses behavior of blades lee et al 2014 used a boundary element method finite element method bem fem fluid structure interaction fsi tool to study the hydrodynamic damping effects of added mass due to fluid around the propeller blade the results show the tool can evaluate blade strength and also enable to do risk assessment by estimating the change in performance and the deformation depending on blade position in the ship s wake wang et al 2016 used a one way coupling fsi model to study the hydrodynamic loads of a 1 5 mw wind turbine blade and the maximum tensile compressive stresses and tip deflections in each case were found to be within the material and structural limits li et al 2014 developed a methodology based on bem fem to study a hydro turbine blade with reliability based fatigue life yin et al 2017 investigated the fluid structure responses of three metal materials blades in a high pressure booster pump application showing that the natural frequencies were different and the maximum equivalent stresses were observed at the root junction jo et al 2013 used a fsi tool to analyze a tidal current turbine and the calculation results were conducted to determine the deformation distribution along the pile tower rafiee et al 2016 investigated the aeroelastic behavior of a full scale composite wind turbine blade based on a bem cfd tool and fsi tool showing the influence of deformation on power performance is determined implying on a reduction in output power in order to verify the effectiveness of model some researchers carried out an experimental work related the hydrodynamic and structural model for example calì et al 2018 offered a methodology that enhances the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fiber orientation on sail performance based on an integrated cfd csm computational structural mechanics analysis and digital photogrammetry 3d reconstruction experiment showing this methodology can contribute to narrowing the gap between hydrodynamic simulation and real life behavior of sails turnbull and omenzetter 2017 used a fuzzy finite element model updating ffemu techniques for damage severity assessment of a turbine blade showing ffemu was able to obtain a prediction of baseline material properties of the blade whilst also successfully predicting with sufficient accuracy a larger magnitude of structural alteration and its location macphee and beyene 2015 experimental tested wind turbine performance in a wind tunnel and analyzed the aero elastic response using a finite volume fluid structure interaction solver showing that the flexible rotor was markedly superior to a geometrically identical rigid one in terms of the size fagan et al 2017 carried out an experimental testing on a glass fibre epoxy composite turbine blade the results of the test were used to calibrate finite element models and a design optimization study was then performed using a genetic algorithm showing such structural modeling in combination with numerical search algorithms provide a powerful tool for designers augier et al 2015 developed an experimental measurement system to extract hydrodynamic loads on the foils and capture their twisting deformation during operation and used a couple fsi tool to predicate the foil hydrodynamic loads the results show an excellent agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured hydrodynamic loads and foil twisting motion however in a real ocean environment the blades are affected not only by fsi but also the environmental factors from an environmental point of view the ocean environment is changeable and complex the ocean current turbine is affected by sea water and sea salt vapor corrosion seawater is a naturally strong conductive electrolyte with a salt content of approximately 3 5 mass fraction this makes seawater highly corrosive to most metal materials such as iron steel and aluminum alloy due to the high levels of chloride that prevent them from passivation the corrosion rate of metals in a saline water environment is high and if the environmental factors and fsi work together fluid structure environment interaction it will greatly shorten the life span of the structure according to some research results the fatigue growth rates of alloys including marine engineering alloys in saline water are obviously higher than those in the air e g li et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 meng et al 2013 dhinakaran and prakash 2014 mehmanparast et al 2017 in order to control the environmental corrosion effect some researchers used composite materials to replace metal blade due to its attractive characteristics such as low density good fatigue resistance wear resistance and corrosion resistance making composite materials a good option for applications in an ocean environment for example boisseau et al 2012 2013 and kennedy et al 2016 conducted fatigue tests on glass fiber reinforced material for marine turbine blade application showing that the influence of testing in different environments was small and such material have good application prospect tual et al 2015 carried out the long term behavior of different carbon epoxy composites using accelerated ageing tests the results show a significant reduction of composite strengths has been observed after saturation of water in the material and no significant changes have been observed for moduli nor for composite toughness davies et al 2013 carried out static and cyclic tests on composite both in air and in sea water the influence of ageing in sea water on fatigue performance is then quantified and much lower fatigue lives are measured after ageing the only drawback is that composite materials have the problem of insufficient stiffness and yet metal materials have high stiffness and strong bearing capacity an idea was developed to combine metal materials and composite materials to meet basic needs and realize each respective function based on the ocean characteristics of metal materials and composite materials manufacturing using a multilayer composite blade design is capable of achieving corrosion resistance and the mechanical fatigue resistance effect and load carrying capacity with lightweight structures it can be concluded that a large number of theoretical numerical and experimental researches have been carried out on the hydrodynamic issues structural responses and fatigue properties and some progress have been achieved however the study of the fluid structure environment interaction of ocean current turbine blades is very limited and there is a lack of effective solutions for prolonging the life span of the blades based on the above researches the purpose of this paper is to propose a multilayer composite blade design scheme for ocean current energy applications in the present work a fsi model for an ocean current turbine blade was established and the results were used for evaluation the fatigue crack growth rate measurements for nano particles reinforced polypropylene nprp in four environments were performed using mts fatigue testing techniques and the fatigue data obtained were evaluated fractographical investigations with a scanning electron microscope sem were used to identify the mechanisms of the fatigue effect the multilayer composite blade was tested under fatigue load verification test it is hoped that the study presented in this paper will prove useful for those wishing to enhance the performance of ocean current turbines especially in regards to corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance more specifically the multilayer composite blade design could have a profound impact and help increase the blade life span without significant upfront costs this could be especially useful in regions where tidal current energy resources are abundant but the environment is relatively complex 2 ocean current turbine model the calculation model is a micro horizontal axis diffuser augmented ocean current turbine and the diameter of the rotor is 500 mm the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser is 5 mm such a small tip clearance is conducive to reducing diffuser costs and water flow resistance the 3d geometry model of the ocean current turbine is presented in fig 1 the details of the turbine can be found in song et al 2019a b the blade includes five types of hydrofoils i e dt0814 dt0816 dt0818 dt0820 and dt0820 the main parameters are summarized in table 1 in this paper the incoming velocity was set to 2 m s this value was taken as the research background from the tidal current power generation test field near the zhaitang islands and putuo hulu islands in the east china sea since the maximum ocean current velocity extreme operating conditions there is approximately 2 m s the power coefficients of the turbine versus tsr are shown in fig 2 the c p values that are higher than 0 6 at tsr of 3 50 4 75 showing the turbine is suitable for operating under lower tip speed ratio and reduces chances of cavitation it has to be mentioned here cavitation a complex physical flow process involving multiphase flow turbulence and phase transition is often found in hydro machinery e g carlton 2012 kumar and saini 2010 when cavitation is created and developed to a certain stage collapse and shedding of the cavitation will occur and at the same time a large amount of energy will be released under the long term effect of cavitation a series of problems will occur such as material corrosion structural damage vibration and noise which seriously affect the performance of the ocean current turbine therefore cavitation as the important performance criterion on the turbine blade should be discussed the three dimensional mixture turbulent model was used to simulate the cavitation performance of the ocean current turbine and the other boundary conditions set ups were the same as the follow up section the basic phase is liquid seawater and the secondary phase is water vapor assuming that the phases are adiabatic and there are no slips only mass transfer occurs the saturated vapor pressure of seawater at room temperature 300 k is 3540 pa the density is 1025 kg m3 and the density of water vapor is 0 02558 kg m3 the water vapor volume fraction and pressure distribution on the ocean current turbine were used to plot the cavitation characteristics of the system as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the value of the water vapor volume fraction is zero under this condition indicating there is no cavitation on the turbine system the ocean current turbine blade is unlikely to be corroded and damaged by the cavitation effect therefore we focus on the fsi effect and salinity corrosion effect on turbine blade in follow up section 3 mathematical model and fsi setup 3 1 governing equations and coupling approaches flow is considered to be a viscous three dimensional and unsteady turbulent flow the incompressible three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes questions can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i is the time averaged velocity p is the time average pressure ρ is the fluid density and f i is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress value and the two equation shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is used to model the reynolds stress menter 1994 bardina et al 1997 the reynolds number re ρvr μ 5 0 105 is based on the dynamic viscosity μ the inlet current velocity v 2 m s and the radius r of the rotor the dynamic equation of the structure wu et al 2013 is defined as 3 m s q t c s q t k s q t q s where q t is a nodal acceleration vector q t is a nodal velocity vector q t is a nodal displacement vector m s is the structural mass matrix c s is the structural damping matrix k s is the structural stiffness matrix and q s is the applied load vector including the hydrodynamical force 3 2 computational setup according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the cylinder is used as the fluid calculation domain the diameter of the calculation domain is 6d d is diameter of turbine the distance between the center point of the turbine and the inlet is 3d and the distance between the center point and the outlet is 6d the fluid computations were performed using ansys fluent software the mrf model frank 2015 is used for numerical calculations and the computational domain is divided into a rotatory zone and a stationary zone the rotatory zone was set as a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as the velocity inlet a free outflow and a free slip wall condition for the stationary outer domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a nonslip wall the duct surface was also set as a nonslip wall the fluid calculation domain is shown in fig 4 near the rotor and diffuser surface the grid is denser and the surface is configured to have a prism layer including 10 inflation layers and a y 1 for the rotor s surfaces the diffuser surface is also inflated but with 5 inflation layers and a y 10 leading to 8 million elements for the diffuser augmented turbine the hydrodynamic performance experiment and relevant cfd numerical results of the ocean current turbine have been provided in the previous publication song et al 2019a b shown in fig 5 the average deviation measured at five current velocities is 5 8 and the maximum deviation is 8 0 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method the blade structure was meshed using unstructured mesh element refinement and self adaptation were carried out in the parts with larger curvature to determine the appropriate solid mesh size and number a mesh independence assessment was carried out the assessment considered the hydrodynamic loads assuming a centrifugal force equivalent to that experienced by a rotor rotating at 288 rpm along with the gravity loads in the normal direction of incoming current velocity these conditions closely mimic the previous hydrodynamic performance experimental test conditions at 2 m s current velocity additionally a fixed boundary condition was applied to the rotor hub and the material used was aluminum alloy taking only the rotor into consideration and ensuring a higher density on the blade the maximal equivalent stress on the blade was recorded with varying mesh numbers until very little relative change was found shown in table 2 the final mesh of the blade as seen in fig 6 contains 0 4 m elements the coupling method of fsi modeling is based on one way coupling by ansys workbench and the fluid domain calculation uses cfd until the convergence criteria are reached the hydrodynamic pressures on the blade obtained from cfd are mapped to the fea as load boundary conditions and the structural responses of the blade subjected to hydrodynamic load can be calculated such as blade deformations and stress distributions 3 3 analysis of fsi results in the modal analysis the frequency response characteristics of the turbine blade models were discussed the first to the sixth order modal for the turbine blade under rotating prestress gravity and fluid structure coupling effects are shown in fig 7 the first to the sixth order vibration modes are similar with vibration related frequency increases and gradual deformation increases the maximum deformation can be found in the tip which is called the swing deformation the frequencies of the first three orders are close in value as are the last three orders thus the impact of fsi on the vibration characteristics is small for low order modes but a significant difference between the frequencies of the third and fourth modal can been seen the modal frequencies are much higher at 239 18 561 4 hz than the working frequency of the ocean current turbine at 2 m s approximately 4 8 hz the difference is based on the fact that a safer system is unlikely to have resonant vibrations in the system in the static analysis the maximum equivalent stress created on the root regions and the maximum deformation that occurred in the blade tip are shown in fig 8 a and b the fatigue risk location can be initially determined by finding the maximum stress concentration area on the blade the peak stress in the stress concentration area is also used to predict the service life of a blade in this study the max equivalent stress on the blade is 48 3 mpa which is well below the aluminum alloy yield strength of 265 mpa the maximum deformation of the blade tip is 1 7 mm which is much lower than the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser 5 mm indicating that the blade is unlikely to strike on the diffuser or other parts under the given conditions and the hydrodynamic performance is basically unaffected fig 9 shows the max equivalent stress versus time on the blade under unsteady behaviors of the hydrodynamics of the ocean current turbine the stress values do not change significantly with time indicating that the operation stability is good under this condition safety factors are important factors to be considered in the design performance fatigue life and efficiency of ocean current turbine blades fig 8 d shows the safety factor distribution on the blade the critical safety factor is 1 7 indicating that the blade can withstand 1 109 cycles with a low probability of failures under the given conditions however the actual life of the blade in a sea environment will be far less than the numerical simulation value due to the environmental corrosion since for ocean current turbines salinity corrosion is the main inducement 4 fatigue experiment to find suitable materials to meet the demand the properties of several materials were studied the nano particles reinforced polypropylene nprp was selected as the layer material and the aluminum alloy was selected as the main metal material due to its good processing ability and lightweight structure in this paper the design scheme of main part plus two layers were used as follows the main part aluminum alloy load carrying structure the first layer curing agent bonding layer bonding aluminum alloy and nprp thickness is approximately 100 μm curing agent bonding layer of epoxy resin cementing was used due to its special performance of pollution free convenient storage and transportation fast solidification and good adhesion as for fiber metal plastic and non metallic materials the epoxy resin cementing all has good adhesive properties for those materials e g sahafi et al 2003 takai and takaya 2008 anagnostopoulos et al 2016 the second layer nprp layer salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance thickness is 1 2 mm the schematic of the layers on the blade is shown in fig 10 the base mechanical properties of two main materials are in table 3 in the following sections the fatigue performance of nprp and the multilayer blade were analyzed by experimental tests and numerical simulation 4 1 nprp immersed fatigue performance test and crack resistance effect mts and the test specimen are shown in fig 11 the test specimen is depicted with specific dimensions based on the reference of international standards iso12108 2012 the nprp material was processed into standard three point single edge notch bend se b model i loading specimens as shown in fig 12 the total length of the specimen is 210 mm the distance of the two supporting bases is 180 mm the thickness b is 20 mm and the height w is 50 mm the mechanical prefabricated incision width is 2 mm and the height is 5 mm on this basis a 1 mm sharp initial crack on the incision was cut with a razor blade by broaching during the test the crack growth was along the middle section of the specimen the stress intensity factors range values δk were calculated according to eq 4 4 δ k δ p b w 1 2 6 α 1 2 1 2 α 1 α 3 2 1 99 α 1 α 2 15 3 93 α 2 7 α 2 where δp p max p min b represents the specimen thickness w represents the specimen width a is the crack length α a w all tests were performed using an electrodynamic fatigue testing machine type mts 809 mts usa the prepared specimens were immersed in three specific nacl saline water environments 0 3 5 5 for 60 days then sealed with waterproof tape the corresponding saline water was added to the tape to ensure that the crack tip in the fatigue test was always immersed the number of cycles per 0 5 mm of specimen crack growth in the four environments air water 3 5 saline water 5 saline water was recorded by a crack length measurement device with a light source all specimens were loaded with a sinusoidal force profile with a frequency of 6 hz and an r ratio ratio between the minimum to maximum applied force of 0 1 and the results were plotted in terms of da dn vs δk the results were obtained through fatigue tests with an initial stress of p max 3600 n and an initial length of 6 mm where the tip equivalent stress is 69 7 mpa which is much higher than the blade equivalent stress of 48 3 mpa as shown in fig 8 b the specimens fatigue cracks in the four environments were not observed during the tests instead 69 7 mpa was defined as the lower limit of the crack resistance effect which means no fatigue cracks appeared when the equivalent stress was lower than this value for the initial stress p max 4600 n and the initial length of 6 mm where the tip equivalent stress is 89 1 mpa as shown in fig 13 b there was an obvious crack resistance effect where the fatigue cracks were approximately less than 2 mm in the four environments so 89 1 mpa was defined as the upper limit of the crack resistance effect which means the fatigue crack could not continue to grow when the equivalent stress was between 69 7 mpa and 89 1 mpa the above test results were verified by 1 107 cycles showing the four environments did not affect the crack resistance effect of nprp the test fractographical nprp specimen 5 saline water immersed is shown in fig 14 the details of sem fractographical information are shown in fig 15 the fatigue area of crack growth can be divided into three stages the initial stage δk ranges from 2 9 to 3 6 mpa m1 2 the crack resistance effect occurred at this stage stable linear stage δk ranges from 3 6 to 5 5 mpa m1 2 and rapid instability stage δk ranges from 5 5 to 7 6 mpa m1 2 point a is in the initial stage with crack growth about 1 mm corresponding δk is 2 9 sem fractographical information displays that there are some wrinkles and bulges in these areas and the nano particles with small bright spots can be seen at the same time these small particles are distributed in the polypropylene matrix playing an important role in the crack resistance effect the nano particles are uniformly dispersed in the matrix of the polypropylene and there is no agglomeration among the particles which can achieve a degree of nano dispersion when the nprp is subjected to external loads the stress concentration will occur around the nano particles and make the surrounding matrix agglomerated thus inhibiting the sliding of the molecular clusters on the other hand due to the large specific surface area and the high specific surface energy of the nano particles both matrix protrusions and wrinkles will appear to further absorb the excess energy therefore in the initial stage the fatigue resistance performance of nprp is enhanced and the crack resistance effect occurs point b is in the stable linear stage with crack growth about 6 mm corresponding δk is 3 6 point c is in the stable linear stage with crack growth about 13 mm corresponding δk is 4 3 the fractographical information displays these surface wrinkles and bulges become larger compared to point a point d is in the rapid instability stage with crack growth about 18 mm corresponding δk is 5 8 the fractographical information displays this area has a large range of circular layered bumps and potholes with some micro matrixes detached and some wrinkles slip paged point e is in the brittle fracture area about 30 mm away from the mechanical incision it can be seen that the surface is much smoother than the fatigue area and there are only a few small range of bumps on the surface the fatigue crack growth curves of nprp in the four environments are shown in fig 16 it is observed that the crack growth rates in the four environments are basically not changed however chloride has little effect on the crack growth rate of nprp the fitted data at the stable linear stage show that the growth rate slightly increases with the increase in the chlorine concentration the slope of the fitted line slightly increases with the increase in δk values in fig 14 b e g song et al 2019 song et al 2015 such effects of chlorine on fatigue crack growth rates can be explained by enhanced fatigue crack tip aging e g cosgriff et al 2017 fischer et al 2016 which is the degradation of the polypropylene matrix molecular mass and the resulting change in the molecular mass distribution in the region near the fatigue crack tip first any liquid solution leads to a certain amount of additive and micro matrix leaching and the polymer network structure in regions near the fatigue crack tip is significantly reduced second the chlorine in the saline water induces chemical aging at the fatigue crack tip region leading to accelerating fatigue crack growth rates it is worth mentioning that compared with air and water environments at higher δk values enough time is available for the chlorine in the saline water to induce local crack tip aging leading to acceleration of the fatigue crack growth rates vs lower δk values simultaneously at lower δk values and crack growth rates the exposure time of the crack tip region to the surrounding environment is not enough resulting in little differences in crack growth rates between the four environments however chlorine seems to act as a degrading aging medium only when breaking through the crack resistance effect tip at a certain external load range indicating that such an effect was not affected by chlorine chemical aging in summary there is basically no change in the fatigue crack growth rates of nprp in the four environments in particular nprp is not sensitive to the presence of chloride which proves that nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance 4 2 multilayer blade fatigue endurance test the damage and fracture of the blades are mainly concentrated in the vulnerable regions of the blades according to the references damage occurs mainly in the radial range of approximately 26 54 of the blade e g ataya and ahmed 2013 jensen et al 2006 yang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 and the fsi results in fig 8 b thus the test blades are half blades near the root and the length is 112 5 mm as shown in fig 17 the test blades were immersed in 5 nacl saline water for 60 days as pretreatment the fatigue tests were also loaded with a sinusoidal force profile with a frequency of 6 hz and an r ratio of 0 1 the total loads on the blade in the radial direction can be approximately evaluated by 5 f f a f c f a m b l a d e r c 2 π n 60 2 where f c is the centrifugal force m blade 0 157 kg the distance between the gravity center and the rotation center r c 98 16 mm n 288 rpm and f a is the hydrodynamic force calculated by cfd the torque values were also calculated by cfd the torque was amplified and loaded 5 times and then loaded onto the blade the test blades were loaded for 1 0 107 cycles under the tensile load of 100 n and the torque load of 5 15 n m where no failure occurred the observation of the whole blade surface showed no surface cracking and no layers peeling off simultaneously the results of the fem analysis with the same boundary condition are shown in fig 18 the maximum equivalent stress and the maximum deformation are also found to be within material and structural limits the bonded contact type was used for simulating the function of the curing agent bonding layer between the aluminum alloy and nprp it is worth mentioning that the stronger stiffness material will mainly bear external loads when the two materials have different stiffnesses within a certain range as seen in fig 18 b and c the stress mainly acts on the aluminum alloy and the stress acting on nprp is much smaller than that on the aluminum alloy 5 discussion the reduction of the sharp edges selection of suitable materials and increase of the structural members are important measures for prolonging the life span in small and micro axis ocean current turbines the fsi results clearly show the vulnerable regions in the blade especially the regions near the root so engineers must concentrate on reinforcement of the blades and the optimization of how they work there is good bonding performance between the aluminum alloy and nprp which can be loaded and deformed as one in addition the max shear stress 9 1 mpa was created in a very small area near the root while most of the blade surface had stresses of approximately 2 4 mpa as shown in fig 8 c the shear strength of the epoxy resin cementing is above 18 mpa so it is unlikely that peeling off will occur the linear expansion coefficients of aluminum alloy and nprp are close aluminum alloy is approximately 23 8 10 6 c 1 and nprp is approximately 44 5 10 6 c 1 the temperature in the target sea area has changed within a small range year round so the bonding effect is unlikely to be damaged by temperature changes aluminum alloy has a high stiffness and load carrying capacity and nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance therefore wrapping the outside of the aluminum alloy with nprp can protect the aluminum alloy by combining the two materials the aluminum alloy and nprp can both be fully utilized so that the two materials can do their best to realize each respective function and form structural members with good performance nprp is an optional material that is not only suitable for small and micro axis ocean current turbine blade layers but also can be applied as a noncore structural component in turbine systems such as a floater further adjustments can be made according to the characteristics of the sea area for example the acrylic acid epoxy resin can be applied as the third layer for some areas where the environment is worse which can further strengthen the corrosion resistance of the blades 6 conclusions this paper presents the design and investigation of an ocean current turbine blade with salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance based on a fsi simulation established by one way coupling of cfd and fea and fatigue experimental tests the following conclusions can be drawn the fsi results show that the first to the sixth order modal frequencies for the blade are much higher at 239 18 561 4 hz than the working frequency of the ocean current turbine at 2 m s and the maximum equivalent stress and deformation is found to be within material and structural limits the critical safety factor of the blade is 1 7 indicating that the blade can withstand 1 109 cycles with a low probability of failures under the given conditions without environmental effect nprp has an obvious crack resistance effect during the test no fatigue cracks were observed when the equivalent tip stress was lower than 69 7 mpa and the fatigue cracks did not continue to grow when the equivalent tip stress was between 69 7 mpa and 89 1 mpa in the four environments furthermore the wide range of crack growth rates and δk values for nprp in the four environments are reported here the slight detrimental effect of the presence of chlorine on fatigue crack growth rates was explained by enhanced local crack tip aging which is the degradation of the polypropylene matrix molecular mass and the resulting change in molecular mass distribution in the region near the fatigue crack tip nprp is not sensitive to the presence of chloride which proves that nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance the multilayer composite test blades with immersion pretreatment can stand 1 107 cycles under a tensile load of 100 n and a torque load of 5 15 n m where no failure occurred the observation of the whole blade surface showed no surface cracking and no layers peeling off meanwhile relevant numerical simulation showed that the stress mainly acted on the aluminum alloy and the stress acting on nprp was much smaller than that on aluminum alloy while testing in the four environments did not result in significant differences the details of the material development are critical if these materials or similar ones can be applied in a wider range this emphasizes the importance of working closely with material suppliers matrix manufacturers and resin formulators the test procedure presented here using cyclic tests after immersion pretreatment allows the materials to be evaluated for

22084,ocean environmental corrosion and mechanical load vibration introduce considerable negative effects caused by the fluid structure environment interaction a new design scheme for a blade with salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance is proposed based on numerical simulation and fatigue tests the one way fluid structure interaction fsi model for an ocean current turbine blade was established and calculated by a computational fluid dynamics cfd solver and finite element method fem solver according to the fsi results the maximum equivalent stress and deformation in extreme operating conditions are found to be within material and structural limits on this basis an aluminum alloy nano particles reinforced polypropylene multilayer composite blade was designed and fatigue tested the results show that an obvious crack resistance effect exists within a certain stress range and there is basically no change in the fatigue crack growth rates of nprp in the four environmental fatigue tests the multilayer composite blades with immersion pretreatment can stand 1 107 cycles of fatigue tensile loads and torque loads without failure the results provide specific theoretical guidance for the optimization of the structural design of ocean current turbine blade in ocean environment keywords ocean current turbine multi layer composite blade fluid structure interaction fatigue experimental test crack resistance effect 1 introduction oceans cover more than 71 of earth s surface and offer significant resources for the production of potential electricity ocean energy resources such as tidal and wave energy are clean and environmentally friendly as an alternative source of renewable energy the use of ocean energy for power generation has large economic benefits and major development prospects e g bahaj et al 2007a b batten et al 2007 researchers around the world have taken many efforts to develop advanced ocean power systems li et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b and ocean current turbine is one way to extract the power from the ocean it is known that the turbine blade as one of the most critical components which determine the hydrodynamic performance of a turbine system ghorashi and moetakef imani 2016 wang et al 2019a b therefore the performance life span and some potential influence factors on turbine blade have attracted much attention of researchers during the operation of ocean current turbines the blades are becoming more susceptible to hydrodynamic issues caused by fsi fluid structure interaction these hydrodynamic issues originate from a variety of sources such as hydrodynamic loads from water streams current speed variational fatigue loads intermittent loads with the effect of rotations gravity like centrifugal and coriolis forces nijssen 2006 and the vibrational natural frequencies induced in an ocean current turbine blade kumar et al 2018 specifically the hydrodynamic issues on the blade may cause blade mechanical load vibration this vibration can in turn lead to additional variation in the flow field resulting in further load alteration after a long period of operation the interaction of fluid and structure may lead to fatigue problems and there could be a possible progressive crack on the turbine blade which could result in a macro fatigue of blade well before that of the yield strength and eventually lead to failure meanwhile a failure of one blade can lead to the total destruction of an ocean current turbine system and widespread damage to the turbine surroundings therefore fsi evaluation on turbine blade is a critical issue in need of concentration fsi modeling requires both hydrodynamic and structural components to establish both hydrodynamic loads and the corresponding structural responses for the hydrodynamic component of fsi modeling the bem blade element momentum model glauert 1935 and cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling tu et al 2018 are common used and for the structural component of fsi modeling beam models and fea finite element analysis models are the two most common approaches e g hansen et al 2006 zhang and huang 2011 currently there are many relevant numerical studies have been carried out on investigating hydrodynamic and structural responses behavior of blades lee et al 2014 used a boundary element method finite element method bem fem fluid structure interaction fsi tool to study the hydrodynamic damping effects of added mass due to fluid around the propeller blade the results show the tool can evaluate blade strength and also enable to do risk assessment by estimating the change in performance and the deformation depending on blade position in the ship s wake wang et al 2016 used a one way coupling fsi model to study the hydrodynamic loads of a 1 5 mw wind turbine blade and the maximum tensile compressive stresses and tip deflections in each case were found to be within the material and structural limits li et al 2014 developed a methodology based on bem fem to study a hydro turbine blade with reliability based fatigue life yin et al 2017 investigated the fluid structure responses of three metal materials blades in a high pressure booster pump application showing that the natural frequencies were different and the maximum equivalent stresses were observed at the root junction jo et al 2013 used a fsi tool to analyze a tidal current turbine and the calculation results were conducted to determine the deformation distribution along the pile tower rafiee et al 2016 investigated the aeroelastic behavior of a full scale composite wind turbine blade based on a bem cfd tool and fsi tool showing the influence of deformation on power performance is determined implying on a reduction in output power in order to verify the effectiveness of model some researchers carried out an experimental work related the hydrodynamic and structural model for example calì et al 2018 offered a methodology that enhances the understanding of the influence of panel arrangement and fiber orientation on sail performance based on an integrated cfd csm computational structural mechanics analysis and digital photogrammetry 3d reconstruction experiment showing this methodology can contribute to narrowing the gap between hydrodynamic simulation and real life behavior of sails turnbull and omenzetter 2017 used a fuzzy finite element model updating ffemu techniques for damage severity assessment of a turbine blade showing ffemu was able to obtain a prediction of baseline material properties of the blade whilst also successfully predicting with sufficient accuracy a larger magnitude of structural alteration and its location macphee and beyene 2015 experimental tested wind turbine performance in a wind tunnel and analyzed the aero elastic response using a finite volume fluid structure interaction solver showing that the flexible rotor was markedly superior to a geometrically identical rigid one in terms of the size fagan et al 2017 carried out an experimental testing on a glass fibre epoxy composite turbine blade the results of the test were used to calibrate finite element models and a design optimization study was then performed using a genetic algorithm showing such structural modeling in combination with numerical search algorithms provide a powerful tool for designers augier et al 2015 developed an experimental measurement system to extract hydrodynamic loads on the foils and capture their twisting deformation during operation and used a couple fsi tool to predicate the foil hydrodynamic loads the results show an excellent agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured hydrodynamic loads and foil twisting motion however in a real ocean environment the blades are affected not only by fsi but also the environmental factors from an environmental point of view the ocean environment is changeable and complex the ocean current turbine is affected by sea water and sea salt vapor corrosion seawater is a naturally strong conductive electrolyte with a salt content of approximately 3 5 mass fraction this makes seawater highly corrosive to most metal materials such as iron steel and aluminum alloy due to the high levels of chloride that prevent them from passivation the corrosion rate of metals in a saline water environment is high and if the environmental factors and fsi work together fluid structure environment interaction it will greatly shorten the life span of the structure according to some research results the fatigue growth rates of alloys including marine engineering alloys in saline water are obviously higher than those in the air e g li et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 meng et al 2013 dhinakaran and prakash 2014 mehmanparast et al 2017 in order to control the environmental corrosion effect some researchers used composite materials to replace metal blade due to its attractive characteristics such as low density good fatigue resistance wear resistance and corrosion resistance making composite materials a good option for applications in an ocean environment for example boisseau et al 2012 2013 and kennedy et al 2016 conducted fatigue tests on glass fiber reinforced material for marine turbine blade application showing that the influence of testing in different environments was small and such material have good application prospect tual et al 2015 carried out the long term behavior of different carbon epoxy composites using accelerated ageing tests the results show a significant reduction of composite strengths has been observed after saturation of water in the material and no significant changes have been observed for moduli nor for composite toughness davies et al 2013 carried out static and cyclic tests on composite both in air and in sea water the influence of ageing in sea water on fatigue performance is then quantified and much lower fatigue lives are measured after ageing the only drawback is that composite materials have the problem of insufficient stiffness and yet metal materials have high stiffness and strong bearing capacity an idea was developed to combine metal materials and composite materials to meet basic needs and realize each respective function based on the ocean characteristics of metal materials and composite materials manufacturing using a multilayer composite blade design is capable of achieving corrosion resistance and the mechanical fatigue resistance effect and load carrying capacity with lightweight structures it can be concluded that a large number of theoretical numerical and experimental researches have been carried out on the hydrodynamic issues structural responses and fatigue properties and some progress have been achieved however the study of the fluid structure environment interaction of ocean current turbine blades is very limited and there is a lack of effective solutions for prolonging the life span of the blades based on the above researches the purpose of this paper is to propose a multilayer composite blade design scheme for ocean current energy applications in the present work a fsi model for an ocean current turbine blade was established and the results were used for evaluation the fatigue crack growth rate measurements for nano particles reinforced polypropylene nprp in four environments were performed using mts fatigue testing techniques and the fatigue data obtained were evaluated fractographical investigations with a scanning electron microscope sem were used to identify the mechanisms of the fatigue effect the multilayer composite blade was tested under fatigue load verification test it is hoped that the study presented in this paper will prove useful for those wishing to enhance the performance of ocean current turbines especially in regards to corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance more specifically the multilayer composite blade design could have a profound impact and help increase the blade life span without significant upfront costs this could be especially useful in regions where tidal current energy resources are abundant but the environment is relatively complex 2 ocean current turbine model the calculation model is a micro horizontal axis diffuser augmented ocean current turbine and the diameter of the rotor is 500 mm the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser is 5 mm such a small tip clearance is conducive to reducing diffuser costs and water flow resistance the 3d geometry model of the ocean current turbine is presented in fig 1 the details of the turbine can be found in song et al 2019a b the blade includes five types of hydrofoils i e dt0814 dt0816 dt0818 dt0820 and dt0820 the main parameters are summarized in table 1 in this paper the incoming velocity was set to 2 m s this value was taken as the research background from the tidal current power generation test field near the zhaitang islands and putuo hulu islands in the east china sea since the maximum ocean current velocity extreme operating conditions there is approximately 2 m s the power coefficients of the turbine versus tsr are shown in fig 2 the c p values that are higher than 0 6 at tsr of 3 50 4 75 showing the turbine is suitable for operating under lower tip speed ratio and reduces chances of cavitation it has to be mentioned here cavitation a complex physical flow process involving multiphase flow turbulence and phase transition is often found in hydro machinery e g carlton 2012 kumar and saini 2010 when cavitation is created and developed to a certain stage collapse and shedding of the cavitation will occur and at the same time a large amount of energy will be released under the long term effect of cavitation a series of problems will occur such as material corrosion structural damage vibration and noise which seriously affect the performance of the ocean current turbine therefore cavitation as the important performance criterion on the turbine blade should be discussed the three dimensional mixture turbulent model was used to simulate the cavitation performance of the ocean current turbine and the other boundary conditions set ups were the same as the follow up section the basic phase is liquid seawater and the secondary phase is water vapor assuming that the phases are adiabatic and there are no slips only mass transfer occurs the saturated vapor pressure of seawater at room temperature 300 k is 3540 pa the density is 1025 kg m3 and the density of water vapor is 0 02558 kg m3 the water vapor volume fraction and pressure distribution on the ocean current turbine were used to plot the cavitation characteristics of the system as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the value of the water vapor volume fraction is zero under this condition indicating there is no cavitation on the turbine system the ocean current turbine blade is unlikely to be corroded and damaged by the cavitation effect therefore we focus on the fsi effect and salinity corrosion effect on turbine blade in follow up section 3 mathematical model and fsi setup 3 1 governing equations and coupling approaches flow is considered to be a viscous three dimensional and unsteady turbulent flow the incompressible three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes questions can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i is the time averaged velocity p is the time average pressure ρ is the fluid density and f i is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress value and the two equation shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is used to model the reynolds stress menter 1994 bardina et al 1997 the reynolds number re ρvr μ 5 0 105 is based on the dynamic viscosity μ the inlet current velocity v 2 m s and the radius r of the rotor the dynamic equation of the structure wu et al 2013 is defined as 3 m s q t c s q t k s q t q s where q t is a nodal acceleration vector q t is a nodal velocity vector q t is a nodal displacement vector m s is the structural mass matrix c s is the structural damping matrix k s is the structural stiffness matrix and q s is the applied load vector including the hydrodynamical force 3 2 computational setup according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the cylinder is used as the fluid calculation domain the diameter of the calculation domain is 6d d is diameter of turbine the distance between the center point of the turbine and the inlet is 3d and the distance between the center point and the outlet is 6d the fluid computations were performed using ansys fluent software the mrf model frank 2015 is used for numerical calculations and the computational domain is divided into a rotatory zone and a stationary zone the rotatory zone was set as a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as the velocity inlet a free outflow and a free slip wall condition for the stationary outer domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a nonslip wall the duct surface was also set as a nonslip wall the fluid calculation domain is shown in fig 4 near the rotor and diffuser surface the grid is denser and the surface is configured to have a prism layer including 10 inflation layers and a y 1 for the rotor s surfaces the diffuser surface is also inflated but with 5 inflation layers and a y 10 leading to 8 million elements for the diffuser augmented turbine the hydrodynamic performance experiment and relevant cfd numerical results of the ocean current turbine have been provided in the previous publication song et al 2019a b shown in fig 5 the average deviation measured at five current velocities is 5 8 and the maximum deviation is 8 0 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method the blade structure was meshed using unstructured mesh element refinement and self adaptation were carried out in the parts with larger curvature to determine the appropriate solid mesh size and number a mesh independence assessment was carried out the assessment considered the hydrodynamic loads assuming a centrifugal force equivalent to that experienced by a rotor rotating at 288 rpm along with the gravity loads in the normal direction of incoming current velocity these conditions closely mimic the previous hydrodynamic performance experimental test conditions at 2 m s current velocity additionally a fixed boundary condition was applied to the rotor hub and the material used was aluminum alloy taking only the rotor into consideration and ensuring a higher density on the blade the maximal equivalent stress on the blade was recorded with varying mesh numbers until very little relative change was found shown in table 2 the final mesh of the blade as seen in fig 6 contains 0 4 m elements the coupling method of fsi modeling is based on one way coupling by ansys workbench and the fluid domain calculation uses cfd until the convergence criteria are reached the hydrodynamic pressures on the blade obtained from cfd are mapped to the fea as load boundary conditions and the structural responses of the blade subjected to hydrodynamic load can be calculated such as blade deformations and stress distributions 3 3 analysis of fsi results in the modal analysis the frequency response characteristics of the turbine blade models were discussed the first to the sixth order modal for the turbine blade under rotating prestress gravity and fluid structure coupling effects are shown in fig 7 the first to the sixth order vibration modes are similar with vibration related frequency increases and gradual deformation increases the maximum deformation can be found in the tip which is called the swing deformation the frequencies of the first three orders are close in value as are the last three orders thus the impact of fsi on the vibration characteristics is small for low order modes but a significant difference between the frequencies of the third and fourth modal can been seen the modal frequencies are much higher at 239 18 561 4 hz than the working frequency of the ocean current turbine at 2 m s approximately 4 8 hz the difference is based on the fact that a safer system is unlikely to have resonant vibrations in the system in the static analysis the maximum equivalent stress created on the root regions and the maximum deformation that occurred in the blade tip are shown in fig 8 a and b the fatigue risk location can be initially determined by finding the maximum stress concentration area on the blade the peak stress in the stress concentration area is also used to predict the service life of a blade in this study the max equivalent stress on the blade is 48 3 mpa which is well below the aluminum alloy yield strength of 265 mpa the maximum deformation of the blade tip is 1 7 mm which is much lower than the tip clearance between the rotor and diffuser 5 mm indicating that the blade is unlikely to strike on the diffuser or other parts under the given conditions and the hydrodynamic performance is basically unaffected fig 9 shows the max equivalent stress versus time on the blade under unsteady behaviors of the hydrodynamics of the ocean current turbine the stress values do not change significantly with time indicating that the operation stability is good under this condition safety factors are important factors to be considered in the design performance fatigue life and efficiency of ocean current turbine blades fig 8 d shows the safety factor distribution on the blade the critical safety factor is 1 7 indicating that the blade can withstand 1 109 cycles with a low probability of failures under the given conditions however the actual life of the blade in a sea environment will be far less than the numerical simulation value due to the environmental corrosion since for ocean current turbines salinity corrosion is the main inducement 4 fatigue experiment to find suitable materials to meet the demand the properties of several materials were studied the nano particles reinforced polypropylene nprp was selected as the layer material and the aluminum alloy was selected as the main metal material due to its good processing ability and lightweight structure in this paper the design scheme of main part plus two layers were used as follows the main part aluminum alloy load carrying structure the first layer curing agent bonding layer bonding aluminum alloy and nprp thickness is approximately 100 μm curing agent bonding layer of epoxy resin cementing was used due to its special performance of pollution free convenient storage and transportation fast solidification and good adhesion as for fiber metal plastic and non metallic materials the epoxy resin cementing all has good adhesive properties for those materials e g sahafi et al 2003 takai and takaya 2008 anagnostopoulos et al 2016 the second layer nprp layer salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance thickness is 1 2 mm the schematic of the layers on the blade is shown in fig 10 the base mechanical properties of two main materials are in table 3 in the following sections the fatigue performance of nprp and the multilayer blade were analyzed by experimental tests and numerical simulation 4 1 nprp immersed fatigue performance test and crack resistance effect mts and the test specimen are shown in fig 11 the test specimen is depicted with specific dimensions based on the reference of international standards iso12108 2012 the nprp material was processed into standard three point single edge notch bend se b model i loading specimens as shown in fig 12 the total length of the specimen is 210 mm the distance of the two supporting bases is 180 mm the thickness b is 20 mm and the height w is 50 mm the mechanical prefabricated incision width is 2 mm and the height is 5 mm on this basis a 1 mm sharp initial crack on the incision was cut with a razor blade by broaching during the test the crack growth was along the middle section of the specimen the stress intensity factors range values δk were calculated according to eq 4 4 δ k δ p b w 1 2 6 α 1 2 1 2 α 1 α 3 2 1 99 α 1 α 2 15 3 93 α 2 7 α 2 where δp p max p min b represents the specimen thickness w represents the specimen width a is the crack length α a w all tests were performed using an electrodynamic fatigue testing machine type mts 809 mts usa the prepared specimens were immersed in three specific nacl saline water environments 0 3 5 5 for 60 days then sealed with waterproof tape the corresponding saline water was added to the tape to ensure that the crack tip in the fatigue test was always immersed the number of cycles per 0 5 mm of specimen crack growth in the four environments air water 3 5 saline water 5 saline water was recorded by a crack length measurement device with a light source all specimens were loaded with a sinusoidal force profile with a frequency of 6 hz and an r ratio ratio between the minimum to maximum applied force of 0 1 and the results were plotted in terms of da dn vs δk the results were obtained through fatigue tests with an initial stress of p max 3600 n and an initial length of 6 mm where the tip equivalent stress is 69 7 mpa which is much higher than the blade equivalent stress of 48 3 mpa as shown in fig 8 b the specimens fatigue cracks in the four environments were not observed during the tests instead 69 7 mpa was defined as the lower limit of the crack resistance effect which means no fatigue cracks appeared when the equivalent stress was lower than this value for the initial stress p max 4600 n and the initial length of 6 mm where the tip equivalent stress is 89 1 mpa as shown in fig 13 b there was an obvious crack resistance effect where the fatigue cracks were approximately less than 2 mm in the four environments so 89 1 mpa was defined as the upper limit of the crack resistance effect which means the fatigue crack could not continue to grow when the equivalent stress was between 69 7 mpa and 89 1 mpa the above test results were verified by 1 107 cycles showing the four environments did not affect the crack resistance effect of nprp the test fractographical nprp specimen 5 saline water immersed is shown in fig 14 the details of sem fractographical information are shown in fig 15 the fatigue area of crack growth can be divided into three stages the initial stage δk ranges from 2 9 to 3 6 mpa m1 2 the crack resistance effect occurred at this stage stable linear stage δk ranges from 3 6 to 5 5 mpa m1 2 and rapid instability stage δk ranges from 5 5 to 7 6 mpa m1 2 point a is in the initial stage with crack growth about 1 mm corresponding δk is 2 9 sem fractographical information displays that there are some wrinkles and bulges in these areas and the nano particles with small bright spots can be seen at the same time these small particles are distributed in the polypropylene matrix playing an important role in the crack resistance effect the nano particles are uniformly dispersed in the matrix of the polypropylene and there is no agglomeration among the particles which can achieve a degree of nano dispersion when the nprp is subjected to external loads the stress concentration will occur around the nano particles and make the surrounding matrix agglomerated thus inhibiting the sliding of the molecular clusters on the other hand due to the large specific surface area and the high specific surface energy of the nano particles both matrix protrusions and wrinkles will appear to further absorb the excess energy therefore in the initial stage the fatigue resistance performance of nprp is enhanced and the crack resistance effect occurs point b is in the stable linear stage with crack growth about 6 mm corresponding δk is 3 6 point c is in the stable linear stage with crack growth about 13 mm corresponding δk is 4 3 the fractographical information displays these surface wrinkles and bulges become larger compared to point a point d is in the rapid instability stage with crack growth about 18 mm corresponding δk is 5 8 the fractographical information displays this area has a large range of circular layered bumps and potholes with some micro matrixes detached and some wrinkles slip paged point e is in the brittle fracture area about 30 mm away from the mechanical incision it can be seen that the surface is much smoother than the fatigue area and there are only a few small range of bumps on the surface the fatigue crack growth curves of nprp in the four environments are shown in fig 16 it is observed that the crack growth rates in the four environments are basically not changed however chloride has little effect on the crack growth rate of nprp the fitted data at the stable linear stage show that the growth rate slightly increases with the increase in the chlorine concentration the slope of the fitted line slightly increases with the increase in δk values in fig 14 b e g song et al 2019 song et al 2015 such effects of chlorine on fatigue crack growth rates can be explained by enhanced fatigue crack tip aging e g cosgriff et al 2017 fischer et al 2016 which is the degradation of the polypropylene matrix molecular mass and the resulting change in the molecular mass distribution in the region near the fatigue crack tip first any liquid solution leads to a certain amount of additive and micro matrix leaching and the polymer network structure in regions near the fatigue crack tip is significantly reduced second the chlorine in the saline water induces chemical aging at the fatigue crack tip region leading to accelerating fatigue crack growth rates it is worth mentioning that compared with air and water environments at higher δk values enough time is available for the chlorine in the saline water to induce local crack tip aging leading to acceleration of the fatigue crack growth rates vs lower δk values simultaneously at lower δk values and crack growth rates the exposure time of the crack tip region to the surrounding environment is not enough resulting in little differences in crack growth rates between the four environments however chlorine seems to act as a degrading aging medium only when breaking through the crack resistance effect tip at a certain external load range indicating that such an effect was not affected by chlorine chemical aging in summary there is basically no change in the fatigue crack growth rates of nprp in the four environments in particular nprp is not sensitive to the presence of chloride which proves that nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance 4 2 multilayer blade fatigue endurance test the damage and fracture of the blades are mainly concentrated in the vulnerable regions of the blades according to the references damage occurs mainly in the radial range of approximately 26 54 of the blade e g ataya and ahmed 2013 jensen et al 2006 yang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 and the fsi results in fig 8 b thus the test blades are half blades near the root and the length is 112 5 mm as shown in fig 17 the test blades were immersed in 5 nacl saline water for 60 days as pretreatment the fatigue tests were also loaded with a sinusoidal force profile with a frequency of 6 hz and an r ratio of 0 1 the total loads on the blade in the radial direction can be approximately evaluated by 5 f f a f c f a m b l a d e r c 2 π n 60 2 where f c is the centrifugal force m blade 0 157 kg the distance between the gravity center and the rotation center r c 98 16 mm n 288 rpm and f a is the hydrodynamic force calculated by cfd the torque values were also calculated by cfd the torque was amplified and loaded 5 times and then loaded onto the blade the test blades were loaded for 1 0 107 cycles under the tensile load of 100 n and the torque load of 5 15 n m where no failure occurred the observation of the whole blade surface showed no surface cracking and no layers peeling off simultaneously the results of the fem analysis with the same boundary condition are shown in fig 18 the maximum equivalent stress and the maximum deformation are also found to be within material and structural limits the bonded contact type was used for simulating the function of the curing agent bonding layer between the aluminum alloy and nprp it is worth mentioning that the stronger stiffness material will mainly bear external loads when the two materials have different stiffnesses within a certain range as seen in fig 18 b and c the stress mainly acts on the aluminum alloy and the stress acting on nprp is much smaller than that on the aluminum alloy 5 discussion the reduction of the sharp edges selection of suitable materials and increase of the structural members are important measures for prolonging the life span in small and micro axis ocean current turbines the fsi results clearly show the vulnerable regions in the blade especially the regions near the root so engineers must concentrate on reinforcement of the blades and the optimization of how they work there is good bonding performance between the aluminum alloy and nprp which can be loaded and deformed as one in addition the max shear stress 9 1 mpa was created in a very small area near the root while most of the blade surface had stresses of approximately 2 4 mpa as shown in fig 8 c the shear strength of the epoxy resin cementing is above 18 mpa so it is unlikely that peeling off will occur the linear expansion coefficients of aluminum alloy and nprp are close aluminum alloy is approximately 23 8 10 6 c 1 and nprp is approximately 44 5 10 6 c 1 the temperature in the target sea area has changed within a small range year round so the bonding effect is unlikely to be damaged by temperature changes aluminum alloy has a high stiffness and load carrying capacity and nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance therefore wrapping the outside of the aluminum alloy with nprp can protect the aluminum alloy by combining the two materials the aluminum alloy and nprp can both be fully utilized so that the two materials can do their best to realize each respective function and form structural members with good performance nprp is an optional material that is not only suitable for small and micro axis ocean current turbine blade layers but also can be applied as a noncore structural component in turbine systems such as a floater further adjustments can be made according to the characteristics of the sea area for example the acrylic acid epoxy resin can be applied as the third layer for some areas where the environment is worse which can further strengthen the corrosion resistance of the blades 6 conclusions this paper presents the design and investigation of an ocean current turbine blade with salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance based on a fsi simulation established by one way coupling of cfd and fea and fatigue experimental tests the following conclusions can be drawn the fsi results show that the first to the sixth order modal frequencies for the blade are much higher at 239 18 561 4 hz than the working frequency of the ocean current turbine at 2 m s and the maximum equivalent stress and deformation is found to be within material and structural limits the critical safety factor of the blade is 1 7 indicating that the blade can withstand 1 109 cycles with a low probability of failures under the given conditions without environmental effect nprp has an obvious crack resistance effect during the test no fatigue cracks were observed when the equivalent tip stress was lower than 69 7 mpa and the fatigue cracks did not continue to grow when the equivalent tip stress was between 69 7 mpa and 89 1 mpa in the four environments furthermore the wide range of crack growth rates and δk values for nprp in the four environments are reported here the slight detrimental effect of the presence of chlorine on fatigue crack growth rates was explained by enhanced local crack tip aging which is the degradation of the polypropylene matrix molecular mass and the resulting change in molecular mass distribution in the region near the fatigue crack tip nprp is not sensitive to the presence of chloride which proves that nprp has good salinity corrosion resistance and mechanical fatigue resistance the multilayer composite test blades with immersion pretreatment can stand 1 107 cycles under a tensile load of 100 n and a torque load of 5 15 n m where no failure occurred the observation of the whole blade surface showed no surface cracking and no layers peeling off meanwhile relevant numerical simulation showed that the stress mainly acted on the aluminum alloy and the stress acting on nprp was much smaller than that on aluminum alloy while testing in the four environments did not result in significant differences the details of the material development are critical if these materials or similar ones can be applied in a wider range this emphasizes the importance of working closely with material suppliers matrix manufacturers and resin formulators the test procedure presented here using cyclic tests after immersion pretreatment allows the materials to be evaluated for
