catalytic membrane seawater electro membrane reactor decyanation carbon removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the development of modern social industries gold is utilized extensively in jewelry electronics aerospace and other industries wang et al 2021 in the gold industry cyanidation is a cost effective method for extracting gold chen et al 2020 during the gold extraction procedure cyanide tailings ct containing cyanide and heavy metals are produced not only do simple storage landfilling and other physical treatments of ct harm the environment but they also squander resources realizing the reduction harmlessness and resource discharge of ct is crucial for the gold industry sustainable development as research continues ct can be efficiently processed by various methods since ct often exists in solid form calcination and flotation methods can achieve efficient degradation but at the expense of high energy consumption and cost compared to solid ct treatment various processes are available for the effective removal and recovery of ct specific contaminants cyanide organic pollutants and metal ions leached into the water the electrolytic cell ec can convert the electrical energy provided by the dc power supply into chemical energy via the redox reaction and has the great potential to simultaneously remove cyanide and recover heavy metals from cyanide tailing effluent however the electrolysis application to treat cyanide wastewater suffers from drawbacks including high energy consumption low organic pollutant treatment and heavy metal recovery efficiencies electro membrane reactors emr which combine the technical benefits of membrane reactors mr and microbial fuel cells mfc are extensively used in wastewater treatment due to their inherent energy production and excellent effluent quality however the cathode catalyst affects emr efficacy liu et al 2021 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the slower orr rate at the cathode surface results in electron accumulation due to the continuous transmission of electrons from the anode to the cathode li et al 2022 the high cost susceptibility to corrosion and biofouling of commercially available noble metal catalysts such as pt c impede its further industrial applications gao et al 2018b therefore it is essential to develop alternative non noble metal catalysts including carbon based materials and transition metal catalysts to increase the power output and facilitate contaminants degradation by enhancing the orr rate han and chen 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang and liu 2020 by combining emr and ec systems the emr ec system not only reduces energy consumption but also improves effluent quality with the advantage of good dispersibility and high specific surface area carbon based materials can serve as transition metal catalyst supports lilloja et al 2022 ratso et al 2017 as typical two dimensional carbon materials graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are frequently used as carriers for metal nanoparticles due to their high specific surface area numerous active sites and accessible electron pathways when heteroatoms or transition metal complexes are added to the graphene surface the surface unevenly distributed charges can be modified to obtain active centers graphene derived catalysts have tremendous potential for large scale emr applications by doping heteroatoms or transition metal complexes to enhance the orr rate pan et al prepared go tio2 zsm 5 composite photocatalysts by introducing go as an additional attachment site of the active site thereby enhancing the tio2 photocatalytic efficiency and achieving efficient photocatalytic degradation of cyanide wastewater pan et al 2022 previous research has demonstrated that hydrophilic nanoparticles can increase the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of membrane surfaces wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 the oxygen containing functional groups carboxyl groups etc on the go surface and the hydrophilic chemical bonds formed by metal nanoparticles on the membrane surface can both decrease contact angle ca and improve the hydrophilicity studies have demonstrated that transition metal atoms fe mn and so on and their oxides are alternative non noble metal catalysts due to their low cost superior redox properties and corrosion resistance gao et al 2022 tmos such as iron and manganese oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 etc have diverse chemical structures and highly specific surface areas allowing for heterogeneous reactions on catalyst surfaces wang et al 2015 the variable valence states of tmo enable them to have high mobility of oxygen in the oxide lattice thus stimulating excellent redox reactions ding et al 2020 gao et al 2018a saputra et al 2014 moreover the synergistic interactions between different active sites of heterojunction catalysts can improve the acidic orr kinetics tmos can cleave oo bond of h2o2 to generate oh or h2o and transition metal oxide heterojunctions tmohs can synergistically catalyze the reduction process thereby promoting the kinetics of acidic orr due to their poor electrical conductivity and strong aggregation tendency the performance and long term stability of tmohs are constrained the incorporation of conductive nanostructured supports reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotubes etc can disperse the tmohs produce more available active sites and increase conductivity to enhance the orr property in this study a novel carbon fiber based polyvinylidene fluoride catalytic electrode membrane pvdf rgo tfe mno2 with transition metal oxide heterojunction catalyst tmohc was developed and coupled with semr ec to treat cyanide wastewater the tmohc fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 was fabricated by the chemical synthesis method and the tmohccm was coated with tmohc by phase conversion method using rgo as the nanostructured conductive support to investigate the catalytic and pollutant removal mechanism of the semr ec system coupled with tmohccm for treating cyanide wastewater the following aspects were analyzed 1 the morphology and composition of the tmohc and tmohccm 2 the electrochemical characteristic of tmohccm and the catalytic orr mechanism of tmohc 3 the cyanide wastewater treatment property of the semr ec coupled with tmohccm 4 synergistic removal mechanism of various contaminants in cyanide wastewater and engineering application prospects of semr ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 tmohccm fabrication a detailed description of chemicals and membrane substrate pretreatment is presented in the supporting information page s4 the main difference between the three catalytic cathode membranes in this experiment is the distinct go mass fractions introduced to each membrane the names of pvdf rgo tfe mno2 membranes are derived from table s1 with the pvdf and rgo subscripts indicating membrane thickness and go addition respectively the different tmohccm was fabricated by using the above three casting solutions with different composition ratios and the specific preparation procedures were as follows go was synthesized by the improved method fig 1 a marcano et al 2010 first go was added to the conical flasks containing n n dimethyl formamide dmf according to the casting membrane solution ratio each conical flask was sonicated for 24 h to promote go dissolution in dmf pvdf 5 g and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp 1 g were then added into the conical flask and stirred for 24 h next the homogenous casting solution was prepared by adding reduced iron powder fe fe3o4 into the conical flask with constant stirring for 30 min after stirring the casting knife with the set thickness 300 400 Î¼m dispersed the casting solution on the pretreated carbon fiber cloth the coated membrane plates were quenched into di water to induce phase inversion and obtain pvdf go tfe membranes with various components the membranes were reduced by heating with hydriodic acid hi in a 100 c water bath for 2 min to convert go into rgo the reduced membrane was almost reddish brown and repeatedly was washed with di water until the washing water became transparent to facilitate the conversion of nano reduced iron into ferrous ions the membrane was infiltrated with 2 diluted hydrochloric acid hcl and washed repeatedly with di water finally the membrane was immersed for 24 h in 0 2 mol l 1 potassium permanganate kmno4 solution for further oxidation the pvdf rgo tfe mno2 catalytic cathode membranes with different composition ratios and distinct thicknesses were prepared by the same process 2 2 semr ec system operation more details on cyanide wastewater composition and semr ec system construction are found in the supporting information pages s8 s9 in the domestication phase of anode microorganisms the nutrient solution ph 7 2 containing glucose 500 mg l 1 nh4cl 95 mg l 1 k2hpo4 3h2o 36 5 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 6 22 mg l 1 mgso4 5 85 mg l 1 entered the anode chamber during this period a continuous increase in the anode potential and system potential was observed in the data acquisition system the anode voltage and the system potential were stable after one month of acclimation a suitable resistance was then connected between the nail and cathode membrane to form a closed circuit the ec system is performed by connecting the carbon rod and cathode membrane to a dc power source the semr ec system operated in batch flow mode the nutrient solution was fed into the anode chamber and the cathode chamber was fed with cyanide wastewater due to the limited volume of the cathode chamber the membrane module cannot synchronize the membrane effluent therefore the cathode chamber effluent was collected and the membrane effluent was subjected to an additional membrane filtration procedure during the experiment the electricity generation effluent quality and other related parameters were continuously tested and evaluated at the end of the system operation the anti fouling and durability properties of the cathode membrane were analyzed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 material characterization the lmohccm

respectively x ray diffraction xrd smartlab 3kw rigaku japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 xi thermo fisher scientific america were used to identify the crystal form element composition and chemical bond 2 3 2 electrochemical analysis a data acquisition system gt71r china was used for the potential collection of the anode and the system according to previous research cui et al 2022 the polarization curve and power density curve were measured and plotted using an electrochemical workstation corrtest china with a three electrode system the oxygen reduction activity of the cathode membranes was characterized the specific methods for electrochemical analysis include cyclic voltammetry cv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis linear sweep voltammetry lsv and tafel curve the cv and lsv were tested at 10 mv s 1 between 0 8 v and 0 8 v the eis was measured at 0 8 v with a 10 mv amplitude sinusoidal perturbation the tafel curve derived from the tafel equation

package vasp served as the foundation for all dft calculations the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional within the generalized gradient approximation gga method explained exchange correlation effects the projected augmented wave paw method was utilized to calculate core valence interactions integration of the brillouin zone was sampled using 3 3 1 monkhorst pack grid k points and a 500 ev plane wave expansion energy threshold to avoid periodic reactions vacuum space is 15 Ã¥ above surfaces energy and force convergence values were 1 10 4 ev and 0 02 ev Ã¥ 1 respectively for structural optimization 2 3 4 water quality analysis the cyanide wastewater composition was determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent icp oes 720 america the total organic carbon content of the cyanide wastewater was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc l japan the concentrations of cyanide cn and residual chlorine clo were monitored by uv vis spectrophotometer lh 3ba china the specific measurement method of cyanide and residual chlorine is isonicotinic acid barbituric acid spectrophotometry and dpd spectrophotometry respectively the iron fe concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 china various pollutant indicators are measured three times to take the average and make error bars more details of calculations are presented in the supporting information pages s10 s12 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and chemical composition of tmohccm a detailed description of go morphology is presented in the supporting information page s13 fig 1b c depicts the sem and pore size distribution images of pvdf300 and pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane exhibits a larger pore size 0 18 Î¼m and more uniform membrane pores than the control group on the one hand a larger specific surface area and more edge defects in go sheets as tmo carriers lead to increased membrane pores and pore size expansion the hi thermal reduction process on the other hand decreases the oxygen containing groups on the go surface increases the structural defects and increases the go specific surface area resulting in the expansion and dispersion of membrane pores in addition the crystalline particles observed on the membrane and go surface are identified as tmohc fig 1a and c based on the hrtem image of the rgo tfe mno2 catalyst this catalyst consists of three different tmos crystal planes linked by heterojunctions fig 1d consistent with the saed pattern the three crystal planes are the 221 crystal plane of fe2o3 the 311 crystal plane of fe3o4 and the 031 crystal plane of mno2 fig 1e more details on apparent resistance conductivity and wca of the tmohccm are found in the supporting information pages s15 s16 the ftir spectra of catalytic cathode membranes are shown in fig 1i several minor peaks between 2500 and 3400 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of oh groups a prominent peak around 2352 cm 1 is considered to be the o c o vibration and the peak around 1694 cm 1 is ascribed to the c o vibration in carboxylic groups the peaks around 670 865 and 1550 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of n h groups in the amino functional group while the peaks at 1104 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of the c n groups compared with the control the characteristic peaks intensity of o c o groups are augmented and the characteristic peaks of oxygen containing groups oh c o appeared on the surface of the modified cathode membrane the intensity of the characteristic peaks of oxygen containing groups oh o c o c o nh and cn increase and then decrease with increasing go addition indicating that the hydrophilicity variation reflected by the ca is determined by the amount of hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface the crystal structure of the tmohccm pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 was characterized by xrd fig 1j the diffraction peaks of the cathode membrane at 18 3 19 9 and 26 6 correspond to the 100 020 and 021 crystal planes of the Î± phase li et al 2013 martins et al 2014 the diffraction peaks at 32 2 35 5 43 and 53 5 are attributed to the 211 crystal planes of fe2o3 and the 311 400 and 422 crystal planes of fe3o4 pdf 04 0755 pdf 01 1111 fe3o4 is ascribed to two factors 1 the intrinsic fe3o4 in the reduced iron powder is introduced directly into the cathode membrane as a catalytic component and 2 the bare iron nanoparticles in reduced iron powder are readily oxidized due to prolonged air exposure the remaining diffraction peaks are characteristic peaks of mno2 pdf 14 0644 the xps spectra of pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 can reflect the elements characteristic peaks and chemical bonds the characteristic peaks of c 1 s o 1 s f 1 s mn 2p and fe 2p originates from the membrane components and catalytic fractions fig 1k indicating that they are dissolved in the casting solution and incorporated into the catalytic cathode membrane the splitting and fitting of the characteristic peaks of c 1 o 1 and f 1 s indicate that go is introduced into the membrane as the tmo carrier and coordinated with the membrane polymer elements to form chemical bonds fig 1k1 k3 however manganese is not introduced to the casting solution the mn 2p discovery on the membrane surface confirms that potassium permanganate is converted to manganese dioxide during membrane modification thereby becoming a catalytic component of the cathode membrane fig 1k4 the characteristic peaks of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 appear at 654 4 and 642 47 ev respectively and their binding energy difference is 11 93 ev in accordance with the two electron orbital data of mno2 gao et al 2018b the fe 2p characteristic peaks indicate that the iron oxide in the reduced iron powder is introduced as a catalytic component to the membrane surface and distributed uniformly fig 1k5 the material characterization results hrtem xrd and xps etc indicate the successful construction of catalytic structures on the membrane surface with go and rgo nanostructured conductive supports loaded with tmos fe2o3 fe3o4 and mno2 and connect in a heterojunction structure 3 2 tmohccm electrochemical activity the electrochemical properties of the tmohccm were investigated by cv eis lsv and tafel curves fig 2 a depicts the cv curves of cathode membranes with different go doping ratios and thicknesses at the same membrane thickness the addition of go increases the capacitance an extraordinary reduction peak fe3 mn4 reduction to fe2 mn3 0 37 v and a negligible oxidation peak fe2 mn3 oxidation to fe3 mn4 0 37 v are revealed by the cv curve of the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane this confirms the redox reaction of the internal transition metal ions of tmohc and indicates the superior electrocatalytic performance of the as prepared catalytic cathode during membrane modification more go sheets on the membrane surface are reduced and oxidized creating more active sites and facilitating electron transfer at 0 8 go addition the thinner the membrane the greater the capacitance and the more prominent the reduction peak thinner membranes can decrease the pvdf coverage on the conductive carrier go and rgo and catalytic components fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 thereby exposing more active and catalytic sites and enhancing electron transfer and catalytic activity according to the cv curves analysis both pvdf rgo tfe mno2 catalytic cathode membranes exhibit better electrocatalytic properties which is attributed to two factors 1 structural changes in go and rgo as nanostructured conductive carriers during the modification process improve the membrane conductivity and 2 redox reactions caused by valence changes of transition metal ions within the tmohc enhance the catalytic activity the nyquist plot and the fitting resistance derived from the equivalent circuit of the cathode membranes are shown in fig 2b and table 1 respectively based on the arc radius in the nyquist plot the charge transfer resistance rct of all cathode membranes is low fig 2b which is conducive to rapid electron transfer according to the equivalent circuit the resistance mainly consists of the solution resistance rs and rct and the total resistance rt value is the sum of rs and rct from table 1 the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane has the lowest rt 38 1 Ï and the second lowest rct 4 02 Ï this is due to the go added to the membrane casting solution and the structural alterations that occur during membrane modification due to its low rct and rt the electrons in the semr ec system coupled with pvdf rgo tfe mno2 cathode membranes can be transferred to the cathode faster from the anode thus binding oxygen and accelerating orr to increase the power output the lsv curve and the fitting parameters based on the lsv curve are depicted in fig 2c the lsv curve can be regarded as a variation of the cv curve in the form of a half circle the lsv curve of pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane reveals an evident reduction peak indicating its superior electrochemical performance this is ascribed to the valence state variation of transition metal ions fe2 fe3 mn3 mn4 on the membrane surface during redox reactions gao et al 2018a 2018b logan et al 2006 compared with other cathode membranes pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane exhibits the steepest wave slope indicating the fastest electrochemical reaction rate gupta et al 2017 the onset potentials of all cathode membranes are approximately 0 79 0 8 v vs sce which is not significantly different however pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode has the largest limiting current 3 58 ma and a higher half wave potential 0 5 v vs sce indicating an excellent electrocatalytic property and a faster electrochemical reaction the electrocatalytic characteristic and electron transfer efficiency of cathode membranes was evaluated by tafel curves liang et al 2020 the greater the exchange current density and the tafel slope the quicker the electron transfer and the higher orr electrochemical activity the exchange current density and tafel slope of the cathode membranes fabricated under various conditions are irregular fig 2d compared to the control group pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane cathode exhibits the highest exchange current density and steepest tafel slope indicating a more rapid electron transfer and exceptional catalytic orr activity more details of easa analysis are presented in the supporting information page s18 according to the above electrochemical analysis results the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode has excellent electrocatalytic properties and a quicker orr rate this is assigned to the high easa and conductivity provided by the conductive carriers of go and rgo as well as the catalytic redox properties resulting from the variable valence states of the transition metal ions 3 3 catalytic pathway analysis a detailed description of the catalytic mechanism is presented in the supporting information pages s19 s20 considering the neutral ph of cyanide wastewater the orr follows three pathways 1 a direct 4e pathway 2 a 2e pathway and 3 a 2 2e pathway eqs 3 5 due to its lower reduction potential compared to the 4e orr pathway and the lower power generation performance of the emr conventional tmos catalyzed orr follows the 2e orr pathway in this research emr and ec are combined to form the semr ec system due to its higher applied voltage the orr reaction of the single emr is dominated by the 2e orr pathway whereas the ec is dominated by the 4e orr pathway due to the coexistence of the catalyst prepared with the membrane polymer in this study the rrde measurement is impossible as demonstrated by theoretical analysis and subsequent hydroxyl radical oh generation in the quenching experiments the orr pathway of the semr ec system follows a coexisting 2e and 4e pathway the exceptional catalytic orr efficacy of the cathode membrane is assigned to the valence cycling of the transition metal redox couple in the redox reaction which facilitates electron transfer and decreased the orr reduction potential 3 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e r e d 1 229 v v s r h e 4 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e r e d 0 695 v v s r h e 5 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o to investigate the electron modulation in tmohc tmos and transition metal atomic centers the bader charge of the atomic sites was calculated by theoretical density functional theory dft fig 2g the local electron density in the atomic centers of tmohc relates directly to the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of orr when the tmohc acts as an active site its positive bader charge 72 e indicates that it obtained electrons and underwent reduction reactions as depicted in fig 2g the tmohc is a stacked structure composed of three tmos including fe2o3 fe3o4 and mno2 connect by heterojunctions as individual active sites the three tmos exhibit different redox properties the positive bader charges of fe2o3 1 08 e and mno2 74 96 e indicate that they performed reduction reactions with elevated charge density when acted as an active site as active sites the negative bader charge of fe3o4 4 04 e indicates that electrons were lost and oxidized the bader charges of iron and manganese atomic centers were negative and positive respectively this indicates that oxidation and reduction processes occurred when the respective atomic centers were used as active sites briefly the synthesized tmohc in this study is dominated by reduction reactions when they act as active sites while orr and heavy metal ions reduction processes predominate around the mno2 crystal planes moreover the negligible oxidation peaks in the cv curves are attributed to the lower bader charge 4 04 e of the fe3o4 crystal plane 3 4 orthogonal experiment of the current density membrane area and catalytic cathode membranes on cyanide wastewater treatment since the removal of pollutants cyanide organic matter heavy metals from cyanide wastewater is related to oxidation and reduction in the semr ec system the current density of the ec affects the cyanide wastewater treatment efficacy to gain insight into the effect of different current densities 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 on the pollutant degradation efficiency three parallel semr ec systems were run with the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membranes of the same membrane area 1 7 cm2 the cn removal efficiency is 27 3 100 and 21 5 in 60 min at respective current densities of 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 fig 3 a this can be explained by two oxidative degradation pathways of cn by the semr ec system i clo cl2 oxidation and â± free radical oxidation the reaction mechanism of cn degradation pathway i is as follows 6 c l 2 e c l 2 7 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o c l h 8 h c l o c l o h 9 c l o c n c n o c l 10 3 c l o 2 c n o 2 h n 2 2 c o 2 h 2 o 3 c l studies have shown that a large amount of cl in seawater as an electrolyte play a crucial role in cn degradation according to eqs 6 10 cl oxidation produced chlorine cl2 which reacted with water h2o to form hypochlorous acid clo clo as a strong oxidant first oxidized cn to produce cyanate cno and then oxidized cno to release nitrogen n2 and carbon dioxide co2 and finally formed cl to complete the cl cycle the yields of clo and cl2 are measured by spectrophotometer see supporting information page s22 for more details furthermore the oxidation of free radicals performs a crucial role in the cn degradation process the reaction mechanism of cn degradation pathway ii is as follows eqs 11 13 11 m s u r f a c e n h 2 o 2 m s u r f a c e n 1 o h o h 12 m s u r f a c e n 1 h 2 o 2 m s u r f a c e n o o h h 13 m s u r f a c e n o h m s u r f a c e n 1 o h note that msurface denotes surface transition metal atoms fe mn h2o2 generated by the 2e orr reaction reacted with the transition metal atoms on the membrane surface to produce hydroxyl radicals oh with strong oxidizing properties which could oxidize cn to n2 this process facilitates both the catalytic recycling of transition metal atoms and quenching oh by adjacent transition metal atoms compared to the control group the voltage corresponding to 10 ma cm 2 produces more oh which oxidizes cn effectively apart from cyanide the impact of different current densities on the organic contaminants toc removal efficiency was analyzed the maximum toc removal efficacies at 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 within 12 h are 53 7 88 5 and 69 5 respectively fig 3c this difference is ascribed to two types of strong oxides produced by anodic oxidation in the ec 1 clo cl2 and 2 free radicals both of them react rapidly and non selectively with organic pollutants resulting in their overall mineralization into harmless small molecules co2 h2o etc table 2 to investigate the impact of different current densities on fe iii reduction the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic model were used to explore the fe iii reduction kinetics the fitting degree and correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo first order model for fe iii reduction kinetic are greater than those obtained from the pseudo second order model fig 3d and table 3 this suggests that the fe iii reduction process is in accordance with the pseudo first order model according to the fitting results of the pseudo first order model the order of rate constants is 0 18 h 1 10 ma cm 2 0 07 h 1 20 ma cm 2 0 066 h 1 5 ma cm 2 the maximum rate constant at 10 ma cm 2 is attributed to two factors 1 the voltage corresponding to a 10 ma cm 2 current density generates more oh and consumes more iron ions and 2 the voltage corresponding to 10 ma cm 2 is larger and closer to the iron reduction potential for efficient fe iii reduction due to the oxygen reduction potential being greater than the iron reduction potential eqs 3 and 14 15 the orr occurs readily as the current density increases inhibiting the fe iii reduction process previous research has demonstrated that the self sustained micro electric field of an emr system is more effective at removing heavy metals than the applied voltage cui et al 2022 given the correlation between fe iii reduction and current density in this study however the oxidation and reduction of the ec system rather than the emr system dominate fe iii removal 14 f e 3 e f e 2 e 0 77 v 15 f e 2 2 e f e e

durability of tmohccm fig s5a depicts the reaction rate constants for diverse quenchers with particular radicals species antonopoulou et al 2020 bai et al 2021 ding et al 2021 watts and linden 2007 wu et al 2017 not only are excessive water molecules sulfate ions so4 2 and cl in seawater involved in the reactions between oxidizing substances but they also contribute to pollutant removal by forming reactive radicals the contaminants removal mechanism of the semr ec system was explored by quenching experiment quenchers for oh sulfate radicals so4 and reactive chlorine species rcs were added to the system and cn removal efficiency rate constant k and clo yield were calculated 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmb shows a negligible effect on cn removal and the rate constant indicating a low content of clo cn removal is significantly inhibited by the presence of nitrobenzene nb methanol meoh tert butanol tba and benzoic acid ba fig 4 a b specifically the addition of 10 mm nb decreases the removal efficiency and rate constant of cn within 40 min by 89 57 and 96 35 respectively this indicates the crucial function of oh on cn removal similar effects of meoh and ba are observed on cn removal rates confirming the existence of so4 and cl2 similar inhibition of cn removal efficiency is observed in both nb and tba demonstrating the cl presence in rcs based on the above results oh and rcs cl cl2 clo are dominant in cn degradation while so4 plays a minor role several of the above free radicals including oh so4 and rcs can be generated by the following reaction mechanisms eqs 11 and 16 230 16 s o 4 2 s o 4 e e 2 5 3 1 v 17 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h 18 c l o h h c l o 19 h c l o h c l h 2 o 20 s o 4 c l c l s o 4 2 21 c l c l c l 2 22 h c l o o h h 2 o c l o 23 h c l o c l c l c l o in addition to the removal efficacy and rate constant of cn the influence of the various quenchers on the clo yield was also explored the clo concentration in the systems with tba and ba is inferior to the control whereas the clo yield of nb meoh and dmb systems is higher than the control fig 4c this is explained by the following reactions 24 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o c l h e as quenchers for oh so4 cl nb meoh and dmb and clo can inhibit the production of these free radicals disrupt the reaction pathway eqs 18 and 22 23 and decrease the clo consumption tba and ba as quenchers for oh so4 cl cl2 and clo inhibit the reaction mechanism and prevented the formation of clo eqs 18 and 19 210 24 scavengers including dmpo and tempo were used to capture oh so4 and rcs cl cl2 and clo during the semr ec system operation a signal intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for dmpo oh and a concomitant peak of dmpo so4 are observed indicating the existence of oh and so4 in the electrooxidation process in the ec fig 4d the tempocl signal is captured during electrolysis confirming the cl formation moreover no cl2 and clo signal is found in the epr test which is assigned to the transient nature and the lack of the standard cl2 and clo signals according to the intensity of the free radical signal in the epr test the order of the free radical amount is clo oh so4 this indicates that clo and oh dominate the cn degradation process while so4 plays a secondary role based on reaction rate constants of free radicals the quenching experiments and epr tests confirm the free radicals oh so4 and rcs production during the operation of the semr ec system this not only enriches the pollutants cn toc and so on degradation pathways but also provides novel ideas for the remediation of refractory organic wastewater more details on flux and anti fouling properties are found in the supporting information pages s29 s30 during the semr ec operation the durability of the tmohccm was also evaluated the iron concentration decreases and the manganese is not detected in cyanide wastewater after system operation indicating that the transition metal elements in the catalyst are not leached out this confirms the excellent durability and stability of the catalytic cathode membrane 3 6 purification mechanistic insights and application prospects analysis more details on material characterizations of cathode membranes prior to and following system operation are presented in the supporting information pages s32 s33 as shown in fig 5 a rational pollutants removal mechanism was proposed the pollutants in cyanide wastewater are mainly cyanide organic matter and heavy metals the cyanide degradation can be achieved by two pathways â° clo cl2 oxidation and â± free radical oxidation oh so4 and rcs degradation pathway i is the oxidation of cn and release of co2 and n2 by secondary oxidation via strong oxides clo cl2 produced by electrooxidation at the ec anode eqs 6 10 degradation pathway ii is the oxidation of h2o2 produced by the 2e orr pathway via electrooxidation and so4 2 in seawater as an electrolyte to produce oh and so4 eqs 11 and 16 oh further oxidized the massive cl in seawater to produce rcs cl cl2 and clo eqs 18 23 these radicals can oxidize cn to n2 which is released in addition these radicals are interconvertible some of their reactions are reversible and they are easily decomposed and recycled both degradation pathways i and ii are effective at removing cyanide and there is a correlation between the two pathways due to the reactive conversion between clo cl2 and free radicals the organics degradation is ascribed to three factors â° the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms ii electrooxidation clo cl2 and free radicals and â² membrane filtration anaerobic microorganisms inoculated in the semr ec anode chamber could oxidize organic matter to generate protons and electrons eq 25 which then interacted with oxygen in the cathode chamber to undergo a 2e 4e orr reaction pathway â° eqs 11 13 pathway ii is the mineralization of organic matter by the oxidation of clo cl2 and free radicals to produce harmless small molecules co2 h2o etc additionally the catalytic cathode membrane filtration pathway â² could retain and remove macromolecular organic matter based on quenching experiments and epr tests cl and oh dominate the free radicals oxidative degradation of cn and organic matter 25 c 6 h 12 o 6 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 24 e 24 h the metal ions removal is ascribed to three mechanisms i electroreduction ii electroflocculation and iii membrane filtration metal ions m1 n obtained electrons on the cathode membrane surface and were reduced to metal monomers pathway â° note that m1 denotes electroreducible metal ions fe3 mg2 au3 and so on whereas n denotes the valence state of these metal ions the specific reaction mechanism was as follows eq 26 26 m 1 n n e m 1 precious metal gold existed in two valence states and the monovalent gold

adsorption between functional groups and metal ions were the removal mechanisms of metal ions particle size exclusion is assigned to the macromolecular metal ions m3 n retention by minor membrane pores moreover the carboxyl groups on the membrane surface are anionically coordinated with metal ions m4 n to form compounds meanwhile carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can facilitate the metal ions m4 n chemisorption liu et al 2019 song et al 2015 note that m3 denotes filterable macromolecular metal ions m4 denotes metal ions that can be coordinated to form compounds or be chemisorbed and n denotes the valence state of these metal ions a cost and benefit analysis are performed to validate the engineering application prospects details presented in the supporting information pages s36 s37

catalytic membrane seawater electro membrane reactor decyanation carbon removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the development of modern social industries gold is utilized extensively in jewelry electronics aerospace and other industries wang et al 2021 in the gold industry cyanidation is a cost effective method for extracting gold chen et al 2020 during the gold extraction procedure cyanide tailings ct containing cyanide and heavy metals are produced not only do simple storage landfilling and other physical treatments of ct harm the environment but they also squander resources realizing the reduction harmlessness and resource discharge of ct is crucial for the gold industry sustainable development as research continues ct can be efficiently processed by various methods since ct often exists in solid form calcination and flotation methods can achieve efficient degradation but at the expense of high energy consumption and cost compared to solid ct treatment various processes are available for the effective removal and recovery of ct specific contaminants cyanide organic pollutants and metal ions leached into the water the electrolytic cell ec can convert the electrical energy provided by the dc power supply into chemical energy via the redox reaction and has the great potential to simultaneously remove cyanide and recover heavy metals from cyanide tailing effluent however the electrolysis application to treat cyanide wastewater suffers from drawbacks including high energy consumption low organic pollutant treatment and heavy metal recovery efficiencies electro membrane reactors emr which combine the technical benefits of membrane reactors mr and microbial fuel cells mfc are extensively used in wastewater treatment due to their inherent energy production and excellent effluent quality however the cathode catalyst affects emr efficacy liu et al 2021 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the slower orr rate at the cathode surface results in electron accumulation due to the continuous transmission of electrons from the anode to the cathode li et al 2022 the high cost susceptibility to corrosion and biofouling of commercially available noble metal catalysts such as pt c impede its further industrial applications gao et al 2018b therefore it is essential to develop alternative non noble metal catalysts including carbon based materials and transition metal catalysts to increase the power output and facilitate contaminants degradation by enhancing the orr rate han and chen 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang and liu 2020 by combining emr and ec systems the emr ec system not only reduces energy consumption but also improves effluent quality with the advantage of good dispersibility and high specific surface area carbon based materials can serve as transition metal catalyst supports lilloja et al 2022 ratso et al 2017 as typical two dimensional carbon materials graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are frequently used as carriers for metal nanoparticles due to their high specific surface area numerous active sites and accessible electron pathways when heteroatoms or transition metal complexes are added to the graphene surface the surface unevenly distributed charges can be modified to obtain active centers graphene derived catalysts have tremendous potential for large scale emr applications by doping heteroatoms or transition metal complexes to enhance the orr rate pan et al prepared go tio2 zsm 5 composite photocatalysts by introducing go as an additional attachment site of the active site thereby enhancing the tio2 photocatalytic efficiency and achieving efficient photocatalytic degradation of cyanide wastewater pan et al 2022 previous research has demonstrated that hydrophilic nanoparticles can increase the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of membrane surfaces wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 the oxygen containing functional groups carboxyl groups etc on the go surface and the hydrophilic chemical bonds formed by metal nanoparticles on the membrane surface can both decrease contact angle ca and improve the hydrophilicity studies have demonstrated that transition metal atoms fe mn and so on and their oxides are alternative non noble metal catalysts due to their low cost superior redox properties and corrosion resistance gao et al 2022 tmos such as iron and manganese oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 etc have diverse chemical structures and highly specific surface areas allowing for heterogeneous reactions on catalyst surfaces wang et al 2015 the variable valence states of tmo enable them to have high mobility of oxygen in the oxide lattice thus stimulating excellent redox reactions ding et al 2020 gao et al 2018a saputra et al 2014 moreover the synergistic interactions between different active sites of heterojunction catalysts can improve the acidic orr kinetics tmos can cleave oo bond of h2o2 to generate oh or h2o and transition metal oxide heterojunctions tmohs can synergistically catalyze the reduction process thereby promoting the kinetics of acidic orr due to their poor electrical conductivity and strong aggregation tendency the performance and long term stability of tmohs are constrained the incorporation of conductive nanostructured supports reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotubes etc can disperse the tmohs produce more available active sites and increase conductivity to enhance the orr property in this study a novel carbon fiber based polyvinylidene fluoride catalytic electrode membrane pvdf rgo tfe mno2 with transition metal oxide heterojunction catalyst tmohc was developed and coupled with semr ec to treat cyanide wastewater the tmohc fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 was fabricated by the chemical synthesis method and the tmohccm was coated with tmohc by phase conversion method using rgo as the nanostructured conductive support to investigate the catalytic and pollutant removal mechanism of the semr ec system coupled with tmohccm for treating cyanide wastewater the following aspects were analyzed 1 the morphology and composition of the tmohc and tmohccm 2 the electrochemical characteristic of tmohccm and the catalytic orr mechanism of tmohc 3 the cyanide wastewater treatment property of the semr ec coupled with tmohccm 4 synergistic removal mechanism of various contaminants in cyanide wastewater and engineering application prospects of semr ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 tmohccm fabrication a detailed description of chemicals and membrane substrate pretreatment is presented in the supporting information page s4 the main difference between the three catalytic cathode membranes in this experiment is the distinct go mass fractions introduced to each membrane the names of pvdf rgo tfe mno2 membranes are derived from table s1 with the pvdf and rgo subscripts indicating membrane thickness and go addition respectively the different tmohccm was fabricated by using the above three casting solutions with different composition ratios and the specific preparation procedures were as follows go was synthesized by the improved method fig 1 a marcano et al 2010 first go was added to the conical flasks containing n n dimethyl formamide dmf according to the casting membrane solution ratio each conical flask was sonicated for 24 h to promote go dissolution in dmf pvdf 5 g and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp 1 g were then added into the conical flask and stirred for 24 h next the homogenous casting solution was prepared by adding reduced iron powder fe fe3o4 into the conical flask with constant stirring for 30 min after stirring the casting knife with the set thickness 300 400 Î¼m dispersed the casting solution on the pretreated carbon fiber cloth the coated membrane plates were quenched into di water to induce phase inversion and obtain pvdf go tfe membranes with various components the membranes were reduced by heating with hydriodic acid hi in a 100 c water bath for 2 min to convert go into rgo the reduced membrane was almost reddish brown and repeatedly was washed with di water until the washing water became transparent to facilitate the conversion of nano reduced iron into ferrous ions the membrane was infiltrated with 2 diluted hydrochloric acid hcl and washed repeatedly with di water finally the membrane was immersed for 24 h in 0 2 mol l 1 potassium permanganate kmno4 solution for further oxidation the pvdf rgo tfe mno2 catalytic cathode membranes with different composition ratios and distinct thicknesses were prepared by the same process 2 2 semr ec system operation more details on cyanide wastewater composition and semr ec system construction are found in the supporting

mgso4 5 85 mg l 1 entered the anode chamber during this period a continuous increase in the anode potential and system potential was observed in the data acquisition system the anode voltage and the system potential were stable after one month of acclimation a suitable resistance was then connected between the nail and cathode membrane to form a closed circuit the ec system is performed by connecting the carbon rod and cathode membrane to a dc power source the semr ec system operated in batch flow mode the nutrient solution was fed into the anode chamber and the cathode chamber was fed with cyanide wastewater due to the limited volume of the cathode chamber the membrane module cannot synchronize the membrane effluent therefore the cathode chamber effluent was collected and the membrane effluent was subjected to an additional membrane filtration procedure during the experiment the electricity generation effluent quality and other related parameters were continuously tested and evaluated at the end of the system operation the anti fouling and durability properties of the cathode membrane were analyzed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 material characterization the lmohccm

the projected augmented wave paw method was utilized to calculate core valence interactions integration of the brillouin zone was sampled using 3 3 1 monkhorst pack grid k points and a 500 ev plane wave expansion energy threshold to avoid periodic reactions vacuum space is 15 Ã¥ above surfaces energy and force convergence values were 1 10 4 ev and 0 02 ev Ã¥ 1 respectively for structural

organic carbon content of the cyanide wastewater was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc l japan the concentrations of cyanide cn and residual chlorine clo were monitored by uv vis spectrophotometer lh 3ba china the specific measurement method of cyanide and residual chlorine is isonicotinic acid barbituric acid spectrophotometry and dpd spectrophotometry respectively the iron fe concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 china various pollutant indicators are measured three times to take the average and make error bars more details of calculations are presented in the supporting information pages s10 s12 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and chemical composition of tmohccm a detailed description of go morphology is presented in the supporting information page s13 fig 1b c depicts the sem and pore size distribution images of pvdf300 and pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane exhibits a larger pore size 0 18 Î¼m and more uniform membrane pores than the control group on the one hand a larger specific surface area and more edge defects in go sheets as tmo carriers lead to increased membrane pores and pore size expansion the hi thermal reduction process on the other hand decreases the oxygen containing groups on the go surface increases the structural defects and increases the go specific surface area resulting in the expansion and dispersion of membrane pores in addition the crystalline particles observed on the membrane and go surface are identified as tmohc fig 1a and c based on the hrtem image of the rgo tfe mno2 catalyst this catalyst consists of three different tmos crystal planes linked by heterojunctions fig 1d consistent with the saed pattern the three crystal planes are the 221 crystal plane of fe2o3 the 311 crystal plane of fe3o4 and the 031 crystal plane of mno2 fig 1e more details on apparent resistance conductivity and wca of the tmohccm are found in the supporting information pages s15 s16 the ftir spectra of catalytic cathode membranes are shown in fig 1i several minor peaks between 2500 and 3400 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of oh groups a prominent peak around 2352 cm 1 is considered to be the o c o vibration and the peak around 1694 cm 1 is ascribed to the c o vibration in carboxylic groups the peaks around 670 865 and 1550 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of n h groups in the amino functional group while the peaks at 1104 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of the c n groups compared with the control the characteristic peaks intensity of o c o groups are augmented and the characteristic peaks of oxygen containing groups oh c o appeared on the surface of the modified cathode membrane the intensity of the characteristic peaks of oxygen containing groups oh o c o c o nh and cn increase and then decrease with increasing go addition indicating that the hydrophilicity variation reflected by the ca is determined by the amount of hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface the crystal structure of the tmohccm pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 was characterized by xrd fig 1j the diffraction peaks of the cathode membrane at 18 3 19 9 and 26 6 correspond to the 100 020 and 021 crystal planes of the Î± phase li et al 2013 martins et al 2014 the diffraction peaks at 32 2 35 5 43 and 53 5 are attributed to the 211 crystal planes of fe2o3 and the 311 400 and 422 crystal planes of fe3o4 pdf 04 0755 pdf 01 1111 fe3o4 is ascribed to two factors 1 the intrinsic fe3o4 in the reduced iron powder is introduced directly into the cathode membrane as a catalytic component and 2 the bare iron nanoparticles in reduced iron powder are readily oxidized due to prolonged air exposure the remaining diffraction peaks are characteristic peaks of mno2 pdf 14 0644 the xps spectra of pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 can reflect the elements characteristic peaks and chemical bonds the characteristic peaks of c 1 s o 1 s f 1 s mn 2p and fe 2p originates from the membrane components and catalytic fractions fig 1k indicating that they are dissolved in the casting solution and incorporated into the catalytic cathode membrane the splitting and fitting of the characteristic peaks of c 1 o 1 and f 1 s indicate that go is introduced into the membrane as the tmo carrier and coordinated with the membrane polymer elements to form chemical bonds fig 1k1 k3 however manganese is not introduced to the casting solution the mn 2p discovery on the membrane surface confirms that potassium permanganate is converted to manganese dioxide during membrane modification thereby becoming a catalytic component of the cathode membrane fig 1k4 the characteristic peaks of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 appear at 654 4 and 642 47 ev respectively and their binding energy difference is 11 93 ev in accordance with the two electron orbital data of mno2 gao et al 2018b the fe 2p characteristic peaks indicate that the iron oxide in the reduced iron powder is introduced as a catalytic component to the membrane surface and distributed uniformly fig 1k5 the material characterization results hrtem xrd and xps etc indicate the successful construction of catalytic structures on the membrane surface with go and rgo nanostructured conductive supports loaded with tmos fe2o3 fe3o4 and mno2 and connect in a heterojunction structure 3 2 tmohccm electrochemical activity the electrochemical properties of the tmohccm were investigated by cv eis lsv and tafel curves fig 2 a depicts the cv curves of cathode membranes with different go doping ratios and thicknesses at the same membrane thickness the addition of go increases the capacitance an extraordinary reduction peak fe3 mn4 reduction to fe2 mn3 0 37 v and a negligible oxidation peak fe2 mn3 oxidation to fe3 mn4 0 37 v are revealed by the cv curve of the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane this confirms the redox reaction of the internal transition metal ions of tmohc and indicates the superior electrocatalytic performance of the as prepared catalytic cathode during membrane modification more go sheets on the membrane surface are reduced and oxidized creating more active sites and facilitating electron transfer at 0 8 go addition the thinner the membrane the greater the capacitance and the more prominent the reduction peak thinner membranes can decrease the pvdf coverage on the conductive carrier go and rgo and catalytic components fe2o3 fe3o4 mno2 thereby exposing more active and catalytic sites and enhancing electron transfer and catalytic activity according to the cv curves analysis both pvdf rgo tfe mno2 catalytic cathode membranes exhibit better electrocatalytic properties which is attributed to two factors 1 structural changes in go and rgo as nanostructured conductive carriers during the modification process improve the membrane conductivity and 2 redox reactions caused by valence changes of transition metal ions within the tmohc enhance the catalytic activity the nyquist plot and the fitting resistance derived from the equivalent circuit of the cathode membranes are shown in fig 2b and table 1 respectively based on the arc radius in the nyquist plot the charge transfer resistance rct of all cathode membranes is low fig 2b which is conducive to rapid electron transfer according to the equivalent circuit the resistance mainly consists of the solution resistance rs and rct and the total resistance rt value is the sum of rs and rct from table 1 the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane has the lowest rt 38 1 Ï and the second lowest rct 4 02 Ï this is due to the go added to the membrane casting solution and the structural alterations that occur during membrane modification due to its low rct and rt the electrons in the semr ec system coupled with pvdf rgo tfe mno2 cathode membranes can be transferred to the cathode faster from the anode thus binding oxygen and accelerating orr to increase the power output the lsv curve and the fitting parameters based on the lsv curve are depicted in fig 2c the lsv curve can be regarded as a variation of the cv curve in the form of a half circle the lsv curve of pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membrane reveals an evident reduction peak indicating its superior electrochemical performance this is ascribed to the valence state variation of transition metal ions fe2 fe3 mn3 mn4 on the membrane surface during redox reactions gao et al 2018a 2018b logan et al 2006 compared with other cathode membranes pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane exhibits the steepest wave slope indicating the fastest electrochemical reaction rate gupta et al 2017 the onset potentials of all cathode membranes are approximately 0 79 0 8 v vs sce which is not significantly different however pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode has the largest limiting current 3 58 ma and a higher half wave potential 0 5 v vs sce indicating an excellent electrocatalytic property and a faster electrochemical reaction the electrocatalytic characteristic and electron transfer efficiency of cathode membranes was evaluated by tafel curves liang et al 2020 the greater the exchange current density and the tafel slope the quicker the electron transfer and the higher orr electrochemical activity the exchange current density and tafel slope of the cathode membranes fabricated under various conditions are irregular fig 2d compared to the control group pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 membrane cathode exhibits the highest exchange current density and steepest tafel slope indicating a more rapid electron transfer and exceptional catalytic orr activity more details of easa analysis are presented in the supporting information page s18 according to the above electrochemical analysis results the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode has excellent electrocatalytic properties and a quicker orr rate this is assigned to the high easa and conductivity provided by the conductive carriers of go and rgo as well as the catalytic redox properties resulting from the variable valence states of the transition metal ions 3 3 catalytic pathway analysis a detailed description of the catalytic mechanism is presented in the supporting information pages s19 s20 considering the neutral ph of cyanide wastewater the orr follows three pathways 1 a direct 4e pathway 2 a 2e pathway and 3 a 2 2e pathway eqs 3 5 due to its lower reduction potential compared to the 4e orr pathway and the lower power generation performance of the emr conventional tmos catalyzed orr follows the 2e orr pathway in this research emr and ec are combined to form the semr ec system due to its higher applied voltage the orr reaction of the single emr is dominated by the 2e orr pathway whereas the ec is dominated by the 4e orr pathway due to the coexistence of the catalyst prepared with the membrane polymer in this study the rrde measurement is impossible as demonstrated by theoretical analysis and subsequent hydroxyl radical oh generation in the quenching experiments the orr pathway of the semr ec system follows a coexisting 2e and 4e pathway the exceptional catalytic orr efficacy of the cathode membrane is assigned to the valence cycling of the transition metal redox couple in the redox reaction which facilitates electron transfer and decreased the orr reduction potential 3 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e r e d 1

the atomic sites was calculated by theoretical density functional theory dft fig 2g the local electron density in the atomic centers of tmohc relates directly to the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of orr when the tmohc acts as an active site its positive bader charge 72 e indicates that it obtained electrons and underwent reduction reactions as depicted in fig 2g the tmohc is a stacked structure composed of three tmos including fe2o3 fe3o4 and mno2 connect by heterojunctions as individual active sites the three tmos exhibit different redox properties the positive bader charges of fe2o3 1 08 e and mno2 74 96 e indicate that they performed reduction reactions with elevated charge density when acted as an active site as active sites the negative bader charge of fe3o4 4 04 e indicates that electrons were lost and oxidized the bader charges of iron and manganese atomic centers were negative and positive respectively this indicates that oxidation and reduction processes occurred when the respective atomic centers were used as active sites briefly the synthesized tmohc in this study is dominated by reduction reactions when they act as active sites while orr and heavy metal ions reduction processes predominate around the mno2 crystal planes moreover the negligible oxidation peaks in the cv curves are attributed to the lower bader charge 4 04 e of the fe3o4 crystal plane 3 4 orthogonal experiment of the current density membrane area and catalytic cathode membranes on cyanide wastewater treatment since the removal of pollutants cyanide organic matter heavy metals from cyanide wastewater is related to oxidation and reduction in the semr ec system the current density of the ec affects the cyanide wastewater treatment efficacy to gain insight into the effect of different current densities 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 on the pollutant degradation efficiency three parallel semr ec systems were run with the pvdf300 rgo0 8 tfe mno2 cathode membranes of the same membrane area 1 7 cm2 the cn removal efficiency is 27 3 100 and 21 5 in 60 min at respective current densities of 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 fig 3 a this can be explained by two oxidative degradation pathways of cn by the semr ec system i clo cl2 oxidation and â± free radical oxidation the reaction mechanism of cn degradation pathway i is as follows 6 c l 2 e c l 2 7 c l 2 h 2 o h c l

degradation according to eqs 6 10 cl oxidation produced chlorine cl2 which reacted with water h2o to form hypochlorous acid clo clo as a strong oxidant first oxidized cn to produce cyanate cno and then oxidized cno to release nitrogen n2 and carbon dioxide co2 and finally formed cl to complete the cl cycle the yields of clo and cl2 are measured by spectrophotometer see supporting information page s22 for more details furthermore the oxidation of free radicals performs a crucial role in the cn degradation process the reaction mechanism of cn degradation pathway ii is as follows eqs 11 13 11 m s u r f a c e n h 2 o 2 m s u r f a c e n 1 o h o h 12 m s u r f a c e n 1 h 2 o 2 m s u r f a c e n o o h h 13 m s u r f a c e n o h m s u r f a c e n 1 o h note that msurface denotes surface transition metal atoms fe mn h2o2 generated by the 2e orr reaction reacted with the transition metal atoms on the membrane surface to produce hydroxyl radicals oh with strong oxidizing properties which could oxidize cn to n2 this process facilitates both the catalytic recycling of transition metal atoms and quenching oh by adjacent transition metal atoms compared to the control group the voltage corresponding to 10 ma cm 2 produces more oh which oxidizes cn effectively apart from cyanide the impact of different current densities on the organic contaminants toc removal efficiency was analyzed the maximum toc removal efficacies at 5 10 and 20 ma cm 2 within 12 h are 53 7 88 5 and 69 5 respectively fig 3c this difference is ascribed to two types of strong oxides produced by anodic oxidation in the ec 1 clo cl2 and 2 free radicals both of them react rapidly and non selectively with organic pollutants resulting in their overall mineralization into harmless small molecules co2 h2o etc table 2 to investigate the impact of different current densities on fe iii reduction the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic model were used to explore the fe iii reduction kinetics the fitting degree and correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo first order model for fe iii reduction kinetic are greater than those obtained from the pseudo second order model fig 3d and table 3 this suggests that the fe iii reduction process is in accordance with the pseudo first order model according to the fitting results of the pseudo first order model the order of rate constants is 0 18 h 1 10 ma cm 2 0 07 h 1 20 ma cm 2 0 066 h 1 5 ma cm 2 the maximum rate constant at 10 ma cm 2 is attributed to two factors 1 the voltage corresponding to a 10 ma cm 2 current density generates more oh and consumes more iron ions and 2 the voltage corresponding to 10 ma cm 2 is larger and closer to the iron reduction potential for efficient fe iii reduction due to the oxygen reduction potential being greater than the iron reduction potential eqs 3 and 14 15 the orr occurs readily as the current density increases inhibiting the fe iii reduction process previous research has demonstrated that the self sustained micro electric field of an emr system is more effective at removing heavy metals than the applied voltage cui et al 2022 given the correlation between fe iii reduction and current density in this study however the oxidation and reduction of the ec system rather than the emr system dominate fe iii removal 14 f e 3 e f e 2 e 0 77 v 15 f e 2 2 e f e e

et al 2017 not only are excessive water molecules sulfate ions so4 2 and cl in seawater involved in the reactions between oxidizing substances but they also contribute to pollutant removal by forming reactive radicals the contaminants removal mechanism of the semr ec system was explored by quenching experiment quenchers for oh sulfate radicals so4 and reactive chlorine species rcs were added to the system and cn removal efficiency rate constant k and clo yield were calculated 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmb shows a negligible effect on cn removal and the rate constant indicating a low content of clo cn removal is significantly inhibited by the presence of nitrobenzene nb methanol meoh tert butanol tba and benzoic acid ba fig 4 a b specifically the addition of 10 mm nb decreases the removal efficiency and rate constant of cn within 40 min by 89 57 and 96 35 respectively this indicates the crucial function of oh on cn removal similar effects of meoh and ba are observed on cn removal rates confirming the existence of so4 and cl2 similar inhibition of cn removal efficiency is observed in both nb and tba demonstrating the cl presence in rcs based on the above results oh and rcs cl cl2 clo are dominant in cn degradation while so4 plays a minor role several of the above free radicals including oh so4 and rcs can be generated by the following reaction mechanisms eqs 11 and 16 230 16 s o 4

to the removal efficacy and rate constant of cn the influence of the various quenchers on the clo yield was also explored the clo concentration in the systems with tba and ba is inferior to the control whereas the clo yield of nb meoh and dmb systems is higher than the control fig 4c this is explained by the following reactions 24 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o c l h e as quenchers for oh so4 cl nb meoh and dmb and clo can inhibit the production of these free radicals disrupt the reaction pathway eqs 18 and 22 23 and decrease the clo consumption tba and ba as quenchers for oh so4 cl cl2 and clo inhibit the reaction mechanism and prevented the formation of clo eqs 18 and 19 210 24 scavengers including dmpo and tempo were used to capture oh so4 and rcs cl cl2 and clo during the semr ec system operation a signal intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for dmpo oh and a concomitant peak of dmpo so4 are observed indicating the existence of oh and so4 in the electrooxidation process in the ec fig 4d the tempocl signal is captured during electrolysis confirming the cl formation moreover no cl2 and clo signal is found in the epr test which is assigned to the transient nature and the lack of the standard cl2 and clo signals according to the intensity of the free radical signal in the epr test the order of the free radical amount is clo oh so4 this indicates that clo and oh dominate the cn degradation process while so4 plays a secondary role based on reaction rate constants of free radicals the quenching experiments and epr tests confirm the free radicals oh so4 and rcs production during the operation of the semr ec system this not only enriches the pollutants cn toc and so on degradation pathways but also provides novel ideas for the remediation of refractory organic wastewater more details on flux and anti fouling properties are found in the supporting information pages s29 s30 during the semr ec operation the durability of the tmohccm was also evaluated the iron concentration decreases and the manganese is not detected in cyanide wastewater after system operation indicating that the transition metal elements in the catalyst are not leached out this confirms the excellent durability and stability of the catalytic cathode membrane 3 6 purification mechanistic insights and application prospects analysis more details on material characterizations of cathode membranes prior to and following system operation are presented in the supporting information pages s32 s33 as shown in fig 5 a rational pollutants removal mechanism was proposed the pollutants in cyanide wastewater are mainly cyanide organic matter and heavy metals the cyanide degradation can be achieved by two pathways â° clo cl2 oxidation and â± free radical oxidation oh so4 and rcs degradation pathway i is the oxidation of cn and release of co2 and n2 by secondary oxidation via strong oxides clo cl2 produced by electrooxidation at the ec anode eqs 6 10 degradation pathway ii is the oxidation of h2o2 produced by the 2e orr pathway via electrooxidation and so4 2 in seawater as an electrolyte to produce oh and so4 eqs 11 and 16 oh further oxidized the massive cl in seawater to produce rcs cl cl2 and clo eqs 18 23 these radicals can oxidize cn to n2 which is released in addition these radicals are interconvertible some of their reactions are reversible and they are easily decomposed and recycled both degradation pathways i and ii are effective at removing cyanide and there is a correlation between the two pathways due to the reactive conversion between clo cl2 and free radicals the organics degradation is ascribed to three factors â° the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms ii electrooxidation clo cl2 and free radicals and â² membrane filtration anaerobic microorganisms inoculated in the semr ec anode chamber could oxidize organic matter to generate protons and electrons eq 25 which then interacted with oxygen in the cathode chamber to undergo a 2e 4e orr reaction pathway â° eqs 11 13 pathway ii is the mineralization of organic matter by the oxidation of clo cl2 and free radicals to produce harmless small molecules co2 h2o etc additionally the catalytic cathode membrane filtration pathway â² could retain and remove macromolecular organic matter based on quenching experiments and epr tests cl and oh dominate the free radicals oxidative degradation of cn and organic matter 25 c 6 h 12 o 6 6 h 2 o 6 c o 2 24 e 24 h the metal ions removal is ascribed to three mechanisms i electroreduction ii electroflocculation and iii membrane

adsorption between functional groups and metal ions were the removal mechanisms of metal ions particle size exclusion is assigned to the macromolecular metal ions m3 n retention by minor membrane pores moreover the carboxyl groups on the membrane surface are anionically coordinated with metal ions m4 n to form compounds meanwhile carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can facilitate the metal ions m4 n chemisorption liu et al 2019 song et al 2015 note that m3 denotes filterable macromolecular metal ions m4 denotes metal ions that can be coordinated to form compounds or be chemisorbed and n

14676,rapid pathogen detection in food and agricultural water is essential for ensuring food safety and public health however complex and noisy environmental background matrices delay the identification of pathogens and require highly trained personnel here we present an ai biosensing framework for accelerated and automated pathogen detection in various water samples from liquid food to agricultural water a deep learning model was used to identify and quantify target bacteria based on their microscopic patterns generated by specific interactions with bacteriophages the model was trained on augmented datasets to maximize data efficiency using input images of selected bacterial species and then fine tuned on a mixed culture model inference was performed on real world water samples containing environmental noises unseen during model training overall our ai model trained solely on lab cultured bacteria achieved rapid 5 5 h prediction with 80 100 accuracy on the real world water samples demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen data our study highlights the potential applications in microbial water quality monitoring during food and agricultural processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pathogen detection biosensing deep learning data augmentation water safety 1 introduction food and agricultural processes require large quantities of water which is a major transmission source of pathogenic disease outbreaks mehle and ravnikar 2012 weller et al 2020 the centers for diseases control and prevention reports that approximately 48 million people in the united states get sick from foodborne illnesses annually which causes an economic burden of over 15 5 billion including costs of medical treatment productivity loss and death centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2018 hoffmann et al 2015 among the various products linked to foodborne outbreaks fresh produce is a leading contributor painter et al 2013 with agricultural water playing a significant role in its contamination julien javaux et al 2019 malakar et al 2019 in addition the consumption of contaminated water and liquid foods represents another critical concern in outbreaks cabral 2010 jha et al 2016 therefore rapid detection and monitoring of pathogenic bacteria in food and agricultural water are critical to ensuring food safety food security and public health hoorfar 2011 law et al 2014 moreover the expansion in the global trade of food and agricultural commodities further emphasizes the significance of pathogen detection in addition to process control board for international food and agricultural development bifad et al 2019 hoorfar 2011 thus the accelerated detection of pathogenic bacteria in food and agricultural systems is essential to enhance public health and reduce economic loss however conventional culture based methods are limited in providing timely detection taking several days to get the results cho and ku 2017 zeng et al 2016 to accelerate this slow process various studies have investigated the application of molecular biology based assays to detect pathogenic bacteria in food samples cho and ku 2017 draz and lu 2016 lungu et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 examples of such molecular methods include nucleic acid based detection such as polymerase chain reaction pcr cho and ku 2017 lungu et al 2012 and loop mediated isothermal amplification draz and lu 2016 yet these methods require advanced technical skills extensive capital cost on devices and laboratory environment and expensive reagents and test kits cho and ku 2017 zeng et al 2016 moreover complex food matrices can further challenge the isolation of nucleic acids or inhibit amplification zeng et al 2016 in addition the detection limits of viable bacteria using these methods are in the range of 102 103 cfu ml or g of food samples after enrichment for at least 5 8 h zeng et al 2016 enzyme linked immunoassay elisa is another example of a molecular method and has been applied in the food industry for its rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria huang et al 2019 law et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 however it also requires a high cost while achieving relatively low sensitivity and cannot distinguish between live and dead bacterial cells law et al 2014 liu et al 2016 such challenges in cost labor and performance against food samples i e low specificity or sensitivity without additional sample preparation have been barriers to implementing advanced diagnostic tools in the food industry complementary to molecular methods the biosensing approach using lytic bacteriophages or phages has also been evaluated for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria brovko et al 2012 paczesny et al 2020 singh et al 2013 these phages can create specific changes in microscopic features of viable target cells in a mixed community of bacteria brovko et al 2012 paczesny et al 2020 singh et al 2013 our previous studies demonstrated rapid specific and sensitive detection of bacteria based on these changes in cell morphology and other optical properties upon phage infection wisuthiphaet et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however this phage based optical biosensing still relies on a well trained workforce and time for image analysis and identification of such optical changes could be limited to simplified monoculture systems to address the challenges in the human operated analysis of sensing data artificial intelligence ai has been combined with microbial image analysis in various studies balagurusamy et al 2019 cui et al 2020 hoorali et al 2020 jin et al 2020 joy et al 2021 kang et al 2020 2021 lasch et al 2018 petitte et al 2019 talo 2019 umar ibrahim et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zieliÅski et al 2017 machine learning and deep learning have been increasingly used in microbial counting especially since 2015 due to the steep growth and development of deep learning algorithms for image segmentation zhang et al 2021a similarly machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been applied to image analysis to classify pathogens in lab based mono or mixed cultures balagurusamy et al 2019 hoorali et al 2020 kang et al 2021 2020 lasch et al 2018 petitte et al 2019 talo 2019 zhang et al 2021b zieliÅski et al 2017 or biosensing for healthcare diagnostics cui et al 2020 jin et al 2020 umar ibrahim et al 2021 these approaches can accelerate and automate image analysis and also improve specificity by pattern recognition and sensitivity by object detection using a convolutional neural network cnn on well defined lab cultured datasets cui et al 2020 thus this study aimed to develop an ai biosensing framework for rapid pathogen detection via phage induced lysis and evaluate its performance on real world water samples with environmental background noise the workflow of this ai biosensing framework is illustrated in the graphical abstract where microscopic images of bacteria were acquired after adding phages to obtain specific patterns of phage induced lysis of target bacteria and analyzed using a cnn object detection model as shown in fig 1 input images were augmented to maximize data efficiency by increasing the variance of train datasets in addition to the target bacteria i e escherichia coli the images of selected non target bacteria i e listeria innocua bacillus subtilis pseudomonas fluorescens were also included in the training dataset to allow the deep learning algorithm to learn distinct features of phage induced lysis compared to microbial background noise then the model trained solely on these lab cultured datasets was used to identify and quantify target bacteria in the real world water samples with background noises unseen during model training here we designed the model training pipeline to optimize the generalizability of the ai model to unseen data that have never been exposed to the model and therefore the need for extensive site specific data generation can be minimized for future applications in this way we could also facilitate the image annotation procedure by reducing the expertise needed to label the images overall this study illustrates the potential of an ai biosensing framework for rapid pathogen detection in liquid food and agricultural water without extensive human and laboratory resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 liquid food and agricultural water sample preparation to introduce unseen background noise created by food and environmental factors coconut water simulated spinach wash water and irrigation water samples were collected coconut water vita coco 100 coconut water was purchased from a local grocery store simulated spinach wash water was prepared by blending pre washed ready to eat baby spinach leaves purchased from a local grocery store with sterile milli q water with a ratio of 1 10wt vol using a sanitized blender osterizer 6706 oster co milwaukee wi usa the mixture was blended twice for 30 s at maximum speed the blended solution was transferred to sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was collected before another centrifugation cycle with the same condition the final supernatant was collected as a simulated spinach wash water sample the irrigation water sample used in this study was collected from the campbell tract at the university of california davis which is the solano county district agricultural irrigation water prior to inoculation we confirmed no presence of e coli in all the water samples by plate counting assay see supplementary information before t7 phage infection 5 ml of coconut water or spinach wash water was mixed with 5 ml of double concentrated tryptic soy broth sigma aldrich st louis mo usa similarly 5 ml of irrigation water was mixed with 5 ml of double concentrated ec broth neogen lansing mi usa a selective medium that isolates e coli and coliforms from food and water samples the mixtures were then inoculated with e coli bl21 at concentrations of 10 103 cfu ml and subjected to bacterial enrichment at 37 c with constant shaking at 200 rpm for 4 h t7 phage 106 pfu ml was then added to the 4h enriched mixtures and incubated at 37 c for 30 min for the negative controls samples without e coli inoculation were used after this phage infection bacterial cells were collected by filtration and the fluorescence images were acquired as described in section 2 2 2 2 imaging pre processing and annotation after bacterial enrichment and phage infection see supplementary information 100 Âµl of the solution was filtered through a 0 2 Âµm pore size whatman anodisc inorganic filter membrane with a 13 mm diameter ge healthcare buckinghamshire uk and allowed to stand for 2 3 min the filter was placed backside down on a 20 Âµl droplet of sybr green i nucleic acid stain 10 concentrate invitrogen carlsbad ca usa on a glass slide and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min the excess sybr green was removed by gently rubbing the backside of the filter using a kimwipe the stained filter was then placed on a new glass slide a 20 Âµl of 1 of p phenylenediamine acros organic fair lawn nj usa was dropped on the filter and covered with a glass coverslip the filter was observed under an olympus ix 71 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 100 magnification 1 25 na objective lens a ccd charge coupled device camera model c4742 80 12ag hamamatsu tokyo japan and the metamorph imaging software version 7 7 2 0 universal imaging corporation the fluorescence excitation emission wavelength of the sybr green i stain was 480 30 and 535 40 nm respectively an average of 10 12 images were taken from different regions of each filter for every sample and at least 5 biological replicates were used per sample our training datasets consisted of 60 77 and 43 images for the e coli monoculture at concentrations of 10 102 and 103 cfu ml respectively the testing datasets included 114 125 and 164 images obtained for coconut water spinach wash water and irrigation water samples respectively notably we utilized an object detection model enabling our ai model to detect and analyze multiple instances of target e coli cells within each image this approach provided valuable and diverse information complementing the number of image replicates available for analysis the image processing software imagej schneider et al 2012 was used to convert the acquired fluorescence image files format from tiff into jpg these microscopic images of 1344 1024 pixels were then resized to 1024 1024 pixels and normalized by taking the maximum and minimum values in each image with lysed e coli particles appeared as round shapes with a diffused distribution of released dna due to cell lysis for ground truth gt annotations of e coli counts in the input images expert classification was conducted by a trained food microbiologist following the methods described in our previous study yang et al 2020 briefly e coli cells were characterized based on morphological features e g area eccentricity and full width at half maximum to detect them among background signals sybr green labeling enhanced bacterial detection specificity by indicating nucleic acid presence within this distinct morphology while the diffuse distribution of the fluorescence signal was used to detect phage induced lysis of e coli our prior optimization of phage to bacteria ratio and incubation time further improved the reliability of gt annotations for lysed e coli ensuring accurate dataset annotations using this approach keypoint annotations were assigned to the center of released dna signals of lysed e coli using an open source computer vision annotation tool cvat developed by intel https github com openvinotoolkit cvat these keypoint annotations were exported in xml format and gt bounding boxes were generated from these keypoint annotations by creating square boxes with a length of 40 pixels 2 3 model architecture and training details all models were trained using the pytorch library in python paszke et al 2019 with a faster r cnn model pre trained on large datasets including imagenet ms coco train2017 ren et al 2017 and the 2020 global wheat detection datasets david et al 2020 the models were trained for 300 epochs and the anchor sizes of 5 10 20 25 and 35 pixels were used input image intensities were converted to 32 bit float values and normalized between 0 and 1 using their minimum and maximum intensity data augmentation was performed to increase the size of train datasets by flipping rotating and randomly varying brightness and contrast a stochastic gradient descent optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0 0001 weight decay of 0 0005 and a momentum of 0 9 for model optimization using e coli monoculture test dataset we split the e coli monoculture dataset into 70 15 15 train validation and test splits and the model was trained on these train and validation datasets to perform model inference and evaluation on the unseen real world water test dataset which had not been previously exposed to the ai model during training the model was trained on two different combinations of lab cultured bacteria exposed to t7 phages i train a and ii train b datasets see section 3 1 in the case of the train a dataset e coli only we split the e coli monoculture dataset into 85 15 train and validation splits and these datasets were used for training similarly we split each dataset into 85 15 train and validation splits for the train b dataset multiple species 2 4 evaluation of model performance the model performance in quantitative inference was examined based on the observed predicted plot for e coli counts for this predicted e coli counts in each test image were plotted against observed e coli counts obtained from gt annotations and linear regression was applied the slope of this linear regression line and its r 2 and root mean square error rmse values were used as evaluation metrics moreover the 95 prediction interval and 95 prediction thresholds for a zero count and true non zero counts were shown in the observed predicted plot the 95 prediction interval was obtained using the ordinary least squares function of the statsmodels api python library and the 95 prediction thresholds were obtained from intersections between the 95 prediction interval and axes see fig 3 a moreover the accuracy of zero count prediction was calculated as follows where the positive or negative was defined based on the image level presence of e coli i e non zero or zero counts respectively furthermore a probability density plot was generated to establish a relationship between the predicted e coli counts in the input images post enrichment and the initial bacterial loads in water samples the probability density plot was generated using the kernel density estimation function of the pandas python library and the 95 true non zero prediction zone was displayed over this density plot this shows the model performance on prediction for different initial e coli loads in each test sample in addition to the evaluation metrics on the data side of model performance the sensing based model performance was also examined in terms of the assay time and detection limit these two metrics were experimentally measured and compared with conventional methods such as plate counting assay and real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr see supplementary information 3 results 3 1 microscopic image datasets obtained using t7 phage for model training fluorescence microscopic images of bacteria exposed to t7 phages were used along with their gt annotations to enable fluorescence imaging bacteria were labeled with sybr green dna specific stain during incubation t7 phages fig 2 a were added to our target e coli fig 2 b or other non target bacterial species including l innocua b subtilis and p fluorescens these bacterial species were chosen as they occur commonly in food while having distinct morphological features fig 2 c e and not being lysed by t7 phages in contrast when t7 phages were added to e coli monoculture fig 2 f h or a mixture of the selected four bacterial species fig 2 i the phages induced changes in microscopic features specific to their target e coli to obtain a gt bounding box keypoint annotation was given to an approximate center point of a lysed e coli cell gt bounding boxes were then generated by expanding the keypoint annotations into 40 px by 40 px boxes the model was trained on two different combinations of lab cultured bacteria exposed to t7 phages i train a dataset where the model was trained solely on e coli monoculture fig 2 f h or ii train b dataset where the model was trained on a concatenated monoculture datasets of e coli and selected non e coli bacteria fig 2 c h and then fine tuned on the lab based mixed culture of all four bacterial species fig i in total 180 images of e coli monoculture at different concentrations 10 102 103 cfu ml 57 images of selected non e coli bacteria and 105 images of the lab based mixed culture were used for model training and validation sets the variance of the train dataset was further increased using the set of data augmentations including flip rotation and random variations of brightness and contrast see section 2 3 importantly the model was only exposed to lab cultured datasets during training and not the real world water samples 3 2 deep convolutional neural network for identification of lysed e coli in this study faster r cnn ren et al 2017 was chosen as an object detection model and trained to visually distinguish dna signals belonging to lysed e coli cells from the background or non e coli bacteria the target dna signals of lysed e coli cells were mapped to 1 and others were mapped to 0 here we did not further distinguish between background and other bacterial cells since the non e coli bacteria selected in this study were only a few examples that could be found in food and the goal of this ai biosensing framework was to detect e coli among them to evaluate the model performance on predicting lysed e coli in a monoculture test datasets were obtained in a controlled laboratory setting commonly used for conventional culture based microbial analysis i e lab cultured in this case the e coli monoculture dataset was split into three subsets i e train validation and test datasets and the test dataset was not included during model training so that the model prediction could be evaluated on unseen data as shown in fig 3 a the model performance on quantification was evaluated by the observed predicted plot for e coli counts per test image this observed predicted plot resulted in a slope of 1 07 r 2 0 99 showing a good match between gt annotations and prediction given the observed e coli counts ranging between 1 and 52 the rmse of the prediction was 2 7 for a zero count i e absence of e coli in a given image a 95 prediction threshold was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 8 in contrast a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts i e presence of e coli in a given image was achieved at predicted e coli counts 4 6 such results shown in fig 3 a were generated using an optimal confidence score threshold which was determined based on the evaluation metrics of the observed predicted plot the confidence score is a hyperparameter used in faster r cnn that represents the probability of an object i e lysed e coli being present in each bounding box during model inference in this study the confidence score threshold of 0 4 was chosen as it resulted in the minimum rmse of 2 7 while giving a slope and r 2 close to 1 was selected as an optimal value fig 3 b this chosen value was further used for model inference on the selected real world water samples with this optimal threshold value the observed and predicted bounding boxes were also displayed on the example e coli monoculture test images fig 3 c overall the model successfully predicted bounding boxes associated with the visible dna signals of lysed e coli cells and the results matched gt annotations for all three different levels of initial e coli loads 3 3 comparison to other conventional pathogen detection methods the efficiency of our ai biosensing framework was compared to conventional pathogen detection methods by evaluating the assay time and detection limit the plate counting assay required 16 h to get the results for the e coli monoculture with this method the lowest possible bacterial count was obtained for an e coli suspension of 1 cfu ml in contrast rt qpcr reduced the assay time to 6 h including the enrichment step of 4 h and the lowest possible bacterial count for the irrigation water sample was 103 cfu ml therefore for the same assay time the ai biosensing framework could improve the detection of e coli using phage induced lysis with a detection limit of 10 cfu ml 3 4 application for e coli detection in unseen liquid food and agricultural water using the model optimized on e coli monoculture datasets we also evaluated model inference on real world water samples that had not been previously exposed to the ai model during training referred to as unseen samples while e coli monoculture was a lab cultured dataset with relatively low noise the selected real world water samples had more complex backgrounds and other commensal microbes that introduced noise that was not present during model training for this investigation the test datasets were divided into two groups based on the complexity of their background noise sources i coconut water and simulated spinach wash water samples provided background noise originating from organic debris of food components and here the model trained on the train a dataset e coli only was used ii irrigation water samples on the other hand provided additional background noise from commensal microbes thus selective media was used during the enrichment step to suppress the growth of non e coli bacteria see section 2 1 in this case the model trained on the train b dataset m species was explored in addition to the model trained on the train a dataset the results in fig 4 a show the example coconut water sample images and their respective observed and predicted bounding boxes the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification fig 4 b had a slope of 0 88 with an r 2 value of 0 96 the observed e coli counts ranged between 0 and 39 while the rmse value of the prediction was 1 91 for this sample a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 0 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 1 00 in 114 images moreover a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 3 5 and this non zero prediction zone was displayed over the density plot of predicted e coli counts fig 4 c to show the prediction performance at different initial e coli loads here 0 14 of the total test images with a lower e coli load 10 cfu ml were within this 95 true non zero prediction zone while 0 85 of the total test images with a higher e coli load 102 103 cfu ml were covered by this zone similarly the results in fig 4 d show the example spinach wash water sample images with their respective observed and predicted bounding boxes the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification fig 4 e had a slope of 0 93 with an r 2 value of 0 81 the observed e coli counts for the spinach wash water ranged between 0 and 16while its rmse value of the prediction was 1 5 for this sample a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 2 6 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 0 95 in 125 images in addition a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 3 4 and the results in fig 4 f show the non zero prediction zone over the density plot of predicted e coli counts with different initial e coli loads in this case 0 20 and 0 88 of the total test images with a lower and higher e coli load were covered by the 95 true non zero prediction zone respectively overall the model trained solely on e coli or the train a dataset resulted in a highly accurate prediction of lysed e coli in the coconut water and spinach wash water samples however for the much noisier irrigation water samples the model trained on the train a dataset e coli only resulted in a less accurate prediction on fig 5 a c the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification had a slope of 0 77 with a lower r 2 value of 0 58 moreover the prediction resulted in a high rmse of 20 7 while the observed e coli counts ranged between 0 and 45 as shown from the input images in fig 5 a and supplementary fig s2a the use of selective media during the enrichment step effectively suppressed the growth of non e coli bacteria consequently this improved the model performance in quantifying e coli counts in a given image supplementary fig s2b in this case the gt predicted plot had a slope of 0 84 with a higher r 2 value of 0 76 and rmse was reduced to 4 0 with the observed data ranging between 0 and 19 in contrast the model trained using the train b dataset m species performed even better with the irrigation water samples fig 5 d f especially with the aid of selective enrichment media as shown in fig 5 e this model resulted in the observed predicted plot with a slope of 0 91 r 2 0 87 and rmse was further reduced to 1 9 with the observed data ranging between 0 and 19 in this case a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 2 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 0 80 in 164 images further a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 4 2 and the results in fig 5 f show the non zero prediction zone over the density plot of predicted e coli counts with different initial e coli loads here 0 04 and 0 88 of the total test images with a lower and higher e coli load were covered by the 95 true non zero prediction zone respectively 4 discussion in this study we present an ai biosensing framework for the rapid identification and quantification of viable pathogens via phage induced lysis in liquid food and agricultural water this approach not only enables accelerated and automated pathogen detection using ai enabled data analysis but also provides accurate detection of target e coli at low concentrations amidst diverse background noise using a biosensing approach in addition by designing the model training pipeline to include selected species of lab cultured non target bacteria the generalizability of the ai model to real world water samples with unseen environmental background noise was demonstrated in our previous study of phage based biosensing for e coli detection data analysis was human engineered based on the average calculation of selected optical properties of a target e coli cell yang et al 2020 this approach was limited for practical application since i only a few features were selected manually by human intervention ii data analysis relies on well trained personnel and is time intensive and iii the method could only apply to well controlled samples like e coli monoculture without background noise in contrast the present ai enabled data analysis enables a full exploration of image features accelerates and automates the detection 5 5 h including bacterial enrichment less than a single work shift and can be applied to real world water samples with complex backgrounds moreover the detection limit of our ai biosensing framework was 10 cfu ml fig 3 in comparison it has been reported in the literature that qpcr methods can quantify e coli concentrations in irrigation water xie et al 2019 and environmental water for 10 cfu ml walker et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 thus we concluded that the detection limit of our ai biosensing framework is comparable to that of rt pcr overall these results show the potential of our ai biosensing framework in accurately detecting pathogens at various concentrations in water resources even in the presence of environmental background matrices the findings of this study complement the previous efforts in integrating ai with biosensing technologies advancing the model performance in the presence of environmental and biological background matrices previous studies have shown that the application of ai in biosensing can significantly improve accuracy and speed by reducing the limitations of human operational skills and errors zhang et al 2021a accordingly researchers have developed ai enabled technologies for rapid identification and quantification of pathogenic bacteria in different background matrices based on spectroscopy microscopy colorimetry microfluidic analysis and other imaging methods table 1 however these methods focused on simplified well controlled tasks such as single cell classification balagurusamy et al 2019 ho et al 2019 kang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 model prediction on monoculture datasets gunda et al 2019 hoorali et al 2020 khan et al 2021 lasch et al 2018 talo 2019 zieliÅski et al 2017 or mixed culture datasets obtained with minimal background noise petitte et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the case of studies performed on mixed culture datasets with real world environmental samples field water and wastewater the model prediction accuracy was compromised on a mixed culture kim et al 2021 or only a qualitative prediction was available li et al 2020 to this our ai biosensing framework introduced biospecificity of phages to improve model performance against complex background noise the use of phages generated target specific patterns that are distinguishable against other biobased background noise originating from food debris organic matter and commensal microbes enabling rapid detection of e coli figs 4 and 5 in addition our presentation of the results in figs 4 c f 5 c and f provides a connection between the model prediction on images and the physical bacterial concentrations of test water samples we presented the probability density plot for predicted e coli counts where the 95 true non zero prediction threshold was given as a criterion value and the area under the curve to the right of this criterion value a non zero was calculated this a non zero indicates the probability of the non zero counts obtained by model inference falling into a 95 prediction interval for each bacterial concentration i e 10 or 102 3 cfu ml with the best model being used fig 4 c f and 5 f a non zero for the real world water samples with 102 3 cfu ml of e coli ranged between 0 85 and 0 88 however lower a non zero values were 0 20 acquired for the water samples with 10 cfu ml of e coli considering a smaller size of e coli i e a cylinder 1 0 2 0 Âµm long with a radius about 0 5 Âµm national research council 1999 compared to the imaging area of 84 64 Âµm this could be due to the statistical sampling effect of partial imaging of the sample and potential heterogeneity in bacterial distribution thus future studies may obtain full stitched wide field microscopic images to further improve model performance for a lower bacterial concentration overall this approach of connecting the imaging data and physical bacterial concentration of test samples could be suggested for future studies to compare model performance across diverse real world samples the model performance results were sample specific depending on the sources of background noise in the case of less noisy water samples such as coconut water and spinach wash water the major sources of background noise were food debris and organic matter since these selected water samples were commercially processed in advance to reduce commensal microbes their background noise patterns did not have an intense signal that microbial dna would generate yet the complexity of background noise from food debris and organic matter traditionally required time and labor consuming isolation of target bacteria or chemical preparation steps zeng et al 2016 moreover food and environmental samples may contain pcr inhibitors so that molecular methods may not work in those cases schrader et al 2012 in contrast phage induced lysis enhanced the identification of target bacteria without such bacterial isolation or chemical preparation steps as a result model inference was performed with high accuracy of 95 100 on these unseen real world water samples by using the model trained solely on e coli monoculture fig 4 on the other hand the noisier irrigation water sample we collected was rich in commensal microbes and this imposed additional complexity on model inference the bacterial profile of this irrigation water sample was assessed through a plate counting assay using selective media which confirmed a high concentration of naturally occurring gram negative bacteria supplementary table s1 these bacterial species can contribute to the dna type background noise exhibiting similarities to that of e coli the use of selective media during enrichment suppressed the growth of such non e coli dna signals allowing physical denoising without adding any extra steps in data acquisition supplementary fig 2 as a result the model achieved 80 prediction accuracy in 164 images by combining physical denoising through selective bacterial enrichment media and model training on multiple lab cultured bacterial species fig 5 e overall these predictive performance levels were comparable to prior studies summarized in table 1 despite the complex real world background noise of the coconut water or spinach wash water samples 5 conclusions in conclusion our ai biosensing framework enables rapid and automated detection of target pathogens which is capable of generalizing to real world water samples with unseen environmental background noise the model trained on a set of lab cultured bacteria effectively identified and quantified target pathogens without the need for prolonged incubation for enrichment or extensive control steps for unknown commensal microbes by including non target bacteria in the training datasets the model performance on real world water samples was further improved by allowing the deep learning algorithm to learn distinct features of phage induced lysis compared to potential microbial background noise in environmental samples such generalizability of the ai model combined with image augmentation maximizes the data efficiency of input images thereby reducing the need for site specific data generation overall this study demonstrates the potential of our ai biosensing

14676,rapid pathogen detection in food and agricultural water is essential for ensuring food safety and public health however complex and noisy environmental background matrices delay the identification of pathogens and require highly trained personnel here we present an ai biosensing framework for accelerated and automated pathogen detection in various water samples from liquid food to agricultural water a deep learning model was used to identify and quantify target bacteria based on their microscopic patterns generated by specific interactions with bacteriophages the model was trained on augmented datasets to maximize data efficiency using input images of selected bacterial species and then fine tuned on a mixed culture model inference was performed on real world water samples containing environmental noises unseen during model training overall our ai model trained solely on lab cultured bacteria achieved rapid 5 5 h prediction with 80 100 accuracy on the real world water samples demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen data our study highlights the potential applications in microbial water quality monitoring during food and agricultural processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pathogen detection biosensing deep learning data augmentation water safety 1 introduction food and agricultural processes require large quantities of water which is a major transmission source of pathogenic disease outbreaks mehle and ravnikar 2012 weller et al 2020 the centers for diseases control and prevention reports that approximately 48 million people in the united states get sick from foodborne illnesses annually which causes an economic burden of over 15 5 billion including costs of medical treatment productivity loss and death centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2018 hoffmann et al 2015 among the various products linked to foodborne outbreaks fresh produce is a leading contributor painter et al 2013 with agricultural water playing a significant role in its contamination julien javaux et al 2019 malakar et al 2019 in addition the consumption of contaminated water and liquid foods represents another critical concern in outbreaks cabral 2010 jha et al 2016 therefore rapid detection and monitoring of pathogenic bacteria in food and agricultural water are critical to ensuring food safety food security and public health hoorfar 2011 law et al 2014 moreover the expansion in the global trade of food and agricultural commodities further emphasizes the significance of pathogen detection in addition to process control board for international food and agricultural development bifad et al 2019 hoorfar 2011 thus the accelerated detection of pathogenic bacteria in food and agricultural systems is essential to enhance public health and reduce economic loss however conventional culture based methods are limited in providing timely detection taking several days to get the results cho and ku 2017 zeng et al 2016 to accelerate this slow process various studies have investigated the application of molecular biology based assays to detect pathogenic bacteria in food samples cho and ku 2017 draz and lu 2016 lungu et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 examples of such molecular methods include nucleic acid based detection such as polymerase chain reaction pcr cho and ku 2017 lungu et al 2012 and loop mediated isothermal amplification draz and lu 2016 yet these methods require advanced technical skills extensive capital cost on devices and laboratory environment and expensive reagents and test kits cho and ku 2017 zeng et al 2016 moreover complex food matrices can further challenge the isolation of nucleic acids or inhibit amplification zeng et al 2016 in addition the detection limits of viable bacteria using these methods are in the range of 102 103 cfu ml or g of food samples after enrichment for at least 5 8 h zeng et al 2016 enzyme linked immunoassay elisa is another example of a molecular method and has been applied in the food industry for its rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria huang et al 2019 law et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 however it also requires a high cost while achieving relatively low sensitivity and cannot distinguish between live and dead bacterial cells law et al 2014 liu et al 2016 such challenges in cost labor and performance against food samples i e low specificity or sensitivity without additional sample preparation have been barriers to implementing advanced diagnostic tools in the food industry complementary to molecular methods the biosensing approach using lytic bacteriophages or phages has also been evaluated for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria brovko et al 2012 paczesny et al 2020 singh et al 2013 these phages can create specific changes in microscopic features of viable target cells in a mixed community of bacteria brovko et al 2012 paczesny et al 2020 singh et al 2013 our previous studies demonstrated rapid specific and sensitive detection of bacteria based on these changes in cell morphology and other optical properties upon phage infection wisuthiphaet et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however this phage based optical biosensing still relies on a well trained workforce and time for image analysis and identification of such optical changes could be limited to simplified monoculture systems to address the challenges in the human operated analysis of sensing data artificial intelligence ai has been combined with microbial image analysis in various studies balagurusamy et al 2019 cui et al 2020 hoorali et al 2020 jin et al 2020 joy et al 2021 kang et al 2020 2021 lasch et al 2018 petitte et al 2019 talo 2019 umar ibrahim et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zieliÅski et al 2017 machine learning and deep learning have been increasingly used in microbial counting especially since 2015 due to the steep growth and development of deep learning algorithms for image segmentation zhang et al 2021a similarly machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been applied to image analysis to classify pathogens in lab based mono or mixed cultures balagurusamy et al 2019 hoorali et al 2020 kang et al 2021 2020 lasch et al 2018 petitte et al 2019 talo 2019 zhang et al 2021b zieliÅski et al 2017 or biosensing for healthcare diagnostics cui et al 2020 jin et al 2020 umar ibrahim et al 2021 these approaches can accelerate and automate image analysis and also improve specificity by pattern recognition and sensitivity by object detection using a convolutional neural network cnn on well defined lab cultured datasets cui et al 2020 thus this study aimed to develop an ai biosensing framework for rapid pathogen detection via phage induced lysis and evaluate its performance on real world water samples with environmental background noise the workflow of this ai biosensing framework is illustrated in the graphical abstract where microscopic images of bacteria were acquired after adding phages to obtain specific patterns of phage induced lysis of target bacteria and analyzed using a cnn object detection model as shown in fig 1 input images were augmented to maximize data efficiency by increasing the variance of train datasets in addition to the target bacteria i e escherichia coli the images of selected non target bacteria i e listeria innocua bacillus subtilis pseudomonas fluorescens were also included in the training dataset to allow the deep learning algorithm to learn distinct features of phage induced lysis compared to microbial background noise then the model trained solely on these lab cultured datasets was used to identify and quantify target bacteria in the real world water samples with background noises unseen during model training here we designed the model training pipeline to optimize the generalizability of the ai model to unseen data that have never been exposed to the model and therefore the need for extensive site specific data generation can be minimized for future applications in this way we could also facilitate the image annotation procedure by reducing the expertise needed to label the images overall this study illustrates the potential of an ai biosensing framework for rapid pathogen detection in liquid food and agricultural water without extensive human and laboratory resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 liquid food and agricultural water sample preparation to introduce unseen background noise created by food and environmental factors coconut water simulated spinach wash water and irrigation water samples were collected coconut water vita coco 100 coconut water was purchased from a local grocery store simulated spinach wash water was prepared by blending pre washed ready to eat baby spinach leaves purchased from a local grocery store with sterile milli q water with a ratio of 1 10wt vol using a sanitized blender osterizer 6706 oster co milwaukee wi usa the mixture was blended twice for 30 s at maximum speed the blended solution was transferred to sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was collected before another centrifugation cycle with the same condition the final supernatant was collected as a simulated spinach wash water sample the irrigation water sample used in this study was collected from the campbell tract at the university of california davis which is the solano county district agricultural irrigation water prior to inoculation we confirmed no presence of e coli in all the water samples by plate counting assay see supplementary information before t7 phage infection 5 ml of coconut water or spinach wash water was mixed with 5 ml of double concentrated tryptic soy broth sigma aldrich st louis mo usa similarly 5 ml of irrigation water was mixed with 5 ml of double concentrated ec broth neogen lansing mi usa a selective medium that isolates e coli and coliforms from food and water samples the mixtures were then inoculated with e coli bl21 at concentrations of 10 103 cfu ml and subjected to bacterial enrichment at 37 c with constant shaking at 200 rpm for 4 h t7 phage 106 pfu ml was then added to the 4h enriched mixtures and incubated at 37 c for 30 min for the negative controls samples without e coli inoculation were used after this phage infection bacterial cells were collected by filtration and the fluorescence images were acquired as described in section 2 2 2 2 imaging pre processing and annotation after bacterial enrichment and phage infection see supplementary information 100 Âµl of the solution was filtered through a 0 2 Âµm pore size whatman anodisc inorganic filter membrane with a 13 mm diameter ge healthcare buckinghamshire uk and allowed to stand for 2 3 min the filter was placed backside down on a 20 Âµl droplet of sybr green i nucleic acid stain 10 concentrate invitrogen carlsbad ca usa on a glass slide and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min the excess sybr green was removed by gently rubbing the backside of the filter using a kimwipe the stained filter was then placed on a new glass slide a 20 Âµl of 1 of p phenylenediamine acros organic fair lawn nj usa was dropped on the filter and covered with a glass coverslip the filter was observed under an olympus ix 71 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 100 magnification 1 25 na objective lens a ccd charge coupled device camera model c4742 80 12ag hamamatsu tokyo japan and the metamorph imaging software version 7 7 2 0 universal imaging corporation the fluorescence excitation emission wavelength of the sybr green i stain was 480 30 and 535 40 nm respectively an average of 10 12 images were taken from different regions of each filter for every sample and at least 5 biological replicates were used per sample our training datasets consisted of 60 77 and 43 images for the e coli monoculture at concentrations of 10 102 and 103 cfu ml respectively the testing datasets included 114 125 and 164 images obtained for coconut water spinach wash water and irrigation water samples respectively notably we utilized an object detection model enabling our ai model to detect and analyze multiple instances of target e coli cells within each image this approach provided valuable and diverse information complementing the number of image replicates available for analysis the image processing software imagej schneider et al 2012 was used to convert the acquired fluorescence image files format from tiff into jpg these microscopic images of 1344 1024 pixels were then resized to 1024 1024 pixels and normalized by taking the maximum and minimum values in each image with lysed e coli particles appeared as round shapes with a diffused distribution of released dna due to cell lysis for ground truth gt annotations of e coli counts in the input images expert classification was conducted by a trained food microbiologist following the methods described in our previous study yang et al 2020 briefly e coli cells were characterized based on morphological features e g area eccentricity and full width at half maximum to detect them among background signals sybr green labeling enhanced bacterial detection specificity by indicating nucleic acid presence within this distinct morphology while the diffuse distribution of the fluorescence signal was used to detect phage induced lysis of e coli our prior optimization of phage to bacteria ratio and incubation time further improved the reliability of gt annotations for lysed e coli ensuring accurate dataset annotations using this approach keypoint annotations were assigned to the center of released dna signals of lysed e coli using an open source computer vision annotation tool cvat developed by intel https github com openvinotoolkit cvat these keypoint annotations were exported in xml format and gt bounding boxes were generated from these keypoint annotations by creating square boxes with a length of 40 pixels 2 3 model architecture and training details all models were trained using the pytorch library in python paszke et al 2019 with a faster r cnn model pre trained on large datasets including imagenet ms coco train2017 ren et al 2017 and the 2020 global wheat detection datasets david et al 2020 the models were trained for 300 epochs and the anchor sizes of 5 10 20 25 and 35 pixels were used input image intensities were converted to 32 bit float values and normalized between 0 and 1 using their minimum and maximum intensity data augmentation was performed to increase the size of train datasets by flipping rotating and randomly varying brightness and contrast a stochastic gradient descent optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0 0001 weight decay of 0 0005 and a momentum of 0 9 for model optimization using e coli monoculture test dataset we split the e coli monoculture dataset into 70 15 15 train validation and test splits and the model was trained on these train and validation datasets to perform model inference and evaluation on the unseen real world water test dataset which had not been previously exposed to the ai model during training the model was trained on two different combinations of lab cultured bacteria exposed to t7 phages i train a and ii train b datasets see section 3 1 in the case of the train a dataset e coli only we split the e coli monoculture dataset into 85 15 train and validation splits and these datasets were used for training similarly we split each dataset into 85 15 train and validation splits for the train b dataset multiple species 2 4 evaluation of model performance the model performance in quantitative inference was examined based on the observed predicted plot for e coli counts for this predicted e coli counts in each test image were plotted against observed e coli counts obtained from gt annotations and linear regression was applied the slope of this linear regression line and its r 2 and root mean square error rmse values were used as evaluation metrics moreover the 95 prediction interval and 95 prediction thresholds for a zero count and true non zero counts were shown in the observed predicted plot the 95 prediction interval was obtained using the ordinary least squares function of the statsmodels api python library and the 95 prediction thresholds were obtained from intersections between the 95 prediction interval and axes see fig 3 a moreover the accuracy of zero count prediction was calculated as follows where the positive or negative was defined based on the image level presence of e coli i e non zero or zero counts respectively furthermore a probability density plot was generated to establish a relationship between the predicted e coli counts in the input images post enrichment and the initial bacterial loads in water samples the probability density plot was generated using the kernel density estimation function of the pandas python library and the 95 true non zero prediction zone was displayed over this density plot this shows the model performance on prediction for different initial e coli loads in each test sample in addition to the evaluation metrics on the data side of model performance the sensing based model performance was also examined in terms of the assay time and detection limit these two metrics were experimentally measured and compared with conventional methods such as plate counting assay and real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr see supplementary information 3 results 3 1 microscopic image datasets obtained using t7 phage for model training fluorescence microscopic images of bacteria exposed to t7 phages were used along with their gt annotations to enable fluorescence imaging bacteria were labeled with sybr green dna specific stain during incubation t7 phages fig 2 a were added to our target e coli fig 2 b or other non target bacterial species including l innocua b subtilis and p fluorescens these bacterial species were chosen as they occur commonly in food while having distinct morphological features fig 2 c e and not being lysed by t7 phages in contrast when t7 phages were added to e coli monoculture fig 2 f h or a mixture of the selected four bacterial species fig 2 i the phages induced changes in microscopic features specific to their target e coli to obtain a gt bounding box keypoint annotation was given to an approximate center point of a lysed e coli cell gt bounding boxes were then generated by expanding the keypoint annotations into 40 px by 40 px boxes the model was trained on two different combinations of lab cultured bacteria exposed to t7 phages i train a dataset where the model was trained solely on e coli monoculture fig 2 f h or ii train b dataset where the model was trained on a concatenated monoculture datasets of e coli and selected non e coli bacteria fig 2 c h and then fine tuned on the lab based mixed culture of all four bacterial species fig i in total 180 images of e coli monoculture at different concentrations 10 102 103 cfu ml 57 images of selected non e coli bacteria and 105 images of the lab based mixed culture were used for model training and validation sets the variance of the train dataset was further increased using the set of data augmentations including flip rotation and random variations of brightness and contrast see section 2 3 importantly the model was only exposed to lab cultured datasets during training and not the real world water samples 3 2 deep convolutional neural network for identification of lysed e coli in this study faster r cnn ren et al 2017 was chosen as an object detection model and trained to visually distinguish dna signals belonging to lysed e coli cells from the background or non e coli bacteria the target dna signals of lysed e coli cells were mapped to 1 and others were mapped to 0 here we did not further distinguish between background and other bacterial cells since the non e coli bacteria selected in this study were only a few examples that could be found in food and the goal of this ai biosensing framework was to detect e coli among them to evaluate the model performance on predicting lysed e coli in a monoculture test datasets were obtained in a controlled laboratory setting commonly used for conventional culture based microbial analysis i e lab cultured in this case the e coli monoculture dataset was split into three subsets i e train validation and test datasets and the test dataset was not included during model training so that the model prediction could be evaluated on unseen data as shown in fig 3 a the model performance on quantification was evaluated by the observed predicted plot for e coli counts per test image this observed predicted plot resulted in a slope of 1 07 r 2 0 99 showing a good match between gt annotations and prediction given the observed e coli counts ranging between 1 and 52 the rmse of the prediction was 2 7 for a zero count i e absence of e coli in a given image a 95 prediction threshold was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 8 in contrast a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts i e presence of e coli in a given image was achieved at predicted e coli counts 4 6 such results shown in fig 3 a were generated using an optimal confidence score threshold which was determined based on the evaluation metrics of the observed predicted plot the confidence score is a hyperparameter used in faster r cnn that represents the probability of an object i e lysed e coli being present in each bounding box during model inference in this study the confidence score threshold of 0 4 was chosen as it resulted in the minimum rmse of 2 7 while giving a slope and r 2 close to 1 was selected as an optimal value fig 3 b this chosen value was further used for model inference on the selected real world water samples with this optimal threshold value the observed and predicted bounding boxes were also displayed on the example e coli monoculture test images fig 3 c overall the model successfully predicted bounding boxes associated with the visible dna signals of lysed e coli cells and the results matched gt annotations for all three different levels of initial e coli loads 3 3 comparison to other conventional pathogen detection methods the efficiency of our ai biosensing framework was compared to conventional pathogen detection methods by evaluating the assay time and detection limit the plate counting assay required 16 h to get the results for the e coli monoculture with this method the lowest possible bacterial count was obtained for an e coli suspension of 1 cfu ml in contrast rt qpcr reduced the assay time to 6 h including the enrichment step of 4 h and the lowest possible bacterial count for the irrigation water sample was 103 cfu ml therefore for the same assay time the ai biosensing framework could improve the detection of e coli using phage induced lysis with a detection limit of 10 cfu ml 3 4 application for e coli detection in unseen liquid food and agricultural water using the model optimized on e coli monoculture datasets we also evaluated model inference on real world water samples that had not been previously exposed to the ai model during training referred to as unseen samples while e coli monoculture was a lab cultured dataset with relatively low noise the selected real world water samples had more complex backgrounds and other commensal microbes that introduced noise that was not present during model training for this investigation the test datasets were divided into two groups based on the complexity of their background noise sources i coconut water and simulated spinach wash water samples provided background noise originating from organic debris of food components and here the model trained on the train a dataset e coli only was used ii irrigation water samples on the other hand provided additional background noise from commensal microbes thus selective media was used during the enrichment step to suppress the growth of non e coli bacteria see section 2 1 in this case the model trained on the train b dataset m species was explored in addition to the model trained on the train a dataset the results in fig 4 a show the example coconut water sample images and their respective observed and predicted bounding boxes the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification fig 4 b had a slope of 0 88 with an r 2 value of 0 96 the observed e coli counts ranged between 0 and 39 while the rmse value of the prediction was 1 91 for this sample a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 0 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 1 00 in 114 images moreover a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 3 5 and this non zero prediction zone was displayed over the density plot of predicted e coli counts fig 4 c to show the prediction performance at different initial e coli loads here 0 14 of the total test images with a lower e coli load 10 cfu ml were within this 95 true non zero prediction zone while 0 85 of the total test images with a higher e coli load 102 103 cfu ml were covered by this zone similarly the results in fig 4 d show the example spinach wash water sample images with their respective observed and predicted bounding boxes the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification fig 4 e had a slope of 0 93 with an r 2 value of 0 81 the observed e coli counts for the spinach wash water ranged between 0 and 16while its rmse value of the prediction was 1 5 for this sample a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 2 6 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 0 95 in 125 images in addition a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 3 4 and the results in fig 4 f show the non zero prediction zone over the density plot of predicted e coli counts with different initial e coli loads in this case 0 20 and 0 88 of the total test images with a lower and higher e coli load were covered by the 95 true non zero prediction zone respectively overall the model trained solely on e coli or the train a dataset resulted in a highly accurate prediction of lysed e coli in the coconut water and spinach wash water samples however for the much noisier irrigation water samples the model trained on the train a dataset e coli only resulted in a less accurate prediction on fig 5 a c the observed predicted plot for e coli quantification had a slope of 0 77 with a lower r 2 value of 0 58 moreover the prediction resulted in a high rmse of 20 7 while the observed e coli counts ranged between 0 and 45 as shown from the input images in fig 5 a and supplementary fig s2a the use of selective media during the enrichment step effectively suppressed the growth of non e coli bacteria consequently this improved the model performance in quantifying e coli counts in a given image supplementary fig s2b in this case the gt predicted plot had a slope of 0 84 with a higher r 2 value of 0 76 and rmse was reduced to 4 0 with the observed data ranging between 0 and 19 in contrast the model trained using the train b dataset m species performed even better with the irrigation water samples fig 5 d f especially with the aid of selective enrichment media as shown in fig 5 e this model resulted in the observed predicted plot with a slope of 0 91 r 2 0 87 and rmse was further reduced to 1 9 with the observed data ranging between 0 and 19 in this case a 95 prediction threshold for a zero count was achieved at observed e coli counts 3 2 and the accuracy of zero count prediction was 0 80 in 164 images further a 95 prediction threshold for true non zero counts was achieved at predicted e coli counts 4 2 and the results in fig 5 f show the non zero prediction zone over the density plot of predicted e coli counts with different initial e coli loads here 0 04 and 0 88 of the total test images with a lower and higher e coli load were covered by the 95 true non zero prediction zone respectively 4 discussion in this study we present an ai biosensing framework for the rapid identification and quantification of viable pathogens via phage induced lysis in liquid food and agricultural water this approach not only enables accelerated and automated pathogen detection using ai enabled data analysis but also provides accurate detection of target e coli at low concentrations amidst diverse background noise using a biosensing approach in addition by designing the model training pipeline to include selected species of lab cultured non target bacteria the generalizability of the ai model to real world water samples with unseen environmental background noise was demonstrated in our previous study of phage based biosensing for e coli detection data analysis was human engineered based on the average calculation of selected optical properties of a target e coli cell yang et al 2020 this approach was limited for practical application since i only a few features were selected manually by human intervention ii data analysis relies on well trained personnel and is time intensive and iii the method could only apply to well controlled samples like e coli monoculture without background noise in contrast the present ai enabled data analysis enables a full exploration of image features accelerates and automates the detection 5 5 h including bacterial enrichment less than a single work shift and can be applied to real world water samples with complex backgrounds moreover the detection limit of our ai biosensing framework was 10 cfu ml fig 3 in comparison it has been reported in the literature that qpcr methods can quantify e coli concentrations in irrigation water xie et al 2019 and environmental water for 10 cfu ml walker et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 thus we concluded that the detection limit of our ai biosensing framework is comparable to that of rt pcr overall these results show the potential of our ai biosensing framework in accurately detecting pathogens at various concentrations in water resources even in the presence of environmental background matrices the findings of this study complement the previous efforts in integrating ai with biosensing technologies advancing the model performance in the presence of environmental and biological background matrices previous studies have shown that the application of ai in biosensing can significantly improve accuracy and speed by reducing the limitations of human operational skills and errors zhang et al 2021a accordingly researchers have developed ai enabled technologies for rapid identification and quantification of pathogenic bacteria in different background matrices based on spectroscopy microscopy colorimetry microfluidic analysis and other imaging methods table 1 however these methods focused on simplified well controlled tasks such as single cell classification balagurusamy et al 2019 ho et al 2019 kang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 model prediction on monoculture datasets gunda et al 2019 hoorali et al 2020 khan et al 2021 lasch et al 2018 talo 2019 zieliÅski et al 2017 or mixed culture datasets obtained with minimal background noise petitte et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the case of studies performed on mixed culture datasets with real world environmental samples field water and wastewater the model prediction accuracy was compromised on a mixed culture kim et al 2021 or only a qualitative prediction was available li et al 2020 to this our ai biosensing framework introduced biospecificity of phages to improve model performance against complex background noise the use of phages generated target specific patterns that are distinguishable against other biobased background noise originating from food debris organic matter and commensal microbes enabling rapid detection of e coli figs 4 and 5 in addition our presentation of the results in figs 4 c f 5 c and f provides a connection between the model prediction on images and the physical bacterial concentrations of test water samples we presented the probability density plot for predicted e coli counts where the 95 true non zero prediction threshold was given as a criterion value and the area under the curve to the right of this criterion value a non zero was calculated this a non zero indicates the probability of the non zero counts obtained by model inference falling into a 95 prediction interval for each bacterial concentration i e 10 or 102 3 cfu ml with the best model being used fig 4 c f and 5 f a non zero for the real world water samples with 102 3 cfu ml of e coli ranged between 0 85 and 0 88 however lower a non zero values were 0 20 acquired for the water samples with 10 cfu ml of e coli considering a smaller size of e coli i e a cylinder 1 0 2 0 Âµm long with a radius about 0 5 Âµm national research council 1999 compared to the imaging area of 84 64 Âµm this could be due to the statistical sampling effect of partial imaging of the sample and potential heterogeneity in bacterial distribution thus future studies may obtain full stitched wide field microscopic images to further improve model performance for a lower bacterial concentration overall this approach of connecting the imaging data and physical bacterial concentration of test samples could be suggested for future studies to compare model performance across diverse real world samples the model performance results were sample specific depending on the sources of background noise in the case of less noisy water samples such as coconut water and spinach wash water the major sources of background noise were food debris and organic matter since these selected water samples were commercially processed in advance to reduce commensal microbes their background noise patterns did not have an intense signal that microbial dna would generate yet the complexity of background noise from food debris and organic matter traditionally required time and labor consuming isolation of target bacteria or chemical preparation steps zeng et al 2016 moreover food and environmental samples may contain pcr inhibitors so that molecular methods may not work in those cases schrader et al 2012 in contrast phage induced lysis enhanced the identification of target bacteria without such bacterial isolation or chemical preparation steps as a result model inference was performed with high accuracy of 95 100 on these unseen real world water samples by using the model trained solely on e coli monoculture fig 4 on the other hand the noisier irrigation water sample we collected was rich in commensal microbes and this imposed additional complexity on model inference the bacterial profile of this irrigation water sample was assessed through a plate counting assay using selective media which confirmed a high concentration of naturally occurring gram negative bacteria supplementary table s1 these bacterial species can contribute to the dna type background noise exhibiting similarities to that of e coli the use of selective media during enrichment suppressed the growth of such non e coli dna signals allowing physical denoising without adding any extra steps in data acquisition supplementary fig 2 as a result the model achieved 80 prediction accuracy in 164 images by combining physical denoising through selective bacterial enrichment media and model training on multiple lab cultured bacterial species fig 5 e overall these predictive performance levels were comparable to prior studies summarized in table 1 despite the complex real world background noise of the coconut water or spinach wash water samples 5 conclusions in conclusion our ai biosensing framework enables rapid and automated detection of target pathogens which is capable of generalizing to real world water samples with unseen environmental background noise the model trained on a set of lab cultured bacteria effectively identified and quantified target pathogens without the need for prolonged incubation for enrichment or extensive control steps for unknown commensal microbes by including non target bacteria in the training datasets the model performance on real world water samples was further improved by allowing the deep learning algorithm to learn distinct features of phage induced lysis compared to potential microbial background noise in environmental samples such generalizability of the ai model combined with image augmentation maximizes the data efficiency of input images thereby reducing the need for site specific data generation overall this study demonstrates the potential of our ai biosensing

14677,metal based nanoparticles nps attract increasing concerns because of their adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems however their environmental concentrations and size distributions are largely unknown especially in marine environments in this work environmental concentrations and risks of metal based nps were examined in laizhou bay china using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms first separation and detection approaches of metal based nps were optimized for seawater and sediment samples with high recoveries of 96 7 and 76 3 respectively spatial distribution results showed that ti based nps had the highest average concentrations for all the 24 stations seawater 1 78 108 particles l sediments 7 75 1012 particles kg followed by zn ag cu and au based nps for all the nps in seawater the highest abundance occurred around the yellow river estuary resulting from a huge input from yellow river in addition the sizes of metal based nps were generally smaller in sediments than those in seawater 22 20 17 and 16 of 22 stations for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively based on the toxicological data of engineered nps predicted no effect concentrations pnecs to marine species were calculated as ag at 72 8 ng l zno at 2 66 Âµg l cuo at 7 83 Âµg l tio2 at 72 0 Âµg l and the actual pnecs of the detected metal based nps may be higher due to the possible presence of natural nps station 2 around the yellow river estuary was assessed as high risk for ag and ti based nps with risk characterization ratio rcr values of 1 73 and 1 66 respectively in addition rcrtotal values for all the four metal based nps were calculated to fully assess the co exposure environmental risk with 1 20 and 1 of 22 stations as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively this study helps to better understand the risks of metal based nps in marine environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal based nanoparticles sp icp ms detection predicted no effect concentrations environmental risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoparticles nps especially metal based nps metal metal oxide and other metal containing nps widely distribute in almost all environmental compartments which attracts increasing concern due to their adverse effects to environments and ecosystems gottschalk et al 2023 based on their origins environmental nps can be categorized as natural nps or anthropogenic nps natural nps are formed by bio geochemical or mechanical processes without connection to human anthropogenic processes lespes et al 2020 anthropogenic nps including incidental and engineered nps are connected tightly to daily life as necessities to improve the performance of many consumer and industrial products ma et al 2023 notably some researchers found that anthropogenic nps were identified as a dominant fraction in natural samples e g ag ti based nps implying a great contribution of nps from human activities azimzada et al 2021 marine environment especially coastal bay is an important sink for terrestrial and atmospheric nps hochella et al 2019 in addition offshore anthropogenic activities e g marine aquaculture maritime transport petroleum industry and tourism input metal based nps into marine environments with potential environmental risk shah and mraz 2020 shingala et al 2020 to better understand the environmental risk of these metal based nps it is urgent to obtain their environmental concentrations in different marine areas nowadays single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms provides a powerful tool to quantify nps in environmental samples bolea et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 currently most of current studies focused on environmental distribution of nps in freshwater compartments e g lakes and rivers nabi et al 2023 wu et al 2020 for seawaters garner et al 2017 predicted the environmental concentrations of metal based nps in san francisco bay while labille et al 2020 detected the concentrations of two types of nps tio2 20 900 Î¼g l zno 1 15 Î¼g l in french mediterranean coast using icp ms with the assistance of filtration only three reports examined environmental distribution of metal based nps in seawaters by sp icp ms azimzada et al 2021 sanchÃ­s et al 2020 xu et al 2020 our previous study examined the concentrations of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawater from a single station of jiaozhou bay china xu et al 2020 ce and ti based nps were detected in mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean with the concentration ranges at 7 5 106 1 5 108 and 1 2 108 3 8 109 particles l respectively azimzada et al 2021 sanchÃ­s et al 2020 however only 1 3 concentration points were detected for each marine area in the above works no report focuses on the spatial distribution of metal based nps in a selected marine environment to our knowledge therefore to better understand the pollution characteristics of metal based nps it is necessary to systematically investigate their specific marine distribution towards a series of metal based nps metal based nps tend to homo or hetero aggregate in seawater and sink into marine sediments dai et al 2022 therefore their concentrations are hypothesized to be much higher than surface seawater however there is no report on the detection of metal based nps in marine sediments due to lack of effective approach to separate metal based nps from marine sediments for freshwater sediments three approaches are used for metal based nps separation i extracting metal based nps by tetrasodium pyrophosphate tspp as nps dispersant which is commonly considered as the best separation approach recovery range at 84 1 105 8 li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 schwertfeger et al 2017 ii directly separating by sedimentation tou et al 2021a and iii low speed centrifugation choleva et al 2020 for approach i the introduction of tspp significantly improved separation effectiveness in sediment samples however instrumental isobaric and or polyatomic interferences from tspp were currently reported jiang et al 2022 sedimentation and centrifugation approaches are based on the stokes separation law dominated by gravity and centrifugal force respectively liu et al 2021 lÃ³pez rodrÃ­guez et al 2022 but their applicability in marine sediments remains unknown compared to freshwater sediments marine sediments are obviously different in salinity organic matter ph and particle composition kuznetsova and timerbaev 2022 li et al 2012 which bring more difficulties to effectively separate metal based nps appropriate approach for metal based nps separation from marine sediments is thus urgently needed in this work we developed and optimized the separation of metal based nps and obtained their environmental distributions in marine sediments for the first time another knowledge gap is environmental risk of metal based nps in marine environment risk characterization ratio rcr offers a guidance for environmental risk assessment of metal based nps which is calculated by comparing the estimated exposure environmental concentration with a presumed safe concentration predicted no effect concentration pnec arvidsson 2018 environmental risk assessments in different freshwaters were assessed based on rcr coll et al 2016 however their environmental concentrations were predicted from environmental fate models based on global production volumes and contaminant transport patterns the predicted environmental concentration could deviate the actual concentrations in a specific area likely leading to inaccuracy in the obtained risk levels nowack et al 2015 parker and keller 2019 in addition there is scare information on the risk assessment of metal based nps towards marine environments therefore risk assessment will be conducted in this work by combining the detected actual concentrations of metal based nps and the calculated pnecs towards marine species also different types of nps could co exist in a specific marine region and co expose to marine species to fully assess the environmental risk induced by all these types of nps it is necessary to systematically assess the risk of a series of nps in this work laizhou bay as an important bay in the inner bohai sea of china with great potential to enrich metal based nps was selected as a target area ag au cu ti and zn based nps were selected as typical metal based nps in the present work and the objectives were to 1 develop an appropriate approach for the separation of these metal based nps from marine sediments and detection approaches for seawater and marine sediments 2 investigate spatial distributions of ag au cu ti and zn based nps in both surface seawaters and sediments of laizhou bay as well as their potential sources and 3 assess environmental risks of different metal based nps by rcrs the obtained results will be helpful for better understanding the pollution level and potential environmental risk of metal based nps in marine environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection laizhou bay a typical semi enclosed inner sea with poor water circulation is an important area for fisheries and the salt industry along the coastline there are more than 20 rivers including the second longest river in china the yellow river flowing into the bay surface seawater 22 stations and sediment samples 24 stations were collected in laizhou bay in may 2021 fig s1 at each sampling station 2 0 l of seawater samples were collected using a plastic niskin hydrophore from 1 m below the sea surface salinity temperature and ph of seawater were measured by a portable water quality monitor eureka water probes immediately table s1 the top 10 cm of sediment samples 5 0 kg were collected using a van veen grab in each station and then transferred to a plastic sealed bag after large stones and biomass removal both seawater and sediment samples were stored at 4 c before pretreatment 2 2 detection method of metal based nps in seawater standard au nps and commercial metal based nps ag tio2 cuo and zno were spiked into seawater to obtain the recoveries and size distributions all these metal based nps were characterized with transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100plus japan the detailed information e g manufacturers purities dispersants individual sizes and hydrodynamic diameters of the five nps is given in table s2 au tio2 cuo and zno nps were spiked into seawater with the concentration of 106 particles ml to obtain the recoveries and size distributions wu et al 2020 then nps spiked seawater samples were directly diluted by 10 or 50 times for sp icp ms analysis for ag nps frequency ion interference occurred during sp icp ms analysis in high ionic intensity liquid therefore cloud point extraction was used to enrich ag based nps e g ag agcl thio et al 2012 wimmer et al 2020 and avoid relative interference wimmer et al 2021 ag nps were added to seawater for spiked recovery analysis of cloud point extraction briefly 100 Âµl tx 114 10 sigma was added into 8 ml ag spiked seawater 10 mg l followed by bath incubation 40 c 40 min wimmer et al 2020 then the sample was centrifuged 4865 g 6 min to separate the organic phase and 600 Âµl ethanol aladdin was added to disperse organic phase finally the sample was diluted to 4 ml by deionized water and analyzed by sp icp ms after sonication 25 c 30 min the recoveries and size distributions of metal based nps were thus obtained based on the concentrations of standard and separated nps 2 3 separation of metal based nps from marine sediments au nps spiked recovery experiments were performed for suitable separation of metal based nps in marine sediments first to obtain au nps spiked sediments different sizes 28 0 0 9 50 3 2 3 and 102 2 2 3 nm in tem images fig s2 of au nps nanocomposix usa were spiked into marine sediments 10 0 g station 17 to achieve final concentrations of 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g then the separation of metal based nps from marine sediments was optimized based on the following three approaches i tspp extraction and sedimentation separation schwertfeger et al 2016 ii sedimentation separation tou et al 2021a and iii centrifugation separation choleva et al 2020 for approach i au spiked sediments 20 0 mg 4 108 particles g were suspended in tspp sigma solution 4 mm 8 ml at a 10 ml polypropylene centrifugal tube followed by bath sonication 25 c 30 min the suspension was settled for 20 h and 1 2 cm supernatant below the liquid surface was taken for sp icp ms analysis schwertfeger et al 2017 meanwhile possible instrumental interference from tspp in approach i was examined briefly two concentrations au nps 2 5 104 and 1 0 105 particles ml 50 nm were respectively added to deionized water and 4 mm tspp for sp icp ms analysis in addition direct separation approaches by sedimentation ii and centrifugation iii were optimized in detail marine sediments with different masses 5 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 30 0 and 40 0 mg were suspended in 8 ml deionized water at 10 ml centrifugal tubes to obtain different sediment water ratios g ml 1 1600 1 800 1 530 1 400 1 270 1 200 after sedimentation 1 2 3 4 8 10 h for approach ii and centrifugation 10 20 40 60 80 100 g separation for approach iii the supernatants 1 2 cm below the liquid surface were sampled for sp icp ms analysis to obtain optimal water sediment ratio for the two approaches after optimal separation parameters were obtained spiked recoveries of au standard nps with different sizes 30 50 100 nm and concentrations 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g in marine sediments were calculated for approach ii and iii respectively optimal separation approach was obtained based on the recovery and size distribution finally 10 mg ag zno tio2 and cuo nps sigma average sizes at 26 5 55 7 87 6 and 68 1 nm based on tem images in fig s3 were spiked into marine sediments 10 0 g separation recoveries of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps from spiked marine sediments were thus obtained based on eq 1 1 r e c o v e r y c m c 0 v d m c s 100 where cm and c0 are the detected particle concentration of separated 1 2 cm supernatant in spiked and none spiked nps sediments particles ml v is the volume of the supernatant ml d is the dilution factor 1 100 of each supernatant m is the mass of nps spiked sediments g and cs is the standard particle concentration particles g of nps in sediments 2 4 sp icp ms icp ms analysis for seawater the samples after dilution 10 times for au and cu based nps 50 times for ti and zn based nps or cloud point extraction ag based nps were sonicated in water bath 25 c 30 min and then analyzed by sp icp ms perkinelmer nexion 350d inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a syngistix nano application module version 2 3 the operating parameters of sp icp ms analysis were summarized in table s3 the calculation of transport efficiency during sp icp ms analysis is described in text s1 supplementary material the chemical compositions of the ag au cu ti and zn based nps were assumed to be ag au cuo tio2 and zno nps and the shapes of nps were assumed to be spheres the instrumental concentration detection limits for ag au cu ti and zn based nps were 45 104 45 35 and 61 particles ml respectively for marine sediments the samples were freeze dried homogenized with an agate mortar and passed through a 20 mesh stainless steel sieve 0 85 mm to remove small stones and biomass then metal based nps were separated in supernatant by the optimized approach in section 2 3 the parameters of sp icp ms for sediment sample analysis were the same as seawater samples the detected particle concentrations particles l of all the five metal based nps in seawaters and sediments in laizhou bay were converted to mass concentration Âµg l and the detailed conversion approach is described in text s2 in addition engineered nps au ag cuo tio2 and zno with the known individual sizes table s2 were used to confirm the accuracy of particle number mass conversion by comparing their converted particle concentrations and particle concentrations obtained from sp icp ms fig s4 moreover the total concentrations of ag au cu ti and zn in all the seawater and sediment samples were measured by icp ms before measurements seawater samples were acidified with hno3 to ph 2 sediment samples 100 mg were digested with hno3 hclo4 hf mixture 7 ml 5 1 1 in a microwave digestion system gem mars 6 usa 2 5 environmental risk assessment of metal based nps in laizhou bay risk quotient method was selected to assess the environmental risk of metal based nps which was calculated by eq 2 based on pnec and detected environmental concentration ec Âµg l coll et al 2016 2 r c r e c p n e c to calculate pnec of metal based nps marine ecotoxicological endpoints of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps from different marine organism species 37 genera 52 species were collected from the published literature to construct species sensitive distributions ssds curves in detail marine ecotoxicological endpoints for ag cuo tio2 and zno nps were obtained from the literature which included median lethal concentration lc50 median effect concentration ec50 20 10 effect concentration ec20 ec10 lowest observed effect concentrations loec and no observed effect concentration noec due to the lack of noec in most literature ecotoxicological endpoints of marine organisms were transformed into noec by dividing two different assessment factors afs and the detailed description is provided in text s3 coll et al 2016 all collected data on the ecotoxicological endpoints were listed in table s4 the ssd curve was acquired by fitting the collected data using the chinese national ecological environment criteria calculation software species sensitivity distribution eec ssd zhang et al 2022 pnec value was regarded as 5th percentile of the distribution from the ssds curves rcr 0 01 0 01 rcr 0 1 0 1 rcr 1 and rcr 1 indicated minimal low medium and high risk for marine species respectively chen et al 2022 in addition these different types of metal based nps are co existing in marine environments including laizhou bay individual rcrs of the four metal based nps were thus summed rcrtotal to fully assess the environmental risk after co exposure ren et al 2022 2 6 quality assurance and quality control metal related materials were avoided to minimize the introduction of metal based nps and avoid potential contamination during sampling and storage strict quality control procedures were implemented throughout the laboratory analysis process as well transparent glass and plastic containers are used for sample pretreatment instrumental and experimental blanks were analyzed periodically and blank concentrations 270 312 405 665 and 549 particles ml for ag au cu ti and zn based nps respectively were subtracted from actual samples to overcome instrumental contamination sample cross contamination and air contamination 2 7 statistical analysis for each experiment four independent samples were respectively treated for sp icp ms analysis statistical differences were determined using spss 26 0 by one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 for the statistical significance sampling station maps and spatial inverse distance weight interpolation analysis on environmental concentrations of metal based nps were performed by arcgis 10 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection approaches of metal based nps in seawaters and marine sediments engineered nps including au ag cuo tio2 and zno were used for recovery detection and the surface morphology and individual sizes were characterized with tem individual sizes of these nps figs s2 and s3 were consistent with those obtained from sp icp ms measurements figs s5 and s6 for seawater samples the high recoveries of 96 7 2 1 and 101 4 3 2 were obtained for au np at 1 105 and 2 104 particles l respectively fig s5a and b for ag based nps cloud point extraction was proven as an effective extraction approach with a high recovery at 90 4 12 8 fig s5c similarly high recoveries of 95 0 10 3 96 7 4 2 and 96 2 2 9 were obtained for cuo tio2 and zno respectively fig s6 thus these results ensured the reliability of sp icp ms method for metal based nps analysis in seawater the separation approach of metal based nps from marine sediments was optimized based on the three reported approaches used for freshwater sediments for approach i tspp extraction and sedimentation separation higher recovery of standard au nps was obtained by tspp extraction 90 1 1 3 than deionized water 34 9 9 1 after 20 h sedimentation fig s7a and b as an additional chemical extractant possible detection interference from tspp was further evaluated known concentrations 2 5 105 and 10 105 particles ml of 50 nm au nps were spiked to tspp solution 4 mm and ultrahigh recoveries 316 1 and 224 1 respectively were obtained fig s7c and d this suggested detection interference of metal based nps caused by tspp which was probably because of the interference from 123na 231p and 716o in tspp during the determination of 197au the presence of tspp should be the reason for the high recovery of approach i fig s7a but this approach is not applicable for this work tspp is commonly used for the dispersion of nps during sp icp ms analysis we thus conclude that it is necessary to verify exclude possible interferences from tspp otherwise the obtained np concentrations could be higher than actual concentrations and the environmental risk of nps may be overestimated approach ii direct sedimentation and approach iii centrifugation were conducted to separate au 50 nm 4 108 particles g from marine sediments for approach ii the optimal sediment water ratio and sedimentation time were 1 530 g ml and 2 h with the recovery at 66 28 1 98 fig 1 a and b for approach iii the optimal sediment water ratio and centrifugal force were 1 1600 g ml and 20 g with the recovery at 76 27 4 27 fig 1d and e to further compare the separation efficiencies of the two approaches au nps with different sizes 30 50 and 100 nm and concentrations 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 8 108 particles g were spiked in marine sediments and the recoveries were obtained fig 1c and f for the two approaches the recoveries of low concentration au nps 0 04 108 and 0 2 108 particles g were lower than that au nps at high concentrations 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g in addition approach iii was better to separate au nps than approach ii especially for au nps at low concentrations furthermore 100 nm au nps were used for particle size analysis and it is showed that the individual sizes 97 7 0 4 nm of the collected au nps from approach iii were closer to the standard au nps 102 2 2 3 nm than approach ii 93 7 2 5 nm fig s8 therefore approach iii was better for au nps separation and particle size detection than approach ii in our work furthermore approach iii was used to separate commercially available metal based nps ag tio2 cuo and zno from marine sediments under the optimal separation conditions sediment water ratio 1 1600 centrifugal force 20 g the recoveries of ag tio2 cuo and zno nps were 72 37 81 12 85 77 and 84 62 respectively fig 1g and h there are only a few reports using sedimentation tou et al 2021a and centrifugation approaches mahdi et al 2017 huang et al 2021 without tspp extraction the recoveries in this work were significantly higher than the reported centrifugation approach 41 64 for ag nps and 65 for au nps and similar to the reported optimal sedimentation approach 71 4 for ag nps and 81 1 for au nps in addition the size distributions of the spiked nps separated from marine sediments were consistent with the spiked nps fig s9 therefore the optimized approach iii could separate the five types of metal based nps from sediments efficiently moreover the size ranges of sediment particles in the supernatant after centrifugation separation were reduced from 0 5 to 300 Âµm to 0 5 20 Âµm which could avoid instrument blockage problems 100 Âµm during the detection procedure fig s10 therefore optimized centrifugation separation approach iii was utilized for sp icp ms analysis of metal based nps in marine sediment samples 3 2 environmental concentrations of metal based nps in seawaters and sediments of laizhou bay using optimized approach iii the particle concentrations of ag cu ti zn and au based nps in seawater 24 stations and sediments 22 stations of laizhou bay are shown in fig 2 for seawater particle concentrations of ti based nps were the highest among the five types of metal based nps for all 24 stations au based nps were not detected below the detection limit 1 04 105 particles l in all the stations the highest concentration of ti based nps could be due to i the production of ti based nps was the highest among all the metal based nps with global production of 2 5 million tons per year by 2025 zhu et al 2022 and ii ti containing minerals are commonly distributed in natural environments gondikas et al 2014 the concentrations of metal based nps in station 2 were significantly higher 1 2 orders of magnitudes than other stations with the particle concentrations at 7 56 107 7 01 107 2 21 1010 and 7 16 108 particles l for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively station 2 is around the estuary of the yellow river indicating transport potential of metal based nps in other stations the descending order of average metal based nps concentrations was ti based nps mean 1 75 108 particles l range 5 75 107 to 9 73 108 particles l zn based nps 3 79 107 particles l 0 60 107 to 1 27 108 particles l ag based nps 1 27 107 particles l 0 56 107 to 2 29 107 particles l cu based nps 0 65 107 particles l 0 04 107 to 2 91 107 particles l fig 2a d for mass concentration in seawaters the ranges for ag cu ti and zn based nps assuming ag cuo tio2 zno were 4 77 125 95 ng l median 12 06 ng l 0 73 62 95 ng l median 7 18 ng l 0 20 199 37 Âµg l median 0 82 Âµg l and 14 04 997 77 ng l median 32 56 ng l respectively the average mass concentrations of the four nps followed the same order with the particle concentration results fig 2a d for marine sediments ti based nps showed higher particle concentrations than other nps for all the stations interestingly au nps were detected in 9 of 22 stations and for each station the concentration of au based nps was the lowest among all the five types of nps fig s11 these results in sediments are in agreement with seawater because nps especially engineered nps in sediments were originated from their deposition from surface seawater metreveli et al 2021 also the average particle concentrations of nps in sediments followed the order ti based nps mean 7 75 1012 particles kg range 3 70 1011 to 1 56 1013 particles kg zn based nps 1 61 1012 particles kg 1 38 1011 to 4 53 1012 particles kg ag based nps 8 16 1010 particles kg 3 36 108 to 8 08 1011 particles kg cu based nps 6 09 1010 particles kg 2 91 109 to 1 81 1011 particles kg au based nps 1 56 108 particles kg 4 74 107 to 3 41 108 particles kg fig 2e h for mass concentrations in sediments the ranges for ag cu ti zn and au based nps were 0 11 69 45 Âµg kg median 1 44 Âµg kg 1 68 102 35 Âµg kg median 45 35 Î¼g kg 1 02 122 66 mg kg median 27 30 mg kg 0 09 4 22 mg kg median 0 91 mg kg and 0 21 3 73 Âµg kg median 0 82 Î¼g kg respectively fig 2e h the reported concentrations of metal based nps in surface waters were summarized in table s5 and showed in fig 3 generally the concentrations of metal based nps in yellow river estuary station 2 and other 21 stations of laizhou bay in this work were within the range of previously reported nps concentrations among different surface waters oceans lakes and rivers for ag based nps the highest concentration was observed in kiessee lake 2 9 108 particles l germany azimzada et al 2021 which may be attributed to the fact that they located in large and populated cities however the concentrations of ti cu and zn based nps around yellow river estuary were the highest among all the surface waters and the input of natural nps from yellow river could contribute to the total nps amount fig 3 to our knowledge very few works investigated environmental concentrations of nps in sediments tou et al 2021b reported that ti and zn based nps in the freshwater sediments of yangtze river estuary were 3 02 1013 9 61 1013 particles kg and 2 74 1012 1 21 1013 particles kg respectively which is higher than the concentrations of these two nps in laizhou bay including yellow river estuary this is possibly because the yangtze river basin has more residents megalopolises and industrial areas than the yellow river delta and could potentially receive more metal based nps zhao et al 2019 it is noted that au nps were detected for the first time in the present work and they were indeed present in the sediments of laizhou bay 3 3 spatial distribution of metal based nps the spatial distributions of ag cu ti and zn based nps in laizhou bay are shown in fig 4 for seawaters the abundance of all the four metal based nps decreased with increasing distance from the yellow river estuary fig 4a d this result suggested that the yellow river was a crucial input and transport pathway for metal based nps to laizhou bay therefore the freshwater in the yellow river estuary was further sampled fig s1 and the sp icp ms results fig s12 showed that the particle concentrations of all the four metal based nps were higher than those in station 2 near yellow river estuary fig 2 which could support this hypothesis the yellow river basin supported 12 of the population 15 of agricultural land and 8 of the industrial land in china indicating frequent human activities xie et al 2022 in addition yellow river as one of the rivers with the highest suspended mineral particles in the world yin et al 2021 carries numerous natural nps those metal based nps in yellow river could eventually release into laizhou bay however the source analysis of metal based nps is extremely difficult some studies used sp icp tof ms to distinguish natural or anthropogenic nps by elemental ratio azimzada et al 2021 and isotopically labeled nps bland et al 2022 but it is hard to obtain the proportions of natural or anthropogenic nps due to many assumptions e g natural nps exhibit chemical heterogeneities while anthropogenic nps are pure and interferences e g unclear isotope characteristics for natural and anthropogenic nps high concentrations of metal based nps were also detected in some coastal stations ag based nps stations 11 18 cu based nps stations 16 18 zn based nps stations 16 17 which might be attributed to the inputs of other local rivers e g weihe river station 11 industrial and urban areas e g laizhou city stations 16 17 ports and aquaculture areas stations 17 18 for sediments ag based nps were mainly enriched in the area around yellow river estuary stations 2 3 and 6 which was consistent with the spatial distribution of seawater fig 4a and e this result indicated that ag based nps in the sediments were mainly originated from the aggregation and sedimentation of nps in seawater because of high salinity 2 83 31 89 table s1 for station 23 the concentration of ag based nps was relatively high in the sediment while low in seawater compared with other stations which is probably due to the dilution of freshwater input from jiehe river fig 4a and e higher cu based nps concentrations were detected in the northern laizhou bay stations 1 5 12 and 13 one potential reason was the transport of bohai sea surface current because of the strong interaction between the bohai sea center and the northern laizhou bay fig s13 which may be caused by the transport of nps from the northern coastal cities tianjin hebei areas with the assistance of ocean current in bohai sea qi et al 2021 for ti based nps except for high accumulation in station 2 nearby yellow river estuary they tended to enrich in stations 3 19 which were near dongying city and wanghe river respectively for zn based nps high concentrations were detected in the stations of northern laizhou bay stations 5 12 13 and 14 and near dongying city station 3 average individual sizes of metal based nps in laizhou bay are shown in fig 5 the size ranges of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawaters were 48 5 67 2 53 2 109 1 106 3 161 0 and 57 0 132 5 nm respectively the individual sizes in sediments were generally smaller than seawaters with the size ranges at 25 0 39 4 46 8 85 1 85 0 160 2 and 58 6 78 7 nm for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively the detected size of metal based nps was consistent with the commercial nanomaterials in nanoproducts including personal care products e g tio2 zno food additives e g tio2 ag packaging materials e g tio2 and agricultural fungicides e g cuo suggesting the potential source of metal based nps from daily life activities de la calle et al 2017 li et al 2022 suwanroek et al 2022 the determined average sizes of nps especially ag based nps in sediments were generally smaller than that in seawaters 100 90 9 77 3 and 72 7 of total stations for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively which could be explained by two reasons i higher concentration of organic matter in sediments than seawaters contributed to the stronger dissolution of nps e g zno cuo ag and higher abundance of metal organic matter complexes in sediments liu et al 2020 and ii metal based nps may be dissolved to free metal ions or transformed to other metal based nps e g ag to ag2s and agcl cuo to cus and cu2s by marine microorganisms with higher abundance in sediments miao et al 2015 the transformation could also undergo in the upper layers of sediments due to the presence of sulfur and organic matter levard et al 2012 total concentrations of metals in both seawaters and sediments of all the stations were measured tables s6 and s7 total au was below the detection limit in all the samples which is in agreement with our finding that au nps were not detected in these samples for each station the fractions of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawater samples were significantly higher than those in sediment samples fig s14 confirming stronger dissolution of metal based nps in sediments 3 4 environmental risk assessment of metal based nps for au based nps the environmental risk was minimal in laizhou bay because they were below the detection limit in seawater for ag cu ti and zn based nps toxicological data of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps the most common types in nano products to marine species were collected to obtain their pnecs ssds curves were constructed by 121 toxicity endpoint values involving 52 marine species fig 6 a d and table s4 ag nps showed the lowest pnecs 72 8 ng l followed by zno 2 66 Âµg l cuo 7 83 Âµg l and tio2 nps 72 0 Âµg l table s8 the obtained pnecs of the four metal nps for marine species showed no obvious difference with freshwater species table s9 combined with the detected environmental concentrations of metal based nps and pnecs of engineered nps the rcrs in laizhou bay were calculated fig 6e h ag based nps had the highest environmental risk in the laizhou bay among the four nps with 1 16 and 5 of 22 stations assessed as high rcr 1 medium 0 1 rcr 1 and low risk 0 01 rcr 0 1 respectively fig 6e the risk levels of cu based nps in all stations were minimal rcr 0 01 fig 6f and this is because the environmental concentrations 0 73 62 95 ng l were much lower than other types of nps ti based nps in station 2 were assessed as high risk while the risks in other stations were low 12 of 22 stations and minimal 9 of 22 stations fig 6g for zn based nps 1 12 and 9 of 22 stations were assessed medium risk low risk and minimal risk respectively fig 6h in other stations the average rcrs followed the order of ag based nps mean 0 19 range 0 07 0 42 zn based nps 0 02 5 28 10 3 0 06 ti based nps 0 02 2 77 10 3 0 10 cu based nps 1 04 10 3 9 43 10 5 4 58 10 3 fig 6e h garner and keller 2014 also found that the risks of ag and zno nps were higher than tio2 cuo and au nps in marine environments for freshwaters most rcrs of metal based nps were below 1 wigger et al 2020 and only one report observed that the rcrs 1 03 1 10 of ag nps in the surface waters of europe were higher than 1 gottschalk et al 2009 in the present work ag nps showed high risk rcr 1 73 only at station 2 around the yellow river estuary among the 22 stations these results suggested comparative risks between marine and freshwater environments and the environmental risk of ag based nps should be paid more attention due to the lack of toxicological data in marine sediments environmental risk of metal based nps in sediments cannot be assessed currently the obtained nps contents in marine sediments fig 2 in this work will be helpful for assessing environmental risk in sediments when the toxicological data are adequate the obtained rcrs for individual types of metal based nps as assessed by risk quotient method could be further influenced by the environmental processes factors i metal based nps would inevitably undergo environmental transformation in aquatic environment zhao et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 vignardi et al 2023 for example ag nps could be partly transformed to agcl with lower toxicity in the presence of cl cervantes avilÃ©s et al 2019 li et al 2020 and may also transform to low solubility ag2o in oxidative conditions and ag2s in sulfur rich natural environments zhang et al 2018 cu nps could also undergo transformation in marine environments and the toxicity to marine phytoplankton dunaliella tertiolecta was lower after transformation aging vignardi et al 2023 thus the actual environmental risk in laizhou bay is likely lower if the transformation process is considered ii organic matter in laizhou bay ranges at 6 31 9 74 mg l wang et al 2022 actually a number of studies focused on the effect of organic matter on nanotoxicity and most of these works observed toxicity mitigation by organic matter due to the masking of the nps surface by the coated organic matter wang et al 2016 noventa et al 2018 liang et al 2022 iii mineral particles are abundant in laizhou bay especially yellow river estuary which could also decrease the toxicity of metal based nps due to heteroaggregation in aquatic environments zhao et al 2021 huynh et al 2014 kansara et al 2020 therefore the environmental risk may be lower if we consider these environmental factors in addition the toxicological data and pnecs of ag cu ti and zn based nps were obtained from most widely used engineered nps ag cuo tio2 and zno respectively in their pure forms however the detected metal based nps in laizhou bay by sp icp ms would include both natural and engineered nps although the proportions were not identified natural nps are commonly less toxic than engineered nps due to less active surface sharma et al 2015 therefore the environmental risk should be lower if we consider the presence of natural nps in laizhou bay moreover these detected metal based nps are co existing in laizhou bay and could co expose to marine organisms thus rcrtotal values of all the four metal based nps were thus calculated to fully assess the co exposure environmental risk ren et al 2022 station 2 around yellow river estuary showed the highest rcrtotal 3 77 induced by the four types of metal based nps 1 20 and 1 of all the 22 stations were assessed as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively fig 6i ag based nps had the highest contribution 81 7 to the environmental risks followed by zn 8 9 ti 8 9 and cu based nps 0 5 fig 6j in addition to these four nps other metal based nps e g ceo2 cds and carbon based nps e g graphene carbon nanotubes could be also present in laizhou bay and the environmental risk from the whole categories of nps seems to be higher it is noted that the interaction e g heteroaggregation between two types of nps inevitably occurs in aquatic environments for example zno and tio2 nps may form heteroaggregates in aquatic phase thus causing antagonistic toxicity to bacteria escherichia coli and aeromonas hydrophila tong et al 2015 the same aggregation induced toxicity mitigation was observed between cuo and tio2 nps joÅko et al 2017 in addition metal based nps could be dissolved in the incubation system and the released metal ions e g cu2 may act as cofactors to activate enzymes and mitigate oxidative stress as caused from another type of nps liu et al 2022 therefore the environmental risk of the four nps as indicated by rcrs may be overestimated however synergistic toxicity to daphnia magna was observed between cu and zno nps due to enhanced dissolution of zno by cu nps in the presence of natural organic matter yu et al 2022 therefore the interaction between different types should be better understood to fully assess their environmental risk 4 conclusions in this work we examined the concentration and distribution of metal based nps au ag cu ti and zn based nps in laizhou bay as well as their environmental risks the centrifugation separation approach was firstly optimized to separate and enrich metal based nps from marine sediments and high detection recoveries were obtained with sp icp ms technique the four metal based nps ti zn ag cu were detected in all the surface water stations and the proportions of anthropogenic and natural nps were not identified ti based nps had the highest particle concentrations for all the 22 stations in laizhou bay the average concentrations of metal based nps were in a descending order of ti zn ag cu based nps in both seawaters and sediments the highest abundance of metal based nps was observed around yellow river estuary possibly contained numerous natural nps in the yellow river based on rcr analysis ag based nps showed the highest environmental risk with 1 16 and 5 of 22 stations assessed as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively one station around yellow river estuary was assessed as high risk for both ag and ti based nps environmental risk of the four types of nps after co exposure was assessed one surface water station station 2 around yellow river estuary was classified as high risk while 20 and 1 stations were at the levels of medium risk and low risk respectively this study offers effective approaches to separate and detect metal based nps in marine environments which may help to map the environmental distribution of metal based nps in global marine areas the risk assessment conducted in this work is an attempt to better understand the risk of metal based nps in marine environments and would also provide useful information to environmental nanotoxicology

14677,metal based nanoparticles nps attract increasing concerns because of their adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems however their environmental concentrations and size distributions are largely unknown especially in marine environments in this work environmental concentrations and risks of metal based nps were examined in laizhou bay china using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms first separation and detection approaches of metal based nps were optimized for seawater and sediment samples with high recoveries of 96 7 and 76 3 respectively spatial distribution results showed that ti based nps had the highest average concentrations for all the 24 stations seawater 1 78 108 particles l sediments 7 75 1012 particles kg followed by zn ag cu and au based nps for all the nps in seawater the highest abundance occurred around the yellow river estuary resulting from a huge input from yellow river in addition the sizes of metal based nps were generally smaller in sediments than those in seawater 22 20 17 and 16 of 22 stations for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively based on the toxicological data of engineered nps predicted no effect concentrations pnecs to marine species were calculated as ag at 72 8 ng l zno at 2 66 Âµg l cuo at 7 83 Âµg l tio2 at 72 0 Âµg l and the actual pnecs of the detected metal based nps may be higher due to the possible presence of natural nps station 2 around the yellow river estuary was assessed as high risk for ag and ti based nps with risk characterization ratio rcr values of 1 73 and 1 66 respectively in addition rcrtotal values for all the four metal based nps were calculated to fully assess the co exposure environmental risk with 1 20 and 1 of 22 stations as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively this study helps to better understand the risks of metal based nps in marine environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal based nanoparticles sp icp ms detection predicted no effect concentrations environmental risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nanoparticles nps especially metal based nps metal metal oxide and other metal containing nps widely distribute in almost all environmental compartments which attracts increasing concern due to their adverse effects to environments and ecosystems gottschalk et al 2023 based on their origins environmental nps can be categorized as natural nps or anthropogenic nps natural nps are formed by bio geochemical or mechanical processes without connection to human anthropogenic processes lespes et al 2020 anthropogenic nps including incidental and engineered nps are connected tightly to daily life as necessities to improve the performance of many consumer and industrial products ma et al 2023 notably some researchers found that anthropogenic nps were identified as a dominant fraction in natural samples e g ag ti based nps implying a great contribution of nps from human activities azimzada et al 2021 marine environment especially coastal bay is an important sink for terrestrial and atmospheric nps hochella et al 2019 in addition offshore anthropogenic activities e g marine aquaculture maritime transport petroleum industry and tourism input metal based nps into marine environments with potential environmental risk shah and mraz 2020 shingala et al 2020 to better understand the environmental risk of these metal based nps it is urgent to obtain their environmental concentrations in different marine areas nowadays single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms provides a powerful tool to quantify nps in environmental samples bolea et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 currently most of current studies focused on environmental distribution of nps in freshwater compartments e g lakes and rivers nabi et al 2023 wu et al 2020 for seawaters garner et al 2017 predicted the environmental concentrations of metal based nps in san francisco bay while labille et al 2020 detected the concentrations of two types of nps tio2 20 900 Î¼g l zno 1 15 Î¼g l in french mediterranean coast using icp ms with the assistance of filtration only three reports examined environmental distribution of metal based nps in seawaters by sp icp ms azimzada et al 2021 sanchÃ­s et al 2020 xu et al 2020 our previous study examined the concentrations of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawater from a single station of jiaozhou bay china xu et al 2020 ce and ti based nps were detected in mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean with the concentration ranges at 7 5 106 1 5 108 and 1 2 108 3 8 109 particles l respectively azimzada et al 2021 sanchÃ­s et al 2020 however only 1 3 concentration points were detected for each marine area in the above works no report focuses on the spatial distribution of metal based nps in a selected marine environment to our knowledge therefore to better understand the pollution characteristics of metal based nps it is necessary to systematically investigate their specific marine distribution towards a series of metal based nps metal based nps tend to homo or hetero aggregate in seawater and sink into marine sediments dai et al 2022 therefore their concentrations are hypothesized to be much higher than surface seawater however there is no report on the detection of metal based nps in marine sediments due to lack of effective approach to separate metal based nps from marine sediments for freshwater sediments three approaches are used for metal based nps separation i extracting metal based nps by tetrasodium pyrophosphate tspp as nps dispersant which is commonly considered as the best separation approach recovery range at 84 1 105 8 li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 schwertfeger et al 2017 ii directly separating by sedimentation tou et al 2021a and iii low speed centrifugation choleva et al 2020 for approach i the introduction of tspp significantly improved separation effectiveness in sediment samples however instrumental isobaric and or polyatomic interferences from tspp were currently reported jiang et al 2022 sedimentation and centrifugation approaches are based on the stokes separation law dominated by gravity and centrifugal force respectively liu et al 2021 lÃ³pez rodrÃ­guez et al 2022 but their applicability in marine sediments remains unknown compared to freshwater sediments marine sediments are obviously different in salinity organic matter ph and particle composition kuznetsova and timerbaev 2022 li et al 2012 which bring more difficulties to effectively separate metal based nps appropriate approach for metal based nps separation from marine sediments is thus urgently needed in this work we developed and optimized the separation of metal based nps and obtained their environmental distributions in marine sediments for the first time another knowledge gap is environmental risk of metal based nps in marine environment risk characterization ratio rcr offers a guidance for environmental risk assessment of metal based nps which is calculated by comparing the estimated exposure environmental concentration with a presumed safe concentration predicted no effect concentration pnec arvidsson 2018 environmental risk assessments in different freshwaters were assessed based on rcr coll et al 2016 however their environmental concentrations were predicted from environmental fate models based on global production volumes and contaminant transport patterns the predicted environmental concentration could deviate the actual concentrations in a specific area likely leading to inaccuracy in the obtained risk levels nowack et al 2015 parker and keller 2019 in addition there is scare information on the risk assessment of metal based nps towards marine environments therefore risk assessment will be conducted in this work by combining the detected actual concentrations of metal based nps and the calculated pnecs towards marine species also different types of nps could co exist in a specific marine region and co expose to marine species to fully assess the environmental risk induced by all these types of nps it is necessary to systematically assess the risk of a series of nps in this work laizhou bay as an important bay in the inner bohai sea of china with great potential to enrich metal based nps was selected as a target area ag au cu ti and zn based nps were selected as typical metal based nps in the present work and the objectives were to 1 develop an appropriate approach for the separation of these metal based nps from marine sediments and detection approaches for seawater and marine sediments 2 investigate spatial distributions of ag au cu ti and zn based nps in both surface seawaters and sediments of laizhou bay as well as their potential sources and 3 assess environmental risks of different metal based nps by rcrs the obtained results will be helpful for better understanding the pollution level and potential environmental risk of metal based nps in marine environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection laizhou bay a typical semi enclosed inner sea with poor water circulation is an important area for fisheries and the salt industry along the coastline there are more than 20 rivers including the second longest river in china the yellow river flowing into the bay surface seawater 22 stations and sediment samples 24 stations were collected in laizhou bay in may 2021 fig s1 at each sampling station 2 0 l of seawater samples were collected using a plastic niskin hydrophore from 1 m below the sea surface salinity temperature and ph of seawater were measured by a portable water quality monitor eureka water probes immediately table s1 the top 10 cm of sediment samples 5 0 kg were collected using a van veen grab in each station and then transferred to a plastic sealed bag after large stones and biomass removal both seawater and sediment samples were stored at 4 c before pretreatment 2 2 detection method of metal based nps in seawater standard au nps and commercial metal based nps ag tio2 cuo and zno were spiked into seawater to obtain the recoveries and size distributions all these metal based nps were characterized with transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100plus japan the detailed information e g manufacturers purities dispersants individual sizes and hydrodynamic diameters of the five nps is given in table s2 au tio2 cuo and zno nps were spiked into seawater with the concentration of 106 particles ml to obtain the recoveries and size distributions wu et al 2020 then nps spiked seawater samples were directly diluted by 10 or 50 times for sp icp ms analysis for ag nps frequency ion interference occurred during sp icp ms analysis in high ionic intensity liquid therefore cloud point extraction was used to enrich ag based nps e g ag agcl thio et al 2012 wimmer et al 2020 and avoid relative interference wimmer et al 2021 ag nps were added to seawater for spiked recovery analysis of cloud point extraction briefly 100 Âµl tx 114 10 sigma was added into 8 ml ag spiked seawater 10 mg l followed by bath incubation 40 c 40 min wimmer et al 2020 then the sample was centrifuged 4865 g 6 min to separate the organic phase and 600 Âµl ethanol aladdin was added to disperse organic phase finally the sample was diluted to 4 ml by deionized water and analyzed by sp icp ms after sonication 25 c 30 min the recoveries and size distributions of metal based nps were thus obtained based on the concentrations of standard and separated nps 2 3 separation of metal based nps from marine sediments au nps spiked recovery experiments were performed for suitable separation of metal based nps in marine sediments first to obtain au nps spiked sediments different sizes 28 0 0 9 50 3 2 3 and 102 2 2 3 nm in tem images fig s2 of au nps nanocomposix usa were spiked into marine sediments 10 0 g station 17 to achieve final concentrations of 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g then the separation of metal based nps from marine sediments was optimized based on the following three approaches i tspp extraction and sedimentation separation schwertfeger et al 2016 ii sedimentation separation tou et al 2021a and iii centrifugation separation choleva et al 2020 for approach i au spiked sediments 20 0 mg 4 108 particles g were suspended in tspp sigma solution 4 mm 8 ml at a 10 ml polypropylene centrifugal tube followed by bath sonication 25 c 30 min the suspension was settled for 20 h and 1 2 cm supernatant below the liquid surface was taken for sp icp ms analysis schwertfeger et al 2017 meanwhile possible instrumental interference from tspp in approach i was examined briefly two concentrations au nps 2 5 104 and 1 0 105 particles ml 50 nm were respectively added to deionized water and 4 mm tspp for sp icp ms analysis in addition direct separation approaches by sedimentation ii and centrifugation iii were optimized in detail marine sediments with different masses 5 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 30 0 and 40 0 mg were suspended in 8 ml deionized water at 10 ml centrifugal tubes to obtain different sediment water ratios g ml 1 1600 1 800 1 530 1 400 1 270 1 200 after sedimentation 1 2 3 4 8 10 h for approach ii and centrifugation 10 20 40 60 80 100 g separation for approach iii the supernatants 1 2 cm below the liquid surface were sampled for sp icp ms analysis to obtain optimal water sediment ratio for the two approaches after optimal separation parameters were obtained spiked recoveries of au standard nps with different sizes 30 50 100 nm and concentrations 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g in marine sediments were calculated for approach ii and iii respectively optimal separation approach was obtained based on the recovery and size distribution finally 10 mg ag zno tio2 and cuo nps sigma average sizes at 26 5 55 7 87 6 and 68 1 nm based on tem images in fig s3 were spiked into marine sediments 10 0 g separation recoveries of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps from spiked marine sediments were thus obtained based on eq 1 1 r e c o v e r y c m c 0 v d m c s 100 where cm and c0 are the detected particle concentration of separated 1 2 cm supernatant in spiked and none spiked nps sediments particles ml v is the volume of the supernatant ml d is the dilution factor 1 100 of each supernatant m is the mass of nps spiked sediments g and cs is the standard particle concentration particles g of nps in sediments 2 4 sp icp ms icp ms analysis for seawater the samples after dilution 10 times for au and cu based nps 50 times for ti and zn based nps or cloud point extraction ag based nps were sonicated in water bath 25 c 30 min and then analyzed by sp icp ms perkinelmer nexion 350d inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a syngistix nano application module version 2 3 the operating parameters of sp icp ms analysis were summarized in table s3 the calculation of transport efficiency during sp icp ms analysis is described in text s1 supplementary material the chemical compositions of the ag au cu ti and zn based nps were assumed to be ag au cuo tio2 and zno nps and the shapes of nps were assumed to be spheres the instrumental concentration detection limits for ag au cu ti and zn based nps were 45 104 45 35 and 61 particles ml respectively for marine sediments the samples were freeze dried homogenized with an agate mortar and passed through a 20 mesh stainless steel sieve 0 85 mm to remove small stones and biomass then metal based nps were separated in supernatant by the optimized approach in section 2 3 the parameters of sp icp ms for sediment sample analysis were the same as seawater samples the detected particle concentrations particles l of all the five metal based nps in seawaters and sediments in laizhou bay were converted to mass concentration Âµg l and the detailed conversion approach is described in text s2 in addition engineered nps au ag cuo tio2 and zno with the known individual sizes table s2 were used to confirm the accuracy of particle number mass conversion by comparing their converted particle concentrations and particle concentrations obtained from sp icp ms fig s4 moreover the total concentrations of ag au cu ti and zn in all the seawater and sediment samples were measured by icp ms before measurements seawater samples were acidified with hno3 to ph 2 sediment samples 100 mg were digested with hno3 hclo4 hf mixture 7 ml 5 1 1 in a microwave digestion system gem mars 6 usa 2 5 environmental risk assessment of metal based nps in laizhou bay risk quotient method was selected to assess the environmental risk of metal based nps which was calculated by eq 2 based on pnec and detected environmental concentration ec Âµg l coll et al 2016 2 r c r e c p n e c to calculate pnec of metal based nps marine ecotoxicological endpoints of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps from different marine organism species 37 genera 52 species were collected from the published literature to construct species sensitive distributions ssds curves in detail marine ecotoxicological endpoints for ag cuo tio2 and zno nps were obtained from the literature which included median lethal concentration lc50 median effect concentration ec50 20 10 effect concentration ec20 ec10 lowest observed effect concentrations loec and no observed effect concentration noec due to the lack of noec in most literature ecotoxicological endpoints of marine organisms were transformed into noec by dividing two different assessment factors afs and the detailed description is provided in text s3 coll et al 2016 all collected data on the ecotoxicological endpoints were listed in table s4 the ssd curve was acquired by fitting the collected data using the chinese national ecological environment criteria calculation software species sensitivity distribution eec ssd zhang et al 2022 pnec value was regarded as 5th percentile of the distribution from the ssds curves rcr 0 01 0 01 rcr 0 1 0 1 rcr 1 and rcr 1 indicated minimal low medium and high risk for marine species respectively chen et al 2022 in addition these different types of metal based nps are co existing in marine environments including laizhou bay individual rcrs of the four metal based nps were thus summed rcrtotal to fully assess the environmental risk after co exposure ren et al 2022 2 6 quality assurance and quality control metal related materials were avoided to minimize the introduction of metal based nps and avoid potential contamination during sampling and storage strict quality control procedures were implemented throughout the laboratory analysis process as well transparent glass and plastic containers are used for sample pretreatment instrumental and experimental blanks were analyzed periodically and blank concentrations 270 312 405 665 and 549 particles ml for ag au cu ti and zn based nps respectively were subtracted from actual samples to overcome instrumental contamination sample cross contamination and air contamination 2 7 statistical analysis for each experiment four independent samples were respectively treated for sp icp ms analysis statistical differences were determined using spss 26 0 by one way analysis of variance anova followed by a least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 for the statistical significance sampling station maps and spatial inverse distance weight interpolation analysis on environmental concentrations of metal based nps were performed by arcgis 10 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection approaches of metal based nps in seawaters and marine sediments engineered nps including au ag cuo tio2 and zno were used for recovery detection and the surface morphology and individual sizes were characterized with tem individual sizes of these nps figs s2 and s3 were consistent with those obtained from sp icp ms measurements figs s5 and s6 for seawater samples the high recoveries of 96 7 2 1 and 101 4 3 2 were obtained for au np at 1 105 and 2 104 particles l respectively fig s5a and b for ag based nps cloud point extraction was proven as an effective extraction approach with a high recovery at 90 4 12 8 fig s5c similarly high recoveries of 95 0 10 3 96 7 4 2 and 96 2 2 9 were obtained for cuo tio2 and zno respectively fig s6 thus these results ensured the reliability of sp icp ms method for metal based nps analysis in seawater the separation approach of metal based nps from marine sediments was optimized based on the three reported approaches used for freshwater sediments for approach i tspp extraction and sedimentation separation higher recovery of standard au nps was obtained by tspp extraction 90 1 1 3 than deionized water 34 9 9 1 after 20 h sedimentation fig s7a and b as an additional chemical extractant possible detection interference from tspp was further evaluated known concentrations 2 5 105 and 10 105 particles ml of 50 nm au nps were spiked to tspp solution 4 mm and ultrahigh recoveries 316 1 and 224 1 respectively were obtained fig s7c and d this suggested detection interference of metal based nps caused by tspp which was probably because of the interference from 123na 231p and 716o in tspp during the determination of 197au the presence of tspp should be the reason for the high recovery of approach i fig s7a but this approach is not applicable for this work tspp is commonly used for the dispersion of nps during sp icp ms analysis we thus conclude that it is necessary to verify exclude possible interferences from tspp otherwise the obtained np concentrations could be higher than actual concentrations and the environmental risk of nps may be overestimated approach ii direct sedimentation and approach iii centrifugation were conducted to separate au 50 nm 4 108 particles g from marine sediments for approach ii the optimal sediment water ratio and sedimentation time were 1 530 g ml and 2 h with the recovery at 66 28 1 98 fig 1 a and b for approach iii the optimal sediment water ratio and centrifugal force were 1 1600 g ml and 20 g with the recovery at 76 27 4 27 fig 1d and e to further compare the separation efficiencies of the two approaches au nps with different sizes 30 50 and 100 nm and concentrations 0 04 108 0 2 108 4 108 6 108 8 108 particles g were spiked in marine sediments and the recoveries were obtained fig 1c and f for the two approaches the recoveries of low concentration au nps 0 04 108 and 0 2 108 particles g were lower than that au nps at high concentrations 4 108 6 108 and 8 108 particles g in addition approach iii was better to separate au nps than approach ii especially for au nps at low concentrations furthermore 100 nm au nps were used for particle size analysis and it is showed that the individual sizes 97 7 0 4 nm of the collected au nps from approach iii were closer to the standard au nps 102 2 2 3 nm than approach ii 93 7 2 5 nm fig s8 therefore approach iii was better for au nps separation and particle size detection than approach ii in our work furthermore approach iii was used to separate commercially available metal based nps ag tio2 cuo and zno from marine sediments under the optimal separation conditions sediment water ratio 1 1600 centrifugal force 20 g the recoveries of ag tio2 cuo and zno nps were 72 37 81 12 85 77 and 84 62 respectively fig 1g and h there are only a few reports using sedimentation tou et al 2021a and centrifugation approaches mahdi et al 2017 huang et al 2021 without tspp extraction the recoveries in this work were significantly higher than the reported centrifugation approach 41 64 for ag nps and 65 for au nps and similar to the reported optimal sedimentation approach 71 4 for ag nps and 81 1 for au nps in addition the size distributions of the spiked nps separated from marine sediments were consistent with the spiked nps fig s9 therefore the optimized approach iii could separate the five types of metal based nps from sediments efficiently moreover the size ranges of sediment particles in the supernatant after centrifugation separation were reduced from 0 5 to 300 Âµm to 0 5 20 Âµm which could avoid instrument blockage problems 100 Âµm during the detection procedure fig s10 therefore optimized centrifugation separation approach iii was utilized for sp icp ms analysis of metal based nps in marine sediment samples 3 2 environmental concentrations of metal based nps in seawaters and sediments of laizhou bay using optimized approach iii the particle concentrations of ag cu ti zn and au based nps in seawater 24 stations and sediments 22 stations of laizhou bay are shown in fig 2 for seawater particle concentrations of ti based nps were the highest among the five types of metal based nps for all 24 stations au based nps were not detected below the detection limit 1 04 105 particles l in all the stations the highest concentration of ti based nps could be due to i the production of ti based nps was the highest among all the metal based nps with global production of 2 5 million tons per year by 2025 zhu et al 2022 and ii ti containing minerals are commonly distributed in natural environments gondikas et al 2014 the concentrations of metal based nps in station 2 were significantly higher 1 2 orders of magnitudes than other stations with the particle concentrations at 7 56 107 7 01 107 2 21 1010 and 7 16 108 particles l for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively station 2 is around the estuary of the yellow river indicating transport potential of metal based nps in other stations the descending order of average metal based nps concentrations was ti based nps mean 1 75 108 particles l range 5 75 107 to 9 73 108 particles l zn based nps 3 79 107 particles l 0 60 107 to 1 27 108 particles l ag based nps 1 27 107 particles l 0 56 107 to 2 29 107 particles l cu based nps 0 65 107 particles l 0 04 107 to 2 91 107 particles l fig 2a d for mass concentration in seawaters the ranges for ag cu ti and zn based nps assuming ag cuo tio2 zno were 4 77 125 95 ng l median 12 06 ng l 0 73 62 95 ng l median 7 18 ng l 0 20 199 37 Âµg l median 0 82 Âµg l and 14 04 997 77 ng l median 32 56 ng l respectively the average mass concentrations of the four nps followed the same order with the particle concentration results fig 2a d for marine sediments ti based nps showed higher particle concentrations than other nps for all the stations interestingly au nps were detected in 9 of 22 stations and for each station the concentration of au based nps was the lowest among all the five types of nps fig s11 these results in sediments are in agreement with seawater because nps especially engineered nps in sediments were originated from their deposition from surface seawater metreveli et al 2021 also the average particle concentrations of nps in sediments followed the order ti based nps mean 7 75 1012 particles kg range 3 70 1011 to 1 56 1013 particles kg zn based nps 1 61 1012 particles kg 1 38 1011 to 4 53 1012 particles kg ag based nps 8 16 1010 particles kg 3 36 108 to 8 08 1011 particles kg cu based nps 6 09 1010 particles kg 2 91 109 to 1 81 1011 particles kg au based nps 1 56 108 particles kg 4 74 107 to 3 41 108 particles kg fig 2e h for mass concentrations in sediments the ranges for ag cu ti zn and au based nps were 0 11 69 45 Âµg kg median 1 44 Âµg kg 1 68 102 35 Âµg kg median 45 35 Î¼g kg 1 02 122 66 mg kg median 27 30 mg kg 0 09 4 22 mg kg median 0 91 mg kg and 0 21 3 73 Âµg kg median 0 82 Î¼g kg respectively fig 2e h the reported concentrations of metal based nps in surface waters were summarized in table s5 and showed in fig 3 generally the concentrations of metal based nps in yellow river estuary station 2 and other 21 stations of laizhou bay in this work were within the range of previously reported nps concentrations among different surface waters oceans lakes and rivers for ag based nps the highest concentration was observed in kiessee lake 2 9 108 particles l germany azimzada et al 2021 which may be attributed to the fact that they located in large and populated cities however the concentrations of ti cu and zn based nps around yellow river estuary were the highest among all the surface waters and the input of natural nps from yellow river could contribute to the total nps amount fig 3 to our knowledge very few works investigated environmental concentrations of nps in sediments tou et al 2021b reported that ti and zn based nps in the freshwater sediments of yangtze river estuary were 3 02 1013 9 61 1013 particles kg and 2 74 1012 1 21 1013 particles kg respectively which is higher than the concentrations of these two nps in laizhou bay including yellow river estuary this is possibly because the yangtze river basin has more residents megalopolises and industrial areas than the yellow river delta and could potentially receive more metal based nps zhao et al 2019 it is noted that au nps were detected for the first time in the present work and they were indeed present in the sediments of laizhou bay 3 3 spatial distribution of metal based nps the spatial distributions of ag cu ti and zn based nps in laizhou bay are shown in fig 4 for seawaters the abundance of all the four metal based nps decreased with increasing distance from the yellow river estuary fig 4a d this result suggested that the yellow river was a crucial input and transport pathway for metal based nps to laizhou bay therefore the freshwater in the yellow river estuary was further sampled fig s1 and the sp icp ms results fig s12 showed that the particle concentrations of all the four metal based nps were higher than those in station 2 near yellow river estuary fig 2 which could support this hypothesis the yellow river basin supported 12 of the population 15 of agricultural land and 8 of the industrial land in china indicating frequent human activities xie et al 2022 in addition yellow river as one of the rivers with the highest suspended mineral particles in the world yin et al 2021 carries numerous natural nps those metal based nps in yellow river could eventually release into laizhou bay however the source analysis of metal based nps is extremely difficult some studies used sp icp tof ms to distinguish natural or anthropogenic nps by elemental ratio azimzada et al 2021 and isotopically labeled nps bland et al 2022 but it is hard to obtain the proportions of natural or anthropogenic nps due to many assumptions e g natural nps exhibit chemical heterogeneities while anthropogenic nps are pure and interferences e g unclear isotope characteristics for natural and anthropogenic nps high concentrations of metal based nps were also detected in some coastal stations ag based nps stations 11 18 cu based nps stations 16 18 zn based nps stations 16 17 which might be attributed to the inputs of other local rivers e g weihe river station 11 industrial and urban areas e g laizhou city stations 16 17 ports and aquaculture areas stations 17 18 for sediments ag based nps were mainly enriched in the area around yellow river estuary stations 2 3 and 6 which was consistent with the spatial distribution of seawater fig 4a and e this result indicated that ag based nps in the sediments were mainly originated from the aggregation and sedimentation of nps in seawater because of high salinity 2 83 31 89 table s1 for station 23 the concentration of ag based nps was relatively high in the sediment while low in seawater compared with other stations which is probably due to the dilution of freshwater input from jiehe river fig 4a and e higher cu based nps concentrations were detected in the northern laizhou bay stations 1 5 12 and 13 one potential reason was the transport of bohai sea surface current because of the strong interaction between the bohai sea center and the northern laizhou bay fig s13 which may be caused by the transport of nps from the northern coastal cities tianjin hebei areas with the assistance of ocean current in bohai sea qi et al 2021 for ti based nps except for high accumulation in station 2 nearby yellow river estuary they tended to enrich in stations 3 19 which were near dongying city and wanghe river respectively for zn based nps high concentrations were detected in the stations of northern laizhou bay stations 5 12 13 and 14 and near dongying city station 3 average individual sizes of metal based nps in laizhou bay are shown in fig 5 the size ranges of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawaters were 48 5 67 2 53 2 109 1 106 3 161 0 and 57 0 132 5 nm respectively the individual sizes in sediments were generally smaller than seawaters with the size ranges at 25 0 39 4 46 8 85 1 85 0 160 2 and 58 6 78 7 nm for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively the detected size of metal based nps was consistent with the commercial nanomaterials in nanoproducts including personal care products e g tio2 zno food additives e g tio2 ag packaging materials e g tio2 and agricultural fungicides e g cuo suggesting the potential source of metal based nps from daily life activities de la calle et al 2017 li et al 2022 suwanroek et al 2022 the determined average sizes of nps especially ag based nps in sediments were generally smaller than that in seawaters 100 90 9 77 3 and 72 7 of total stations for ag cu ti and zn based nps respectively which could be explained by two reasons i higher concentration of organic matter in sediments than seawaters contributed to the stronger dissolution of nps e g zno cuo ag and higher abundance of metal organic matter complexes in sediments liu et al 2020 and ii metal based nps may be dissolved to free metal ions or transformed to other metal based nps e g ag to ag2s and agcl cuo to cus and cu2s by marine microorganisms with higher abundance in sediments miao et al 2015 the transformation could also undergo in the upper layers of sediments due to the presence of sulfur and organic matter levard et al 2012 total concentrations of metals in both seawaters and sediments of all the stations were measured tables s6 and s7 total au was below the detection limit in all the samples which is in agreement with our finding that au nps were not detected in these samples for each station the fractions of ag cu ti and zn based nps in seawater samples were significantly higher than those in sediment samples fig s14 confirming stronger dissolution of metal based nps in sediments 3 4 environmental risk assessment of metal based nps for au based nps the environmental risk was minimal in laizhou bay because they were below the detection limit in seawater for ag cu ti and zn based nps toxicological data of ag cuo tio2 and zno nps the most common types in nano products to marine species were collected to obtain their pnecs ssds curves were constructed by 121 toxicity endpoint values involving 52 marine species fig 6 a d and table s4 ag nps showed the lowest pnecs 72 8 ng l followed by zno 2 66 Âµg l cuo 7 83 Âµg l and tio2 nps 72 0 Âµg l table s8 the obtained pnecs of the four metal nps for marine species showed no obvious difference with freshwater species table s9 combined with the detected environmental concentrations of metal based nps and pnecs of engineered nps the rcrs in laizhou bay were calculated fig 6e h ag based nps had the highest environmental risk in the laizhou bay among the four nps with 1 16 and 5 of 22 stations assessed as high rcr 1 medium 0 1 rcr 1 and low risk 0 01 rcr 0 1 respectively fig 6e the risk levels of cu based nps in all stations were minimal rcr 0 01 fig 6f and this is because the environmental concentrations 0 73 62 95 ng l were much lower than other types of nps ti based nps in station 2 were assessed as high risk while the risks in other stations were low 12 of 22 stations and minimal 9 of 22 stations fig 6g for zn based nps 1 12 and 9 of 22 stations were assessed medium risk low risk and minimal risk respectively fig 6h in other stations the average rcrs followed the order of ag based nps mean 0 19 range 0 07 0 42 zn based nps 0 02 5 28 10 3 0 06 ti based nps 0 02 2 77 10 3 0 10 cu based nps 1 04 10 3 9 43 10 5 4 58 10 3 fig 6e h garner and keller 2014 also found that the risks of ag and zno nps were higher than tio2 cuo and au nps in marine environments for freshwaters most rcrs of metal based nps were below 1 wigger et al 2020 and only one report observed that the rcrs 1 03 1 10 of ag nps in the surface waters of europe were higher than 1 gottschalk et al 2009 in the present work ag nps showed high risk rcr 1 73 only at station 2 around the yellow river estuary among the 22 stations these results suggested comparative risks between marine and freshwater environments and the environmental risk of ag based nps should be paid more attention due to the lack of toxicological data in marine sediments environmental risk of metal based nps in sediments cannot be assessed currently the obtained nps contents in marine sediments fig 2 in this work will be helpful for assessing environmental risk in sediments when the toxicological data are adequate the obtained rcrs for individual types of metal based nps as assessed by risk quotient method could be further influenced by the environmental processes factors i metal based nps would inevitably undergo environmental transformation in aquatic environment zhao et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 vignardi et al 2023 for example ag nps could be partly transformed to agcl with lower toxicity in the presence of cl cervantes avilÃ©s et al 2019 li et al 2020 and may also transform to low solubility ag2o in oxidative conditions and ag2s in sulfur rich natural environments zhang et al 2018 cu nps could also undergo transformation in marine environments and the toxicity to marine phytoplankton dunaliella tertiolecta was lower after transformation aging vignardi et al 2023 thus the actual environmental risk in laizhou bay is likely lower if the transformation process is considered ii organic matter in laizhou bay ranges at 6 31 9 74 mg l wang et al 2022 actually a number of studies focused on the effect of organic matter on nanotoxicity and most of these works observed toxicity mitigation by organic matter due to the masking of the nps surface by the coated organic matter wang et al 2016 noventa et al 2018 liang et al 2022 iii mineral particles are abundant in laizhou bay especially yellow river estuary which could also decrease the toxicity of metal based nps due to heteroaggregation in aquatic environments zhao et al 2021 huynh et al 2014 kansara et al 2020 therefore the environmental risk may be lower if we consider these environmental factors in addition the toxicological data and pnecs of ag cu ti and zn based nps were obtained from most widely used engineered nps ag cuo tio2 and zno respectively in their pure forms however the detected metal based nps in laizhou bay by sp icp ms would include both natural and engineered nps although the proportions were not identified natural nps are commonly less toxic than engineered nps due to less active surface sharma et al 2015 therefore the environmental risk should be lower if we consider the presence of natural nps in laizhou bay moreover these detected metal based nps are co existing in laizhou bay and could co expose to marine organisms thus rcrtotal values of all the four metal based nps were thus calculated to fully assess the co exposure environmental risk ren et al 2022 station 2 around yellow river estuary showed the highest rcrtotal 3 77 induced by the four types of metal based nps 1 20 and 1 of all the 22 stations were assessed as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively fig 6i ag based nps had the highest contribution 81 7 to the environmental risks followed by zn 8 9 ti 8 9 and cu based nps 0 5 fig 6j in addition to these four nps other metal based nps e g ceo2 cds and carbon based nps e g graphene carbon nanotubes could be also present in laizhou bay and the environmental risk from the whole categories of nps seems to be higher it is noted that the interaction e g heteroaggregation between two types of nps inevitably occurs in aquatic environments for example zno and tio2 nps may form heteroaggregates in aquatic phase thus causing antagonistic toxicity to bacteria escherichia coli and aeromonas hydrophila tong et al 2015 the same aggregation induced toxicity mitigation was observed between cuo and tio2 nps joÅko et al 2017 in addition metal based nps could be dissolved in the incubation system and the released metal ions e g cu2 may act as cofactors to activate enzymes and mitigate oxidative stress as caused from another type of nps liu et al 2022 therefore the environmental risk of the four nps as indicated by rcrs may be overestimated however synergistic toxicity to daphnia magna was observed between cu and zno nps due to enhanced dissolution of zno by cu nps in the presence of natural organic matter yu et al 2022 therefore the interaction between different types should be better understood to fully assess their environmental risk 4 conclusions in this work we examined the concentration and distribution of metal based nps au ag cu ti and zn based nps in laizhou bay as well as their environmental risks the centrifugation separation approach was firstly optimized to separate and enrich metal based nps from marine sediments and high detection recoveries were obtained with sp icp ms technique the four metal based nps ti zn ag cu were detected in all the surface water stations and the proportions of anthropogenic and natural nps were not identified ti based nps had the highest particle concentrations for all the 22 stations in laizhou bay the average concentrations of metal based nps were in a descending order of ti zn ag cu based nps in both seawaters and sediments the highest abundance of metal based nps was observed around yellow river estuary possibly contained numerous natural nps in the yellow river based on rcr analysis ag based nps showed the highest environmental risk with 1 16 and 5 of 22 stations assessed as high risk medium risk and low risk respectively one station around yellow river estuary was assessed as high risk for both ag and ti based nps environmental risk of the four types of nps after co exposure was assessed one surface water station station 2 around yellow river estuary was classified as high risk while 20 and 1 stations were at the levels of medium risk and low risk respectively this study offers effective approaches to separate and detect metal based nps in marine environments which may help to map the environmental distribution of metal based nps in global marine areas the risk assessment conducted in this work is an attempt to better understand the risk of metal based nps in marine environments and would also provide useful information to environmental nanotoxicology

14678,concerns over human health risks associated with chemical contaminants micropollutants in drinking waters are rising due to the increased use of reclaimed water or water supplies impacted by upstream wastewater discharges ultraviolet uv driven advanced oxidation processes uv aops using radiation sources that emit at 254 nm have been developed as advanced treatments to degrade contaminants while those uv aops can be improved towards higher radical yields and lower byproduct formation several previous studies have suggested that far uvc radiation 200 230 nm is a promising radiance source to drive uv aops because the direct photolysis of micropollutants and production of reactive species from oxidant precursors can both be improved in this study we summarize from the literature the photodecay rate constants of five micropollutants by direct uv photolysis which are higher at 222 than 254 nm we experimentally determine the molar absorption coefficients at 222 and 254 nm of eight oxidants commonly used in water treatment and present the quantum yields of the oxidant photodecay our experimental results also show that the concentrations of ho cl and clo generated in the uv chlorine aop can be increased by 5 15 15 76 and 2 86 fold respectively by switching the uv wavelength from 254 to 222 nm we also point out the challenges of applying far uvc for micropollutant abatement in water treatment including the strong light screening effect of matrix components e g carbonate nitrate bromide and dissolved organic matter the formation of byproducts via new reaction pathways and the needs to improve the energy efficiency of the far uvc radiation sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants far uvc advanced oxidation process photochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction micropollutants e g pesticides endocrine disrupting compounds disinfection byproducts and pharmaceuticals that have negative health impacts are increasingly identified in drinking waters derived from reclaimed municipal wastewater or surface waters impacted by upstream wastewater discharges their presence in drinking water supplies is mainly due to their poor removal by conventional wastewater treatment processes tong et al 2022 uv radiation driven advanced oxidation processes aops which combine uv irradiation with oxidant precursors e g h2o2 and chlor am ines have been proposed and studied at bench scale for degradation of micropollutants in water rosenfeldt et al 2006 wang et al 2019 and are now commonly used within advanced treatment trains for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater marron et al 2019 low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamps are dominant radiation sources used to drive uv aops because they are cheap effective and commercially available in market ijpelaar et al 2010 however the utilization of the photons and chemicals are inefficient in the lp mp uv driven aops many emerging contaminants cannot be directly photodecomposed by direct uv photolysis at 254 nm uv254 or longer uv wavelengths and even at the very high uv fluence applied in potable reuse trains 1000 mj cm 2 only 10 of the hydrogen peroxide is converted to radicals chuang et al 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2006 zhang et al 2019b krypton chloride excimer krcl lamps which are characterized by a primary emission peak centered at approximately 222 nm uv222 have emerged as a promising far uvc radiation source for air and surface disinfection during the covid 19 pandemic blatchley et al 2022 uv222 is highly effective for inactivation of pathogens because both nucleic acids and proteins have high absorption at 222 nm and safer to human skin and eye tissues than conventional uv254 because uv222 does not substantially penetrate the stratum corneum or the corneal epithelium blatchley et al 2022 the use of short wavelength uv radiation in water treatment has been reported in a few previous studies for example the loss of viral including adenovirus infectivity in water was largely enhanced by uv irradiation at wavelength 240 nm due to the damage on viral proteins beck et al 2018 2015 2014 hull and linden 2018 in addition to disinfection a few previous studies also reported the enhancement to organic contaminant degradation by using short wavelength uv radiation provided by mercury free vacuum vuv and uv excilamps aseev et al 2021 matafonova and batoev 2012a oppenlÃ¤nder and sosnin 2005 payne et al 2022 among those unconventional radiation sources krcl lamps are promising alternatives to lp mp uv lamps to drive uv aops because direct far uvc photolysis of micropollutants and the production of reactive species from far uvc photolysis of oxidant precursors can be efficient this is because the photon energy at 222 nm 539 kj einstein 1 is higher than at 254 nm 471 kj einstein 1 leading to greater likelihood of breaking chemical bonds during 222 nm photolysis additionally many micropollutants and oxidant precursors have higher molar absorption coefficients and or quantum yields at 222 nm than at 254 nm payne et al 2022 in addition krcl lamps possess several advantages over other commonly used and available uv radiation sources unlike conventional low pressure mercury uv lamps excimer lamps are mercury free and have a short stabilization time 15 s and a wider range of form factors for reactor design murcia et al 2020 xenon excimer lamps and low pressure mercury lamps emit vacuum uv vuv radiation at 172 and 185 nm respectively crapulli et al 2014 however the penetration depth of vuv radiation into water is very low 36 Î¼m and 5 6 mm at 172 and 185 nm respectively afzal et al 2010 which constrains their application in large scale water treatment the negligible uv absorbance of water at Î» 200nm allows greater penetration of uv222 radiation into pure water than that of vuv radiation quickenden and irvin 2008 on the other hand the matrix components e g nitrate carbonate and dissolved organic matter in natural water usually have high absorption at uv region 240 nm the light screening impacts of those matrix components at 222 nm might be stronger than that at 254 nm but weaker than that at 172 185 nm due to these features of far uvc and published results from initial studies using this technology for contaminant transformation matafonova et al 2011 matafonova and batoev 2012a payne et al 2022 popova et al 2019 matafonova and batoev 2012b sizykh et al 2022 we believe that far uvc poses a great potential to be applied for micropollutant abatement in water treatment and reuse in this work we present the data collected from literature about direct uv photolysis of organic contaminants at 222 and 254 nm we experimentally determine the molar absorption coefficients of eight oxidants commonly used in water treatment and present their quantum yields of photodecay at 222 and 254 nm we determine and report the radical concentrations in a representative uv chlorine aop at 222 and 254 nm meanwhile the challenges of using far uvc including the vulnerability towards water matrix and the formation of undesired byproducts are also discussed the future research needs are proposed according to the discussion 2 direct uv photolysis of emerging contaminants many micropollutants can be more rapidly photodecomposed by uv222 than uv254 payne et al 2022 a few previous papers reported the time based rate constants for photodecomposition of organic contaminants at 222 and 254 nm in deionized water liu et al 2016 matafonova et al 2011 payne et al 2022 sakai et al 2012 shen et al 1995 we collected the time based rate constants and normalized the data by the uv fluence rate reported in the same literature to provide fluence based rate constants in table 1 the fluence based rate constants of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp by uv222 photolysis were higher than those by uv254 photolysis by factors of 4 23 31 27 1 53 and 47 80 respectively table 1 a recent study also reported that the fluence based rate constant of p chlorobenzoic acid pcba a frequently used probe compound in aop studies was 5 08 times higher by uv222 photolysis than by uv254 photolysis payne et al 2022 these enhancements can be attributed to the much higher molar absorption coefficients of these organic contaminants at 222 nm than those at 254 nm table 1 since the quantum yields were slightly higher comparable at 222 nm than 254 nm except 2 4 dcp the photon energy of uv222 is higher than the average bond dissociation energies bde of almost all single bonds except h f bond and many double bonds e g o o bonds and n n bonds kildahl 1995 assuming that organic contaminants have high absorption at 222 nm the differences between the photon energy and the bdes suggest that direct uv222 photolysis can lead to the cleavage of chemical bonds in many organic contaminants however knowledge of the fundamental photochemical properties e g molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields and the corresponding fluence based rate constants by uv222 photolysis remain uncharacterized for many micropollutants notably the bond dissociation energy of the c f bond around 530 kj mol 1 is higher than the photon energy of uv254 471 kj einstein 1 but lower than the photon energy of uv222 539 kj einstein 1 suggesting that the c f bond cannot be photolyzed by direct uv254 photolysis but could possibly be photodecomposed by direct uv222 photolysis this suggests that far uvc may represent a new tool to combat forever chemicals e g per and polyfluoroalkyl substances also referred as pfas a previous study demonstrated the feasibility of using a polychromatic xenon mercury lamp emitting light in the range of 220 460 nm to decompose perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa by direct photolysis hori et al 2004 while the efficiency and energy requirement for pfas decomposition by the krcl excimer lamps still needs investigation 3 far uvc driven aops uv222 might be more efficient than uv254 in degrading emerging contaminants by promoting reactive species generation in uv aops because of higher molar absorption coefficients and or quantum yields of oxidant precursors at 222 nm than at 254 nm a few previous studies have evaluated the degradation of organic contaminants by far uvc driven aops aristizÃ¡bal et al 2020 aseev et al 2021 budaev et al 2021 gomez et al 2012 2010 ikematsu et al 2004 matafonova and batoev 2012a murcia et al 2020 2012 payne et al 2022 popova et al 2019 sizykh et al 2022 the fluence based degradation rate constants of pcba in the far uvc h2o2 aop were reported to be 9 1 times higher than that in the uv254 h2o2 aop payne et al 2022 the fluence based degradation rate constants of bisphenol a and atrazine in the far uvc peroxydisulfate far uvc pds aop were 1 66 times and 34 85 times respectively higher than those in the uv254 pds aop aseev et al 2021 cai et al 2022 khan et al 2014 popova et al 2019 the higher degradation rate constants are also attributable to the higher radical yields from far uvc aops than uv254 aops in addition to greater direct photolysis by uv222 than uv254 a recent study demonstrated that the concentration of ho normalized by incident fluence rate in the far uvc h2o2 aop was 9 4 times greater than that in the uv254 h2o2 aop payne et al 2022 the authors attributed the higher yield of radicals in the far uvc h2o2 aop than the uv254 h2o2 aop to the much higher molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 222 nm Îµ222 99 m 1 cm 1 than that at 254 nm Îµ254 21 m 1 cm 1 payne et al 2022 the concentrations of ho and so4 in the far uvc pds aop were not reported nor compared with the uv254 pds aop besides h2o2 the absorption coefficients of some other oxidant precursors in water are greater at 222 nm than at 254 nm the molar absorption coefficients for hypochlorous acid hocl dichloramine nhcl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 peroxymonosulfate pms pds and no3 are experimentally determined to be 1 8 9 1 4 7 5 5 8 8 and 915 7 times respectively higher than those at 254 nm table 1 the quantum yields of photolysis of these oxidants at 222 nm are also generally higher than those at 254 nm table 1 these facts suggest that radical production from uv222 photolysis of these oxidant precursors can be more efficient than from uv254 photolysis we experimentally determined steady state radical concentrations in the far uvc chlorine and uv254 chlorine aops according to the degradation kinetics of several probe compounds e g nitrobenzene benzoic acid and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene this method has been widely used in determining radical concentrations in different aops cha et al 2022 hua et al 2019 payne et al 2022 yin et al 2020 the chlorine concentration barely changed over time supporting that the steady state assumption was valid fig 1 a the degradation of probe compounds by direct uv222 photolysis was slow under the experimental conditions with a pseudo first order rate constant of 2 49 10 5 4 14 10 5 and 6 81 10 5 s 1 for nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob respectively fig 1a those rate constants were deducted in the calculation of radical concentrations to make the calculation more accurate the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo ho ss cl ss and clo ss were normalized by the incident fluence rate einc to allow for comparison between different uv aop systems with varying output powers payne et al 2022 einc was calculated as in bolton and linden 2003 but without the water factor correction ho ss cl ss and clo ss normalized by einc in the far uvc chlorine aop were 5 15 15 76 and 2 86 times respectively higher than those in the uv254 chlorine aop in deionized water fig 1b these results support that far uvc aops are more efficient than uv254 aops in radical generation in deionized water 4 impacts of water matrix components the water matrix may affect far uvc aops differently than uv254 aops due to the differences in light screening impacts and reactive species generation at 222 nm chloride sulfate and bicarbonate have negligible or low absorption at 222 nm while carbonate bromide no3 and dissolved organic matter dom have high uv222 absorbance table 1 birkmann et al 2018 and may compete with contaminants and oxidant precursors for uv photons the molar absorption coefficients of dom investigated in this study at 222 nm are 1 28 1 55 times higher than those at 254 nm table 1 while these species contribute to the light screening effect and may adversely impact the performance of the far uvc aops they may also form reactive species which enhance contaminant degradation dom can be photolyzed and generate photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri chu et al 2016 the higher molar absorption coefficients of dom at 222 nm than those at 254 nm table 1 suggested that the generation of ppris i e singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet state excited sensitizers 3sens and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from dom might be promoted by uv222 which might further affect the ppri mediated transformation of dom uv222 photolysis of no3 generated ho which contributed to degradation of pcba under uv222 radiation payne et al 2022 ho ss normalized by einc in the far uvc no3 aop was 1 40 and 5 06 times respectively higher than those in the far uvc h2o2 payne et al 2022 and far uvc chlorine aops no3 5 mg l 1 as n h2o2 10 mg l 1 and chlorine 70 Î¼m suggesting that no3 might be a promising oxidant precursor for far uvc aop and no3 present in water might promote the radical generation in other far uvc aops average quantum yield of ho from no3 at neutral ph in the 200 240 nm range of wavelengths in clean water was reported to be 0 24 0 03 keen et al 2012 while the quantum yield of ho from no3 photolysis at 222 nm remains unknown in addition to ho reactive nitrogen species rns can be formed via uv photolysis of no3 keen et al 2012 sharpless and linden 2001 which may also contribute to contaminant degradation nitrite no2 formation from no3 photolysis might also be promoted by uv222 while whether no2 poses a significant problem during far uvc aop treatment of no3 containing water requires further investigation 5 conclusions and future perspectives due to the high photon energy of uv222 and high molar absorption coefficients and or quantum yields of micropollutants at 222 nm direct uv222 photolysis can contribute greatly to their degradation payne et al 2022 information about the degradation kinetics and quantum yields of micropollutants by direct uv222 photolysis are lacking in the literature and need to be acquired to guide the design of the uv reactors the structural reactivity relationship between the photodecay rates quantum yields and the chemical structure of organic contaminants are recommended to be examined to understand the structure dependence on the contaminant photo degradation compared to uv254 the reactive species generation from photolysis of oxidant precursors in far uvc aops can be promoted by uv222 payne et al 2022 the apparent and innate quantum yields of photolysis of different oxidant precursors and yields of reactive species by uv222 photolysis remain to be determined in this context kinetic models are useful in predicting the reactive species concentrations in the far uvc aops under varied conditions due to the high photon energy uv222 might lead to new pathways for cleavage of chemical bonds e g c f bond and may induce new elementary reactions and new types of reactive species compared to uv254 driven aops this shall be considered and examined in the construction of kinetic models to objectively compare the photodegradation kinetics or radical generation in far uvc aops and other uv aops driven by different uv radiation sources e g uv254 aops the uv fluence rate should be characterized for the different uv reactors payne et al 2022 in addition the geometry and operating conditions of different uv reactors used in lab scale or pilot scale studies should be well characterized and reported e g whether the excimer lamps were used with band pass filters the large variations in the reported wall plug efficiency 5 15 of the krcl lamps make it difficult to compare the energy based treatment efficiencies between krcl driven aops and the lp mp uv driven aops hull and linden 2018 a universal protocol for determining the wall plug efficiency and output power is recommended to be established moreover the commercial development of lamps capable of efficient emission of 222 nm light at pilot and full scale is needed the yields of reactive nitrogen species rns and photoinduced reactive intermediates e g 1o2 and 3dom from uv222 photolysis of nitrate and dom and their impacts on micropollutant degradation have yet to be explored payne et al 2022 the formation of dimeric byproducts

degradation of organic contaminants by far uvc driven aops aristizÃ¡bal et al 2020 aseev et al 2021 budaev et al 2021 gomez et al 2012 2010 ikematsu et al 2004 matafonova and batoev 2012a murcia et al 2020 2012 payne et al 2022 popova et al 2019 sizykh et al 2022 the fluence based degradation rate constants of pcba in the far uvc h2o2 aop were reported to be 9 1 times higher than that in the uv254 h2o2 aop payne et al 2022 the fluence based degradation rate constants of bisphenol a and atrazine in the far uvc peroxydisulfate far uvc pds aop were 1 66 times and 34 85 times respectively higher than those in the uv254 pds aop aseev et al 2021 cai et al 2022 khan et al 2014 popova et al 2019 the higher degradation rate constants are also attributable to the higher radical yields from far uvc aops than uv254 aops in addition to greater direct photolysis by uv222 than uv254 a recent study demonstrated that the concentration of ho normalized by incident fluence rate in the far uvc h2o2 aop was 9 4 times greater than that in the uv254 h2o2 aop payne et al 2022 the authors attributed the higher yield of radicals in the far uvc h2o2 aop than the uv254 h2o2 aop to the much higher molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 222 nm Îµ222 99 m 1 cm 1 than that at 254 nm Îµ254 21 m 1 cm 1 payne et al 2022 the concentrations of ho and so4 in the far uvc pds aop were not reported nor compared with the uv254 pds aop besides h2o2 the absorption coefficients of some other oxidant precursors in water are greater at 222 nm than at 254 nm the molar absorption coefficients for hypochlorous acid hocl dichloramine nhcl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 peroxymonosulfate pms pds and no3 are experimentally determined to be 1 8 9 1 4 7 5 5 8 8 and 915 7 times respectively higher than those at 254 nm table 1 the quantum yields of photolysis of these oxidants at 222 nm are also generally higher than those at 254 nm table 1 these facts suggest that radical production from uv222 photolysis of these oxidant precursors can be more efficient than from uv254 photolysis we experimentally determined steady state radical concentrations in the far uvc chlorine and uv254 chlorine aops according to the degradation kinetics of several probe compounds e g nitrobenzene benzoic acid and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene this method has been widely used in determining radical concentrations in different aops cha et al 2022 hua et al 2019 payne et al 2022 yin et al 2020 the chlorine concentration barely changed over time supporting that the steady state assumption was valid fig 1 a the degradation of probe compounds by direct uv222 photolysis was slow under the experimental conditions with a pseudo first order rate constant of 2 49 10 5 4 14 10 5 and 6 81 10 5 s 1 for nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob respectively fig 1a those rate constants were deducted in the calculation of radical concentrations to make the calculation more accurate the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo ho ss cl ss and clo ss were normalized by the incident fluence rate einc to allow for comparison between different uv aop systems with varying output powers payne et al 2022 einc was calculated as in bolton and linden 2003 but without the water factor correction ho ss cl ss and clo ss normalized by einc in the far uvc chlorine aop were 5 15 15 76 and 2 86 times respectively higher than those in the uv254 chlorine aop in deionized water fig 1b these results support that far uvc aops are more efficient than uv254 aops in radical generation in deionized water 4 impacts of water matrix components the water matrix may affect far uvc aops differently than uv254 aops due to the differences in light screening impacts and reactive species generation at 222 nm chloride sulfate and bicarbonate have negligible or low absorption at 222 nm while carbonate bromide no3 and dissolved organic matter dom have high uv222 absorbance table 1 birkmann et al 2018 and may compete with contaminants and oxidant precursors for uv photons the molar absorption coefficients of dom investigated in this study at 222 nm are 1 28 1 55 times higher than those at 254 nm table 1 while these species contribute to the light screening effect and may adversely impact the performance of the far uvc aops they may also form reactive species which enhance contaminant degradation dom can be photolyzed and generate photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri chu et al 2016 the higher molar absorption coefficients of dom at 222 nm than those at 254 nm table 1 suggested that the generation of ppris i e singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet state excited sensitizers 3sens and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from dom might be promoted by uv222 which might further affect the ppri mediated transformation of dom uv222 photolysis of no3 generated ho which contributed to degradation of pcba under uv222 radiation payne et al 2022 ho ss normalized by einc in the far uvc no3 aop was 1 40 and 5 06 times respectively higher than those in the far uvc h2o2 payne et al 2022 and far uvc chlorine aops no3 5 mg l 1 as n h2o2 10 mg l 1 and chlorine 70 Î¼m suggesting that no3 might be a promising oxidant precursor for far uvc aop and no3 present in water might promote the radical generation in other far uvc aops average quantum yield of ho from no3 at neutral ph in the 200 240 nm range of wavelengths in clean water was reported to be 0 24 0 03 keen et al 2012 while the quantum yield of ho from no3 photolysis at 222 nm remains unknown in addition to ho reactive nitrogen species rns can be formed via uv photolysis of no3 keen et al 2012 sharpless and linden 2001 which may also contribute to contaminant degradation nitrite no2 formation from no3 photolysis might also be promoted by uv222 while whether no2 poses a significant problem during far uvc aop treatment of no3 containing water requires further investigation 5 conclusions and future perspectives due to the high photon energy of uv222 and high molar absorption coefficients and or quantum yields of micropollutants at 222 nm direct uv222 photolysis can contribute greatly to their degradation payne et al 2022 information about the degradation kinetics and quantum yields of micropollutants by direct uv222 photolysis are lacking in the literature and need to be acquired to guide the design of the uv reactors the structural reactivity relationship between the photodecay rates quantum yields and the chemical structure of organic contaminants are recommended to be examined to understand the structure dependence on the contaminant photo degradation compared to uv254 the reactive species generation from photolysis of oxidant precursors in far uvc aops can be promoted by uv222 payne et al 2022 the apparent and innate quantum yields of photolysis of different oxidant precursors and yields of reactive species by uv222 photolysis remain to be determined in this context kinetic models are useful in predicting the reactive species concentrations in the far uvc aops under varied conditions due to the high photon energy uv222 might lead to new pathways for cleavage of chemical bonds e g c f bond and may induce new elementary reactions and new types of reactive species compared to uv254 driven aops this shall be considered and examined in the construction of kinetic models to objectively compare the photodegradation kinetics or radical generation in far uvc aops and other uv aops driven by different uv radiation sources e g uv254 aops the uv fluence rate should be characterized for the different uv reactors payne et al 2022 in addition the geometry and operating conditions of different uv reactors used in lab scale or pilot scale studies should be well characterized and reported e g whether the excimer lamps were used with band pass filters the large variations in the reported wall plug efficiency 5 15 of the krcl lamps make it difficult to compare the energy based treatment efficiencies between krcl driven aops and the lp mp uv driven aops hull and linden 2018 a universal protocol for determining the wall plug efficiency and output power is recommended to be established moreover the commercial development of lamps capable of efficient emission of 222 nm light at pilot and full scale is needed the yields of reactive nitrogen species rns and photoinduced reactive intermediates e g 1o2 and 3dom from uv222 photolysis of nitrate and dom and their impacts on micropollutant degradation have yet to be explored payne et al 2022 the formation of dimeric byproducts

14679,hydrothermal liquefaction has the potential to exploit resources from municipal sewage sludge it converts most organics into a liquid biofuel biocrude concentrates p in the solid residue hydrochar and consequently enables its efficient recovery this study thoroughly evaluated the effects of extraction conditions on p and metal release from hydrochar by nitric acid among assessed factors acid normality 0 02 1 n liquid to solid ratio 5 100 ml g and contact time 0 24 h had positive effects while decreasing eluate ph 0 5 4 improved leaching efficiencies of p and metals notably eluate ph played a dominant role in p leaching and ph 1 5 was crucial for complete extraction p and metal leaching from hydrochar have strong interactions and their leaching mechanism was identified as product layer diffusion using the shrinking core model this suggests that the leaching efficiency is susceptible to agitation and particle size but not temperature using 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2

treatment plants xrd x ray diffraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is a life essential nutrient element that has been listed as a critical raw material in many countries e g eu it is a non renewable and non substitutable resource however its source phosphate rock reserves is only located in a few countries such as morocco and western sahara 72 of the world reserve liu et al 2021b many countries partially or entirely depend on imports of p resources and products the uneven distribution of phosphate rock has created political and economic risks on the other hand p discharge from waste sources such as wastewater is a major contributor to aquatic eutrophication causing severe environmental challenges huang et al 2017 therefore p recovery from p rich residues and its valorization provide a double benefit a geographically distributed secondary p source and environmental conservation municipal sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has gained much attention as a promising p source it is attractive for high levels of p 1 3 8 on a dry basis db large quantities 45 million dry tonnes year and readily available liu et al 2021a 2021b raw sludge contains high moisture up to 98 and its solids generally consist of 40 70 db of volatile matter and 20 50 db of ash including some contaminants such as pathogens organic pollutants heavy metals and micropollutants liu et al 2021a a promising technology hydrothermal liquefaction htl could promote nutrient recovery by converting the organic fraction into a liquid biofuel called biocrude and concentrating p in the solid residue named hydrochar shi et al 2019 using water as the reaction medium htl is particularly suitable for treating sludge and tackling its high moisture and low dewaterability basar et al 2021 htl is typically performed at a closed subcritical condition 280 374 c and 8 22 mpa that is milder than other thermochemical processes e g pyrolysis gasification and incineration after reaction organic matter is mostly transformed into petroleum like biocrude and some are dissolved in the process water called htl aqueous whereas minor carbonaceous material with most minerals is retained in hydrochar basar et al 2023 liu et al 2022 consequently the dry weight p concentration in hydrochar is around five times higher than that of feedstock sludge reaching up to 10 ovsyannikova et al 2020 this makes hydrochar comparable to low grade phosphate rock around 8 p fahimi et al 2021 however reusing hydrochar as a fertilizer is restricted for the excess content of accumulated heavy metals liu et al 2023 therefore p recovery represents an important state for resource sustainability and circular economy in recent years much attention has been given to the fate and transformation of p during hydrothermal treatment huang et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is generally agreed that 80 p from sludge is captured in hydrochar and major metals e g al ca and fe strongly affect p speciation and the subsequent recovery process standing on the experience of incinerated sewage sludge ash wet chemical extraction and precipitation have been identified as the most suitable approach for p recovery due to their cost effectiveness and environmental sustainability fahimi et al 2021 liu et al 2021b to date a few studies attempted to recover p from hydrochar using various extractants including inorganic acids h2so4 and hcl ovsyannikova et al 2020 pÃ©rez et al 2021 organic acids citric and oxalic acid becker et al 2019 ovsyannikova et al 2020 pÃ©rez et al 2022 and bases naoh and koh li et al 2020 ovsyannikova et al 2020 2019 acidic leaching is commonly used for its high efficiency high temperature htl typically transforms al fe bound phosphate into ca phosphate thus limiting the efficiency 70 of alkaline leaching liu et al 2021b besides acidic leaching can remove ash contents and thus enhance the reuse value of hydrochar residue as a solid fuel marin batista et al 2020 the reported extractants also have their limitations sulfuric acid is cheap but the process generates a large amount of gypsum and limits the reusability of hydrochar hydrochloric acid is efficient but corrosive and scarcely used industrially organic acids are too costly for industrial application bases are only applicable to al fe bound phosphate li et al 2020 soltani et al 2019 extraction is the critical step for p recovery but optimizing extraction conditions such as liquid to solid l s ratio extractant concentration leaching time and ph is rarely reported the leaching mechanisms of p and co leached metals from hydrochar are lacking in addition few studies investigated the precipitation of p from extract as interesting products struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o and k struvite mgkpo4 6h2o were recovered previously but they require expensive chemical input e g mgcl2 and face challenges of achieving the optimal stoichiometric ratio between the necessary elements becker et al 2019 li et al 2020 ovsyannikova et al 2020 therefore more robust p recovery processes for hydrochar should be developed to realize industrialization hydroxyapatite is a unique material for its wide application in agriculture biomedicine environmental remediation catalysis and energy storage pham minh et al 2014 it has relatively good sell values and requires cheap chemical input such as lime for production liu et al 2021b however the current studies about hydroxyapatite synthesis are limited to pure chemicals or sources with trace foreign elements agbeboh et al 2020 arokiasamy et al 2022 recovering p as hydroxyapatite from complex waste streams such as hydrochar is rarely reported and may face some challenges thus requiring attention recognizing the benefits of incorporating htl into wwtps liu et al 2022 and the promise of p recovery from hydrochar liu et al 2023 this study aims at developing suitable p recovery procedures for sludge derived hydrochar by wet chemical extraction and precipitation nitric acid was selected as the extractant for the following reasons efficient inexpensive widely used in industry no gypsum generation recoverable and recyclable banihashemi et al 2019 firstly the effects of various extraction conditions on the leaching of p and metals were assessed on hydrochar from one htl condition the interactions between p and metals were explained secondly the leaching kinetics and mechanisms were identified for the first time to assist the process optimization thirdly the challenges and insights of synthesizing hydroxyapatite from hydrochar leachate were unrevealed in particular the compositions of recovered products were examined using various techniques e g inductively coupled plasma fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray diffraction to produce qualified fertilizers ultimately the applicability of established p recovery procedures was validated by applying it to hydrochar samples obtained at different htl conditions temperatures pressures the results are important for wastewater utilities aiming to develop a robust htl process in tandem with p recovery with a clear safe ultimate disposal route for all product streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials municipal mixed primary and secondary sludge table s1 was obtained from a local wwtp in bc canada the wwtp has primary and two stage secondary biological treatment processes including trickling filters followed by solid contact tanks the mixed sludge was dewatered to 20 solids content through centrifugation hydrochar hc350 was produced from the dewatered sludge at an htl reaction temperature of 350 c for a residence time of 15 min a commonly reported condition marrone et al 2018 ovsyannikova et al 2020 after reaction htl aqueous was separated by centrifugation 4000 g for 15 min and filtration 20 Âµm from biocrude and hydrochar hydrochar was extracted from biocrude by washing

normality 0 02 1 n and contact time 0 24 h in each experiment 20 ml of extractant solutions with hydrochar samples were transferred into 30 ml polyethylene tubes the tubes were sealed and well shaken by an end over end rotator gfl 3040 at 20 1 rpm and room temperature 20 2 c after extraction and syringe filtration 0 45 Âµm p and metal contents in extracts were quantified by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes jobin yvon horiba ultima 2 the ph of the eluate was measured immediately the leaching efficiency Î· of p and metals can be calculated by dividing the total as shown in eq s1 see supplementary material all extraction experiments were completed at least in duplicates in each test two experimental blanks were performed on extractants in empty tubes 2 3 leaching kinetics after determining extracted p and metals the shrinking core model for constant particle size most commonly used in the literature was employed to identify the leaching mechanisms faraji et al 2020 it describes a solid liquid process in which leaching agents diffuse through the liquid film around the particle and solid product layer and react on the unreacted core surface however this model assumes that the shape and size of solid particles remain unchanged during the leaching process the effective diffusivity is constant and the reaction is first order and irreversible liddell 2005 the leaching agent should be excessive so that its concentration is constant which generally applies at a high l s ratio the following rate limiting steps can be identified during the leaching process and expressed by the apparent rate equations 1 liquid film diffusion x 1 Ï f t 2 product layer diffusion 1 3 1 x 2 3 2 1 x 1 Ï p t 3 chemical reaction 1 1 x 1 3 1 Ï r t where x Î· 100 is the conversion or ion leaching rate 0 1 at the leaching time t min Ï f Ï p and Ï r are the completion time min of each leaching step to determine which step controls the leaching rate significantly slower than the others the conversion side left of each equation versus time was plotted to obtain the best linear relationship by comparing their coefficients of determination r2 all linear fitting must fix the intercept at 0 i e 0 conversion at 0 time for a correct evaluation in some cases the rate limiting step cannot be clearly defined using a single mechanism or more than one step may control the rate simultaneously the following equation combining all three mechanisms was developed to estimate the time constants nazemi et al 2011 4 t Ï f x Ï p 1 3 1 x 2 3 2 1 x Ï r

to form a lime solution 30 g l p extracts were dosed dropwise to a pre determined amount of lime solutions based on ca p ratios the designated ph was achieved by injecting 2 m koh solutions after stirring at 300 rpm for 24 h at room temperature for maturation the mixture was centrifugated at 3000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was sampled and filtered through 0 45 Âµm syringe filters for the elemental analysis by icp oes the precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration 0 45 Âµm washed with 1 l type i water dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored at 4 c before analysis named hap ph the p precipitation efficiency ppe and overall p recovery efficiency pre were calculated using eqs s2 and s3 2 5 characterization of recovered precipitates the recovered p products were pulverized for xrd

filtration 0 45 Âµm syringe filters the extractable p was determined by icp oes 2 6 application of optimal recovery procedures at a different time mixed sludge was obtained from the same wwtp the sludge was dewatered to 20 solids content and processed at htl temperatures of 290 325 and 360 c 15 min residence time to produce different hydrochars of hc290 hc325 and hc360 respectively liu et al 2023 the optimal extraction and precipitation conditions were applied to those different hydrochar samples to validate the p recovery procedures 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochar composition the composition of hydrochar hc350 is shown in table 1 hydrochar had a high ash content 57 8 on a dry basis db with inorganic contents ranked as transition metals tms p alkaline earth metals aems post transition metals ptms alkali metals ams due to the major presence of fe hydrochar showed a high portion of naip 55 relative to tp while the great amount of ca bound ap indicated that acidic extraction would be more feasible than alkalic extraction for efficient p recovery hydrochar also contained excessive amounts of heavy metals e g mo and zn raising concerns for direct land application therefore p recovery for separating from heavy metals is necessary the xrd patterns fig s1 suggest that the major crystal phases in hydrochar were cordierite mg6 5feal15 5si19 3o76 9 diopside ca4mg3 6fe0 8si7 6o24 and enstatite al0 2fe1 2mg14 6si15 8o48 as agreed to previous studies liu et al 2021b 3 2 leaching tests for the evaluation of leaching behavior and extraction efficiency of p and metals the effects of l s ratio nitric acid concentration and leaching time were examined selected metals were presented in groups or families that are expected to have close behavior including aems ca and mg tms fe zn cu mn cr ni and mo and ptms al and pb those metals typically have strong affinities with phosphate 3 2 1 effect of l s ratio as shown in fig 1 a at constant acid normality 0 1 n and leaching time 24 h the release of p and metals significantly enhanced with increasing l s ratio 5 100 ml g while the eluate ph at the end of extraction decreased dramatically from 4 to 2 they all showed limited extraction 20 at a low l s 5 ml g notably the leaching efficiency of aems was much higher than p tms and ptms and p and aems reached nearly 100 extraction at 100 ml g final ph around 1 6 over 100 extraction was considered errors from inhomogeneous samples underestimated total and high dilution factors for analysis when fixing the eluate ph at 2 the l s ratio showed limited impacts on leaching efficiencies compared to fixed acid concentration fig 1b the leaching of aems remained above 80 whereas the sharp rise of other metals only occurred from 5 to 10 ml g with limited increase afterward this indicated that constraining final ph could strongly hinder the release of p tms and ptms at 10 100 ml g p and tms showed nearly the same leaching behaviors suggesting p was mainly released from compounds bound to tms e g iron phosphates however the p extraction at 100 ml g was still 60 suggesting a lower ph is necessary for efficient p recovery at both fixed acid concentration and eluate ph the overall release followed the order of aems p tms ptms implying that p leaching efficiency was probably regulated by tms and ptms analysis of variance showed that l s ratio had a significant effect p 0 007 on p release while eluate ph exhibited a much higher impact p 0 0001 3 2 2 effect of acid concentration the leaching of p and metals at different acid concentrations was investigated at 10 and 100 ml g for 24 h at 10 ml g the leaching of p and metals increased sharply by increasing acid concentration from 0 1 n to 0 6 n for more free h fig 2 a above 0 6 n eluate ph 1 4 p aems and tms reached the plateau or maximum while ptms continued leaching but the rate decreased another study also found that the leaching of p and metals from primary sludge derived hydrochar reached equilibrium at 0 4 1 n of sulfuric acid with an l s of 10 ml g ovsyannikova et al 2020 similarly at 100 ml g fig 2b the extraction efficiency of p and each metal group enhanced constantly by increasing acid normality from 0 02 n to 0 1 n for maximum leaching however the plateau region was not observed at 0 02 0 1 n for cost effectiveness 0 6 n and 0 1 n were considered the most suitable condition for p leaching at the l s of 10 and 100 ml g respectively when normalizing the acid consumption per sample amount as calculated by eq 7 there was a substantial difference between the two l s ratios fig 2 at the same acid consumption the leaching efficiency of p and metals were much higher at 10 ml g than those at 100 ml g the difference was attributed to the elevated ph by dilution factor 10 at the higher l s to achieve complete leaching of p 6 and 10 mmol of nitric acid per g of sample were needed at the l s of 10 and 100 ml g respectively therefore a lower l s ratio was more efficient and economical for p extraction 7 a c i d c o n s u m p t i o n m m o l g a c i d c o n c e n t r a t i o n m o l l l s m l g 3 2 3 effect of leaching time the influence of leaching time was evaluated at various l s ratios and hno3 concentrations fig 3 illustrates that the extraction of each element increased with leaching time and eventually achieved equilibrium within 2 h under both leaching conditions with the release of p and metals the eluate ph of leachate also increased and gradually reached a plateau at 10 ml g 0 6 n hno3 almost all p and aems and nearly 90 of tms and 60 of ptms were released at 2 h fig 3a under 100 ml g 0 1 n hno3 90 of p and aems 80 of tms and around 50 of ptms were extracted in 2 h fig 3b using h2so4 hcl and citric acid a few studies found the maximum p extraction from sludge derived hydrochar could be achieved within 2 h becker et al 2019 ovsyannikova et al 2020 most studies confirmed that 2 h is sufficient to leach most p from incinerated sewage sludge ash issa liu et al 2021b however using excessive acid 0 6 n hno3 and a high l s ratio 100 ml g significantly accelerated the leaching process to complete within 0 5 h fig 3c notably the initial leaching rate was much faster at a higher l s ratio or stronger acid normality under identical conditions which was probably linked to the lower ph notably leaching efficiencies of p and metal decreased after 2 h in fig 3a and b indicating adsorption or reprecipitation of metal phosphates during long term extraction ottosen et al 2013 therefore 2 h was considered the optimal leaching time nevertheless there is a compromise between complete leaching time and acid amount 3 2 4 dependency on ph the leaching efficiency of p was found to depend on the eluate ph at the end of extraction fig 4 a the fitting analysis suggested a logistic curve of p release in terms of eluate ph adjusted r2 0 99 p 0 05 regardless of the l s ratio at a leaching time of 24 h the p leaching efficiency was nearly 0 at a final ph 3 which improved sharply following an s curve with decreased ph until reaching the complete extraction at a ph 1 5 this finding agrees with a previous literature review which summarized that ph 2 is necessary to extract most p from sludge derived ash and hydrochar liu et al 2021b based on the eluate ph the reactions during leaching can be generalized into two steps shown by eq 8 and eqs 9 11 respectively liu et al 2021b which can be explained by the solubility product constant ksp and calculated molar solubility s of phosphates although ap and naip have low ksp values and thus low solubilities they could dissolve in sufficient acid since a little soluble po4 3 would protonate and form hydrogen phosphates and eventually phosphoric acid eqs 12 14 luyckx et al 2020 which promotes the dissolution based on the le chatelier s principle at a less acidic ph of 2 3 mainly calcium phosphates ca p dissolve as they have a higher molar solubility while aluminum al p and iron phosphates fe p only partially dissolve he et al 2020 for ph 2 more ferrous aluminum and ferric phosphates could solubilize and p leaching efficiency enhanced steeply until fully soluble by enough acid this is in line with a previous study that most p was released from alpo4 at ph 1 toor and kim 2019 over 55 of naip in hydrochar suggested that only an eluate ph 1 5 could achieve the full extraction of p the xrd analysis of hydrochar residue after leaching fig s1a confirmed that high intensity al and fe minerals e g cordierite and diopside were remaining at final ph around 2 3 ls10 0 1 n and ls10 0 4 n which disappeared at eluate ph 1 5 ls10 0 6 n the ftir spectra fig s1b implied that phosphates band at 1000 1100 cm 1 greatly leached and disappeared from hydrochar with decreased ph increased acid concentration while iron oxides bands at 550 and 460 cm 1 did not change much until using 0 6 n hno3 both xrd ilvaite peaks and ftir band 460 cm 1 results indicated some acid insoluble fe al silicates were retained in leached hydrochar 2 ph 3 25 c 8 c a 3 p o 4 2 3 c a 2 2 p o 4 3 k sp 2 1 10 33 s 1 1 10 7 m ph 2 25 c 9 f e 3 p o 4 2 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 k sp 1 6 10 36 s 2 7 10 8 m 10

3 p o 4 p k a 2 12 nevertheless a ph 1 5 does not guarantee a complete p extraction since other extraction conditions l s ratio acid concentration and leaching time could affect the leaching efficiency the principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the correlations between influential factors using originpro 2021 software as shown in fig 4b the first two principal components pcs retained 87 accumulated of explained variance pc1 was positively contributed by eluate ph and leaching time with correlation coefficients r of 0 64 and 0 54 respectively but negatively contributed by acid concentration r 0 54 pc2 mainly depended on acid concentration r 0 48 and l s ratio r 0 82 that contributed positively and negatively respectively the pca results suggested that eluate ph was the most determinant variable that was positively related to leaching time and l s ratio and negatively associated with acid concentration a previous study also concluded similar findings for p extraction from issa luyckx et al 2020 consequently while satisfying other factors retaining an eluate ph 1 5 could leach most p from hydrochar 3 2 5 co leaching of heavy metals heavy metals are inevitably co leached during acidic extraction of p from hydrochar targeting higher p leaching efficiency generally leads to more release of heavy metals due to more free acids fig 5 shows the impacts of various parameters on heavy metal leaching using 0 1 n hno3 for 24 h increasing l s ratio from 5 to 100 ml dramatically enhanced the leaching efficiency of zn pb cr ni cu and mo from 4 to 53 62 34 18 13 and 12 respectively fig 5a however when controlling the eluate ph at 2 the release of heavy metals exhibited no or limited increase regarding higher l s ratio fig 5b pb and cr were the most susceptible to l s ratio while zn and ni remained nearly constant and cu and mo showed slight increases this indicated that the leaching of zn and ni depended on eluate ph rather than l s ratio while the other heavy metals could be affected by both l s ratio and eluate ph at fixed l s 10 ml g and time 24 h fig 5c acid concentration had positive effects on the extraction of heavy metals especially pb zn cr and cu whereas ni and mo showed slight changes which might be more influenced to l s ratio similar results were previously reported on cu pb zn and ni release from issa by nitric acid fang et al 2018a with 0 6 n hno3 at 10 ml g all assessed heavy metals reached the equilibrium status within 10 min although there were slight increases at longer leaching time fig 5d this was also observed by luyckx et al 2020 on most heavy metals leaching from issa overall the leachability of heavy metals from hydrochar ranked as zn pb cr ni cu mo among those metals mo was the least leachable possibly for its insoluble forms such as femoo4 and fe2 moo4 3 nikolenko et al 2018 however the leaching efficiencies could vary depending on the mineral composition of hydrochar indeed the results suggested that controlling leaching conditions e g low l s ratio low acid concentration and short time could reduce the co extraction of heavy metals and associated concerns for the following utilization of p extract to maintain a high p extraction efficiency the optimum conditions for low leaching of heavy metals were 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h although alkaline leaching can avoid the co dissolution of heavy metals it restricts p leaching efficiency up to 70 from hydrochar liu et al 2021b for example naoh extractable p in digested sludge derived hydrochar obtained at 260 c was 42 ovsyannikova et al 2019 while using 10 ml 1 n naoh per g hydrochar leached only 4 p from primary sludge derived hydrochar obtained at 350 c ovsyannikova et al 2020 it seems that the performance of alkaline extraction is largely affected by the feedstock composition likely the amount of al or fe salts instead acidic leaching could be a more reliable approach for efficient p recovery from hydrochar 3 3 leaching kinetics the shrinking core model was applied to the leaching process in 0 1 and 0 6 n hno3 at an l s of 100 ml g assuming only one rate limiting step the leaching rate versus time at each acid concentration was fitted to eqs 1 3 individually fig 6 based on the r2 0 99 eq 2 showed the best correlation to the leaching of p and all metal groups for both 0 1 and 0 6 n hno3 this indicated that the leaching reaction rate was limited by product layer diffusion the particle size distribution also suggested that the assumption of constant particle size was fulfilled fig s2 to validate the single controlling mechanism leaching data were tested by the combined resistances method expressed by eqs 4 5 and share Ï f Ï p and Ï r of each step was calculated in table 2 the results suggested that product layer diffusion had the most share in leaching rates although liquid film diffusion and chemical reaction contributed marginally to the p and tms leaching respectively in 0 1 n hno3 the resistance from liquid film might be caused by the small particle size while the chemical reaction could be between iron oxides and acid nazemi et al 2011 h h wang et al 2017 the leaching data at 0 6 n generally showed a poorer correlation lower r2 than those at 0 1 n which was attributed to the convection at a high eluent concentration liddell 2005 remarkably the higher acid normality 0 6 n significantly cut the completion time of the leaching process nearly ten times demonstrating that excessive amounts of acid could be used to reduce the retention time in industrial applications based on the estimated completion time the diffusion rate could be ranked as p aems tms ptms both the better correlation of linear fitting and the higher share in the leaching rate confirmed that product layer diffusion was the governing rate limiting step for p and metals leaching from hydrochar in nitric acid the same mechanism was reported for p leaching from phosphate rock by h2so4 liu et al 2021 dephosphorization slag by hcl du et al 2020 and rice husk ash by hcl j wang et al 2017 the diffusion mechanism suggests that the leaching process is sensitive to agitation and particle size but insensitive to temperature faraji et al 2020 intensive stirring 1200 rpm could achieve 90 of p extraction efficiency within 10 min from issa franz 2008 according to the shrinking core model the leaching process can be described as follows fig 7 1 in a short period acid h diffuses from solution through the liquid film around hydrochar particles 2 acid quickly reacts with minerals to release phosphates and metals 3 soluble reaction products gradually diffuses through the product layer and quickly diffuses through the liquid film to the solution 4 reaction continues until reaching the particle center finding the controlling mechanism of p leaching from hydrochar is reported for the first time in the literature by this study which has a significant contribution to designing an efficient p recovery process 3 4 p recovery by precipitation after extraction using 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h phosphate was precipitated by adjusting ph and ca p molar ratio to generate hydroxyapatite hap to achieve a near neutral ph for precipitation ca oh 2 was dosed at slightly higher ca p molar ratios 1 7 2 than the theoretical value 1 67 in hydroxyapatite as shown in table 3 the ppe could reach 99 with only slight increases when ph increased from 5 to 6 in agreement with the literature liu et al 2021b however the actual ca p 0 40 0 72 in precipitates hap 5 and hap 6 were far below the target molar ratio indicating the failure of hap synthesis the reason was mainly due to the competition from iron fe p 0 78 and the co precipitation of fepo4 yan and shih 2016 the xrd and ftir results also did not observe hydroxyapatite or crystalline phosphates in precipitates obtained at ph 5 6 fig 8 previous studies suggested that foreign metal ions particularly zn2 could inhibit the crystallization of phosphate minerals and also attach to crystal surface and interfere xrd patterns dai et al 2018 considering most foreign metal ions are amphoteric and their forms strongly depend on ph chemical equilibrium modeling as a function of precipitation ph was performed by visual minteq 3 1 software fig s3 the results indicate that the saturation index si of hap is positive at ph 4 and increases at higher ph until reaches the maximum at ph 9 the si values of foreign minerals e g strengite and zn3 po4 2 also enhance with increasing ph but then mostly decrease to below 0 at ph 12 therefore a high ph may mitigate the effects of foreign ions and improve crystallization enhancing the ph to 13 by adding koh solution all p precipitated at a ca p of 1 7 table 3 notably the actual ca p in the recovered hap 13 achieved the target ca p with the decrease of fe p and al p both xrd and ftir spectra proved the formation of crystal phosphates hydroxyapatite compared to broad peaks 2Î¸ 30 of amorphous p in other precipitates hap 13 showed numerous sharp peaks corresponding to hydroxyapatite in xrd fig 8a the ftir spectra fig 8b only identified hydroxyl groups 1640 cm 1 and board band 1200 900 cm 1 of amorphous phosphates in precipitates obtained at ph 5 6 while hap 13 displayed several peaks 1040 605 and 565 cm 1 of crystal phosphates with some carbonate groups 1420 and 870 cm 1 pham minh et al 2014 petzet et al 2012 also synthesized hydroxyapatite from naoh extracted sludge ash and the strategy was converting al p into ca p at ph 13 the results demonstrated that a ph 5 could precipitate almost all p in extracts from hydrochar whereas a higher ph e g 13 would be necessary to produce hydroxyapatite 3 5 recovered precipitates as fertilizers precipitation of p from acid extracts by ca oh 2 is efficient at both neutral 5 6 and high ph 13 however the recovered precipitates have different compositions that will affect their usage as presented in table 4 all the recovered precipitates had high concentrations of p comparable to calcium phosphate fertilizers e g superphosphates notably the ph increase decreased p2o5 content from 43 in hap 5 to 26 in hap 13 this change could be related to the increase of basic species e g hpo4 2 and po4 3 that bind more metal cations liu et al 2018 conversely the plant availability of p increased from 61 to 100 it was suggested that aluminum and iron phosphates generally have limited available p while their conversion into ca p by additional ca oh 2 or ph enhancement could improve p availability fang et al 2018b although the multifunctional hydroxyapatite could be synthesized at a ph of 13 there is a compromise of additional chemicals for ph adjustment therefore process optimization would be useful to make it more economical overall the recovered precipitates showed good amounts of available p as fertilizers with the potential for broader application as hydrochar is often concentrated with heavy metals that could be leached by acids the presence of contaminants in recovered products is concerning for agricultural use although the chemical equilibrium modeling fig s3 suggested that most heavy metals should exist in soluble forms at ph 13 their actual concentrations in hap 13 were high table 4 this was attributed to the strong adsorption capacity of hydroxyapatite pham minh et al 2014 the total heavy metals in recovered precipitates generally followed the order of zn cu pb cr ni mo consistent with those in the original hydrochar the total pb and zn in precipitates are relatively higher than those recovered from sewage sludge ash which also exceeds the fertilizer criteria in the eu liu et al 2021b in canada and the us standards for heavy metals in fertilizers are risk based which depend on the annual application rate and percentage of p in fertilizers respectively table s2 according to canadian regulation table 4 the heavy metals contents in recovered precipitates are well below the criteria if the fertilizer application rate maintains under 2000 kg ha per year far beyond the regular application rate 80 kg ha in canada wang et al 2022 their concentrations are also acceptable based on the us limits after multiplying the p2o5 nevertheless metals in hydrochar can co leach and co precipitate during the recovery process and affect the quality of recovered products and thus purification steps should be considered 3 6 application of recovery process to different hydrochar applying the optimal extraction 0 6 n hno3 at l s 10 ml g for 2 h and precipitation ca p 1 7 at ph 13 for 24 h conditions to other hydrochar samples the overall p flow at various hydrothermal conditions is illustrated in fig 9 the p distribution at different htl reaction temperatures 290 360 c has been reported previously liu et al 2023 overall around 85 of p was captured in hydrochar hc290 and hc325 from mixed sludge at 290 and 325 c while a slightly higher recovery 89 was obtained at 360 c hc360 the highest p extraction efficiency nearly 100 was achieved for hydrochar from medium htl temperature 325 c fig s4 p leaching from hc290 and hc360 was also satisfactory despite a lower leaching rate 89 compared to extraction the performance of precipitation step seems to be more stable almost all p in solutions from different hydrochar could be precipitated table s3 with the successful synthesis of hydroxyapatite fig s5 the recovered precipitates also had acceptable contents of plant available p and heavy metals in canada and the us in summary considering the holistic process the total p recovery efficiency was between 76 and 85 based on the sludge input the hydrothermal temperature is influential on the p distribution and extraction efficiency and htl at 325 c for 15 min was found as the best scenario most p losses occurred during the hydrothermal treatment and extraction step that require additional investigations to enhance the overall recovery 4 conclusion recovering p from hydrochar is promising and favorable for promoting the integration of htl into wwtps this study demonstrated the performance of a simple and reproducible p recovery process the following conclusions are drawn nitric acid is efficient for p extraction all assessed variables showed significant impacts on p and metals leaching efficiencies higher l s ratios e g 100 ml g improved extraction but consumed more acid a leaching time of 2 h was sufficient to achieve chemical equilibrium but can be shortened by higher acid concentration the eluate ph was a dominant factor controlling p leaching related to the interactions with fe and al the optimal extraction conditions balancing the leaching of p and heavy metals were 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h however the conditions should be further tested and optimized for other htl feedstock types as the extraction conditions can vary depending on p and metal contents as well as mineral species for future optimization studies the eluate ph can be used as a monitoring factor the kinetic analysis suggested that the leaching of p and metals from hydrochar was limited by product layer diffusion meaning that the leaching process is sensitive to stirring and particle size but not temperature the diffusion rate was ranked as p aems tms ptms the addition of ca oh 2 to p extracts could precipitate most p at a ph of 5 6 but not form hydroxyapatite due to the interference of co leached metals e g zn enhancing ph to 13 successfully produced hydroxyapatite the recovered precipitates had acceptable values of plant available p and total heavy metals in canada and the us for land application however the precipitation step requires optimization for reducing costs and improving product quality the developed p recovery procedures were applicable to hydrochar from various htl conditions however the p capture in hydrochar and its extraction from hydrochar were affected by htl reaction temperatures that require further investigation overall htl at 325 c for 15 min could be the best process operation for energy and p recovery from municipal sludge and its hydrochar declaration of competing

14679,hydrothermal liquefaction has the potential to exploit resources from municipal sewage sludge it converts most organics into a liquid biofuel biocrude concentrates p in the solid residue hydrochar and consequently enables its efficient recovery this study thoroughly evaluated the effects of extraction conditions on p and metal release from hydrochar by nitric acid among assessed factors acid normality 0 02 1 n liquid to solid ratio 5 100 ml g and contact time 0 24 h had positive effects while decreasing eluate ph 0 5 4 improved leaching efficiencies of p and metals notably eluate ph played a dominant role in p leaching and ph 1 5 was crucial for complete extraction p and metal leaching from hydrochar have strong interactions and their leaching mechanism was identified as product layer diffusion using the shrinking core model this suggests that the leaching efficiency is susceptible to agitation and particle size but not temperature using 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2

treatment plants xrd x ray diffraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is a life essential nutrient element that has been listed as a critical raw material in many countries e g eu it is a non renewable and non substitutable resource however its source phosphate rock reserves is only located in a few countries such as morocco and western sahara 72 of the world reserve liu et al 2021b many countries partially or entirely depend on imports of p resources and products the uneven distribution of phosphate rock has created political and economic risks on the other hand p discharge from waste sources such as wastewater is a major contributor to aquatic eutrophication causing severe environmental challenges huang et al 2017 therefore p recovery from p rich residues and its valorization provide a double benefit a geographically distributed secondary p source and environmental conservation municipal sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has gained much attention as a promising p source it is attractive for high levels of p 1 3 8 on a dry basis db large quantities 45 million dry tonnes year and readily available liu et al 2021a 2021b raw sludge contains high moisture up to 98 and its solids generally consist of 40 70 db of volatile matter and 20 50 db of ash including some contaminants such as pathogens organic pollutants heavy metals and micropollutants liu et al 2021a a promising technology hydrothermal liquefaction htl could promote nutrient recovery by converting the organic fraction into a liquid biofuel called biocrude and concentrating p in the solid residue named hydrochar shi et al 2019 using water as the reaction medium htl is particularly suitable for treating sludge and tackling its high moisture and low dewaterability basar et al 2021 htl is typically performed at a closed subcritical condition 280 374 c and 8 22 mpa that is milder than other thermochemical processes e g pyrolysis gasification and incineration after reaction organic matter is mostly transformed into petroleum like biocrude and some are dissolved in the process water called htl aqueous whereas minor carbonaceous material with most minerals is retained in hydrochar basar et al 2023 liu et al 2022 consequently the dry weight p concentration in hydrochar is around five times higher than that of feedstock sludge reaching up to 10 ovsyannikova et al 2020 this makes hydrochar comparable to low grade phosphate rock around 8 p fahimi et al 2021 however reusing hydrochar as a fertilizer is restricted for the excess content of accumulated heavy metals liu et al 2023 therefore p recovery represents an important state for resource sustainability and circular economy in recent years much attention has been given to the fate and transformation of p during hydrothermal treatment huang et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is generally agreed that 80 p from sludge is captured in hydrochar and major metals e g al ca and fe strongly affect p speciation and the subsequent recovery process standing on the experience of incinerated sewage sludge ash wet chemical extraction and precipitation have been identified as the most suitable approach for p recovery due to their cost effectiveness and environmental sustainability fahimi et al 2021 liu et al 2021b to date a few studies attempted to recover p from hydrochar using various extractants including inorganic acids h2so4 and hcl ovsyannikova et al 2020 pÃ©rez et al 2021 organic acids citric and oxalic acid becker et al 2019 ovsyannikova et al 2020 pÃ©rez et al 2022 and bases naoh and koh li et al 2020 ovsyannikova et al 2020 2019 acidic leaching is commonly used for its high efficiency high temperature htl typically transforms al fe bound phosphate into ca phosphate thus limiting the efficiency 70 of alkaline leaching liu et al 2021b besides acidic leaching can remove ash contents and thus enhance the reuse value of hydrochar residue as a solid fuel marin batista et al 2020 the reported extractants also have their limitations sulfuric acid is cheap but the process generates a large amount of gypsum and limits the reusability of hydrochar hydrochloric acid is efficient but corrosive and scarcely used industrially organic acids are too costly for industrial application bases are only applicable to al fe bound phosphate li et al 2020 soltani et al 2019 extraction is the critical step for p recovery but optimizing extraction conditions such as liquid to solid l s ratio extractant concentration leaching time and ph is rarely reported the leaching mechanisms of p and co leached metals from hydrochar are lacking in addition few studies investigated the precipitation of p from extract as interesting products struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o and k struvite mgkpo4 6h2o were recovered previously but they require expensive chemical input e g mgcl2 and face challenges of achieving the optimal stoichiometric ratio between the necessary elements becker et al 2019 li et al 2020 ovsyannikova et al 2020 therefore more robust p recovery processes for hydrochar should be developed to realize industrialization hydroxyapatite is a unique material for its wide application in agriculture biomedicine environmental remediation catalysis and energy storage pham minh et al 2014 it has relatively good sell values and requires cheap chemical input such as lime for production liu et al 2021b however the current studies about hydroxyapatite synthesis are limited to pure chemicals or sources with trace foreign elements agbeboh et al 2020 arokiasamy et al 2022 recovering p as hydroxyapatite from complex waste streams such as hydrochar is rarely reported and may face some challenges thus requiring attention recognizing the benefits of incorporating htl into wwtps liu et al 2022 and the promise of p recovery from hydrochar liu et al 2023 this study aims at developing suitable p recovery procedures for sludge derived hydrochar by wet chemical extraction and precipitation nitric acid was selected as the extractant for the following reasons efficient inexpensive widely used in industry no gypsum generation recoverable and recyclable banihashemi et al 2019 firstly the effects of various extraction conditions on the leaching of p and metals were assessed on hydrochar from one htl condition the interactions between p and metals were explained secondly the leaching kinetics and mechanisms were identified for the first time to assist the process optimization thirdly the challenges and insights of synthesizing hydroxyapatite from hydrochar leachate were unrevealed in particular the compositions of recovered products were examined using various techniques e g inductively coupled plasma fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray diffraction to produce qualified fertilizers ultimately the applicability of established p recovery procedures was validated by applying it to hydrochar samples obtained at different htl conditions temperatures pressures the results are important for wastewater utilities aiming to develop a robust htl process in tandem with p recovery with a clear safe ultimate disposal route for all product streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials municipal mixed primary and secondary sludge table s1 was obtained from a local wwtp in bc canada the wwtp has primary and two stage secondary biological treatment processes including trickling filters followed by solid contact tanks the mixed sludge was dewatered to 20 solids content through centrifugation hydrochar hc350 was produced from the dewatered sludge at an htl reaction temperature of 350 c for a residence time of 15 min a commonly reported condition marrone et al 2018

as shown in eq s1 see supplementary material all extraction experiments were completed at least in duplicates in each test two experimental blanks were performed on extractants in empty tubes 2 3 leaching kinetics after determining extracted p and metals the shrinking core model for constant particle size most commonly used in the literature was employed to identify the leaching mechanisms faraji et al 2020 it describes a solid liquid process in which leaching agents diffuse through the liquid film around the particle and solid product layer and react on the unreacted core surface however this model assumes that the shape and size of solid particles remain unchanged during the leaching process the effective diffusivity is constant and the reaction is first order and irreversible liddell 2005 the leaching agent should be excessive so that its concentration is constant which generally applies at a high l s ratio the following rate limiting steps can be identified during the leaching process and expressed by the apparent rate equations 1 liquid film diffusion x 1 Ï f t 2 product layer diffusion 1 3 1 x 2 3 2 1 x 1 Ï p t 3 chemical reaction 1 1 x 1 3 1 Ï r t

all linear fitting must fix the intercept at 0 i e 0 conversion at 0 time for a correct evaluation in some cases the rate limiting step cannot be clearly defined using a single mechanism or more than one step may control the rate simultaneously the following equation combining all three mechanisms was developed to estimate the time constants nazemi et al 2011 4 t Ï f x Ï p 1 3 1 x 2 3 2 1 x Ï r

extraction would be more feasible than alkalic extraction for efficient p recovery hydrochar also contained excessive amounts of heavy metals e g mo and zn raising concerns for direct land application therefore p recovery for separating from heavy metals is necessary the xrd patterns fig s1 suggest that the major crystal phases in hydrochar were cordierite mg6 5feal15 5si19 3o76 9 diopside ca4mg3 6fe0 8si7 6o24 and enstatite al0 2fe1 2mg14 6si15 8o48 as agreed to previous studies liu et al 2021b 3 2 leaching tests for the evaluation of leaching behavior and extraction efficiency of p and metals the effects of l s ratio nitric acid concentration and leaching time were examined selected metals were presented in groups or families that are expected to have close behavior including aems ca and mg tms fe zn cu mn cr ni and mo and ptms al and pb those metals typically have strong affinities with phosphate 3 2 1 effect of l s ratio as shown in fig 1 a at constant acid normality 0 1 n and leaching time 24 h the release of p and metals significantly enhanced with increasing l s ratio 5 100 ml g while the eluate ph at the end of extraction decreased dramatically from 4 to 2 they all showed limited extraction 20 at a low l s 5 ml g notably the leaching efficiency of aems was much higher than p tms and ptms and p and aems reached nearly 100 extraction at 100 ml g final ph around 1 6 over 100 extraction was considered errors from inhomogeneous samples underestimated total and high dilution factors for analysis when fixing the eluate ph at 2 the l s ratio showed limited impacts on leaching efficiencies compared to fixed acid concentration fig 1b the leaching of aems remained above 80 whereas the sharp rise of other metals only occurred from 5 to 10 ml g with limited increase afterward this indicated that constraining final ph could strongly hinder the release of p tms and ptms at 10 100 ml g p and tms showed nearly the same leaching behaviors suggesting p was mainly released from compounds bound to tms e g iron phosphates however the p extraction at 100 ml g was still 60 suggesting a lower ph is necessary for efficient p recovery at both fixed acid concentration and eluate ph the overall release followed the order of aems p tms ptms implying that p leaching efficiency was probably regulated by tms and ptms analysis of variance showed that l s ratio had a significant effect p 0 007 on p release while eluate ph exhibited a much higher impact p 0 0001 3 2 2 effect of acid concentration the leaching of p and metals at different acid concentrations was investigated at 10 and 100 ml g for 24 h at 10 ml g the leaching of p and metals increased sharply by increasing acid concentration from 0 1 n to 0 6 n for more free h fig 2 a above 0 6 n eluate ph 1 4 p aems and tms reached the plateau or maximum while ptms continued leaching but the rate decreased another study also found that the leaching of p and metals from primary sludge derived hydrochar reached equilibrium at 0 4 1 n of sulfuric acid with an l s of 10 ml g ovsyannikova et al 2020 similarly at 100 ml g fig 2b the extraction efficiency of p and each metal group enhanced constantly by increasing acid normality from 0 02 n to 0 1 n for maximum leaching however the plateau region was not observed at 0 02 0 1 n for cost effectiveness 0 6 n and 0 1 n were considered the most suitable condition for p leaching at the l s of 10 and 100 ml g respectively when normalizing the acid consumption per sample amount as calculated by eq 7 there was a substantial difference between the two l s ratios fig 2 at the same acid consumption the leaching efficiency of p and metals were much higher at 10 ml g than those at 100 ml g the difference was attributed to the elevated ph by dilution factor 10 at the higher l s to achieve complete leaching of p 6 and 10 mmol of nitric acid per g of sample were needed at the l s of 10 and 100 ml g respectively therefore a lower l s ratio was more efficient and economical for p extraction 7 a c i d c o n s u m p t i o n m m o l g a c i d c o n c e n t r a t i o n m o l l l s m l g 3 2 3 effect of leaching time the influence of leaching time was evaluated at various l s ratios and hno3 concentrations fig 3 illustrates that the extraction of each element increased with leaching time and eventually achieved equilibrium within 2 h under both leaching conditions with the release of p and metals the eluate ph of leachate also increased and gradually reached a plateau at 10 ml g 0 6 n hno3 almost all p and aems and nearly 90 of tms and 60 of ptms were released at 2 h fig 3a under 100 ml g 0 1 n hno3 90 of p and aems 80 of tms and around 50 of ptms were extracted in 2 h fig 3b using h2so4 hcl and citric acid a few studies found the maximum p extraction from sludge derived hydrochar could be achieved within 2 h becker et al 2019 ovsyannikova et al 2020 most studies confirmed that 2 h is sufficient to leach most p from incinerated sewage sludge ash issa liu et al 2021b however using excessive acid 0 6 n hno3 and a high l s ratio 100 ml g significantly accelerated the leaching process to complete within 0 5 h fig 3c notably the initial leaching rate was much faster at a higher l s ratio or stronger acid normality under identical conditions which was probably linked to the lower ph notably leaching efficiencies of p and metal decreased after 2 h in fig 3a and b indicating adsorption or reprecipitation of metal phosphates during long term extraction ottosen et al 2013 therefore 2 h was considered the optimal leaching time nevertheless there is a compromise between complete leaching time and acid amount 3 2 4 dependency on ph the leaching efficiency of p was found to depend on the eluate ph at the end of extraction fig 4 a the fitting analysis suggested a logistic curve of p release in terms of eluate ph adjusted r2 0 99 p 0 05 regardless of the l s ratio at a leaching time of 24 h the p leaching efficiency was nearly 0 at a final ph 3 which improved sharply following an s curve with decreased ph until reaching the complete extraction at a ph 1 5 this finding agrees with a previous literature review which summarized that ph 2 is necessary to extract most p from sludge derived ash and hydrochar liu et al 2021b based on the eluate ph the reactions during leaching can be generalized into two steps shown by eq 8 and eqs 9 11 respectively liu et al 2021b which can be explained by the solubility product constant ksp and calculated molar solubility s of phosphates although ap and naip have low ksp values and thus low solubilities they could dissolve in sufficient acid since a little soluble po4 3 would protonate and form hydrogen phosphates and eventually phosphoric acid eqs 12 14 luyckx et al 2020 which promotes the dissolution based on the le chatelier s principle at a less acidic ph of 2 3 mainly calcium phosphates ca p dissolve as they have a higher molar solubility while aluminum al p and iron phosphates fe p only partially dissolve he et al 2020 for ph 2 more ferrous aluminum and ferric phosphates could solubilize and p leaching efficiency enhanced steeply until fully soluble by enough acid this is in line with a previous study that most p was released from alpo4 at ph 1 toor and kim 2019 over 55 of naip in hydrochar suggested that only an eluate ph 1 5 could achieve the full extraction of p the xrd analysis of hydrochar residue after leaching fig s1a confirmed that high intensity al and fe minerals e g cordierite and diopside were remaining at final ph around 2 3 ls10 0 1 n and ls10 0 4 n which disappeared at eluate ph 1 5 ls10 0 6 n the ftir spectra fig s1b implied that phosphates band at 1000 1100 cm 1 greatly leached and disappeared from hydrochar with decreased ph increased acid concentration while iron oxides bands at 550 and 460 cm 1 did not change much until using 0 6 n hno3 both xrd ilvaite peaks and ftir band 460 cm 1 results indicated some acid insoluble fe al silicates were retained in leached hydrochar 2 ph 3 25 c 8 c a 3 p o 4 2 3 c a 2 2 p o 4 3 k sp 2 1 10 33 s 1 1 10 7 m ph 2 25 c 9 f e 3 p o 4 2 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 k sp 1 6 10 36 s 2 7 10 8 m 10

3 p o 4 p k a 2 12 nevertheless a ph 1 5 does not guarantee a complete p extraction since other extraction conditions l s ratio acid concentration and leaching time could affect the leaching efficiency the principal component analysis pca was employed to determine the correlations between influential factors using originpro 2021 software as shown in fig 4b the first two principal components pcs retained 87 accumulated of explained variance pc1 was positively contributed by eluate ph and leaching time with correlation coefficients r of 0 64 and 0 54 respectively but negatively contributed by acid concentration r 0 54 pc2 mainly depended on acid concentration r 0 48 and l s ratio r 0 82 that contributed positively and negatively respectively the pca results suggested that eluate ph was the most determinant variable that was positively related to leaching time and l s ratio and negatively associated with acid concentration a previous study also concluded similar findings for p extraction from issa luyckx et al 2020 consequently while satisfying other factors retaining an eluate ph 1 5 could leach most p from hydrochar 3 2 5 co leaching of heavy metals heavy metals are inevitably co leached during acidic extraction of p from hydrochar targeting higher p leaching efficiency generally leads to more release of heavy metals due to more free acids fig 5 shows the impacts of various parameters on heavy metal leaching using 0 1 n hno3 for 24 h increasing l s ratio from 5 to 100 ml dramatically enhanced the leaching efficiency of zn pb cr ni cu and mo from 4 to 53 62 34 18 13 and 12 respectively fig 5a however when controlling the eluate ph at 2 the release of heavy metals exhibited no or limited increase regarding higher l s ratio fig 5b pb and cr were the most susceptible to l s ratio while zn and ni remained nearly constant and cu and mo showed slight increases this indicated that the leaching of zn and ni depended on eluate ph rather than l s ratio while the other heavy metals could be affected by both l s ratio and eluate ph at fixed l s 10 ml g and time 24 h fig 5c acid concentration had positive effects on the extraction of heavy metals especially pb zn cr and cu whereas ni and mo showed slight changes which might be more influenced to l s ratio similar results were previously reported on cu pb zn and ni release from issa by nitric acid fang et al 2018a with 0 6 n hno3 at 10 ml g all assessed heavy metals reached the equilibrium status within 10 min although there were slight increases at longer leaching time fig 5d this was also observed by luyckx et al 2020 on most heavy metals leaching from issa overall the leachability of heavy metals from hydrochar ranked as zn pb cr ni cu mo among those metals mo was the least leachable possibly for its insoluble forms such as femoo4 and fe2 moo4 3 nikolenko et al 2018 however the leaching efficiencies could vary depending on the mineral composition of hydrochar indeed the results suggested that controlling leaching conditions e g low l s ratio low acid concentration and short time could reduce the co extraction of heavy metals and associated concerns for the following utilization of p extract to maintain a high p extraction efficiency the optimum conditions for low leaching of heavy metals were 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h although alkaline leaching can avoid the co dissolution of heavy metals it restricts p leaching efficiency up to 70 from hydrochar liu et al 2021b for example naoh extractable p in digested sludge derived hydrochar obtained at 260 c was 42 ovsyannikova et al 2019 while using 10 ml 1 n naoh per g hydrochar leached only 4 p from primary sludge derived hydrochar obtained at 350 c ovsyannikova et al 2020 it seems that the performance of alkaline extraction is largely affected by the feedstock composition likely the amount of al or fe salts instead acidic leaching could be a more reliable approach for efficient p recovery from hydrochar 3 3 leaching kinetics the shrinking core model was applied to the leaching process in 0 1 and 0 6 n hno3 at an l s of 100 ml g assuming only one rate limiting step the leaching rate versus time at each acid concentration was fitted to eqs 1 3 individually fig 6 based on the r2 0 99 eq 2 showed the best correlation to the leaching of p and all metal groups for both 0 1 and 0 6 n hno3 this indicated that the leaching reaction rate was limited by product layer diffusion the particle size distribution also suggested that the assumption of constant particle size was fulfilled fig s2 to validate the single controlling mechanism leaching data were tested by the combined resistances method expressed by eqs 4 5 and share Ï f Ï p and Ï r of each step was calculated in table 2 the results suggested that product layer diffusion had the most share in leaching rates although liquid film diffusion and chemical reaction contributed marginally to the p and tms leaching respectively in 0 1 n hno3 the resistance from liquid film might be caused by the small particle size while the chemical reaction could be between iron oxides and acid nazemi et al 2011 h h wang et al 2017 the leaching data at 0 6 n generally showed a poorer correlation lower r2 than those at 0 1 n which was attributed to the convection at a high eluent concentration liddell 2005 remarkably the higher acid normality 0 6 n significantly cut the completion time of the leaching process nearly ten times demonstrating that excessive amounts of acid could be used to reduce the retention time in industrial applications based on the estimated completion time the diffusion rate could be ranked as p aems tms ptms both the better correlation of linear fitting and the higher share in the leaching rate confirmed that product layer diffusion was the governing rate limiting step for p and metals leaching from hydrochar in nitric acid the same mechanism was reported for p leaching from phosphate rock by h2so4 liu et al 2021 dephosphorization slag by hcl du et al 2020 and rice husk ash by hcl j wang et al 2017 the diffusion mechanism suggests that the leaching process is sensitive to agitation and particle size but insensitive to temperature faraji et al 2020 intensive stirring 1200 rpm could achieve 90 of p extraction efficiency within 10 min from issa franz 2008 according to the shrinking core model the leaching process can be described as follows fig 7 1 in a short period acid h diffuses from solution through the liquid film around hydrochar particles 2 acid quickly reacts with minerals to release phosphates and metals 3 soluble reaction products gradually diffuses through the product layer and quickly diffuses through the liquid film to the solution 4 reaction continues until reaching the particle center finding the controlling mechanism of p leaching from hydrochar is reported for the first time in the literature by this study which has a significant contribution to designing an efficient p recovery process 3 4 p recovery by precipitation after extraction using 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h phosphate was precipitated by adjusting ph and ca p molar ratio to generate hydroxyapatite hap to achieve a near neutral ph for precipitation ca oh 2 was dosed at slightly higher ca p molar ratios 1 7 2 than the theoretical value 1 67 in hydroxyapatite as shown in table 3 the ppe could reach 99 with only slight increases when ph increased from 5 to 6 in agreement with the literature liu et al 2021b however the actual ca p 0 40 0 72 in precipitates hap 5 and hap 6 were far below the target molar ratio indicating the failure of hap synthesis the reason was mainly due to the competition from iron fe p 0 78 and the co precipitation of fepo4 yan and shih 2016 the xrd and ftir results also did not observe hydroxyapatite or crystalline phosphates in precipitates obtained at ph 5 6 fig 8 previous studies suggested that foreign metal ions particularly zn2 could inhibit the crystallization of phosphate minerals and also attach to crystal surface and interfere xrd patterns dai et al 2018 considering most foreign metal ions are amphoteric and their forms strongly depend on ph chemical equilibrium modeling as a function of precipitation ph was performed by visual minteq 3 1 software fig s3 the results indicate that the saturation index si of hap is positive at ph 4 and increases at higher ph until reaches the maximum at ph 9 the si values of foreign minerals e g strengite and zn3 po4 2 also enhance with increasing ph but then mostly decrease to below 0 at ph 12 therefore a high ph may mitigate the effects of foreign ions and improve crystallization enhancing the ph to 13 by adding koh solution all p precipitated at a ca p of 1 7 table 3 notably the actual ca p in the recovered hap 13 achieved the target ca p with the decrease of fe p and al p both xrd and ftir spectra proved the formation of crystal phosphates hydroxyapatite compared to broad peaks 2Î¸ 30 of amorphous p in other precipitates hap 13 showed numerous sharp peaks corresponding to hydroxyapatite in xrd fig 8a the ftir spectra fig 8b only identified hydroxyl groups 1640 cm 1 and board band 1200 900 cm 1 of amorphous phosphates in precipitates obtained at ph 5 6 while hap 13 displayed several peaks 1040 605 and 565 cm 1 of crystal phosphates with some carbonate groups 1420 and 870 cm 1 pham minh et al 2014 petzet et al 2012 also synthesized hydroxyapatite from naoh extracted sludge ash and the strategy was converting al p into ca p at ph 13 the results demonstrated that a ph 5 could precipitate almost all p in extracts from hydrochar whereas a higher ph e g 13 would be necessary to produce hydroxyapatite 3 5 recovered precipitates as fertilizers precipitation of p from acid extracts by ca oh 2 is efficient at both neutral 5 6 and high ph 13 however the recovered precipitates have different compositions that will affect their usage as presented in table 4 all the recovered precipitates had high concentrations of p comparable to calcium phosphate fertilizers e g superphosphates notably the ph increase decreased p2o5 content from 43 in hap 5 to 26 in hap 13 this change could be related to the increase of basic species e g hpo4 2 and po4 3 that bind more metal cations liu et al 2018 conversely the plant availability of p increased from 61 to 100 it was suggested that aluminum and iron phosphates generally have limited available p while their conversion into ca p by additional ca oh 2 or ph enhancement could improve p availability fang et al 2018b although the multifunctional hydroxyapatite could be synthesized at a ph of 13 there is a compromise of additional chemicals for ph adjustment therefore process optimization would be useful to make it more economical overall the recovered precipitates showed good amounts of available p as fertilizers with the potential for broader application as hydrochar is often concentrated with heavy metals that could be leached by acids the presence of contaminants in recovered products is concerning for agricultural use although the chemical equilibrium modeling fig s3 suggested that most heavy metals should exist in soluble forms at ph 13 their actual concentrations in hap 13 were high table 4 this was attributed to the strong adsorption capacity of hydroxyapatite pham minh et al 2014 the total heavy metals in recovered precipitates generally followed the order of zn cu pb cr ni mo consistent with those in the original hydrochar the total pb and zn in precipitates are relatively higher than those recovered from sewage sludge ash which also exceeds the fertilizer criteria in the eu liu et al 2021b in canada and the us standards for heavy metals in fertilizers are risk based which depend on the annual application rate and percentage of p in fertilizers respectively table s2 according to canadian regulation table 4 the heavy metals contents in recovered precipitates are well below the criteria if the fertilizer application rate maintains under 2000 kg ha per year far beyond the regular application rate 80 kg ha in canada wang et al 2022 their concentrations are also acceptable based on the us limits after multiplying the p2o5 nevertheless metals in hydrochar can co leach and co precipitate during the recovery process and affect the quality of recovered products and thus purification steps should be considered 3 6 application of recovery process to different hydrochar applying the optimal extraction 0 6 n hno3 at l s 10 ml g for 2 h and precipitation ca p 1 7 at ph 13 for 24 h conditions to other hydrochar samples the overall p flow at various hydrothermal conditions is illustrated in fig 9 the p distribution at different htl reaction temperatures 290 360 c has been reported previously liu et al 2023 overall around 85 of p was captured in hydrochar hc290 and hc325 from mixed sludge at 290 and 325 c while a slightly higher recovery 89 was obtained at 360 c hc360 the highest p extraction efficiency nearly 100 was achieved for hydrochar from medium htl temperature 325 c fig s4 p leaching from hc290 and hc360 was also satisfactory despite a lower leaching rate 89 compared to extraction the performance of precipitation step seems to be more stable almost all p in solutions from different hydrochar could be precipitated table s3 with the successful synthesis of hydroxyapatite fig s5 the recovered precipitates also had acceptable contents of plant available p and heavy metals in canada and the us in summary considering the holistic process the total p recovery efficiency was between 76 and 85 based on the sludge input the hydrothermal temperature is influential on the p distribution and extraction efficiency and htl at 325 c for 15 min was found as the best scenario most p losses occurred during the hydrothermal treatment and extraction step that require additional investigations to enhance the overall recovery 4 conclusion recovering p from hydrochar is promising and favorable for promoting the integration of htl into wwtps this study demonstrated the performance of a simple and reproducible p recovery process the following conclusions are drawn nitric acid is efficient for p extraction all assessed variables showed significant impacts on p and metals leaching efficiencies higher l s ratios e g 100 ml g improved extraction but consumed more acid a leaching time of 2 h was sufficient to achieve chemical equilibrium but can be shortened by higher acid concentration the eluate ph was a dominant factor controlling p leaching related to the interactions with fe and al the optimal extraction conditions balancing the leaching of p and heavy metals were 10 ml g of 0 6 n hno3 for 2 h however the conditions should be further tested and optimized for other htl feedstock types as the extraction conditions can vary depending on p and metal contents as well as mineral species for future optimization studies the eluate ph can be used as a monitoring factor the kinetic analysis suggested that the leaching of p and metals from hydrochar was limited by product layer diffusion meaning that the leaching process is sensitive to stirring and particle size but not temperature the diffusion rate was ranked as p aems tms ptms the addition of ca oh 2 to p extracts could precipitate most p at a ph of 5 6 but not form hydroxyapatite due to the interference of co leached metals e g zn enhancing ph to 13 successfully produced hydroxyapatite the recovered precipitates had acceptable values of plant available p and total heavy metals in canada and the us for land application however the precipitation step requires optimization for reducing costs and improving product quality the developed p recovery procedures were applicable to hydrochar from various htl conditions however the p capture in hydrochar and its extraction from hydrochar were affected by htl reaction temperatures that require further investigation overall htl at 325 c for 15 min could be the best process operation for energy and p recovery from municipal sludge and its hydrochar declaration of competing
