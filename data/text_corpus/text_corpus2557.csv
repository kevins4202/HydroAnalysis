12785,the biofilm carriers are of significance for the operation of the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr system however knowledge about the nitrification process with different types of carriers is still limited particularly for saline wastewater treatment in this study six different carriers were applied to assess their ability for nitrification in the mbbrs through a long term continuous operation with the hydraulic retention time reduced from 21 6 h to 3 1 h ammonia removal could be effectively achieved with a loading rate up to 14 g nh4 n d in all carriers 91 except for carriers 3 84 and 4 78 moreover partial nitrification was established and maintained in the mbbr with carrier 4 while full nitrification occurred in others the microbial structure revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria and denitrifiers were dominant with the overall relative abundance of 38 82 51 30 26 90 59 84 49 54 and 51 92 in each mbbr suggesting the possibility of achieving simultaneous nitrification and denitrification the findings of this study have shed lights into the nitrogen conversion in mbbrs with different carriers for saline wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrification denitrification moving bed biofilm reactors saline wastewater treatment microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with rapid industrialization and urbanization the removal of nitrogen containing pollutants is of utmost significance for urban wastewater treatment and ecological protection 1 2 the biological nitrogen removal process is the most economical approach and is commonly applied in wastewater treatment 3 4 the process of nitrification which converts ammonia to nitrate relies on the mediation of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 5 however the enrichment of nitrifiers becomes extensively limited due to the sensitivity of the nitrifying microorganisms towards the challenging operational conditions 4 6 such inhibition will become more sever for saline wastewater treatment 7 9 compared with conventional suspended growth bioprocesses attached growth bioprocesses are considered to be favorable for nitrification due to their ability of retaining nitrifiers more easily 6 10 and overcomes the challenges in saline wastewater treatment 11 13 specially the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr system could be a promising biotechnology for achieving effective nitrification in saline wastewater treatment in the past decades the mbbr has been developed as a flexible robust and compact technology for wastewater treatment 14 15 the application of mbbr has the advantages including improved treatment capacity with a strong resistance to the influent variations 15 16 the mbbr system is ideally suited for the nitrification process since it enables the proliferation of nitrifying bacteria within the biofilms attached to the carriers 14 moreover the mbbr system could improve nitrification performance by sustaining a large population of nitrifying bacteria without manipulating solid retention time or recirculation 17 one of the key elements of the mbbr is the biofilm carrier which is essential for the good operation of the system the carriers usually have a high specific area high strength surface roughness porosity and durability 18 often made of plastics such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and high density polyethylene hdpe 19 also the microbial groups are accumulated on the carriers to form biofilms and improve process effectiveness 20 21 the biofilm carriers applied in the mbbr system are selected based on the aerobic or anoxic anaerobic process 15 moreover the biofilm carriers could affect the biofilm architecture and functional microbial groups 15 19 for instance the carrier with wider openings could be beneficial for the fast growing aerobic heterotrophic biofilm to avoid loss of effective surface area caused by clogging in contrast the carriers with smaller openings and higher surface area are preferable for the slow growing autotrophic biofilm e g in the nitrification process 22 as for nitrogen removal two typical mbbr carriers anoxkaldnes k1 and pva gel showed a different ammonia removal at a 27 and 32 mgnh4 n l h at 37 and 9 6 filling ratios respectively 23 a recent study has found that the mbbr using pva gel beads could reach a much higher nitrogen removal 50 90 nitrification and 40 denitrification than using plastic carrier mp mbbr 01 5 10 nitrogen removal due to the structural difference 24 the abovementioned literatures could be benefited to design and operate conventional mbbr system however knowledge about the different carriers with different shapes and surface areas on nitrification performance and microorganisms for saline bacteria based mbbr system remains unclear particularly for saline wastewater treatment it is crucial to understand the applicability of the biofilm carriers for various nitrification bioprocesses and the functional microbial populations in the saline wastewater treatment hence the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different types in total six types of carriers on the saline wastewater nitrification in the mbbrs through long term observation specifically the mbbrs with six different carriers were continuously operated under different conditions e g flowrate hydraulic retention time hrt and influent ammonia concentration in situ batch tests were carried out to assess the detailed conversion of ammonium nitrite and nitrate along with the kinetic analysis moreover the microbial community of the biofilms on the carriers was analyzed to reveal the key functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen conversion lastly potential applications were discussed to shed light on the applicability of different carriers in the nitrification process in the mbbrs for saline wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of the mbbrs to evaluate the ammonia removal performance of different carriers six identical acrylic reactors were designed and established with the dimension of 0 6 0 2 0 18 m fig 1 the effective volume of each reactor was about 18 l and a screening plate was installed near the effluent point to prevent the blockage or leakage of the carriers the reactor was equipped with an air diffusing panel to create the rolling pattern of carriers compressed air was supplied for the aeration of the mbbr and the aeration intensity was controlled using an air flow meter six different carriers for the mbbrs were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant shatin hong kong and the biofilms were attached to the carriers and no additional sludge was used during the experiment the filling ratio was calculated based on the surface area of each carrier to create the total surface area of about 4 5 m2 in the reactors the basic information of the carriers used is listed in table 1 which these carriers are commercial products from different manufacturers it should be noted that the carriers 1 and 2 and carriers 3 and 4 were obtained from the same manufacturers respectively the mbbrs were continuously operated for about 118 days 6 phases with the variations of flowrate hrt and influent ammonia concentration at a temperature of 20 2 c the detailed operational conditions are summarized in table 1 synthetic wastewater was prepared according to the compositions provided in a previous study 25 except for ammonia and chloride concentrations and carbon source in this study about 1 g l of nahco3 was used as the inorganic carbon source moreover about 6 g cl l were maintained in the synthetic influent via dosing sodium chloride chemical the pre inoculated carriers were collected from a local sewage treatment works in hong kong and allocated to different reactors with different filling volumes table 1 during the whole experimental period samples were collected to measure ammonia nitrite nitrate dissolved oxygen and ph in six reactors with different carriers after the long term operation batch tests of the mbbrs with different carriers were carried out to monitor the changes in ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations within 6 h the mbbrs were slowly drained at first and synthetic wastewater containing about 70 mg nh4 n l was supplemented into the reactors the air intensity was maintained at the same level compared with the long term operation samples were collected to measure the concentrations of ammonia nitrite and nitrate after the batch tests kinetic analysis of ammonia removal rate was conducted by following the first order reaction kinetics the kinetic rate constants were calculated to assess the ammonia removal performance of different carriers 2 2 microbial community analysis to evaluate and compare the microbial structure of different carriers biofilm samples were carefully collected from different carriers after the long term operation of the mbbrs each sample was obtained from more than ten carriers in the mbbrs the microbial raw data are available from the ncbi sra database with accession numbers srr16036453 srr16036454 srr16036455 srr16036456 srr16036457 and srr16036458 dna from the samples was extracted by using ctab sds method and monitored on 1 agarose gels 16s rrna of v4 v5 were amplified by using specific primer 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 all pcr reactions were conducted with phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs paired end reads was assigned to samples based on their unique barcodes and merged by using flash v1 2 11 for the effective tags the dada2 by default or deblur module in qiime2 software was used to conduct denoise and the sequences with 5 abundances were filtered out to obtain the final asvs amplicon sequence variables and feature table then the classify sklearn moduler in qiime2 software was used to compare asvs with the database and to obtain the species annotation of each asv alpha diversity and beta diversity were performed by using qiime2 software based on the asvs tree and gene information of asvs in greengene database function prediction was conducted with picrust2 26 2 3 analytical methods the samples collected from the mbbrs were filtered at first through disposable filters with the pore size of 0 45 μm ph and dissolved oxygen were measured with a multi parameter portable meter multi 3420 wtw germany the measurement of ammonia nitrite and nitrate were following the standard methods 27 to be specific ammonia was analyzed by using nessler method via the spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 420 nm nitrite and nitrate were detected by the colorimetric methods at the wavelength of 540 nm and 420 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation the reactors filled with different carriers were continuously operated for over 118 days and the changes in ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were monitored as shown in fig 2 ammonia removal rate arr in mbbrs with different carriers for saline wastewater treatment was calculated table 2 generally the mbbrs with different carriers could effectively convert ammonium into nitrite and or nitrate with 70 to 100 mg n l of influent ammonium concentrations and 20 to 140 l d of flowrates the conversion rates of ammonium were higher than 90 in all mbbrs at phases 5 and 6 except for the mbbr with carrier 3 at phase 6 and the mbbr with carrier 4 the ammonium concentration in the effluent in all mbbrs was fluctuated in the first 30 days indicating the gradual adaption of the pre inoculated carriers nitrite accumulation was observed in all mbbrs especially in the first 60 days this could be ascribed to the different growth rates of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob yaob 0 18 g codcell g nox and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ynob 0 06 g codcell g nox 3 28 nob could be washed out due to their lower specific growth rate 29 lowering the ability of nitrite oxidization in the mbbr at phase 5 i e from day 51 to 91 the mbbrs with carriers 1 2 3 and 5 reached stable complete nitrification from ammonium to nitrate with an influent ammonium concentration of 70 mg n l at a flowrate of 140 l d this indicates that carriers 1 2 3 and 5 could complete the conversion bioprocess from ammonium to nitrate under the designated conditions compared to this the mbbrs with carrier 4 and 6 mainly converted ammonium into nitrite as the final product to be specific the nitrite level was kept at 52 96 7 29 mg n l with carrier 4 and 43 92 12 30 mg n l with carrier 6 moreover the effluent from the mbbr with carrier 4 mainly contained nitrite and ammonium no2 n nh4 n 3 42 while nitrite and nitrate no2 n no3 n 2 31 were the major components in the effluent with carrier 6 this implies that partial nitrification instead of full nitrification could easily occur in the mbbrs with carriers 4 and 6 under specific conditions this is quite interesting since carriers 4 and 6 could be preferably used for aob accumulation to conduct the partial nitrification process in the mbbr treating ammonia laden wastewater 30 32 to further evaluate the ammonia removal ability of different carriers the influent ammonium concentration was increased from 70 to 100 mg n l at phase 6 i e from day 92 118 the increased ammonia loading posed various influences on nitrogen conversion in the mbbrs with different carriers while the arr of different carriers increased with a higher ammonium loading compared to the performance at stage 5 the mbbrs with carriers 1 2 3 and 4 showed a good resilience for increased ammonia loading by comparison nitrite level in the effluent with carrier 5 increased up to a similar level with nitrate no3 n no2 n 1 08 at phase 6 as for the mbbr with carrier 6 majority of the effluent nitrogen altered its form from nitrite at phase 5 to nitrate at phase 6 suggesting that the influent ammonia concentration may impact on the accumulation of aob and nob in the mbbr to understand the changes in different nitrogen species during the mbbrs operation a detailed investigation was deemed necessary see session 3 3 3 2 batch tests in situ batch tests were carried out in the mbbrs with different carriers to evaluate the conversion of different nitrogen species in the system along with the kinetic analysis of ammonia removal performance the changes in ammonium nitrite and nitrate within 6 h are shown in fig 3 and the first order reaction kinetic results for arr are listed in table 3 generally all mbbrs could convert ammonium into nitrate in the 6 h tests while nitrite was mainly accumulated in the first 3 h similar trends of the variation of different nitrogen species were also observed by another study 6 this implies that the mbbrs with different carriers could achieve complete nitrification with the mediation of aob and nob on the other hand the first order reaction could satisfactorily reflect the removal performance of ammonium in all mbbrs r2 84 in all cases the kinetic rate constants k 1 h of carriers 2 and 5 were the highest followed by the k of carrier 1 indicating the good performance of mbbrs during the long term operation the high kinetic rate constants indicate a rapid conversion of ammonia in the mbbrs the k of carrier 4 was the lowest among all carriers although ammonium was converted into nitrate in the batch test within 6 h nitrite was the main product in the effluent with carrier 4 in the long term operation this may be attributed to the low microbial activity of ammonia conversion in the mbbr which required further investigation on the microbial groups in the system 3 3 microbial communities the microbial structure of the carriers in different mbbrs in saline wastewater treatment was analyzed to evaluate the key functional microbial groups involved as shown in figs 4 and 5 according to the asvs results the common and unique asvs were revealed in flower diagram fig 4a specifically there were 191 asvs shared by all biofilm samples occupying the majority in all carriers except for carrier 3 the unique asvs in carrier 3 was much higher than others suggesting a rich diversity of microorganisms accumulated similar observations could also be identified in pca in which the distance between carrier 3 and others was quite large fig 4b by contrast the avss of carriers 1 and 2 from the same manufacturer were relatively similar to the avss of carriers 4 and 6 for microbial community analysis the top 35 genera in abundance were selected to reveal the key functional microorganisms in the biofilms with different carriers fig 4 in general proteobacteria bacteroidota and nitrospirota were the most abundant bacteria at phylum level in all mbbrs accounting for 87 92 75 96 95 and 96 of the total relative abundance for different carriers respectively fig 4c these phyla were widely reported to be involved in the biofilm growth and nitrogen removal proteobacteria was reported as one of the most widely detected bacterial phyla in freshwater and wastewater 33 and this phylum contains mostly aob and nob 34 moreover nitrospirae and proteobacteria are responsible for ammonia removal in the nitrification process 34 all known nob are affiliated with the phyla of nitrospirae 35 members of bacteroidota could enrich functional groups for nitrogen removal 36 and their activities are highly linked with biofilm morphology 37 suggesting that bacteroidota identified in this study may promote the biofilm growth and nitrogen conversion in the mbbrs at genus level microbial groups responsible for nitrogen conversion were dominant fig 4d e g nitrosomonas flavobacterium nitrospira terrimonas arenibacter and hydrogenophaga occupying 36 51 25 61 49 and 51 of the total abundance for different carriers respectively this indicates the high ability of nitrogen conversion including nitrification and denitrification in the mbbrs nitrosomonas as a key aob in all mbbrs is the most commonly found nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge process and poses a high adaptive tolerance for free nitrous acid 38 the abundance of nitrosomonas is highly correlated with the extracellular polymeric substances nitrogen loading and nitrogen removal rate 39 this is particularly true since nitrite was accumulated and stimulating a high relative abundance of nitrosomonas in the mbbrs with carrier 4 39 and carrier 6 34 while it was about 6 6 9 and 16 in other carriers this implies that carriers 4 and 6 were preferable for cultivating nitrosomonas for completing partial nitrification besides nob that belongs to flavobacterium and nitrospira were accumulated with the cumulative relative abundance of 18 25 11 9 21 and 12 in the mbbrs with different carriers respectively flavobacterium was reported to be dominant in the partial nitrification system 40 41 and could incur simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification process in saline wastewater 42 43 the high abundance of flavobacterium implies the mbbrs in this study may have the potential for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification most species of nitrospira were widely found as the key nob in activated sludge which were sensitive to oxygen and nitrite concentrations 38 42 interestingly some nitrospira was recognized as the complete ammonia oxidizers comammox 44 45 this suggests the diverse nitrogen conversion pathways in the mbbrs with different carriers besides denitrifying bacteria were observed in the mbbrs i e terrimonas arenibacter hydrogenophaga calorithrix erythrobacter 2 46 49 the relative abundance of the denitrifiers was 15 20 7 12 13 and 6 respectively also the role of flavobacterium is still controversial since some flavobacterium were considered as the denitrifiers for nitrite reduction 50 besides thauera was identified in the mbbrs which was widely considered as the denitrifiers 51 52 the enrichment of denitrifiers implies that the denitrification process may occur in the mbbrs to sum up the microbial community analysis suggests that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was highly possible to exist in the mbbrs with different carriers 3 4 potential applications this study demonstrated that the nitrification process was successfully developed in the mbbrs with six different carriers through a 118 day operation specifically the efficiency of ammonia removal was satisfactory with arr higher than 2 14 g n m2 d except for carrier 4 1 74 g n m2 d at phase 5 9 8 g nh4 n d as the loading was increased to 14 g nh4 n d the removal performances of carriers 1 2 5 and 6 were maintained at a value higher than 91 this indicates that the different carriers used in mbbr systems have a strong resistance to the fluctuation of influent ammonia loading rates the microbial community in the mbbrs with different carriers revealed the key functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen conversion as shown in fig 5 and the presence of aob nob and denitrifiers indicate that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process may occur in the system 30 42 48 moreover all carriers could effectively convert ammonium into nitrate except for carriers 4 and 5 this indicates that complete nitrification could be achieved by using carriers 1 2 3 and 6 as for carrier 4 partial nitrification was maintained throughout the whole experimental period along with a quite high abundance of aob in the mbbr fig 5 suggesting the ability of using carrier 4 in the mbbr to stimulate the partial nitrification process the performance of the mbbr with carrier 5 was altered from complete nitrification to partial nitrification when the influent ammonium concentration was increased from 70 to 100 mg n l the results of this study imply that the different carriers could be used for different purposes of nitrogen conversion the biofilm carriers provide a preferable shelter for the slow growing nitrifying bacteria in the mbbr system this study proved possibility of achieving complete nitrification via the accumulation of aob and nob in all carriers in addition the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria implies the possibility of the occurrence of denitrification process interestingly partial nitrification was identified with specific carriers which could be used for establishing partial nitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation process 4 conclusion the study demonstrated that ammonia removal could be effectively achieved with a loading rate up to 14 g nh4 n d and ammonia conversion efficiency 90 for saline wastewater treatment partial nitrification was established and maintained in the mbbr with carrier 4 while full nitrification occurred in others the microbial structure revealed that aob nob and denitrifiers were the dominant microbial groups indicating the possibility of achieving simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in all mbbrs the findings of this study have shed lights into the improvement of nitrogen conversion in the mbbr

the colorimetric methods at the wavelength of 540 nm and 420 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation the reactors filled with different carriers were continuously operated for over 118 days and the changes in ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were monitored as shown in fig 2 ammonia removal rate arr in mbbrs with different carriers for saline wastewater treatment was calculated table 2 generally the mbbrs with different carriers could effectively convert ammonium into nitrite and or nitrate with 70 to 100 mg n l of influent ammonium concentrations and 20 to 140 l d of flowrates the conversion rates of ammonium were higher than 90 in all mbbrs at phases 5 and 6 except for the mbbr with carrier 3 at phase 6 and the mbbr with carrier 4 the ammonium concentration in the effluent in all mbbrs was fluctuated in the first 30 days indicating the gradual adaption of the pre inoculated carriers nitrite accumulation was observed in all mbbrs especially in the first 60 days this could be ascribed to the different growth rates of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob yaob 0 18 g codcell g nox and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ynob 0 06 g codcell g nox 3 28 nob could be washed out due to their lower specific growth rate 29 lowering the ability of nitrite oxidization in the mbbr at phase 5 i e from day 51 to 91 the mbbrs with carriers 1 2 3 and 5 reached stable complete nitrification from ammonium to nitrate with an influent ammonium concentration of 70 mg n l at a flowrate of 140 l d this indicates that carriers 1 2 3 and 5 could complete the conversion bioprocess from ammonium to nitrate under the designated conditions compared to this the mbbrs with carrier 4 and 6 mainly converted ammonium into nitrite as the final product to be specific the nitrite level was kept at 52 96 7 29 mg n l with carrier 4 and 43 92 12 30 mg n l with carrier 6 moreover the effluent from the mbbr with carrier 4 mainly contained nitrite and ammonium no2 n nh4 n 3 42 while nitrite and nitrate no2 n no3 n 2 31 were the major components in the effluent with carrier 6 this implies that partial nitrification instead of full nitrification could easily occur in the mbbrs with carriers 4 and 6 under specific conditions this is quite interesting since carriers 4 and 6 could be preferably used for aob accumulation to conduct the partial nitrification process in the mbbr treating ammonia laden wastewater 30 32 to further evaluate the ammonia removal ability of different carriers the influent ammonium concentration was increased from 70 to 100 mg n l at phase 6 i e from day 92 118 the increased ammonia loading posed various influences on nitrogen conversion in the mbbrs with different carriers while the arr of different carriers increased with a higher ammonium loading compared to the performance at stage 5 the mbbrs with carriers 1 2 3 and 4 showed a good resilience for increased ammonia loading by comparison nitrite level in the effluent with carrier 5 increased up to a similar level with nitrate no3 n no2 n 1 08 at phase 6 as for the mbbr with carrier 6 majority of the effluent nitrogen altered its form from nitrite at phase 5 to nitrate at phase 6 suggesting that the influent ammonia concentration may impact on the accumulation of aob and nob in the mbbr to understand the changes in different nitrogen species during the mbbrs operation a detailed investigation was deemed necessary see session 3 3 3 2 batch tests in situ batch tests were carried out in the mbbrs with different carriers to evaluate the conversion of different nitrogen species in the system along with the kinetic analysis of ammonia removal performance the changes in ammonium nitrite and nitrate within 6 h are shown in fig 3 and the first order reaction kinetic results for arr are listed in table 3 generally all mbbrs could convert ammonium into nitrate in the 6 h tests while nitrite was mainly accumulated in the first 3 h similar trends of the variation of different nitrogen species were also observed by another study 6 this implies that the mbbrs with different carriers could achieve complete nitrification with the mediation of aob and nob on the other hand the first order reaction could satisfactorily reflect the removal performance of ammonium in all mbbrs r2 84 in all cases the kinetic rate constants k 1 h of carriers 2 and 5 were the highest followed by the k of carrier 1 indicating the good performance of mbbrs during the long term operation the high kinetic rate constants indicate a rapid conversion of ammonia in the mbbrs the k of carrier 4 was the lowest among all carriers although ammonium was converted into nitrate in the batch test within 6 h nitrite was the main product in the effluent with carrier 4 in the long term operation this may be attributed to the low microbial activity of ammonia conversion in the mbbr which required further investigation on the microbial groups in the system 3 3 microbial communities the microbial structure of the carriers in different mbbrs in saline wastewater treatment was analyzed to evaluate the key functional microbial groups involved as shown in figs 4 and 5 according to the asvs results the common and unique asvs were revealed in flower diagram fig 4a specifically there were 191 asvs shared by all biofilm samples occupying the majority in all carriers except for carrier 3 the unique asvs in carrier 3 was much higher than others suggesting a rich diversity of microorganisms accumulated similar observations could also be identified in pca in which the distance between carrier 3 and others was quite large fig 4b by contrast the avss of carriers 1 and 2 from the same manufacturer were relatively similar to the avss of carriers 4 and 6 for microbial community analysis the top 35 genera in abundance were selected to reveal the key functional microorganisms in the biofilms with different carriers fig 4 in general proteobacteria bacteroidota and nitrospirota were the most abundant bacteria at phylum level in all mbbrs accounting for 87 92 75 96 95 and 96 of the total relative abundance for different carriers respectively fig 4c these phyla were widely reported to be involved in the biofilm growth and nitrogen removal proteobacteria was reported as one of the most widely detected bacterial phyla in freshwater and wastewater 33 and this phylum contains mostly aob and nob 34 moreover nitrospirae and proteobacteria are responsible for ammonia removal in the nitrification process 34 all known nob are affiliated with the phyla of nitrospirae 35 members of bacteroidota could enrich functional groups for nitrogen removal 36 and their activities are highly linked with biofilm morphology 37 suggesting that bacteroidota identified in this study may promote the biofilm growth and nitrogen conversion in the mbbrs at genus level microbial groups responsible for nitrogen conversion were dominant fig 4d e g nitrosomonas flavobacterium nitrospira terrimonas arenibacter and hydrogenophaga occupying 36 51 25 61 49 and 51 of the total abundance for different carriers respectively this indicates the high ability of nitrogen conversion including nitrification and denitrification in the mbbrs nitrosomonas as a key aob in all mbbrs is the most commonly found nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge process and poses a high adaptive tolerance for free nitrous acid 38 the abundance of nitrosomonas is highly correlated with the extracellular polymeric substances nitrogen loading and nitrogen removal rate 39 this is particularly true since nitrite was accumulated and stimulating a high relative abundance of nitrosomonas in the mbbrs with carrier 4 39 and carrier 6 34 while it was about 6 6 9 and 16 in other carriers this implies that carriers 4 and 6 were preferable for cultivating nitrosomonas for completing partial nitrification besides nob that belongs to flavobacterium and nitrospira were accumulated with the cumulative relative abundance of 18 25 11 9 21 and 12 in the mbbrs with different carriers respectively flavobacterium was reported to be dominant in the partial nitrification system 40 41 and could incur simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification process in saline wastewater 42 43 the high abundance of flavobacterium implies the mbbrs in this study may have the potential for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification most species of nitrospira were widely found as the key nob in activated sludge which were sensitive to oxygen and nitrite concentrations 38 42 interestingly some nitrospira was recognized as the complete ammonia oxidizers comammox 44 45 this suggests the diverse nitrogen conversion pathways in the mbbrs with different carriers besides denitrifying bacteria were observed in the mbbrs i e terrimonas arenibacter hydrogenophaga calorithrix erythrobacter 2 46 49 the relative abundance of the denitrifiers was 15 20 7 12 13 and 6 respectively also the role of flavobacterium is still controversial since some flavobacterium were considered as the denitrifiers for nitrite reduction 50 besides thauera was identified in the mbbrs which was widely considered as the denitrifiers 51 52 the enrichment of denitrifiers implies that the denitrification process may occur in the mbbrs to sum up the microbial community analysis suggests that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was highly possible to exist in the mbbrs with different carriers 3 4 potential applications this study demonstrated that the nitrification process was successfully developed in the mbbrs with six different carriers through a 118 day operation specifically the efficiency of ammonia removal was satisfactory with arr higher than 2 14 g n m2 d except for carrier 4 1 74 g n m2 d at phase 5 9 8 g nh4 n d as the loading was increased to 14 g nh4 n d the removal performances of carriers 1 2 5 and 6 were maintained at a value higher than 91 this indicates that the different carriers used in mbbr systems have a strong resistance to the fluctuation of influent ammonia loading rates the microbial community in the mbbrs with different carriers revealed the key functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen conversion as shown in fig 5 and the presence of aob nob and denitrifiers indicate that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process may occur in the system 30 42 48 moreover all carriers could effectively convert ammonium into nitrate except for carriers 4 and 5 this indicates that complete nitrification could be achieved by using carriers 1 2 3 and 6 as for carrier 4 partial nitrification was maintained throughout the whole experimental period along with a quite high abundance of aob in the mbbr fig 5 suggesting the ability of using carrier 4 in the mbbr to stimulate the partial nitrification process the performance of the mbbr with carrier 5 was altered from complete nitrification to partial nitrification when the influent ammonium concentration was increased from 70 to 100 mg n l the results of this study imply that the different carriers could be used for different purposes of nitrogen conversion the biofilm carriers provide a preferable shelter for the slow growing nitrifying bacteria in the mbbr system this study proved possibility of achieving complete nitrification via the accumulation of aob and nob in all carriers in addition the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria implies the possibility of the occurrence of denitrification process interestingly partial nitrification was identified with specific carriers which could be used for establishing partial nitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation process 4 conclusion the study demonstrated that ammonia removal could be effectively achieved with a loading rate up to 14 g nh4 n d and ammonia conversion efficiency 90 for saline wastewater treatment partial nitrification was established and maintained in the mbbr with carrier 4 while full nitrification occurred in others the microbial structure revealed that aob nob and denitrifiers were the dominant microbial groups indicating the possibility of achieving simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in all mbbrs the findings of this study have shed lights into the improvement of nitrogen conversion in the mbbr

12786,the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in an increased use of disinfectants worldwide one of the most popular active ingredients is triclosan trc which is added to personal care products such as soap wet wipes and dish soap negative aspect of trc in wastewater is its release into the environment since trc is not completely removed in wwtps in the context of the rapidly increasing concentration of disinfectants in the wastewater influent the aim of the study was to develop a method for treating wastewater containing trc biological treatment in a sequential batch reactor sbr was used and then the sbr effluent was treated in one of the tertiary processes i e ultrafiltration adsorption ozonation ozonation uv in the ultrafiltration step innovative membranes were used such as membranes prepared from recycled polystyrene rec ps or polyethersulfone mixed with single walled carbon nanotubes pes swcnt adsorption was conducted in fixed bed columns packed with novel composite adsorbent containing halloysite and single walled carbon nanotubes trc impaired the removal of phosphate and caused the degradation of activated sludge phosphate removal in the sbr 2 reactor wastewater with trc decreased throughout the 6 weeks from 48 1 to 38 1 in contrast for sbr 1 wastewater without trc it increased from 34 3 to 71 8 the phosphate concentration of the effluent exceeded the permissible values necessitating further treatment flocs from sbr 2 were smaller and looser compared to those from the control sbr biodegradation of trc was noted in the 5th week of the operation as methyl trc was detected in the effluent 0 07 mg l in ultrafiltration with pes swcnt membrane phosphate trc and methyl trc were reduced by 33 7 27 8 36 8 respectively on the other hand adsorption ozonation and ozonation uv processes were highly suitable to treat sbr effluent the phosphate trc and trc byproducts removal degrees exceeded 90 both for adsorption in the fixed bed column as well as the ozonation and ozonation uv processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covid 19 triclosan biological treatment wastewater ultrafiltration adsorption aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a potent way to limit coronavirus transmission in 2020 many governments restricted industrial commercial and social activities this lockdown had a positive effect on the natural environment such as reduced air and water pollution numerous countries reported a remarkable drop in the emission of greenhouse gases and particulate matter 1 for example as a result of the lockdown the water quality of the canals in venice improved considerably 2 similarly improved quality of water was reported in surface water from vembanad lake in india as concentration of suspended particulate matter was reduced by 15 9 in lockdown period 3 however because of the increased use of antiseptics containing among others alcohols chlorine compounds biocides pesticides and surfactants wastewater influent is loaded with additional organic matter 4 5 an excessive disinfectant loads can disturb the biological treatment by inactivating the microorganisms in the activated sludge consequently the quality of the effluent discharged into waterbodies is lower with various adverse effects on the aquatic environment such as eutrophication destruction of the aquatic fauna and flora and increased antibiotic and antiviral resistance 6 7 one of the most popular biocides is triclosan trc which is detected in aquatic environments at high rates 6 trc is widely used in pharmaceutical and personal care products hand soap and wet wipes to protect against coronavirus triclosan has a broad spectrum antibacterial activity the adverse effect of trc in wastewater is related to the direct exposure of activated sludge microorganisms 8 resulting in inhibited bacterial growth decreased bacterial diversity and abundance and changes in the bacterial community structure 9 as a consequence decreased nutrient removal in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is observed 10 11 another negative aspect of trc in wastewater is its release into the environment since trc is not completely removed in wwtps of the total load of trc in wwtp influent around 48 9 61 2 is biodegraded whereas 36 49 is adsorbed by sludge thus around 10 is discharged into the receiving waterbodies 6 12 this makes wwtp effluent a main source of trc in surface and drinking water to mitigate this issue different tertiary treatment methods are implemented including membrane filtration adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops 13 these techniques should include the removal of residual trc and its by products and control the levels of nutrients and organic compounds this is especially important against the background of the covid 19 pandemic with the overuse of disinfectants shakil et al 1 highlight the need to study the relationship between covid 19 and the environment and yang et al 14 report that sars cov 2 rna persists in wastewater systems for more than 19 days making wastewater is a potential source of the virus current studies mostly report the direct effect of covid 19 on wastewater quality focusing on the development of methods to mitigate virus transmission in wastewater by tertiary treatment with membrane processes or disinfection techniques 15 16 on the other hand fate of triclosan in wwtp or methods for removal of trc or its by products are well known however to the best of our knowledge studies on the indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater treatment and effluent quality are lacking therefore this study presents a novel approach focusing on effect of trc in wastewater on general treatment efficiency in biological treatment and three different tertiary processes i e ultrafiltration fixed bed adsorption ozonation ozonation uv another novelty of this study is to use an innovative membranes prepared from waste polystyrene and polyether sulfone with single walled carbon nanotubes and adsorbents prepared from halloysite and single walled carbon nanotubes in ultrafiltration and adsorption these materials were applied for the first time to remove trc trc byproducts and other pollutants from wastewater in tertiary treatment 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials broth peptone nh4cl nacl cacl2 6h2o mgso4 7h2o k2hpo4 and kh2po4 were

gliwice poland biological treatment was carried out in 3 l sbr reactors synthetic wastewater was dosed to the first reactor sbr 1 whereas synthetic wastewater with trc at a concentration of 0 2 mg l was dosed to the second reactor sbr 2 the experiments in sbr 1 and sbr 2 reactors were duplicated to control the biological treatment process and then the average values was presented the chamber was filled and emptied using heidolph peristaltic pumps heidolph schwabach germany each day in the morning the treated wastewater was collected by means of the peristaltic pump set to the appropriate volume wastewater quality parameters were measured in triplicate from which the average value was calculated the excess sludge was regularly discharged from the reactor in order to keep its concentration at 3 0 g l the solid retention time srt was 20 days the load of the sludge with the contaminants was 0 1 g cod gdmd and the oxygen concentration was 3 mg l the sequential biological reactor was operated in 1 cycle per day with the following conditions filing and mixing phase 6 h aeration phase 17 h sedimentation and sbr effluent discharge 1 h the duration of these phases was controlled by the electronic programmer aquarium cubes connected to the aeration pump tetratec aps 300 type tetra melle germany were used to aerate the reactor the contents of the chambers were mixed with a magnetic stirrer at a speed of rotation ranging from 50 to 1000 rpm sbr effluents from weeks 5th and 6th were mixed and treated in ultrafiltration adsorption ozonation ozonation uv 2 6 sbr 2 effluent treatment by ultrafiltration pressure filtration was carried out in the dead end ultrafiltration setup with a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar the setup was equipped with 400 ml stainless steel cell where a flat membrane 0 003848 m2 was placed before the ultrafiltration of feed water sbr 2 effluent the membranes rec ps and pes swcnt were conditioned with ultrapure water under the same pressure the permeate volume was measured in the same time intervals and the volumetric permeate flux was calculated based on eq 1 1 jv v a t where jv is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume 3 l a is the effective membrane surface are a m2 t is the filtration time h 2 7 sbr 2 effluent treatment in fixed bed columns the sbr 2 effluent treatment in fixed bed columns was conducted in 15 mm glass columns with a length of 15 cm at a flow rate of 1 ml min two columns were tested column i was a reference column filled with 15 cm of sand particle size 3 mm and column ii was filled with 5 cm of sand and 10 cm of hal swcnt grains the sand and grains were wet packed to avoid layering and air entrapment inside the column columns were mounted vertically and glass wool was used at the bottom of the column as supporting material of the adsorbent bed then ultrapure water was passed through the column for 1 day followed by pumping of the sbr 2 effluent basic quality parameters and trc and its by products were monitored in the samples collected from the column outlets for this purpose five filtrate portions were collected every 1 5 h all experiments were carried out at the room temperature 20 2 c 2 8 sbr 2 effluent treatment by o3 and o3 uv processes the advanced oxidation processes combining the action of ozone o3 and uv radiation was carried out in a 0 7 l glass batch reaction vessel placed on a dedicated magnetic stirrer a monochromatic uv lamp with a power of 15 w by heraeus hanau germany was used as the source of uv radiation the lamp was placed in a stand that allows the placement of the light source in the center of the reaction vessel the emitted radiation had a wavelength λmax of 254 nm which corresponds to an energy of radiation reaching the reaction mixtures of 4 88 ev estimated based on the multiplication of planck s constant with the frequency of light the fresh air ozone fm500 generator by wrc multiozon sopot poland was used for the generation of o3 the produced o3 was introduced to the reaction mixture through a bottom placed ceramic diffuser the dose of o3 used in the o3 uv process was based on preliminary studies which assessed the effectiveness of sbr effluent treatment in a single ozonation process the ozonation process was carried out at the following o3 doses 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l the spectroquant ozone test by merck kgaa darmstadt germany was applied for the photometrically measured of o3 concentration the samples were taken from the middle of the reaction solution instantly after ozone dosing to the water the contact time during single ozonation was 5 min the ozonation was halted by dosing 24 mmol l na2so3 the o3 uv process was carried out in a dark chamber to minimize the impact of artificial and sunlight radiation on the course of the decomposition reactions the oxidation process of sbr effluent was carried out under 24 1 c for 5 15 and 30 min 2 9 wastewater quality analysis the treatment performance in the sbr ultrafiltration fixed bed column and o3 and o3 uv processes were evaluated by the monitoring of typical quality parameters total cod bod5 toc color nitrate phosphate ammonium conductivity

their mass spectra with the united states national institute of standards and technology nistv 17 mass spectral library the lod limit of detection and loq limit of quantitation values for analytes are provided in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological treatment in the sbr to investigate the influence of trc on the efficiency of wastewater treatment in the sbr system two reactors were used i e the sbr 1 control reactor without trc and the sbr 2 reactor with trc the average values of the concentration of basic quality parameters cod toc color ammonium nitrogen phosphate and the degrees of their reduction in the sbr system are shown in fig 5 on each day measurements of wastewater quality parameters were carried out and then the average of the obtained values was taken the results present the mean taken from the analysis of wastewater quality parameters for every week and the error bars represent the standard deviation for both reactors the degree of cod removal was relatively stable during the 6 weeks of operation more specifically in sbr 2 the cod reduction varied from 88 8 to 90 whereas in sbr 2 it ranged from 88 to 90 6 however the cod concentration in the sbr 2 effluent was slightly higher 8 9 11 6 mg o2 l than that in the sbr 1 control reactor 5 2 11 2 mg o2 l importantly in both reactors the cod and toc concentrations did not exceed the permissible values for wastewater discharged to receiving waters according to the regulation of the minister of maritime economy and inland navigation of july 12 2019 on substances particularly harmful to the aquatic environment and the conditions to be met when discharging sewage into waters or ground as well as when discharging rainwater or meltwater into waters or into water facilities although the addition of trc to sbr 2 slightly increased the concentration of organic carbon almost all toc was removed in both reactors based on the cod and toc levels in sbr 1 and sbr 2 trc had no impact on the removal of organic compounds a slight deterioration of the treatment efficiency of sbr 2 compared to sbr 1 was noted for the color reduction the effluent color levels were 32 and 35 mg l for sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively throughout the entire process nitrate nitrogen in the effluent of both reactors remained at an average level of 8 mg l fig 8 the ammonium nitrogen concentration was 0 mg l for both reactors throughout the experimental period however both reactors showed insufficient phosphorus removal which was expected for sbr operation under laboratory conditions the phosphate concentration of the effluent from sbr 1 and sbr 2 exceeded the permissible values thus in the second part of this study additional methods were applied to eliminate phosphate in the context of phosphate removal there was a negative effect of trc in sbr 2 compared to sbr 1 the phosphate concentration in the sbr 2 effluent was around 30 higher than that in the sbr 1 effluent moreover phosphate removal in the sbr 2 reactor decreased throughout the 6 weeks from 48 1 to 38 1 in contrast for sbr 1 it increased from 34 3 to 71 8 this leads us to infer that a longer process time at a given trc concentration reduced the effectiveness of the sbr 2 reactor especially in the context of phosphate elimination table 3 presents the concentrations of trc and its by products such as methyl trc 2 4 dichlorophenol or 2 4 6 trichlorophenol in sbr 2 effluent over the first 3 weeks of sbr 2 operation the trc concentration in the effluent was 0 lod on the other hand no biodegradation by products of trc were detected suggesting that trc was adsorbed to sludge flocs but not biodegraded ying et al suggested that trc is removed during conventional wastewater treatment by adsorption and biodegradation 21 in the fourth week triclosan was detected in the sbr 2 while no methyl triclosan and other biodegradation byproducts were detected this indicates a reduction in the sorption capacity of the activated sludge in the fifth week in the sbr 2 effluent the triclosan concentration decreased compared to week 4 and methyl triclosan appeared this means that in the 5th week of sbr 2 operation triclosan decomposed in the sixth week the triclosan concentration in the sbr 2 effluent increased again and the concentration of methyl triclosan decreased compared to week 5 which shows that the activated sludge was losing the ability to degrade triclosan fig 6 this observation corresponds with the microscopic observations of activated sludge in week 6 fig 7 shows sludge flocs from both reactors in week 6 obviously the addition of trc impaired the quality of activated sludge in the sbr 2 reactor both the shape and size of the sludge flocs were changed the structure of flocs was looser compared to those from sbr 1 and the flocs were smaller and more irregularly shaped also the microbial community was considerably less varied it should be noted however that there were few filamentous bacteria in both reactors on the other hand the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment process was sufficient with the exception of phosphorus removal which is a common issue 22 the activated sludge index was determined daily the lower the value of the sedimentation index the better the sedimentation properties of the activated sludge however a low value does not always indicate good properties regarding sludge compaction in this study the flocs were smaller and more dispersed on the other hand the sediment index at the time of the experiment was on average 120 cm3 g for sbr 1 after 40 days of activated sludge operation this index decreased slightly to 118 cm3 g the sediment index values in the case of sbr 2 were slightly lower and reached 110 cm3 g most likely because of the changes in sediment structure 3 2 sbr 2 effluent treatment in ultrafiltration fig 8 shows the efficiency of sbr 2 in effluent treatment ultrafiltration with membrane pes swcnt was more effective compared to rec ps especially for the removal of nitrate trc and met trc more specifically nitrate was reduced by 25 9 and 59 3 by membranes rec ps and pes swcnt respectively trc and met trc were removed by 27 8 and 36 8 respectively for pes swcnt whereas for rec ps the removal degrees were 9 1 and 16 6 for trc and met trc respectively the higher treatment efficiency with membrane pes swcnt could be attributed to the single walled carbon nanotubes with a high specific surface area 1124 m2 g according to previous studies membranes filled with carbon nanotubes reveal strong adsorptive properties 23 24 thus the conventional sieve effect separation during uf is supported by pollutant adsorption 25 adsorption on membrane material contributed also to mediocre removal of phosphate and nitrate 9 1 59 9 by both uf membranes this mechanism of removal of nitrate and phosphate by uf membranes was reported by many authors 26 27 another retention mechanism of these substances can be excluded duo to much smaller ionic radii of ionic substances than the size of pores of uf membranes phosphate removal via ultrafiltration was insufficient for both membranes the phosphate concentration in the permeate exceeded the recommenced value for wastewater discharged into receiving waterbodies 28 as seen in fig 9 membrane pes swcnt revealed a higher permeate flux compared to rec ps this was unexpected since membrane rec ps had a slightly higher hydrophilic surface lower value of contact angle and a higher porosity than pes swcnt thus rec ps membrane was expected to be more permeable than pes swcnt the twice higher initial permeate flux for pes swcnt could be attributed to its lower thickness 75 9 μm compared to the 159 8 μm for rec ps table 2 a thinner membrane generally has a lower resistance resulting in a higher permeate flux 29 moreover the pes swcnt membrane demonstrated a decrease in permeate flux in time whereas in the case of rec ps permeate flux was relatively constant during the entire ultrafiltration period pollutant adsorption by carbon nanotubes in the pes swcnt membrane might explain the higher decrease in permeate flux as deposited and adsorbed pollutants block the membrane pores 30 31 3 3 sbr 2 effluent treatment in the fixed bed column fig 10 presents the treatment efficiency for sbr 2 effluent in adsorption columns filled with sand column i and sand hal swcnt grains column ii the reduction of typical water quality parameters nitrate phosphate color was lower in column i compared to column ii similarly the removal of trc and met trc was lower in column i the treatment efficiency decreased over time for both columns however a more pronounced decrease in reduction was observed for column i for example phosphate removal decreased from 86 to 3 and from 97 to 90 for columns i and ii respectively this indicates the superiority of hal swcnt adsorbents over conventional sand 3 3 1 breakthrough curves of effluent pollutants in the fixed bed column the breakthrough curves show the ratio of concentration at a time t and the initial concentration versus time fig 11 curves for column i fig 11a indicate that breakthrough occurred rapidly for nitrate and phosphate exhaustion of the bed c c0 0 9 was achieved after 240 min indicating that after this nitrate and phosphate passed through the column spontaneously and reached the outlet without any reaction with sand for column ii breakthrough occurred only for nitrate and at around 300 min phosphate retention was high throughout the experimental period most likely phosphate was strongly adsorbed by hal swcnt as halloysite is dedicated for removal of these pollutants 32 the difference in the removal of phosphate and nitrate can be attributed to the strong competition between them and to different adsorption mechanisms 33 alagaha et al 34 suggested that the higher adsorption of phosphate compared to nitrate occurs because phosphate adsorption is attributed to chemisorption and endothermic reactions under natural conditions whereas nitrate adsorption is based on physisorption and exothermic reactions some authors have shown that during the simultaneous adsorption of nitrate and phosphate adsorption of nitrate is generally lower 35 36 3 4 sbr 2 effluent treatment in o3 and o3 uv processes the single ozonation experiments allowed the selection of the o3 dose used in the o3 uv process fig 12 summarizes the treatment efficiencies for sbr 2 effluent subjected to the action of o3 at concentrations of 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l the 5 minute contact time of o3 species with the pollutants in the sbr 2 effluent resulted in a high removal of phosphate the phosphate concentration decreased by 92 for o3 at 1 0 mg l and by 93 for o3 at 5 0 and 10 0 mg l it should be noted that phosphorus occurs in wastewater in two operationally defined fractions which can be determined by colorimetric detection methods termed reactive phosphorus or were unable to be detected by these types of methods non reactive phosphorus clark et al 37 as well as venkiteshwaran et al 38 indicated that over 75 of the total phosphorus amount in wastewater belongs to the group of termed reactive phosphorus species therefore the obtained reduction of the concentration of the measured phosphate form did not refer to the total phosphorus content in the treated wastewater a decrease in the concentration can be the result of the transformation of the termed reactive species to the non reactive form gray et al 39 indicated that organic phosphorus can be successfully removed in advanced oxidation processes also other studies 40 41 in this field indicate that oxidation agents are potentially effective at oxidizing organic phosphorus compounds to form inorganic phosphorus forms the removal of trc and met trc increased with increasing o3 doses the highest differences in compound decomposition were noted between the o3 concentrations of 1 0 and 2 0 for example the removal of met trc at an o3 dose of 1 0 mg l was 96 and increased to 99 by doubling the o3 dose the differences in the removal degrees for both micropollutants among o3 doses of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 were negligible and within the error limit the basic mechanisms of pollutant decomposition during ozonation are their oxidation and reduction through electron transfer 42 the o3 can also react with compounds through the cycloaddition reaction creating a five membered ozonide structure 43 moreover o3 is an electrophilic agent and can attack the nucleophilic position of organic substances the type of groups in the structure of an aromatic molecule such as oh or cl can significantly influence the reactivity of the aromatic ring with o3 our results indicate that the compounds occurring in the treated sbr 2 effluent were most susceptible to decomposition by o3 only in the case of nitrates a negligible removal which did not exceed 17 was noted fig 13 also the color of the samples was not completely reduced making it necessary to perform a process that combines the action of two oxidizing agents such as the o3 uv process the o3 uv process was conducted at an o3 dose of 1 mg l based on the results obtained in the single ozonation process the removal degrees for the selected contaminants and the measured sample color indicate that o3 concentrations above 1 mg l do not contribute to a significant improvement in the treatment efficiency for sbr 2 effluent the nitrates phosphates color trc and met trc removal degrees obtained during the o3 uv process fig 13 resulted from the simultaneous action of the o3 induced oxidation and reduction of compounds and photochemical reactions the photochemical decomposition of a compound is initiated when the compound absorbs the first photon leading to the electron excitation state of the compound molecule 44 the susceptibility of compounds to decomposition under the influence of uv radiation depends on their structure the presence of particular functional groups and the radiation energy 45 the removal degrees for nitrate phosphate trc and met trc show that the decomposition of compounds was most pronounced in the first 5 min after this the nitrate and phosphate levels were reduced by 88 and 95 respectively also the remaining compounds responsible for the color of the tested solutions were reduced by 72 after 5 min extending the duration of the process up to 30 min resulted in an over 97 removal of phosphates and a 91 removal of nitrates the implementation of the o3 uv process resulted in the complete removal of trc and met trc the high efficiency of the o3 uv process was also based on the formation of photogenerated reactive oxygen species these species were formed during the irradiation of dissolved organic matter and or nitrates and nitrites with uv light 46 photogenerated reactive oxygen species contributed to the decomposition of micropollutants such as cationic surfactants trc and met trc as a result of the so called indirect photolysis of compounds advanced oxidation processes based on the action of o3 can be an effective method for the decomposition of a large number of organic micropollutants however they can lead to the formation of intermediates those newly formed compounds can become another challenge in the development of effective techniques for the treatment of water streams for example the simultaneous action of o3 and sunlight on trc solutions can result in the generation of chlorophenols which increases the toxicity of the post processed solutions 47 the literature 48 49 does not clearly indicate the negative impacts of ozonation on the quality of treated water matrices containing pharmaceutical or antiviral agents stalter et al 50 highlight the toxic nature of some transformation products of organic compounds contained in water solutions of a complex physicochemical composition thus a high degree of compound removal does not always prove the effectiveness of a given process it is recommended to supplement the advanced oxidation processes by an additional process such as adsorption or filtration that will allow for the separation of the formed by products of the decomposition of compounds 4 conclusions this study shows that the covid 19 pandemic affected biological wastewater treatment due to adverse effects of overused disinfectants such as trc on microorganisms in activated sludge the treatment efficiency of the sbr 2 reactor for trc containing wastewater was significantly lower for phosphate permissible values therefore sbr 2 effluent cannot be discharged without additional treatment exposure to trc resulted in adverse effects on the structure of the activated sludge compared to the control sbr reactor wastewater without trc the flocs from the sbr containing trc were looser and smaller trc was not detected in the sbr 2 effluent at an sbr operation period of 3 weeks which was however not attributed to its biodegradation since no trc byproducts methyl triclosan 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol were detected this leads us to infer that tcr removal is linked with adsorption on activated sludge a biodegradation of trc was noted in the 5th week of sbr operation whereas in the sixth week biodegradation was less pronounced as the concentration of trc increased and that of met trc decreased this corresponds with the activated sludge impairment after this period since the sbr 2 effluent contained trc met trc and excess phosphate levels additional treatment was required ultrafiltration could not sufficiently remove trc met trc and phosphate from sbr 2 effluent based on the results treatment in the fixed bed column packed with hal swcnt grainy composite adsorbent is highly efficient for the removal of phosphate trc and met trc however the efficiency decreased over time breakthrough occurred more rapidly for the control column packed with sand for nitrate and phosphate compared to the column packed with hal swcnt adsorbents which only showed breakthrough for nitrate after 300 min in the tertiary treatment with o3 and o3 uv the treatment efficiency for all studied parameters was highest the o3 uv processes carried for 5 min by the o3 equal to 1 mg l allowed for the complete removal of trc and met trc as well as an over 88 decrease of nitrates and 95 of phosphates aops can be successfully used

12786,the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in an increased use of disinfectants worldwide one of the most popular active ingredients is triclosan trc which is added to personal care products such as soap wet wipes and dish soap negative aspect of trc in wastewater is its release into the environment since trc is not completely removed in wwtps in the context of the rapidly increasing concentration of disinfectants in the wastewater influent the aim of the study was to develop a method for treating wastewater containing trc biological treatment in a sequential batch reactor sbr was used and then the sbr effluent was treated in one of the tertiary processes i e ultrafiltration adsorption ozonation ozonation uv in the ultrafiltration step innovative membranes were used such as membranes prepared from recycled polystyrene rec ps or polyethersulfone mixed with single walled carbon nanotubes pes swcnt adsorption was conducted in fixed bed columns packed with novel composite adsorbent containing halloysite and single walled carbon nanotubes trc impaired the removal of phosphate and caused the degradation of activated sludge phosphate removal in the sbr 2 reactor wastewater with trc decreased throughout the 6 weeks from 48 1 to 38 1 in contrast for sbr 1 wastewater without trc it increased from 34 3 to 71 8 the phosphate concentration of the effluent exceeded the permissible values necessitating further treatment flocs from sbr 2 were smaller and looser compared to those from the control sbr biodegradation of trc was noted in the 5th week of the operation as methyl trc was detected in the effluent 0 07 mg l in ultrafiltration with pes swcnt membrane phosphate trc and methyl trc were reduced by 33 7 27 8 36 8 respectively on the other hand adsorption ozonation and ozonation uv processes were highly suitable to treat sbr effluent the phosphate trc and trc byproducts removal degrees exceeded 90 both for adsorption in the fixed bed column as well as the ozonation and ozonation uv processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covid 19 triclosan biological treatment wastewater ultrafiltration adsorption aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a potent way to limit coronavirus transmission in 2020 many governments restricted industrial commercial and social activities this lockdown had a positive effect on the natural environment such as reduced air and water pollution numerous countries reported a remarkable drop in the emission of greenhouse gases and particulate matter 1 for example as a result of the lockdown the water quality of the canals in venice improved considerably 2 similarly improved quality of water was reported in surface water from vembanad lake in india as concentration of suspended particulate matter was reduced by 15 9 in lockdown period 3 however because of the increased use of antiseptics containing among others alcohols chlorine compounds biocides pesticides and surfactants wastewater influent is loaded with additional organic matter 4 5 an excessive disinfectant loads can disturb the biological treatment by inactivating the microorganisms in the activated sludge consequently the quality of the effluent discharged into waterbodies is lower with various adverse effects on the aquatic environment such as eutrophication destruction of the aquatic fauna and flora and increased antibiotic and antiviral resistance 6 7 one of the most popular biocides is triclosan trc which is detected in aquatic environments at high rates 6 trc is widely used in pharmaceutical and personal care products hand soap and wet wipes to protect against coronavirus triclosan has a broad spectrum antibacterial activity the adverse effect of trc in wastewater is related to the direct exposure of activated sludge microorganisms 8 resulting in inhibited bacterial growth decreased bacterial diversity and abundance and changes in the bacterial community structure 9 as a consequence decreased nutrient removal in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is observed 10 11 another negative aspect of trc in wastewater is its release into the environment since trc is not completely removed in wwtps of the total load of trc in wwtp influent around 48 9 61 2 is biodegraded whereas 36 49 is adsorbed by sludge thus around 10 is discharged into the receiving waterbodies 6 12 this makes wwtp effluent a main source of trc in surface and drinking water to mitigate this issue different tertiary treatment methods are implemented including membrane filtration adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops 13 these techniques should include the removal of residual trc and its by products and control the levels of nutrients and organic compounds this is especially important against the background of the covid 19 pandemic with the overuse of disinfectants shakil et al 1 highlight the need to study the relationship between covid 19 and the environment and yang et al 14 report that sars cov 2 rna persists in wastewater systems for more than 19 days making wastewater is a potential source of the virus current studies mostly report the direct effect of covid 19 on wastewater quality focusing on the development of methods to mitigate virus transmission in wastewater by tertiary treatment with membrane processes or disinfection techniques 15 16 on the other hand fate of triclosan in wwtp or methods for removal of trc or its by products are well known however to the best of our knowledge studies on the indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater treatment and effluent quality are lacking therefore this study presents a novel approach focusing on effect of trc in wastewater on general treatment efficiency in biological treatment and three different tertiary processes i e ultrafiltration fixed bed adsorption ozonation ozonation uv another novelty of this study is to use an innovative membranes prepared from waste polystyrene and polyether sulfone with single walled carbon nanotubes and adsorbents prepared from halloysite and single walled carbon nanotubes in ultrafiltration and adsorption these materials were applied for the first time to remove trc trc byproducts and other pollutants from wastewater in tertiary treatment 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials broth peptone nh4cl nacl cacl2 6h2o mgso4 7h2o k2hpo4 and kh2po4 were

gliwice poland biological treatment was carried out in 3 l sbr reactors synthetic wastewater was dosed to the first reactor sbr 1 whereas synthetic wastewater with trc at a concentration of 0 2 mg l was dosed to the second reactor sbr 2 the experiments in sbr 1 and sbr 2 reactors were duplicated to control the biological treatment process and then the average values was presented the chamber was filled and emptied using heidolph peristaltic pumps heidolph schwabach germany each day in the morning the treated wastewater was collected by means of the peristaltic pump set to the appropriate volume wastewater quality parameters were measured in triplicate from which the average value was calculated the excess sludge was regularly discharged from the reactor in order to keep its concentration at 3 0 g l the solid retention time srt was 20 days the load of the sludge with the contaminants was 0 1 g cod gdmd and the oxygen concentration was 3 mg l the sequential biological reactor was operated in 1 cycle per day with the following conditions filing and mixing phase 6 h aeration phase 17 h sedimentation and sbr effluent discharge 1 h the duration of these phases was controlled by the electronic programmer aquarium cubes connected to the aeration pump tetratec aps 300 type tetra melle germany were used to aerate the reactor the contents of the chambers were mixed with a magnetic stirrer at a speed of rotation ranging from 50 to 1000 rpm sbr effluents from weeks 5th and 6th were mixed and treated in ultrafiltration adsorption ozonation ozonation uv 2 6 sbr 2 effluent treatment by ultrafiltration pressure filtration was carried out in the dead end ultrafiltration setup with a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar the setup was equipped with 400 ml stainless steel cell where a flat membrane 0 003848 m2 was placed before the ultrafiltration of feed water sbr 2 effluent the membranes rec ps and pes swcnt were conditioned with ultrapure water under the same pressure the permeate volume was measured in the same time intervals and the volumetric permeate flux was calculated based on eq 1 1 jv v a t where jv is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 v is the permeate volume 3 l a is the effective membrane surface are a m2 t is the filtration time h 2 7 sbr 2 effluent treatment in fixed bed columns the sbr 2 effluent treatment in fixed bed columns was conducted in 15 mm glass columns with a length of 15 cm at a flow rate of 1 ml min two columns were tested column i was a reference column filled with 15 cm of sand particle size 3 mm and column ii was filled with 5 cm of sand and 10 cm of hal swcnt grains the sand and grains were wet packed to avoid layering and air entrapment inside the column columns were mounted vertically and glass wool was used at the bottom of the column as supporting material of the adsorbent bed then ultrapure water was passed through the column for 1 day followed by pumping of the sbr 2 effluent basic quality parameters and trc and its by products were monitored in the samples collected from the column outlets for this purpose five filtrate portions were collected every 1 5 h all experiments were carried out at the room temperature 20 2 c 2 8 sbr 2 effluent treatment by o3 and o3 uv processes the advanced oxidation processes combining the action of ozone o3 and uv radiation was carried out in a 0 7 l glass batch reaction vessel placed on a dedicated magnetic stirrer a monochromatic uv lamp with a power of 15 w by heraeus hanau germany was used as the source of uv radiation the lamp was placed in a stand that allows the placement of the light source in the center of the reaction vessel the emitted radiation had a wavelength λmax of 254 nm which corresponds to an energy of radiation reaching the reaction mixtures of 4 88 ev estimated based on the multiplication of planck s constant with the frequency of light the fresh air ozone fm500 generator by wrc multiozon sopot poland was used for the generation of o3 the produced o3 was introduced to the reaction mixture through a bottom placed ceramic diffuser the dose of o3 used in the o3 uv process was based on preliminary studies which assessed the effectiveness of sbr effluent treatment in a single ozonation process the ozonation process was carried out at the following o3 doses 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l the spectroquant ozone test by merck kgaa darmstadt germany was applied for the photometrically measured of o3 concentration the samples were taken from the middle of the reaction solution instantly after ozone dosing to the water the contact time during single ozonation was 5 min the ozonation was halted by dosing 24 mmol l na2so3 the o3 uv process was carried out in a dark chamber to minimize the impact of artificial and sunlight radiation on the course of the decomposition reactions the oxidation process of sbr effluent was carried out under 24 1 c for 5 15 and 30 min 2 9 wastewater quality analysis the treatment performance in the sbr ultrafiltration fixed bed column and o3 and o3 uv processes were evaluated by the monitoring of typical quality parameters total cod bod5 toc color nitrate phosphate ammonium conductivity

their mass spectra with the united states national institute of standards and technology nistv 17 mass spectral library the lod limit of detection and loq limit of quantitation values for analytes are provided in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological treatment in the sbr to investigate the influence of trc on the efficiency of wastewater treatment in the sbr system two reactors were used i e the sbr 1 control reactor without trc and the sbr 2 reactor with trc the average values of the concentration of basic quality parameters cod toc color ammonium nitrogen phosphate and the degrees of their reduction in the sbr system are shown in fig 5 on each day measurements of wastewater quality parameters were carried out and then the average of the obtained values was taken the results present the mean taken from the analysis of wastewater quality parameters for every week and the error bars represent the standard deviation for both reactors the degree of cod removal was relatively stable during the 6 weeks of operation more specifically in sbr 2 the cod reduction varied from 88 8 to 90 whereas in sbr 2 it ranged from 88 to 90 6 however the cod concentration in the sbr 2 effluent was slightly higher 8 9 11 6 mg o2 l than that in the sbr 1 control reactor 5 2 11 2 mg o2 l importantly in both reactors the cod and toc concentrations did not exceed the permissible values for wastewater discharged to receiving waters according to the regulation of the minister of maritime economy and inland navigation of july 12 2019 on substances particularly harmful to the aquatic environment and the conditions to be met when discharging sewage into waters or ground as well as when discharging rainwater or meltwater into waters or into water facilities although the addition of trc to sbr 2 slightly increased the concentration of organic carbon almost all toc was removed in both reactors based on the cod and toc levels in sbr 1 and sbr 2 trc had no impact on the removal of organic compounds a slight deterioration of the treatment efficiency of sbr 2 compared to sbr 1 was noted for the color reduction the effluent color levels were 32 and 35 mg l for sbr 1 and sbr 2 respectively throughout the entire process nitrate nitrogen in the effluent of both reactors remained at an average level of 8 mg l fig 8 the ammonium nitrogen concentration was 0 mg l for both reactors throughout the experimental period however both reactors showed insufficient phosphorus removal which was expected for sbr operation under laboratory conditions the phosphate concentration of the effluent from sbr 1 and sbr 2 exceeded the permissible values thus in the second part of this study additional methods were applied to eliminate phosphate in the context of phosphate removal there was a negative effect of trc in sbr 2 compared to sbr 1 the phosphate concentration in the sbr 2 effluent was around 30 higher than that in the sbr 1 effluent moreover phosphate removal in the sbr 2 reactor decreased throughout the 6 weeks from 48 1 to 38 1 in contrast for sbr 1 it increased from 34 3 to 71 8 this leads us to infer that a longer process time at a given trc concentration reduced the effectiveness of the sbr 2 reactor especially in the context of phosphate elimination table 3 presents the concentrations of trc and its by products such as methyl trc 2 4 dichlorophenol or 2 4 6 trichlorophenol in sbr 2 effluent over the first 3 weeks of sbr 2 operation the trc concentration in the effluent was 0 lod on the other hand no biodegradation by products of trc were detected suggesting that trc was adsorbed to sludge flocs but not biodegraded ying et al suggested that trc is removed during conventional wastewater treatment by adsorption and biodegradation 21 in the fourth week triclosan was detected in the sbr 2 while no methyl triclosan and other biodegradation byproducts were detected this indicates a reduction in the sorption capacity of the activated sludge in the fifth week in the sbr 2 effluent the triclosan concentration decreased compared to week 4 and methyl triclosan appeared this means that in the 5th week of sbr 2 operation triclosan decomposed in the sixth week the triclosan concentration in the sbr 2 effluent increased again and the concentration of methyl triclosan decreased compared to week 5 which shows that the activated sludge was losing the ability to degrade triclosan fig 6 this observation corresponds with the microscopic observations of activated sludge in week 6 fig 7 shows sludge flocs from both reactors in week 6 obviously the addition of trc impaired the quality of activated sludge in the sbr 2 reactor both the shape and size of the sludge flocs were changed the structure of flocs was looser compared to those from sbr 1 and the flocs were smaller and more irregularly shaped also the microbial community was considerably less varied it should be noted however that there were few filamentous bacteria in both reactors on the other hand the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment process was sufficient with the exception of phosphorus removal which is a common issue 22 the activated sludge index was determined daily the lower the value of the sedimentation index the better the sedimentation properties of the activated sludge however a low value does not always indicate good properties regarding sludge compaction in this study the flocs were smaller and more dispersed on the other hand the sediment index at the time of the experiment was on average 120 cm3 g for sbr 1 after 40 days of activated sludge operation this index decreased slightly to 118 cm3 g the sediment index values in the case of sbr 2 were slightly lower and reached 110 cm3 g most likely because of the changes in sediment structure 3 2 sbr 2 effluent treatment in ultrafiltration fig 8 shows the efficiency of sbr 2 in effluent treatment ultrafiltration with membrane pes swcnt was more effective compared to rec ps especially for the removal of nitrate trc and met trc more specifically nitrate was reduced by 25 9 and 59 3 by membranes rec ps and pes swcnt respectively trc and met trc were removed by 27 8 and 36 8 respectively for pes swcnt whereas for rec ps the removal degrees were 9 1 and 16 6 for trc and met trc respectively the higher treatment efficiency with membrane pes swcnt could be attributed to the single walled carbon nanotubes with a high specific surface area 1124 m2 g according to previous studies membranes filled with carbon nanotubes reveal strong adsorptive properties 23 24 thus the conventional sieve effect separation during uf is supported by pollutant adsorption 25 adsorption on membrane material contributed also to mediocre removal of phosphate and nitrate 9 1 59 9 by both uf membranes this mechanism of removal of nitrate and phosphate by uf membranes was reported by many authors 26 27 another retention mechanism of these substances can be excluded duo to much smaller ionic radii of ionic substances than the size of pores of uf membranes phosphate removal via ultrafiltration was insufficient for both membranes the phosphate concentration in the permeate exceeded the recommenced value for wastewater discharged into receiving waterbodies 28 as seen in fig 9 membrane pes swcnt revealed a higher permeate flux compared to rec ps this was unexpected since membrane rec ps had a slightly higher hydrophilic surface lower value of contact angle and a higher porosity than pes swcnt thus rec ps membrane was expected to be more permeable than pes swcnt the twice higher initial permeate flux for pes swcnt could be attributed to its lower thickness 75 9 μm compared to the 159 8 μm for rec ps table 2 a thinner membrane generally has a lower resistance resulting in a higher permeate flux 29 moreover the pes swcnt membrane demonstrated a decrease in permeate flux in time whereas in the case of rec ps permeate flux was relatively constant during the entire ultrafiltration period pollutant adsorption by carbon nanotubes in the pes swcnt membrane might explain the higher decrease in permeate flux as deposited and adsorbed pollutants block the membrane pores 30 31 3 3 sbr 2 effluent treatment in the fixed bed column fig 10 presents the treatment efficiency for sbr 2 effluent in adsorption columns filled with sand column i and sand hal swcnt grains column ii the reduction of typical water quality parameters nitrate phosphate color was lower in column i compared to column ii similarly the removal of trc and met trc was lower in column i the treatment efficiency decreased over time for both columns however a more pronounced decrease in reduction was observed for column i for example phosphate removal decreased from 86 to 3 and from 97 to 90 for columns i and ii respectively this indicates the superiority of hal swcnt adsorbents over conventional sand 3 3 1 breakthrough curves of effluent pollutants in the fixed bed column the breakthrough curves show the ratio of concentration at a time t and the initial concentration versus time fig 11 curves for column i fig 11a indicate that breakthrough occurred rapidly for nitrate and phosphate exhaustion of the bed c c0 0 9 was achieved after 240 min indicating that after this nitrate and phosphate passed through the column spontaneously and reached the outlet without any reaction with sand for column ii breakthrough occurred only for nitrate and at around 300 min phosphate retention was high throughout the experimental period most likely phosphate was strongly adsorbed by hal swcnt as halloysite is dedicated for removal of these pollutants 32 the difference in the removal of phosphate and nitrate can be attributed to the strong competition between them and to different adsorption mechanisms 33 alagaha et al 34 suggested that the higher adsorption of phosphate compared to nitrate occurs because phosphate adsorption is attributed to chemisorption and endothermic reactions under natural conditions whereas nitrate adsorption is based on physisorption and exothermic reactions some authors have shown that during the simultaneous adsorption of nitrate and phosphate adsorption of nitrate is generally lower 35 36 3 4 sbr 2 effluent treatment in o3 and o3 uv processes the single ozonation experiments allowed the selection of the o3 dose used in the o3 uv process fig 12 summarizes the treatment efficiencies for sbr 2 effluent subjected to the action of o3 at concentrations of 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg l the 5 minute contact time of o3 species with the pollutants in the sbr 2 effluent resulted in a high removal of phosphate the phosphate concentration decreased by 92 for o3 at 1 0 mg l and by 93 for o3 at 5 0 and 10 0 mg l it should be noted that phosphorus occurs in wastewater in two operationally defined fractions which can be determined by colorimetric detection methods termed reactive phosphorus or were unable to be detected by these types of methods non reactive phosphorus clark et al 37 as well as venkiteshwaran et al 38 indicated that over 75 of the total phosphorus amount in wastewater belongs to the group of termed reactive phosphorus species therefore the obtained reduction of the concentration of the measured phosphate form did not refer to the total phosphorus content in the treated wastewater a decrease in the concentration can be the result of the transformation of the termed reactive species to the non reactive form gray et al 39 indicated that organic phosphorus can be successfully removed in advanced oxidation processes also other studies 40 41 in this field indicate that oxidation agents are potentially effective at oxidizing organic phosphorus compounds to form inorganic phosphorus forms the removal of trc and met trc increased with increasing o3 doses the highest differences in compound decomposition were noted between the o3 concentrations of 1 0 and 2 0 for example the removal of met trc at an o3 dose of 1 0 mg l was 96 and increased to 99 by doubling the o3 dose the differences in the removal degrees for both micropollutants among o3 doses of 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 were negligible and within the error limit the basic mechanisms of pollutant decomposition during ozonation are their oxidation and reduction through electron transfer 42 the o3 can also react with compounds through the cycloaddition reaction creating a five membered ozonide structure 43 moreover o3 is an electrophilic agent and can attack the nucleophilic position of organic substances the type of groups in the structure of an aromatic molecule such as oh or cl can significantly influence the reactivity of the aromatic ring with o3 our results indicate that the compounds occurring in the treated sbr 2 effluent were most susceptible to decomposition by o3 only in the case of nitrates a negligible removal which did not exceed 17 was noted fig 13 also the color of the samples was not completely reduced making it necessary to perform a process that combines the action of two oxidizing agents such as the o3 uv process the o3 uv process was conducted at an o3 dose of 1 mg l based on the results obtained in the single ozonation process the removal degrees for the selected contaminants and the measured sample color indicate that o3 concentrations above 1 mg l do not contribute to a significant improvement in the treatment efficiency for sbr 2 effluent the nitrates phosphates color trc and met trc removal degrees obtained during the o3 uv process fig 13 resulted from the simultaneous action of the o3 induced oxidation and reduction of compounds and photochemical reactions the photochemical decomposition of a compound is initiated when the compound absorbs the first photon leading to the electron excitation state of the compound molecule 44 the susceptibility of compounds to decomposition under the influence of uv radiation depends on their structure the presence of particular functional groups and the radiation energy 45 the removal degrees for nitrate phosphate trc and met trc show that the decomposition of compounds was most pronounced in the first 5 min after this the nitrate and phosphate levels were reduced by 88 and 95 respectively also the remaining compounds responsible for the color of the tested solutions were reduced by 72 after 5 min extending the duration of the process up to 30 min resulted in an over 97 removal of phosphates and a 91 removal of nitrates the implementation of the o3 uv process resulted in the complete removal of trc and met trc the high efficiency of the o3 uv process was also based on the formation of photogenerated reactive oxygen species these species were formed during the irradiation of dissolved organic matter and or nitrates and nitrites with uv light 46 photogenerated reactive oxygen species contributed to the decomposition of micropollutants such as cationic surfactants trc and met trc as a result of the so called indirect photolysis of compounds advanced oxidation processes based on the action of o3 can be an effective method for the decomposition of a large number of organic micropollutants however they can lead to the formation of intermediates those newly formed compounds can become another challenge in the development of effective techniques for the treatment of water streams for example the simultaneous action of o3 and sunlight on trc solutions can result in the generation of chlorophenols which increases the toxicity of the post processed solutions 47 the literature 48 49 does not clearly indicate the negative impacts of ozonation on the quality of treated water matrices containing pharmaceutical or antiviral agents stalter et al 50 highlight the toxic nature of some transformation products of organic compounds contained in water solutions of a complex physicochemical composition thus a high degree of compound removal does not always prove the effectiveness of a given process it is recommended to supplement the advanced oxidation processes by an additional process such as adsorption or filtration that will allow for the separation of the formed by products of the decomposition of compounds 4 conclusions this study shows that the covid 19 pandemic affected biological wastewater treatment due to adverse effects of overused disinfectants such as trc on microorganisms in activated sludge the treatment efficiency of the sbr 2 reactor for trc containing wastewater was significantly lower for phosphate permissible values therefore sbr 2 effluent cannot be discharged without additional treatment exposure to trc resulted in adverse effects on the structure of the activated sludge compared to the control sbr reactor wastewater without trc the flocs from the sbr containing trc were looser and smaller trc was not detected in the sbr 2 effluent at an sbr operation period of 3 weeks which was however not attributed to its biodegradation since no trc byproducts methyl triclosan 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol were detected this leads us to infer that tcr removal is linked with adsorption on activated sludge a biodegradation of trc was noted in the 5th week of sbr operation whereas in the sixth week biodegradation was less pronounced as the concentration of trc increased and that of met trc decreased this corresponds with the activated sludge impairment after this period since the sbr 2 effluent contained trc met trc and excess phosphate levels additional treatment was required ultrafiltration could not sufficiently remove trc met trc and phosphate from sbr 2 effluent based on the results treatment in the fixed bed column packed with hal swcnt grainy composite adsorbent is highly efficient for the removal of phosphate trc and met trc however the efficiency decreased over time breakthrough occurred more rapidly for the control column packed with sand for nitrate and phosphate compared to the column packed with hal swcnt adsorbents which only showed breakthrough for nitrate after 300 min in the tertiary treatment with o3 and o3 uv the treatment efficiency for all studied parameters was highest the o3 uv processes carried for 5 min by the o3 equal to 1 mg l allowed for the complete removal of trc and met trc as well as an over 88 decrease of nitrates and 95 of phosphates aops can be successfully used

of technology zhengzhou 450001 china school of environmental engineering henan university of technology zhengzhou 450001 china the effects of different temperature conditions on nitritation denitrification are still unclear in this study two sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to explore the effects of stepwise cooling 28 2 24 5 20 6 17 0 c and continuous low temperature 17 0 c on partial nitrification denitrification pnd the pnd performance sludge characteristics and microbial communities were evaluated the results showed that pnd completed start up faster and achieved 80 nitrite accumulation under stepwise cooling conditions while a longer acclimation period was required under continuous low temperature conditions higher dissolved oxygen limits should be used for real time control at low temperatures to achieve complete ammonia removal fitting using arrhenius equation it was found that pnd was not significantly affected by temperature at 17 28 c however the denitrification activity was significantly inhibited by temperatures below 17 c bacteroidota phylum proliferated at low temperatures while dgaos proliferated only under stepwise cooling conditions and they may contribute to efficient denitrification sludge bulking under sustained low temperature conditions eased with increasing pnd activity suggesting that sludge settling performance needs attention when activity is low graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial nitrification denitrification low temperature sludge bulking microorganisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen pollutants in municipal wastewater are mainly present in the form of ammonia biological treatment has become a common technology for the removal of ammonia conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps generally use complete nitrification denitrification as the mainstream process for ammonia removal 1 however this process has the disadvantages of long reaction time high energy consumption and insufficient carbon source in the anoxic section 2 the partial nitrification denitrification pnd process accumulates only nitrite during aerobic phase and the nitrite is subsequently reduced to n2 it saves 25 of aeration and 40 of organic carbon compared to conventional biological nitrogen removal processes and reduces reaction time and sludge production and has attracted much attention in recent years 3 since nitrogen conversion in the pnd process is highly correlated with dissolved oxygen do concentration ph and oxidation reduction potential orp the development of real time control relying on programmable logic controllers plc has facilitated its research and application 4 5 moreover pnd can be combined with the emerging process anammox which is a highly promising autotrophic process 6 in conclusion the development of pnd as one of the new biological nitrogen removal processes has important implications for the future reformation of wwtps however the application of pnd in wwtps faces numerous challenges the key to long term stable operation of partial nitrification is the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob higher ph 7 5 9 0 insufficient do below 1 0 mg l 1 and free ammonia fa 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 all have inhibitory effects on nob 1 7 in addition wang et al 8 demonstrated the feasibility of using hydroxylamine as an inhibitor of nob ambient temperatures below the comfortable temperature of aob is one of the most difficult bottlenecks to overcome the temperatures below 25 c are generally considered low for partial nitrification processes 9 10 the recommended temperature for aob is 25 c or higher while the water temperature in colder regions is generally below 20 c 11 in addition the maximum growth rate of aob is not as good as the maximum growth rate of nob when it is below 25 c 12 it has been proven that nob activity may be restored at 15 c which is detrimental to partial nitrification 13 low temperatures have an overall inhibitory effect on the reaction rate and microbial growth of pnd and they may also trigger sludge bulking especially when climate change brings a sharp drop in temperature 14 the characteristics of temperature change vary globally with some regions often experiencing sharp seasonal cooling while other regions experience more moderate cold shocks 15 therefore the study of the operational characteristics of pnd during different temperature reduction is necessary the understanding of the specific effects of temperature on pnd is not consistent recent studies found that granulation of sludge at 10 15 c helped to inhibit nob 16 whereas prolonged non discharge at 10 c promoted nob growth 17 it is widely believed that the ability of nitrifying bacteria to reproduce is inhibited by temperature reduction 18 in contrast luo et al 14 found that the abundance of aob and nob increased with cooling in wwtps in cold regions some studies found that low temperatures do not reduce nitrite accumulation 19 20 in addition cold usually leads to sludge bulking which does not impair the effluent quality but is detrimental to the operation of wastewater treatment systems 21 zeng et al 22 operated pnd in an anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor and found that low do 0 3 0 5 mg l 1 did not trigger sludge bulking at 22 c some filamentous bacteria such as microthrix trichococcus and thiothrix which are prone to sludge bulking are widely present in wastewater treatment systems 23 a study has been conducted to reveal the effect of low temperature 5 20 c on partial nitrification in the long and short term 19 however very limited studies have been conducted on the combined effects of different low temperature conditions on the characteristics of sludge and microorganisms in this study the pnd was run with stepwise cooling and continuous low temperature respectively aiming to assess the stability of pnd reaction rate and nitrogen removal during the two low temperature processes reveal changes in sludge growth characteristics and settling performance and discuss changes in microbial communities to reveal functional bacteria and biological triggers of sludge bulking during low temperature pnd 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup this study used two identical sequential batch reactors sbrs each with a working volume of 10 l each reactor was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and air pump for aeration and a rotameter was used for airflow control to maintain the do levels in the system temperature controlled devices were wrapped around the outer wall of the reactor to control the temperature of the system do orp and ph probes in reactors were connected to a plc for real time monitoring via a computer switches on the plc controller control the nitrogen feeding agitation aeration chemical oxygen demand cod feeding and discharge of the reactor inlet outlet and carbon source replenishment are achieved by peristaltic pumps longer china 2 2 operation strategy the sbrs in this study were operated indoors in winter with an average room temperature of 16 4 c the two reactors adopted aerobic anoxic operation modes for partial nitrification and denitrification each cycle includes pre aeration 20 min influent 10 min aeration cod feeding 5 min anoxic settling 40 min and decant 10 min the lengths of aeration and anoxic phase were controlled by the real time control system the purpose of pre aeration is to remove residual cod from the previous cycle in order to promote nitrite accumulation aeration was terminated once do exceeded 0 5 mg l 1 throughout the experiment both sbrs were applied with the same do control strategy the volume exchange ratio was set at 0 3 the specific operation strategies of the two sbrs are shown in table 1 the ph of the whole pnd process was maintained between 7 8 and 9 0 sbr1 was operated in four phases phase i ii iii and iv at four temperatures 28 2 1 0 24 5 1 3 20 6 1 3 c and ambient temperature 17 0 1 1 c while sbr2 was consistently operated at ambient temperature through three phases start up phase phase i and phase ii initially no sludge was discharged in order to enrich the biomass except for the loss of testing sludge discharge started from day 29 and 45 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the sludge retention time srt was controlled at 20 days by discharging 500 ml of the mixture daily as shown in fig 1 the end of partial nitrification can be judged based on the do and ph curves displayed in real time to avoid the conversion of no2 to no3 in the aerobic phase similarly the end of denitrification can be judged based on the ph and orp curves 2 3 wastewater and seeding sludge synthetic wastewater was used in the experiment the nh4 n concentrations of influent for sbr1 and sbr2 were 47 4 4 2 and 49 8 5 6 mg n l 1 respectively the nh4 n was prepared with nh4 2so4 while nahco3 was added for inorganic carbon source and maintained the molar ratio of hco3 nh4 for 2 kh2po4 and trace element solution 2 ml l 1 required for biological growth were added trace element solution g l 1 is composed of the following components 1 56 fecl3 6h2o

of 4 for denitrification the seed sludge was taken from the aerobic tank of a pilot scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor in the water treatment laboratory of henan university of technology the sludge had been successfully domesticated for partial nitrification at 30 1 c it was used in this study after 3 months of storage 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples were collected at the end of the feeding aerobic and anoxic phases to study the operating characteristics of the reactors these liquid samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before measuring nh4 n no2 n and no3 n according to standard methods 24 a 50 ml sample of sludge was taken every three days and sludge volume index svi mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured to study the sludge characteristics in the reactors do ph and orp were measured in real time using sensors mettler toledo switzerland 2 5 calculations nitrite accumulation rate nar was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 nar c produced no 2 n c produced no 3 n where c produced no 2 n and c produced no 3 n represent the concentrations mg n l 1 of no2 n and no3 n produced in the aerobic section respectively specific ammonia oxidation rate saor and specific denitrification rate sdnr were calculated as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 saor mgn gvss 1 h 1 d c nh 4 n x d t 3 sdnr mgn gvss 1 h 1 d c no x n x d t where dc nh 4 n represents the reduction of nh 4 n concentration in the aerobic section mg n l 1 and dc no x n represents the reduction of the sum of no 2 n and no 3 n concentrations in the denitrification section mg n l 1 x represents mlvss g l 1 and dt represents the duration of the reaction hours the simplified arrhenius equation was used to analyze the effect of temperature on the rate of pnd reaction 4 r t r 293 θ t 293 where r t is the reaction rate at temperature t in k and θ is the temperature coefficient the natural logarithmic form of the arrhenius equation for determining the activation energy of the ammonia oxidation reaction 5 ln r t e a r t ln a where e a is the activation energy j mol 1 the a is the frequency factor in the same units as r t and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 2 6 microbial diversity analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sbrs during the idle period washed three times with deionized water and centrifuged at 8000 r min for 5 min the obtained sludge samples were used for high throughput 16s rrna sequencing analysis the samples were subjected to total genomic dna extraction and the extracted genomic dna was detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the pcr amplification was performed in triplicate for each sludge sample in the v3 v4 region using forward primer 338f actcctrcgggaggcagcag and reverse primer 806r ggactaccagggtatctaat the dna sequencing was performed on the illumina hi seq 2500 platform illumina usa at majorbio co ltd shanghai china pcr products were recovered by cutting the gel using axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa the products were eluted with tris hcl buffer and detected by 2 agarose electrophoresis the rdp classifier bayesian algorithm was used to perform otu clustering at a 97 similarity level 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of pnd sbrs 3 1 1 start up of pnd sbrs in the first cycle the ammonia nitrogen in the influent of sbr1 and sbr2 were 48 4 and 56 1 mg n l 1 while they were operated at 28 2 and 17 0 c respectively the cycle length of the two sbrs for completely remove the nitrogen were 24 5 and 98 4 h respectively it indicates that the nitrogen removal capacity of the reactors was at a low level due to the long term storage of the sludge nitrate accumulation was suppressed by identifying the characteristic points of do orp and ph at the end of the ammonia oxidation phase and shutting down the aeration in time 4 after more cycles the pnd process was enhanced and the reaction rate was accelerated it took 4 and 16 days to reduce the reaction time of both reactors to 10 h respectively this difference indicates that the low temperature shock caused a significant inhibition of the activated sludge in sbr2 the nar of sbr1 was 84 4 in day 1 while only 27 0 in sbr2 fig 2 similarly the saor and sdnr of sbr2 were significantly lower than those of sbr1 sbr1 showed a strong adaptation in phase i with a rapid increase in saor from 2 1 to 15 3 and sdnr from 8 0 to 133 7 mg n gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a comparatively the saor and sdnr of sbr2 were consistently low peaking at only 6 4 and 8 8 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively during the start up phase fig 3b the nar of sbr2 stabilized after increasing to 44 3 on day 16 fig 2b which is considered as the completion of the start up phase the above results suggest that temperature is responsible for the difference in the start up performance of the two reactors the activity of pnd related microorganisms was inhibited at lower temperatures which was directly manifested by the weakened rate of nitrogen conversion the decrease in nitrite accumulation indicates that the lower temperature is not favorable for nob inhibition 3 1 2 effects of temperature variations on pnd for sbr1 the three temperature reductions from phase i to phase iv had minimal impact on the nitrogen concentration in effluent and the effluent nox n was always below 1 0 mg n l 1 in phase iv the effluent ammonia nitrogen increased slightly to 3 5 1 0 mg n l 1 table 1 at low temperatures the oxygen consumption rate of the aob became slower so the do level during nitritation was higher the continued oxygen limitation strategy of 0 5 mg l 1 resulted in the aeration being terminated before the complete transformation of ammonia nitrogen the reduction in nar and saor shown in table 1 demonstrates the inhibitory effect of low temperature on aob therefore the value of the do limiting strategy used at low temperatures should be higher than that at high temperatures an exponential decrease in the maximum saor was found during the cooling from 28 2 to 17 0 c as shown in fig 4a the saor at 17 0 c was reduced by 37 compared to that at 28 2 c θ for the arrhenius equation was determined to be 1 040 close to the conclusion of bao et al 25 1 023 at 20 30 c it is slightly lower than the previously reported values 1 116 at 10 20 c 26 and 1 12 at 10 25 c suggested in asm2 27 the lower θ in this study suggests that the ammonia oxidation reaction is insensitive to temperature changes at 17 0 28 2 c a linear fit was performed using the natural logarithm of saor as the y axis and 1000 rt as the x axis fig 4b the activation energy of the ammonia oxidation reaction was determined from the slope to be 28 3 kj mol 1 at 17 0 28 2 c which is lower than those proposed in other studies 42 0 kj mol 1 at 20 35 c 19 and 34 2 kj mol 1 at 10 30 c 28 this indicates that the ammonia oxidation reaction of the pnd sludge in this study was easier to carry out notably the largest decrease in the average saor was observed from phase ii to iii much greater than from i to ii and iii to iv this confirms the conclusion of guo et al 19 who found that the activation energy was higher at 5 20 c than at 20 35 c in order to study the effect of temperature on denitrification 0 5 l of mixture was taken from sbr1 at the end of the experiment for batch testing in a water bath the denitrification performance with nitrite as electron acceptor was tested within 9 28 c 9 13 17 21 25 and 28 c fig 5a no2 n was prepared using sodium nitrite at approximately 40 mg n l 1 and the cod n ratio was 4 no2 n removal was achieved within 20 min at 17 28 c at 13 and 9 c the decreases in denitrification rates were significant and it took about 28 and 45 min to complete denitrification respectively the effect of temperature on the denitrification rate of nitrite is also consistent with the arrhenius equation it is found that two curves fig 5b can be fitted at 9 17 c and 17 28 c and both obtain satisfactory goodness of fit the temperature coefficient θ is determined to be 1 010 at 17 28 c and as high as 1 103 at 9 17 c it indicates that the temperature of 17 28 c has less effect on nitrite denitrification while nitrite denitrification below 17 c is very sensitive to temperature changes for sbr2 slight increase in nar was observed in phase i but the highest did not exceed 55 in the first two phases the long term feeding of sbr2 enhanced its autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacterial activity the saor of sbr2 increased steadily during the first 30 days reaching a peak of 18 6 mg n gvss 1 h 1 at day 30 this is a satisfactory rate for low temperature ammonia oxidation 29 which exceeded even the highest saor in sbr1 15 8 at day 16 sbr1 was shocked by cooling in the short term while sbr2 was exposed to low temperatures for the long term this is the reason why the rate of sbr1 was worse than that of sbr2 meanwhile the sdnr also reached 54 0 mg n gvss 1 h 1 high activity pnd was successfully achieved at a long term low temperature of 17 0 1 1 c however sbr2 apparently took longer than sbr1 to reach a high level activity taking about twice as many days this proves that low temperature has a strong impairment on the start up of pnd in the long term the trends of saor and sdnr in fig 3 show a clear positive correlation it indicates that the changes in environmental factors are essentially synchronous in promoting or inhibiting ammonia oxidation and denitrification processes and also indicates the consistency in temperature adaptation of microorganisms involved in the pnd process 3 1 3 impact of increased daily treatment load the idle time of sbr2 was shortened in phase ii to increase the nitrogen loading rate nlr table 1 with the number of cycles run per day increasing from 2 to 5 the average nlr value increased from 1 0 to 2 5 g n l 1 d 1 which is still within the tolerable range of the sludge system nar increased rapidly 46 2 72 6 during 35 40 d and was maintained above 70 thereafter fig 2b this phenomenon is consistent with the findings in a previous study 30 high throughput sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of aob nitrosomonas in sbr2 increased from 0 09 at day 35 to 1 34 at day 51 while nob nitrobacter decreased from 0 09 to 0 02 this indicates that the enhanced substrate feeding accelerated the aob reproduction without promoting nob although some sludge was discharged in the last 6 days of the operation however the srt set was relatively long and its contribution to nob inhibition was small and negligible thus the increased nlr promoted nitrite accumulation which facilitated partial nitrification however saor and sdnr showed an abrupt decrease on day 39 fig 3b by 59 and 32 respectively compared to the previous day it is possible that the high loading led to the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and inert matters which hindered the transfer rate of do and substrate 31 meanwhile mlvss increased from 0 9 day 36 to 1 7 g l 1 day 39 fig 6b this suggests that the higher nitrogen load accelerated the biomass enrichment finally sbr2 achieved a stable pnd but it still differed from sbr1 in nar at the same 17 0 c with maximum 92 3 and 83 0 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively they were similar in terms of ammonia nitrogen removal with the same average removal rate of 92 0 however at the same nlr of 1 0 g n l 1 d 1 and the same low temperatures the saor of sbr1 phase iv was lower than that of sbr2 phase i which was operated at low temperature for a long time as shown in table 1 with average saor of 8 7 and 11 6 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively this indicates that sbr2 had adapted to the cold while sbr1 suffered a short term shock from a temperature drop and required some time to recover 3 2 characteristics of sludge 3 2 1 activated sludge enrichment at low temperature the initial concentration of sludge was at a low level in the first 29 d the mlss and mlvss of sbr1 increased from 2 0 and 1 0 to 5 3 and 2 5 g l 1 respectively fig 6a to control the sludge concentration at this level the srt was set as 20 d the sludge concentration was stable for a period thereafter but a decreasing trend was observed from day 38 it indicates that the temperature of about 17 0 c in phase iv suppressed microbial proliferation and required a longer srt to balance it the specific growth rate of pnd bacteria was significantly affected by temperature and the relationship between maximum specific growth rate and temperature was in accordance with the arrhenius equation 32 predation by aquatic micro animals loss of testing and bacterial lysis resulted in mlvss in sbr2 below 1 1 g l 1 on days 1 to 35 fig 6b despite the absence of sludge discharge this result is completely different from that of sbr1 at high temperature which fully illustrates that low temperature severely inhibits the microbial reproduction capacity the sludge concentration of sbr2 increased rapidly from 2 8 to a maximum of 4 8 g l 1 after the daily treatment load was improved in phase ii the sludge discharge section was activated from day 45 and successfully controlled the mlvss at a level close to that of sbr1 4 7 g l 1 the f value mlvss mlss ratio reflects the amount of biomass in the activated sludge low f value represents an excess of inorganic particles in the sludge which may cause problems for the stable operation of wwtps as shown in fig 6 the f value of sbr1 showed a slight decrease in phase i from 0 51 to 0 41 on the other hand a continuous decrease from 0 55 to 0 39 in the f value of sbr2 was also observed in its phase i the decrease in their f values all correspond to their respective periods of rapidly increasing reaction rates this may be related to the increase of inorganic substances produced by microbial metabolism the f value for the two sbrs in the latter period was stable at 0 4 0 5 which is a low value 33 it has been demonstrated that too little sludge discharge leads to a lower mlvss mlss ratio 34 long term undischarged sludge was the main reason for the low f values in both systems however no results showed that the mlvss mlss ratio was related to the decrease in temperature 3 2 2 comparison of settling performance svi reflects the compressibility and settleability of the sludge during the settling period the average svi of sbr1 was 60 4 ml g 1 which was at a satisfactory level as shown in fig 6a the settling performance was stable for a long time indicating that small gradients of temperature drop had no impact on the sludge settling performance in contrast the settling performance of sbr2 was significantly inferior to that of sbr1 with an svi as high as 132 5 ml g 1 on day 3 and up to 232 8 ml g 1 on day 24 fig 6a suggesting that the intense shock of low temperature led to the sludge bulking after that svi started to decrease which was attributed to the gradual adaptation of microorganisms to low temperatures at phase ii svi was further reduced and restored to a normal level of 74 4 ml g 1 at 48 d sludge bulking often occurs in wastewater treatment systems when environmental conditions are unfavorable for microorganisms it is common in winter or cold regions the stepwise cooling process of sbr1 is a much smoother process compared to the exposure to low temperature initiation of sbr2 in other words the impact of low temperature on sbr1 is milder than that of sbr2 as shown in fig 6b svi in sbr2 showed a decreasing trend from day 24 onwards which corresponds to the period of rapid growth of pnd activity shown in fig 3b in the system sludge bulking was caused by filamentous bacteria which competed with pnd functional bacteria for the limited do and nutrients at the beginning of sbr2 operation pnd functional bacteria were less competitive to the substrate providing favorable conditions for filamentous bacteria to proliferate however the filamentous bacteria were weakened as the pnd activity increased which contributed to the recovery of sludge bulking the decline of svi in sbr2 stopped after raising nlr in phase ii however after the sludge discharge on day 45 another decline occurred this result is in line with the previous knowledge that the increase in ammonia nitrogen load may deteriorate the sludge settling performance 35 and sludge discharge alleviated the problem of sludge bulking to some extent because of the expulsion of filamentous bacterial flocs 36 3 3 microbial properties in low temperature pnd process 3 3 1 microbial community succession high throughput sequencing was used to reveal the evolution of the bacterial community in both systems sludge samples were collected at the start seed sludge on days 21 33 and 51 of sbr1 and on days 21 35 and 51 of sbr2 optimized sequences 57 472 66 188 were obtained in 7 sludge samples for a total of 435 871 the number of otus obtained was 251 377 the population richness and species diversity of the sbr1 system showed little fluctuation during the 51 days in contrast the population richness of the sbr2 system shrank at day 35 and the results at day 51 showed a rebound as indicated by the ace and chao indices table 2 this is due to the enhanced nutrient supply from the increased daily treatment which induced the system to evolve more species the community diversity of sbr2 reduced significantly in the later period as shown by the decrease of shannon index and the increase of simpson index table 2 it suggests that with the stable operation of the system the inferior species were eliminated and the microbial functions were gradually homogenized however in contradiction to this previous researchers have found enhanced species diversity at low temperatures 13 the two patterns of temperature shifts resulted in different microbial community compositions as shown in fig 7a species overlap at the otu level is represented as a venn diagram in the three samples of seed sludge sbr1 day 51 and sbr2 day 51 the species shared by the three accounted for 42 2 of the total number of species 54 species were detected to be eliminated by both systems in these 51 days accounting for 11 6 compared to sbr1 sbr2 had 10 5 less species overlap share with seed sludge meanwhile sbr1 and sbr2 developed 6 7 and 13 3 of unique species with respectively this indicates that compared to the mild staged cooling operation the evolution of the community structure resulting from gradual adaptation after a low temperature shock is more dramatic 3 3 2 functional bacteria during pnd the microbial community composition in sbrs was examined at the phylum level as shown in fig 7b the dominant phyla were proteobacteria 15 12 49 29 bacteroidota 9 53 61 01 latescibacterota 7 2 26 63 firmicutes 0 63 20 66 and chloroflexi 0 45 6 56 the phylum proteobacteria contains most of the genera associated with nitrogen removal and plays an important role in wastewater treatment systems 1 at day 20 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in sbr1 was 26 82 as the temperature decreased they were gradually enriched to 48 23 in sbr1 day 51 indicating an effective enrichment of nitrogen removal related microorganisms under stepwise cooling conditions bacteroidota continued to grow in sbr1 increasing from the initial 11 73 to 35 74 on day 51 in phase i of sbr2 they proliferated from 9 53 to 61 01 replacing proteobacteria as the dominant phylum bacteroidota have outstanding capabilities in nutrient metabolism and degradation of complex compounds and they may contribute to denitrification under low temperature conditions in addition chloroflexi as heterotrophic bacteria which can decompose organic carbon released by the death lysis of other microorganisms 37 also create conditions for heterotrophic denitrification the top 40 bacteria in number at the genus level were plotted as a heat map by absolute abundance on a logarithmic scale of 10 as shown in fig 7c the genera dominating the autotrophic nitrogen conversion process in the reactors were nitrosomonas aob and nitrobacter nob with relative abundances of 0 04 and 1 33 in the seed sludge respectively nitrobacter was reduced to 0 03 after 20 days of operation for sbr1 correspondingly sbr2 was 0 42 on day 21 the two sbrs were at different temperatures at this time 24 5 and 17 0 c which proved that nob was inhibited by the high ph and low do environment in the systems moreover this inhibition was affected by temperature and nob was more strongly inhibited at high temperatures compared to low temperatures as reflected by the nar values of both after long term runs the relative abundance of nitrobacter in both reactors was below 0 05 at day 51 the abundance of nitrosomonas continued to increase reaching 0 60 and 1 34 respectively the higher abundance of aob in sbr2 was due to the fact that it ran more cycles denitrifying bacteria detected in the reactors included thauera 0 19 4 49 paracoccus 0 15 1 64 unclassified f comamonadaceae 0 04 0 16 bacillus 0 01 0 27 which are commonly found in in wastewater treatment systems 38 40 they can reduce nitrite and nitrate under anoxic conditions using the organic carbon source in water as the electron donor the enrichment of flavobacterium 0 11 59 61 was detected at low temperatures and this bacterium has been shown to be a cryophilic bacterium 41 and increases in flavobacterium at low temperatures have been found in other similar researches 14 42 studies have shown that the genus flavobacterium has anaerobic denitrification capacity 43 its relative abundance was detected in r2 35d sludge samples up to an impressive 59 61 and the high rate of denitrification in the reactor may be related to this similar to the results of the present study horn et al 43 had detected flavobacterium in relative abundance up to 56 0 at 15 c in addition significant amounts of lentimicrobium belonging to bacteroidota 0 32 19 65 which is a genus capable of hydrolytic polymerization of organic matter were detected in both reactors 44 they can degrade complex organic carbon and facilitate heterotrophic bacteria consumption which is essential for denitrification similarly wang et al 45 found the dominance of lentimicrobium in high efficiency denitrification sbr in contrast to sbr2 a large number of enriched dgaos denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms were found in sbr1 such as candidatus competibacter 0 18 21 06 and defluviicoccus 0 24 10 17 fig 7c ca competibacter use internal poly hydroxyalkanoates phas to reduce no2 n and no3 n under anoxic conditions for endogenous denitrification 46 this explains the efficient denitrification with limited organic carbon in sbr1 a previous study showed that gaos are more capable of reproducing at high temperatures 47 so they did not proliferate in sbr2 3 3 3 biological factors of sludge bulking activated sludge bulking is influenced by various factors low do concentration low temperature low substrate concentration and low organic loading may induce sludge bulking the operating conditions of both sbrs were the same except for temperature so the sludge bulking in sbr2 was caused by low temperature chloroflexi plays an important role in the formation of zoogloea 48 and its relative abundance in sbr2 is generally lower than that in sbr1 which may also partially account for the difference in svi between the two sbrs activated sludge bulking includes filamentous and non filamentous bulking the type of sludge bulking is difficult to determine sometimes both occur simultaneously none of the common filamentous bacteria such as microthrix parvicela nostocoida limicola haliscomenobacter hydrossis were detected in all sludge samples 49 however the genus flavobacterium which is abundant in the reactors is also a filamentous bacterium that may cause sludge bulking 50 and it is cold adapted contributing to its own rapid proliferation at low temperatures therefore severe filamentous bulking occurred in sbr2 although flavobacterium enrichment was also detected in sbr1 on day 51 16 37 the relative abundance was much less than that in sbr2 56 65 which explains why sludge bulking was not observed in sbr1 the proper amount of filamentous bacteria combine to form the skeleton of the sludge floc but when they grow in excess they can jeopardize the sludge settling performance once sludge bulking occurs overgrowth of filamentous bacteria may lead to a decrease in non filamentous bacteria causing non filamentous bacteria to be easily lost from the system 51 the non filamentous bulking is mainly related to the composition of eps non filamentous bulking can be triggered if the carbohydrate content in eps is high 52 further studies are needed to confirm the non filamentous bulking in the reactors in this study 4 conclusions the effects of stepwise cooling 28 2 24 5 20 6 17 0 c and sustained low temperature 17 0 c were evaluated for pnd at high temperatures pnd startup took 4 days and was more likely to achieve efficient nitrite accumulation nar 80 whereas sustained low temperature pnd required a longer acclimation period 16 days higher do limits should be set at low temperatures when using a do limited real time control strategy otherwise ammonia removal will be incomplete raising nlr facilitates enhanced aob dominance and enrichment biomass at low temperatures the results of the arrhenius equation fit indicate that nitritation and nitrite denitrification activities are not significantly affected by temperature between 17 and 28 c but pnd activity was susceptible to short term shocks from cooling during stepwise cooling denitrification could be completed within 20 min at 17 c but its activity was strongly inhibited by lower temperatures the proliferation of bacteroidota phylum at low temperature may contribute to efficient denitrification dgaos were enriched heavily only under stepwise cooling condition and it contributed to denitrification to save organic carbon severe sludge bulking appeared under continuous low temperature condition rather than stepwise cooling condition and it alleviated with rising pnd activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

of technology zhengzhou 450001 china school of environmental engineering henan university of technology zhengzhou 450001 china the effects of different temperature conditions on nitritation denitrification are still unclear in this study two sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to explore the effects of stepwise cooling 28 2 24 5 20 6 17 0 c and continuous low temperature 17 0 c on partial nitrification denitrification pnd the pnd performance sludge characteristics and microbial communities were evaluated the results showed that pnd completed start up faster and achieved 80 nitrite accumulation under stepwise cooling conditions while a longer acclimation period was required under continuous low temperature conditions higher dissolved oxygen limits should be used for real time control at low temperatures to achieve complete ammonia removal fitting using arrhenius equation it was found that pnd was not significantly affected by temperature at 17 28 c however the denitrification activity was significantly inhibited by temperatures below 17 c bacteroidota phylum proliferated at low temperatures while dgaos proliferated only under stepwise cooling conditions and they may contribute to efficient denitrification sludge bulking under sustained low temperature conditions eased with increasing pnd activity suggesting that sludge settling performance needs attention when activity is low graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial nitrification denitrification low temperature sludge bulking microorganisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen pollutants in municipal wastewater are mainly present in the form of ammonia biological treatment has become a common technology for the removal of ammonia conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps generally use complete nitrification denitrification as the mainstream process for ammonia removal 1 however this process has the disadvantages of long reaction time high energy consumption and insufficient carbon source in the anoxic section 2 the partial nitrification denitrification pnd process accumulates only nitrite during aerobic phase and the nitrite is subsequently reduced to n2 it saves 25 of aeration and 40 of organic carbon compared to conventional biological nitrogen removal processes and reduces reaction time and sludge production and has attracted much attention in recent years 3 since nitrogen conversion in the pnd process is highly correlated with dissolved oxygen do concentration ph and oxidation reduction potential orp the development of real time control relying on programmable logic controllers plc has facilitated its research and application 4 5 moreover pnd can be combined with the emerging process anammox which is a highly promising autotrophic process 6 in conclusion the development of pnd as one of the new biological nitrogen removal processes has important implications for the future reformation of wwtps however the application of pnd in wwtps faces numerous challenges the key to long term stable operation of partial nitrification is the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob higher ph 7 5 9 0 insufficient do below 1 0 mg l 1 and free ammonia fa 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 all have inhibitory effects on nob 1 7 in addition wang et al 8 demonstrated the feasibility of using hydroxylamine as an inhibitor of nob ambient temperatures below the comfortable temperature of aob is one of the most difficult bottlenecks to overcome the temperatures below 25 c are generally considered low for partial nitrification processes 9 10 the recommended temperature for aob is 25 c or higher while the water temperature in colder regions is generally below 20 c 11 in addition the maximum growth rate of aob is not as good as the maximum growth rate of nob when it is below 25 c 12 it has been proven that nob activity may be restored at 15 c which is detrimental to partial nitrification 13 low temperatures have an overall inhibitory effect on the reaction rate and microbial growth of pnd and they may also trigger sludge bulking especially when climate change brings a sharp drop in temperature 14 the characteristics of temperature change vary globally with some regions often experiencing sharp seasonal cooling while other regions experience more moderate cold shocks 15 therefore the study of the operational characteristics of pnd during different temperature reduction is necessary the understanding of the specific effects of temperature on pnd is not consistent recent studies found that granulation of sludge at 10 15 c helped to inhibit nob 16 whereas prolonged non discharge at 10 c promoted nob growth 17 it is widely believed that the ability of nitrifying bacteria to reproduce is inhibited by temperature reduction 18 in contrast luo et al 14 found that the abundance of aob and nob increased with cooling in wwtps in cold regions some studies found that low temperatures do not reduce nitrite accumulation 19 20 in addition cold usually leads to sludge bulking which does not impair the effluent quality but is detrimental to the operation of wastewater treatment systems 21 zeng et al 22 operated pnd in an anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor and found that low do 0 3 0 5 mg l 1 did not trigger sludge bulking at 22 c some filamentous bacteria such as microthrix trichococcus and thiothrix which are prone to sludge bulking are widely present in wastewater treatment systems 23 a study has been conducted to reveal the effect of low temperature 5 20 c on partial nitrification in the long and short term 19 however very limited studies have been conducted on the combined effects of different low temperature conditions on the characteristics of sludge and microorganisms in this study the pnd was run with stepwise cooling and continuous low temperature respectively aiming to assess the stability of pnd reaction rate and nitrogen removal during the two low temperature processes reveal changes in sludge growth characteristics and settling performance and discuss changes in microbial communities to reveal functional bacteria and biological triggers of sludge bulking during low temperature pnd 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup this study used two identical sequential batch reactors sbrs each with a working volume of 10 l each reactor was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and air pump for aeration and a rotameter was used for airflow control to maintain the do levels in the system temperature controlled devices were wrapped around the outer wall of the reactor to control the temperature of the system do orp and ph probes in reactors were connected to a plc for real time monitoring via a computer switches on the plc controller control the nitrogen feeding agitation aeration chemical oxygen demand cod feeding and discharge of the reactor inlet outlet and carbon source replenishment are achieved by peristaltic pumps longer china 2 2 operation strategy the sbrs in this study were operated indoors in winter with an average room temperature of 16 4 c the two reactors adopted aerobic anoxic operation modes for partial nitrification and denitrification each cycle includes pre aeration 20 min influent 10 min aeration cod feeding 5 min anoxic settling 40 min and decant 10 min the lengths of aeration and anoxic phase were controlled by the real time control system the purpose of pre aeration is to remove residual cod from the previous cycle in order to promote nitrite accumulation aeration was terminated once do exceeded 0 5 mg l 1 throughout the experiment both sbrs were applied with the same do control strategy the volume exchange ratio was set at 0 3 the specific operation strategies of the two sbrs are shown in table 1 the ph of the whole pnd process was maintained between 7 8 and 9 0 sbr1 was operated in four phases phase i ii iii and iv at four temperatures 28 2 1 0 24 5 1 3 20 6 1 3 c and ambient temperature 17 0 1 1 c while sbr2 was consistently operated at ambient temperature through three phases start up phase phase i and phase ii initially no sludge was discharged in order to enrich the biomass except for the loss of testing sludge discharge started from day 29 and 45 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the sludge retention time srt was controlled at 20 days by discharging 500 ml of the mixture daily as shown in fig 1 the end of partial nitrification can be judged based on the do and ph curves displayed in real time to avoid the conversion of no2 to no3 in the aerobic phase similarly the end of denitrification can be judged based on the ph and orp curves 2 3 wastewater and seeding sludge synthetic wastewater was used in the experiment the nh4 n concentrations of influent for sbr1 and sbr2 were 47 4 4 2 and 49 8 5 6 mg n l 1 respectively the nh4 n was prepared with nh4 2so4 while nahco3 was added for inorganic carbon source and maintained the molar ratio of hco3 nh4 for 2 kh2po4 and trace element solution 2 ml l 1 required for biological growth were added trace element solution g l 1 is composed of the following components 1 56 fecl3 6h2o

of 4 for denitrification the seed sludge was taken from the aerobic tank of a pilot scale anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor in the water treatment laboratory of henan university of technology the sludge had been successfully domesticated for partial nitrification at 30 1 c it was used in this study after 3 months of storage 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples were collected at the end of the feeding aerobic and anoxic phases to study the operating characteristics of the reactors these liquid samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before measuring nh4 n no2 n and no3 n according to standard methods 24 a 50 ml sample of sludge was taken every three days and sludge volume index svi mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured to study the sludge characteristics in the reactors do ph and orp were measured in real time using sensors mettler toledo switzerland 2 5 calculations nitrite accumulation rate nar was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 nar c produced no 2 n c produced no 3 n where c produced no 2 n and c produced no 3 n represent the concentrations mg n l 1 of no2 n and no3 n produced in the aerobic section respectively specific ammonia oxidation rate saor and specific denitrification rate sdnr were calculated as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 saor mgn gvss 1 h 1 d c nh 4 n x d t 3 sdnr mgn gvss 1 h 1 d c no x n x d t where dc nh 4 n represents the reduction of nh 4 n concentration in the aerobic section mg n l 1 and dc no x n represents the reduction of the sum of no 2 n and no 3 n concentrations in the denitrification section mg n l 1 x represents mlvss g l 1 and dt represents the duration of the reaction hours the simplified arrhenius equation was used to analyze the effect of temperature on the rate of pnd reaction 4 r t r 293 θ t 293 where r t is the reaction rate at temperature t in k and θ is the temperature coefficient the natural logarithmic form of the arrhenius equation for determining the activation energy of the ammonia oxidation reaction 5 ln r t e a r t ln a where e a is the activation energy j mol 1 the a is the frequency factor in the same units as r t and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 2 6 microbial diversity analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sbrs during the idle period washed three times with deionized water and centrifuged at 8000 r min for 5 min the obtained sludge samples were used for high throughput 16s rrna sequencing analysis the samples were subjected to total genomic dna extraction and the extracted genomic dna was detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the pcr amplification was performed in triplicate for each sludge sample in the v3 v4 region using forward primer 338f actcctrcgggaggcagcag and reverse primer 806r ggactaccagggtatctaat the dna sequencing was performed on the illumina hi seq 2500 platform illumina usa at majorbio co ltd shanghai china pcr products were recovered by cutting the gel using axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa the products were eluted with tris hcl buffer and detected by 2 agarose electrophoresis the rdp classifier bayesian algorithm was used to perform otu clustering at a 97 similarity level 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of pnd sbrs 3 1 1 start up of pnd sbrs in the first cycle the ammonia nitrogen in the influent of sbr1 and sbr2 were 48 4 and 56 1 mg n l 1 while they were operated at 28 2 and 17 0 c respectively the cycle length of the two sbrs for completely remove the nitrogen were 24 5 and 98 4 h respectively it indicates that the nitrogen removal capacity of the reactors was at a low level due to the long term storage of the sludge nitrate accumulation was suppressed by identifying the characteristic points of do orp and ph at the end of the ammonia oxidation phase and shutting down the aeration in time 4 after more cycles the pnd process was enhanced and the reaction rate was accelerated it took 4 and 16 days to reduce the reaction time of both reactors to 10 h respectively this difference indicates that the low temperature shock caused a significant inhibition of the activated sludge in sbr2 the nar of sbr1 was 84 4 in day 1 while only 27 0 in sbr2 fig 2 similarly the saor and sdnr of sbr2 were significantly lower than those of sbr1 sbr1 showed a strong adaptation in phase i with a rapid increase in saor from 2 1 to 15 3 and sdnr from 8 0 to 133 7 mg n gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a comparatively the saor and sdnr of sbr2 were consistently low peaking at only 6 4 and 8 8 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively during the start up phase fig 3b the nar of sbr2 stabilized after increasing to 44 3 on day 16 fig 2b which is considered as the completion of the start up phase the above results suggest that temperature is responsible for the difference in the start up performance of the two reactors the activity of pnd related microorganisms was inhibited at lower temperatures which was directly manifested by the weakened rate of nitrogen conversion the decrease in nitrite accumulation indicates that the lower temperature is not favorable for nob inhibition 3 1 2 effects of temperature variations on pnd for sbr1 the three temperature reductions from phase i to phase iv had minimal impact on the nitrogen concentration in effluent and the effluent nox n was always below 1 0 mg n l 1 in phase iv the effluent ammonia nitrogen increased slightly to 3 5 1 0 mg n l 1 table 1 at low temperatures the oxygen consumption rate of the aob became slower so the do level during nitritation was higher the continued oxygen limitation strategy of 0 5 mg l 1 resulted in the aeration being terminated before the complete transformation of ammonia nitrogen the reduction in nar and saor shown in table 1 demonstrates the inhibitory effect of low temperature on aob therefore the value of the do limiting strategy used at low temperatures should be higher than that at high temperatures an exponential decrease in the maximum saor was found during the cooling from 28 2 to 17 0 c as shown in fig 4a the saor at 17 0 c was reduced by 37 compared to that at 28 2 c θ for the arrhenius equation was determined to be 1 040 close to the conclusion of bao et al 25 1 023 at 20 30 c it is slightly lower than the previously reported values 1 116 at 10 20 c 26 and 1 12 at 10 25 c suggested in asm2 27 the lower θ in this study suggests that the ammonia oxidation reaction is insensitive to temperature changes at 17 0 28 2 c a linear fit was performed using the natural logarithm of saor as the y axis and 1000 rt as the x axis fig 4b the activation energy of the ammonia oxidation reaction was determined from the slope to be 28 3 kj mol 1 at 17 0 28 2 c which is lower than those proposed in other studies 42 0 kj mol 1 at 20 35 c 19 and 34 2 kj mol 1 at 10 30 c 28 this indicates that the ammonia oxidation reaction of the pnd sludge in this study was easier to carry out notably the largest decrease in the average saor was observed from phase ii to iii much greater than from i to ii and iii to iv this confirms the conclusion of guo et al 19 who found that the activation energy was higher at 5 20 c than at 20 35 c in order to study the effect of temperature on denitrification 0 5 l of mixture was taken from sbr1 at the end of the experiment for batch testing in a water bath the denitrification performance with nitrite as electron acceptor was tested within 9 28 c 9 13 17 21 25 and 28 c fig 5a no2 n was prepared using sodium nitrite at approximately 40 mg n l 1 and the cod n ratio was 4 no2 n removal was achieved within 20 min at 17 28 c at 13 and 9 c the decreases in denitrification rates were significant and it took about 28 and 45 min to complete denitrification respectively the effect of temperature on the denitrification rate of nitrite is also consistent with the arrhenius equation it is found that two curves fig 5b can be fitted at 9 17 c and 17 28 c and both obtain satisfactory goodness of fit the temperature coefficient θ is determined to be 1 010 at 17 28 c and as high as 1 103 at 9 17 c it indicates that the temperature of 17 28 c has less effect on nitrite denitrification while nitrite denitrification below 17 c is very sensitive to temperature changes for sbr2 slight increase in nar was observed in phase i but the highest did not exceed 55 in the first two phases the long term feeding of sbr2 enhanced its autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacterial activity the saor of sbr2 increased steadily during the first 30 days reaching a peak of 18 6 mg n gvss 1 h 1 at day 30 this is a satisfactory rate for low temperature ammonia oxidation 29 which exceeded even the highest saor in sbr1 15 8 at day 16 sbr1 was shocked by cooling in the short term while sbr2 was exposed to low temperatures for the long term this is the reason why the rate of sbr1 was worse than that of sbr2 meanwhile the sdnr also reached 54 0 mg n gvss 1 h 1 high activity pnd was successfully achieved at a long term low temperature of 17 0 1 1 c however sbr2 apparently took longer than sbr1 to reach a high level activity taking about twice as many days this proves that low temperature has a strong impairment on the start up of pnd in the long term the trends of saor and sdnr in fig 3 show a clear positive correlation it indicates that the changes in environmental factors are essentially synchronous in promoting or inhibiting ammonia oxidation and denitrification processes and also indicates the consistency in temperature adaptation of microorganisms involved in the pnd process 3 1 3 impact of increased daily treatment load the idle time of sbr2 was shortened in phase ii to increase the nitrogen loading rate nlr table 1 with the number of cycles run per day increasing from 2 to 5 the average nlr value increased from 1 0 to 2 5 g n l 1 d 1 which is still within the tolerable range of the sludge system nar increased rapidly 46 2 72 6 during 35 40 d and was maintained above 70 thereafter fig 2b this phenomenon is consistent with the findings in a previous study 30 high throughput sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of aob nitrosomonas in sbr2 increased from 0 09 at day 35 to 1 34 at day 51 while nob nitrobacter decreased from 0 09 to 0 02 this indicates that the enhanced substrate feeding accelerated the aob reproduction without promoting nob although some sludge was discharged in the last 6 days of the operation however the srt set was relatively long and its contribution to nob inhibition was small and negligible thus the increased nlr promoted nitrite accumulation which facilitated partial nitrification however saor and sdnr showed an abrupt decrease on day 39 fig 3b by 59 and 32 respectively compared to the previous day it is possible that the high loading led to the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances eps and inert matters which hindered the transfer rate of do and substrate 31 meanwhile mlvss increased from 0 9 day 36 to 1 7 g l 1 day 39 fig 6b this suggests that the higher nitrogen load accelerated the biomass enrichment finally sbr2 achieved a stable pnd but it still differed from sbr1 in nar at the same 17 0 c with maximum 92 3 and 83 0 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively they were similar in terms of ammonia nitrogen removal with the same average removal rate of 92 0 however at the same nlr of 1 0 g n l 1 d 1 and the same low temperatures the saor of sbr1 phase iv was lower than that of sbr2 phase i which was operated at low temperature for a long time as shown in table 1 with average saor of 8 7 and 11 6 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively this indicates that sbr2 had adapted to the cold while sbr1 suffered a short term shock from a temperature drop and required some time to recover 3 2 characteristics of sludge 3 2 1 activated sludge enrichment at low temperature the initial concentration of sludge was at a low level in the first 29 d the mlss and mlvss of sbr1 increased from 2 0 and 1 0 to 5 3 and 2 5 g l 1 respectively fig 6a to control the sludge concentration at this level the srt was set as 20 d the sludge concentration was stable for a period thereafter but a decreasing trend was observed from day 38 it indicates that the temperature of about 17 0 c in phase iv suppressed microbial proliferation and required a longer srt to balance it the specific growth rate of pnd bacteria was significantly affected by temperature and the relationship between maximum specific growth rate and temperature was in accordance with the arrhenius equation 32 predation by aquatic micro animals loss of testing and bacterial lysis resulted in mlvss in sbr2 below 1 1 g l 1 on days 1 to 35 fig 6b despite the absence of sludge discharge this result is completely different from that of sbr1 at high temperature which fully illustrates that low temperature severely inhibits the microbial reproduction capacity the sludge concentration of sbr2 increased rapidly from 2 8 to a maximum of 4 8 g l 1 after the daily treatment load was improved in phase ii the sludge discharge section was activated from day 45 and successfully controlled the mlvss at a level close to that of sbr1 4 7 g l 1 the f value mlvss mlss ratio reflects the amount of biomass in the activated sludge low f value represents an excess of inorganic particles in the sludge which may cause problems for the stable operation of wwtps as shown in fig 6 the f value of sbr1 showed a slight decrease in phase i from 0 51 to 0 41 on the other hand a continuous decrease from 0 55 to 0 39 in the f value of sbr2 was also observed in its phase i the decrease in their f values all correspond to their respective periods of rapidly increasing reaction rates this may be related to the increase of inorganic substances produced by microbial metabolism the f value for the two sbrs in the latter period was stable at 0 4 0 5 which is a low value 33 it has been demonstrated that too little sludge discharge leads to a lower mlvss mlss ratio 34 long term undischarged sludge was the main reason for the low f values in both systems however no results showed that the mlvss mlss ratio was related to the decrease in temperature 3 2 2 comparison of settling performance svi reflects the compressibility and settleability of the sludge during the settling period the average svi of sbr1 was 60 4 ml g 1 which was at a satisfactory level as shown in fig 6a the settling performance was stable for a long time indicating that small gradients of temperature drop had no impact on the sludge settling performance in contrast the settling performance of sbr2 was significantly inferior to that of sbr1 with an svi as high as 132 5 ml g 1 on day 3 and up to 232 8 ml g 1 on day 24 fig 6a suggesting that the intense shock of low temperature led to the sludge bulking after that svi started to decrease which was attributed to the gradual adaptation of microorganisms to low temperatures at phase ii svi was further reduced and restored to a normal level of 74 4 ml g 1 at 48 d sludge bulking often occurs in wastewater treatment systems when environmental conditions are unfavorable for microorganisms it is common in winter or cold regions the stepwise cooling process of sbr1 is a much smoother process compared to the exposure to low temperature initiation of sbr2 in other words the impact of low temperature on sbr1 is milder than that of sbr2 as shown in fig 6b svi in sbr2 showed a decreasing trend from day 24 onwards which corresponds to the period of rapid growth of pnd activity shown in fig 3b in the system sludge bulking was caused by filamentous bacteria which competed with pnd functional bacteria for the limited do and nutrients at the beginning of sbr2 operation pnd functional bacteria were less competitive to the substrate providing favorable conditions for filamentous bacteria to proliferate however the filamentous bacteria were weakened as the pnd activity increased which contributed to the recovery of sludge bulking the decline of svi in sbr2 stopped after raising nlr in phase ii however after the sludge discharge on day 45 another decline occurred this result is in line with the previous knowledge that the increase in ammonia nitrogen load may deteriorate the sludge settling performance 35 and sludge discharge alleviated the problem of sludge bulking to some extent because of the expulsion of filamentous bacterial flocs 36 3 3 microbial properties in low temperature pnd process 3 3 1 microbial community succession high throughput sequencing was used to reveal the evolution of the bacterial community in both systems sludge samples were collected at the start seed sludge on days 21 33 and 51 of sbr1 and on days 21 35 and 51 of sbr2 optimized sequences 57 472 66 188 were obtained in 7 sludge samples for a total of 435 871 the number of otus obtained was 251 377 the population richness and species diversity of the sbr1 system showed little fluctuation during the 51 days in contrast the population richness of the sbr2 system shrank at day 35 and the results at day 51 showed a rebound as indicated by the ace and chao indices table 2 this is due to the enhanced nutrient supply from the increased daily treatment which induced the system to evolve more species the community diversity of sbr2 reduced significantly in the later period as shown by the decrease of shannon index and the increase of simpson index table 2 it suggests that with the stable operation of the system the inferior species were eliminated and the microbial functions were gradually homogenized however in contradiction to this previous researchers have found enhanced species diversity at low temperatures 13 the two patterns of temperature shifts resulted in different microbial community compositions as shown in fig 7a species overlap at the otu level is represented as a venn diagram in the three samples of seed sludge sbr1 day 51 and sbr2 day 51 the species shared by the three accounted for 42 2 of the total number of species 54 species were detected to be eliminated by both systems in these 51 days accounting for 11 6 compared to sbr1 sbr2 had 10 5 less species overlap share with seed sludge meanwhile sbr1 and sbr2 developed 6 7 and 13 3 of unique species with respectively this indicates that compared to the mild staged cooling operation the evolution of the community structure resulting from gradual adaptation after a low temperature shock is more dramatic 3 3 2 functional bacteria during pnd the microbial community composition in sbrs was examined at the phylum level as shown in fig 7b the dominant phyla were proteobacteria 15 12 49 29 bacteroidota 9 53 61 01 latescibacterota 7 2 26 63 firmicutes 0 63 20 66 and chloroflexi 0 45 6 56 the phylum proteobacteria contains most of the genera associated with nitrogen removal and plays an important role in wastewater treatment systems 1 at day 20 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in sbr1 was 26 82 as the temperature decreased they were gradually enriched to 48 23 in sbr1 day 51 indicating an effective enrichment of nitrogen removal related microorganisms under stepwise cooling conditions bacteroidota continued to grow in sbr1 increasing from the initial 11 73 to 35 74 on day 51 in phase i of sbr2 they proliferated from 9 53 to 61 01 replacing proteobacteria as the dominant phylum bacteroidota have outstanding capabilities in nutrient metabolism and degradation of complex compounds and they may contribute to denitrification under low temperature conditions in addition chloroflexi as heterotrophic bacteria which can decompose organic carbon released by the death lysis of other microorganisms 37 also create conditions for heterotrophic denitrification the top 40 bacteria in number at the genus level were plotted as a heat map by absolute abundance on a logarithmic scale of 10 as shown in fig 7c the genera dominating the autotrophic nitrogen conversion process in the reactors were nitrosomonas aob and nitrobacter nob with relative abundances of 0 04 and 1 33 in the seed sludge respectively nitrobacter was reduced to 0 03 after 20 days of operation for sbr1 correspondingly sbr2 was 0 42 on day 21 the two sbrs were at different temperatures at this time 24 5 and 17 0 c which proved that nob was inhibited by the high ph and low do environment in the systems moreover this inhibition was affected by temperature and nob was more strongly inhibited at high temperatures compared to low temperatures as reflected by the nar values of both after long term runs the relative abundance of nitrobacter in both reactors was below 0 05 at day 51 the abundance of nitrosomonas continued to increase reaching 0 60 and 1 34 respectively the higher abundance of aob in sbr2 was due to the fact that it ran more cycles denitrifying bacteria detected in the reactors included thauera 0 19 4 49 paracoccus 0 15 1 64 unclassified f comamonadaceae 0 04 0 16 bacillus 0 01 0 27 which are commonly found in in wastewater treatment systems 38 40 they can reduce nitrite and nitrate under anoxic conditions using the organic carbon source in water as the electron donor the enrichment of flavobacterium 0 11 59 61 was detected at low temperatures and this bacterium has been shown to be a cryophilic bacterium 41 and increases in flavobacterium at low temperatures have been found in other similar researches 14 42 studies have shown that the genus flavobacterium has anaerobic denitrification capacity 43 its relative abundance was detected in r2 35d sludge samples up to an impressive 59 61 and the high rate of denitrification in the reactor may be related to this similar to the results of the present study horn et al 43 had detected flavobacterium in relative abundance up to 56 0 at 15 c in addition significant amounts of lentimicrobium belonging to bacteroidota 0 32 19 65 which is a genus capable of hydrolytic polymerization of organic matter were detected in both reactors 44 they can degrade complex organic carbon and facilitate heterotrophic bacteria consumption which is essential for denitrification similarly wang et al 45 found the dominance of lentimicrobium in high efficiency denitrification sbr in contrast to sbr2 a large number of enriched dgaos denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms were found in sbr1 such as candidatus competibacter 0 18 21 06 and defluviicoccus 0 24 10 17 fig 7c ca competibacter use internal poly hydroxyalkanoates phas to reduce no2 n and no3 n under anoxic conditions for endogenous denitrification 46 this explains the efficient denitrification with limited organic carbon in sbr1 a previous study showed that gaos are more capable of reproducing at high temperatures 47 so they did not proliferate in sbr2 3 3 3 biological factors of sludge bulking activated sludge bulking is influenced by various factors low do concentration low temperature low substrate concentration and low organic loading may induce sludge bulking the operating conditions of both sbrs were the same except for temperature so the sludge bulking in sbr2 was caused by low temperature chloroflexi plays an important role in the formation of zoogloea 48 and its relative abundance in sbr2 is generally lower than that in sbr1 which may also partially account for the difference in svi between the two sbrs activated sludge bulking includes filamentous and non filamentous bulking the type of sludge bulking is difficult to determine sometimes both occur simultaneously none of the common filamentous bacteria such as microthrix parvicela nostocoida limicola haliscomenobacter hydrossis were detected in all sludge samples 49 however the genus flavobacterium which is abundant in the reactors is also a filamentous bacterium that may cause sludge bulking 50 and it is cold adapted contributing to its own rapid proliferation at low temperatures therefore severe filamentous bulking occurred in sbr2 although flavobacterium enrichment was also detected in sbr1 on day 51 16 37 the relative abundance was much less than that in sbr2 56 65 which explains why sludge bulking was not observed in sbr1 the proper amount of filamentous bacteria combine to form the skeleton of the sludge floc but when they grow in excess they can jeopardize the sludge settling performance once sludge bulking occurs overgrowth of filamentous bacteria may lead to a decrease in non filamentous bacteria causing non filamentous bacteria to be easily lost from the system 51 the non filamentous bulking is mainly related to the composition of eps non filamentous bulking can be triggered if the carbohydrate content in eps is high 52 further studies are needed to confirm the non filamentous bulking in the reactors in this study 4 conclusions the effects of stepwise cooling 28 2 24 5 20 6 17 0 c and sustained low temperature 17 0 c were evaluated for pnd at high temperatures pnd startup took 4 days and was more likely to achieve efficient nitrite accumulation nar 80 whereas sustained low temperature pnd required a longer acclimation period 16 days higher do limits should be set at low temperatures when using a do limited real time control strategy otherwise ammonia removal will be incomplete raising nlr facilitates enhanced aob dominance and enrichment biomass at low temperatures the results of the arrhenius equation fit indicate that nitritation and nitrite denitrification activities are not significantly affected by temperature between 17 and 28 c but pnd activity was susceptible to short term shocks from cooling during stepwise cooling denitrification could be completed within 20 min at 17 c but its activity was strongly inhibited by lower temperatures the proliferation of bacteroidota phylum at low temperature may contribute to efficient denitrification dgaos were enriched heavily only under stepwise cooling condition and it contributed to denitrification to save organic carbon severe sludge bulking appeared under continuous low temperature condition rather than stepwise cooling condition and it alleviated with rising pnd activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12788,in the nanofiltration nf treatment of saline dye wastewater whether dye aggregation and salting out occur in membrane elements is still not well understood in this study a reactive turquoise blue kn g rtb which is easy to aggregate and salt out was selected for experimental study firstly the effects of dye and salt concentrations on the aggregation and salting out rate of rtb were investigated by beaker experiments then nf experiments and scanning electron microscope sem observation were carried out to investigate the membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out finally based on the mechanical analysis of dye particles in cross flow filtration system two membrane fouling control measures of increasing cross flow velocity and ultrasonic irradiation of feed water were investigated the results showed that the aggregation degree and the salting out rate of rtb were positively correlated with the salt concentration sem showed that the fouling on the membrane surface had particle characteristics during nf experiment the normalized flux j j 0 decreased from 0 96 to 0 42 when the added salt concentration increased from 0 0 g l 1 to 5 0 g l 1 however the attenuation of j j 0 was significantly reduced by increasing cross flow velocity or ultrasonic irradiation of feed water therefore in the process of nf treatment of saline dye wastewater salting out in membrane elements could occur and increase membrane fouling and increasing cross flow velocity or applying ultrafiltration can effectively reduce the membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out keywords nanofiltration dye aggregation salting out membrane fouling ultrasonic irradiation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dye wastewater is characterized by complex composition deep colour high salt content high chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and poor biodegradability making the conventional treatment technologies such as coagulation oxidation adsorption and biochemical methods difficult to have ideal efficiency and economic applicability unlike these traditional technologies nf is an environmentally friendly and advanced separation technology based on the space steric effect and charge interaction nf membranes can achieve high retention of dyes which provide technical support for the desalination and purification of dyes or the treatment and recycling of dye wastewater 1 6 yu et al reported a successful example of the application of nf technology to replace the traditional salting out and pressure filtration process in dye production where the service life of the nf membrane was more than 3 years and the economic and social benefits of the nf process were very remarkable 5 besides a full scale spiral nf membrane system for treatment of dyestuff wastewater has been successfully implemented at a company in thailand 6 however membrane fouling is always a concern during nf severe membrane fouling results in a significant decline of membrane flux and deterioration of separation performance which restricts the large scale applications of nf technology in the nf process of a mixture containing soluble dye and salt most studies have focused on the effect of dye adsorption on membrane fouling 7 9 the adsorption mechanism could be based on multiple interactions such as electrostatic hydrophobic van der waals and hydrogen bonds 9 li et al established the remarkable correlation between membrane flux decline and membrane absorbed mass which directly confirmed that dye adsorption played a dominant role in membrane fouling 10 as the dye continued to adsorb on the membrane a gel layer would gradually form some scholars further studied the effect of the gel layer on membrane properties such as permeability resistance and salt rejection performance 11 13 obviously high salt concentration in dye wastewater can have a complex effect on the performance of nf membrane especially commercial membrane because it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high retention of dye and low retention of salt luo et al 14 comprehensively reviewed the effects and related mechanisms in which salting out induced pore swelling and solute dehydration increase of effective membrane thickness multivalent ions adsorption charge screening charge induced concentration polarization were proposed to elucidate the effect of salt on nf performance these effects affect not only solute rejection rate membrane flux but also membrane fouling behavior it s worth mentioning that dye aggregation and precipitation caused by salt should not be ignored it has been reported that dye molecules have a tendency to self association and can form dimers trimers and even polymers under the interactions such as hydrogen bond van der waals forces electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction 15 16 generally speaking the dye molecules with benzene rings or heterocycles have a high hydrophobicity and are easily aggregated and affected by salt while the dye molecules with high solubility are generally weakly affected by salt 1 17 for example koyuncu et al reported flux decline at high salt concentrations was lower than the flux decline at low salt concentrations and concluded that the adsorption rate of dye molecules was high on membrane surface at low nacl concentrations 18 this result may be related to the high solubility of the active black 5 solubility 367 g l 1 at 25 c 19 used in the experiment however at high salt concentrations many dyes precipitate known as salting out which has been demonstrated in industrial production where a large number of inorganic salts are added to precipitate the dye from the liquid 20 therefore in the process of nf treatment of saline dye wastewater with low dye concentration it is of great significance to find out whether dye aggregation and salting out will also occur in the membrane elements which is related to the membrane fouling control however there are few reports on the subject because the factors influencing membrane fouling are quite complex control strategies for flux decline are also diverse including modification of membrane pretreatment of feed optimization of operating parameters etc 21 23 ultrasound is a promising method for membrane fouling control 24 as we know ultrasonic waves in water will produce cavitation effect causing the formation of microstreamers and microstreaming which can significantly enhance the solute dispersion effect reduce the concentration polarization mobilize particles that would otherwise attach to the membrane and then the particles can be carried away by acoustic streaming 25 27 so far there are many reports on the application of ultrasound in ultrafiltration or microfiltration but few in nf treatment of dye wastewater among them patel et al reported that the flux decline could be significantly slowed down during nf for dye nacl mixed solution when the membrane cell was irradiated with low frequency ultrasound 27 however it is feared that direct ultrasonic irradiation of membrane module may damage the membrane and reduce its service life based on the above review when nf is used for saline dye wastewater the concentration of dye and salt will continue to rise along the membrane elements so the phenomenon of dye aggregation and salting out is likely to exist especially in the terminal membrane elements however until now the effect of dye aggregation and salting out on membrane fouling and the control measures have not been systematically studied in this study rtb was selected for experimental study since insoluble dyes such as disperse dyes are generally suitable for ultrafiltration but not for nf the selected dyes used for nf should first be water soluble dyes such as reactive dyes secondly in order to achieve the research objectives of this paper the selected dyes are required to be easily aggregated and salted out after preliminary investigation rtb was found to be suitable 28 then the effects of dye and salt concentrations on dye aggregation and the salting out rate were investigated by beaker tests on this basis nf permeation experiments were carried out to investigate membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out and the effects of increasing cross velocity and ultrasonic irradiation on improving membrane fouling the experimental results are helpful to further understand the causes of membrane fouling and explore effective control measures when using nf to treat dye wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 reagents rtb kn g c40h25cun9o14s5 1080 da as shown in fig 1 a typical reactive dye was purchased from hong kong inspire trading company according to the technical instructions provided by the manufacturer the maximum absorption wavelength is 660 nm nacl ar was supplied by nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 beaker tests on dye aggregation and salting out of rtb in order to fully understand the characteristics of rtb aggregation and salting out beaker experiments were carried out a certain amount of sodium chloride was added to the rtb solution under agitation the rtb concentration was set at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 and nacl concentration was set at 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 g l 1 respectively the solution temperature was controlled at 25 c by a thermostatic water bath jintan jerel electric appliance co ltd after 30 min of reaction the particle size and salting out rate were determined respectively referring to the calculation method of recovery rate commonly used in salting out method 29 the salting out effect in this paper is expressed as salting out rate r s and its calculation is shown in eq 1 1 r s 1 c 2 c 1 100 where c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of rtb in the filtrate by 0 45 μm filter membrane before and after nacl was added g l 1 2 3 nf permeation experiments the nf membrane used in this study was a spiral polyamide pa nf membrane element haina environmental technology co ltd the effective filtration area of the element is 0 4 m2 based on the neutral solute nf experiment and the steric hindrance pore shp model 30 the pore radius r p was determined to be 0 36 nm the molecular weight cut off mcwo of the nf membrane was also determined to be 168 da by fitting the relationship between molecular weight and molecular radius 31 the pure water permeability l p was determined to be 30 6 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 by measuring the permeate flux as a function of applied pressure in addition at a temperature of 25 c and a salt concentration of 5 g l 1 the salt rejection rate was measured to be about 90 which is consistent with the salt rejection performance of the typical commercial nf membrane a cross flow filtration unit was used for the membrane fouling test of the simulated dye wastewater as shown in fig 2 the feed tank 1 l beaker was placed in a water bath to maintain the feed temperature stable at 25 c operation pressure was controlled at 0 5 mpa by valve 1 cross flow velocity was adjusted by valve 1 and valve 2 the reflux liquid concentrate and permeate streams were recycled and returned to the feed tank to keep the concentration of the feed solution constant throughout the experiment the dye concentration in the feed was kept at 2 0 g l 1 due to the operating pressure limitation of the experimental device the osmotic pressure of the feed cannot be high so the salt concentration was set in the range of 0 5 g l 1 the ph of the experimental water sample was about 5 9 and the addition of salt had no obvious effect the membrane element was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water prior to the start of each batch experiment when investigating the effect of ultrasound on membrane permeability the feed tank was placed in the water bath of a low frequency ultrasonic generator 40 khz kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china for irradiation and other conditions remained unchanged permeate experiments lasted 180 min during which the membrane flux and the rejection rate were measured every 20 min the flux j l m 2 h 1 was calculated by eq 2 2 j v at where v l a m2 and t h are the volume of permeate the effective area of the nf membrane and time interval respectively and on this basis the normalized flux that is the flux relative to the initial flux j j 0 was calculated the rejection rate r of dye was calculated by eq 3 3 r dye 1 c p c f 100 where c p and c f are solute concentrations in permeate and feed solution respectively 2 4 analysis methods the concentration of rtb was determined by absorbance measured with a vis spectrophotometer 722g inesa analytical instrument co ltd china at 660 nm the wavelength scanning showed that salt addition has little effect on the maximum absorption wavelength of rtb the conductivity was measured by a conductivity meter ec200 beijing luoweibang co ltd china the particle size in the rtb nacl mixed solution was measured by nano particle size and zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zse malvern instruments co ltd uk the morphology of membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out was observed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5610lv japan electronics co ltd japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye aggregation and salting out in bulk solution as shown in fig 3 the particle size of dye increased significantly with the increase of salt or dye concentration especially when salt concentration exceeded 20 g l 1 moreover the salting out flocs were clearly observed in the static state as shown in fig 4 these observations can directly confirm the highly aggregative properties of rtb molecules from the molecular structure of rtb fig 1 one can see it contains so3h oh and nh groups which makes it easy to form hydrogen bonds between molecules besides the rtb molecule has a coplanar multi aromatic structure and a large molecular weight making the hydrophobic interaction and van der waals attraction between molecules stronger these properties make rtb molecules easy to aggregate in solution when inorganic salts are added on the one hand the positively charged counterions sodium ions will favourably reduce the mutual repulsive force and help the formation of aggregates 17 on the other hand inorganic ions can capture the bound water around molecules because water would preferentially solvate ions 14 enhancing rtb molecular hydrophobicity aggregation and salting out besides with the increase of dye concentration the collisions between dye molecules increase promoting dye aggregation and salting out fig 5 further showed that the relationship between the dye salting out rate and the added salt concentration and dye concentration obviously the salting out rate of rtb was positively correlated with salt concentration although the effect of dye concentration on salting out rate was not as obvious as that of salt concentration the absolute salting out mass increased with the increase of dye concentration it is worth noting that the salting out of rtb is different from the precipitation of inorganic salt crystals which only precipitates when the salt concentration exceeds the solubility while rtb salting out also exists at lower concentrations similar results have been reported and applied to dyeing processes where the use of high salt concentrations reduces the solubility of the dye and allows it to be exhausted in the dye solution 17 18 20 therefore when nf is used for saline dye wastewater the concentration of dye and salt will continue to rise along the membrane elements the phenomenon of dye aggregation and salting out is likely to exist especially in the terminal membrane elements and so the effect of dye aggregation and salting out on membrane fouling cannot be ignored 3 2 nf membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out the morphology of membrane fouling was observed by sem as shown in fig 6 fig 6 a clearly showed that the membrane fouling had obvious particle characteristics indicating the presence of dye aggregation or salting out in the bulk feed solution in accordance with the results described in section 3 1 as filtration continued the particles accumulated and formed a gel layer as shown in fig 6 b and c therefore the formation mechanism of the fouling layer is not only the adsorption between the dye molecules and the membrane surface but also the deposition of salting out particles furthermore we investigated the changes of the normalized flux j j 0 and dye rejection at different salt concentrations with nf time as shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 showed that salt concentration had a significant influence on the attenuation of the normalized flux when no salt was added control group j j 0 only declined to 0 96 indicating that fouling was marginal in this case the aggregation degree of dye molecules was low and mainly existed in the form of soluble anions resulting in the electrostatic repulsion between dye anions and membrane was stronger than van der waals force and hydrogen bond which made it difficult for dye anions to adsorb on the membrane surface apart from adsorption pore clogging is also a common cause of membrane fouling caused by organic matter 32 but it generally occurs when the molecular size is comparable to the pore size 7 8 in this study the molecular weight of rtb was 1080 da much larger than mwco 168 da so the contribution of pore clogging to membrane fouling should be small the j j 0 line in fig 7 showed a characteristic of slow initial attenuation which supported the conclusion that the pore clogging was marginal if the membrane pores were severely clogged the initial j j 0 should decline sharply therefore the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the adsorption of dye molecules without salt addition and the fouling degree was relatively light when salt was added j j 0 of all experimental groups showed significant attenuation and the degree of attenuation was positively correlated with salt concentration after 180 min of nf j j 0 decreased to 0 84 at 2 5 g l 1 nacl and sharply decreased to 0 42 at 5 0 g l 1 nacl it is known that the increase of salt concentration will lead to the increase of osmotic pressure and the decrease of membrane flux while the decrease of membrane flux will lead to the decrease of concentration polarization therefore theoretically if the decrease of j j 0 is caused by concentration polarization it should decrease slowly with time but our experimental results were the opposite we believed that this result clearly indicated that the increase in salt concentration led to an increase in membrane fouling on the one hand as reported by luo et al 14 the salt addition can affect the surface properties of nf membrane such as hydrophilicity and charge increasing the salt concentration increases the membrane volume charge but decreases the flowing potential and increases the electrostatic screening at the same time the membrane hydrophilicity may decrease according to the salting out and electrostatic screening effects the changes could lead to the decrease of electrostatic repulsion and the increase of hydrophobic interaction between the dye molecules and the membrane resulting in an increase in membrane fouling on the other hand it is undeniable that salt enhanced the aggregation and salting out of rtb which was experimentally confirmed in section 3 1 was also an important reason for the increase of membrane fouling it is worth mentioning that koyuncu et al did not get consistent results when they performed nf experiments with a mixture of reactive black 5 and salt 18 this is probably due to the good solubility of reactive black 5 solubility 367 g l 1 at 25 c 19 no salting out and the high cross flow velocity however for dyes such as rtb the addition of salt enhanced dye aggregation and salting out formed a large number of aggregates easily deposited on the membrane surface and aggravated the membrane fouling in addition salt concentration had little effect on rtb rejection as shown in fig 8 mainly because the molecular weight of rtb was significantly higher than mwco 168 da similar results were reported by tang and van der bruggen 2 33 3 3 control of membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out based on the mechanical analysis of particles in the cross flow filtration system 34 two membrane fouling control measures were proposed one was to increase the cross current velocity and the other was ultrasonic irradiation of feed water the experimental results are shown in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that both cross flow velocity and ultrasonic irradiation had significant effects on membrane flux after nf for 180 min j j 0 only decreased to 0 88 at the cross flow velocity of 3 5 cm s 1 and sharply decreased to 0 42 at 1 5 cm s 1 indicating that increasing the cross flow velocity can significantly reduce membrane fouling similar results have been reported by others 35 37 the mechanism is that increasing the cross flow velocity can increase the shear force of the fluid 38 and can enhance the reverse diffusion of particles which makes it difficult for the dye aggregates in the bulk solution to gather on the membrane surface and can also make the fouling adhered be washed away and flow out of the membrane element in addition increasing cross flow velocity also reduced concentration polarization and inhibited flux reduction caused by osmotic pressure 37 therefore in order to reduce the fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out the cross flow velocity should be appropriately increased in practical applications in addition to increasing the cross flow velocity ultrasonic irradiation of feed water can also reduce membrane fouling in order to avoid the damage of dye molecules and membrane caused by hydroxyl radicals due to strong cavitation effect low frequency ultrasound with 40 khz was selected in fig 9 the j j 0 of ultrasonic irradiation groups did not appear decline even at low cross flow velocity patel et al also found that the flux decline with time could be significantly mitigated under low frequency ultrasonic irradiation compared with the conventional unassisted nf 27 it is well known that ultrasonic wave in water will produce cavitation effect and has a significant dispersion effect and solubilization effect 39 our experiment also proved that ultrasonic irradiation could significantly reduce the particle size of rtb aggregates as shown in fig 10 because of this small fluid shear forces can also prevent the adhesion of small aggregates on the membrane surface in other words ultrasonic irradiation of feed water is as effective as increasing cross flow velocity in reducing membrane fouling caused by dye aggregates in addition we also investigated whether ultrasound irradiation of the feed had a significant effect on the rejection of dyes as shown in fig 11 the results showed that the rtb retention rates were consistently higher than 99 and there was little difference between the ultrasonic irradiation group and the non ultrasonic irradiation group indicating that in similar systems with rtb macromolecular dyes and commercial nanofiltration membranes used in this study reasonable application of low frequency ultrasound can have no significant adverse effect on dye rejection 4 conclusion for a dye like rtb that aggregates and salts out easily the aggregation degree and the salting out rate of dye are positively correlated with the salt concentration suggesting that in the process of nf treatment of salt containing dye wastewater dye aggregation and salting out in membrane elements could occur and exacerbate particulate membrane fouling nf experimental results showed that the normalized flux j j 0 decreased from 0 96 to 0 42 when salt concentration increased from 0 0 g l 1 to 5 0 g l 1 increasing cross flow velocity from 1 5 to 3 5 cm s 1 j j 0 increased from 0 42 to 0 88 after nf for 180 min similarly j j 0 basically did not appear to decline when the feed was irradiated by ultrasonic in conclusion increasing cross flow velocity and applying ultrasonic irradiation are effective strategies to reduce the membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out declaration of competing interest no conflict

hydrophobic van der waals and hydrogen bonds 9 li et al established the remarkable correlation between membrane flux decline and membrane absorbed mass which directly confirmed that dye adsorption played a dominant role in membrane fouling 10 as the dye continued to adsorb on the membrane a gel layer would gradually form some scholars further studied the effect of the gel layer on membrane properties such as permeability resistance and salt rejection performance 11 13 obviously high salt concentration in dye wastewater can have a complex effect on the performance of nf membrane especially commercial membrane because it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high retention of dye and low retention of salt luo et al 14 comprehensively reviewed the effects and related mechanisms in which salting out induced pore swelling and solute dehydration increase of effective membrane thickness multivalent ions adsorption charge screening charge induced concentration polarization were proposed to elucidate the effect of salt on nf performance these effects affect not only solute rejection rate membrane flux but also membrane fouling behavior it s worth mentioning that dye aggregation and precipitation caused by salt should not be ignored it has been reported that dye molecules have a tendency to self association and can form dimers trimers and even polymers under the interactions such as hydrogen bond van der waals forces electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction 15 16 generally speaking the dye molecules with benzene rings or heterocycles have a high hydrophobicity and are easily aggregated and affected by salt while the dye molecules with high solubility are generally weakly affected by salt 1 17 for example koyuncu et al reported flux decline at high salt concentrations was lower than the flux decline at low salt concentrations and concluded that the adsorption rate of dye molecules was high on membrane surface at low nacl concentrations 18 this result may be related to the high solubility of the active black 5 solubility 367 g l 1 at 25 c 19 used in the experiment however at high salt concentrations many dyes precipitate known as salting out which has been demonstrated in industrial production where a large number of inorganic salts are added to precipitate the dye from the liquid 20 therefore in the process of nf treatment of saline dye wastewater with low dye concentration it is of great significance to find out whether dye aggregation and salting out will also occur in the membrane elements which is related to the membrane fouling control however there are few reports on the subject because the factors influencing membrane fouling are quite complex control strategies for flux decline are also diverse including modification of membrane pretreatment of feed optimization of operating parameters etc 21 23 ultrasound is a promising method for membrane fouling control 24 as we know ultrasonic waves in water will produce cavitation effect causing the formation of microstreamers and microstreaming which can significantly enhance the solute dispersion effect reduce the concentration polarization mobilize particles that would otherwise attach to the membrane and then the particles can be carried away by acoustic streaming 25 27 so far there are many reports on the application of ultrasound in ultrafiltration or microfiltration but few in nf treatment of dye wastewater among them patel et al reported that the flux decline could be significantly slowed down during nf for dye nacl mixed solution when the membrane cell was irradiated with low frequency ultrasound 27 however it is feared that direct ultrasonic irradiation of membrane module may damage the membrane and reduce its service life based on the above review when nf is used for saline dye wastewater the concentration of dye and salt will continue to rise along the membrane elements so the phenomenon of dye aggregation and salting out is likely to exist especially in the terminal membrane elements however until now the effect of dye aggregation and salting out on membrane fouling and the control measures have not been systematically studied in this study rtb was selected for experimental study since insoluble dyes such as disperse dyes are generally suitable for ultrafiltration but not for nf the selected dyes used for nf should first be water soluble dyes such as reactive dyes secondly in order to achieve the research objectives of this paper the selected dyes are required to be easily aggregated and salted out after preliminary investigation rtb was found to be suitable 28 then the effects of dye and salt concentrations on dye aggregation and the salting out rate were investigated by beaker tests on this basis nf permeation experiments were carried out to investigate membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out and the effects of increasing cross velocity and ultrasonic irradiation on improving membrane fouling the experimental results are helpful to further understand the causes of membrane fouling and explore effective control measures when using nf to treat dye wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 reagents rtb kn g c40h25cun9o14s5 1080 da as shown in fig 1 a typical reactive dye was purchased from hong kong inspire trading company according to the technical instructions provided by the manufacturer the maximum absorption wavelength is 660 nm nacl ar was supplied by nanjing chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 beaker tests on dye aggregation and salting out of rtb in order to fully understand the characteristics of rtb aggregation and salting out beaker experiments were carried out a certain amount of sodium chloride was added to the rtb solution under agitation the rtb concentration was set at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 and nacl concentration was set at 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 g l 1 respectively the solution temperature was controlled at 25 c by a thermostatic water bath jintan jerel electric appliance co ltd after 30 min of reaction the particle size and salting out rate were determined respectively referring to the calculation method of recovery rate commonly used in salting out method 29 the salting out effect in this paper is expressed as salting out rate r s and its calculation is shown in eq 1 1 r s 1 c 2 c 1 100 where c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of rtb in the filtrate by 0 45 μm filter membrane before and after nacl was added g l 1 2 3 nf permeation experiments the nf membrane used in this study was a spiral polyamide pa nf membrane element haina environmental technology co ltd the effective filtration area of the element is 0 4 m2 based on the neutral solute nf experiment and the steric hindrance pore shp model 30 the pore radius r p was determined to be 0 36 nm the molecular weight cut off mcwo of the nf membrane was also determined to be 168 da by fitting the relationship between molecular weight and molecular radius 31 the pure water permeability l p was determined to be 30 6 l m 2 h 1 mpa 1 by measuring the permeate flux as a function of applied pressure in addition at a temperature of 25 c and a salt concentration of 5 g l 1 the salt rejection rate was measured to be about 90 which is consistent with the salt rejection performance of the typical commercial nf membrane a cross flow filtration unit was used for the membrane fouling test of the simulated dye wastewater as shown in fig 2 the feed tank 1 l beaker was placed in a water bath to maintain the feed temperature stable at 25 c operation pressure was controlled at 0 5 mpa by valve 1 cross flow velocity was adjusted by valve 1 and valve 2 the reflux liquid concentrate and permeate streams were recycled and returned to the feed tank to keep the concentration of the feed solution constant throughout the experiment the dye concentration in the feed was kept at 2 0 g l 1 due to the operating pressure limitation of the experimental device the osmotic pressure of the feed cannot be high so the salt concentration was set in the range of 0 5 g l 1 the ph of the experimental water sample was about 5 9 and the addition of salt had no obvious effect the membrane element was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water prior to the start of each batch experiment when investigating the effect of ultrasound on membrane permeability the feed tank was placed in the water bath of a low frequency ultrasonic generator 40 khz kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china for irradiation and other conditions remained unchanged permeate experiments lasted 180 min during which the membrane flux and the rejection rate were measured every 20 min the flux j l m 2 h 1 was calculated by eq 2 2 j v at where v l a m2 and t h are the volume of permeate the effective area of the nf membrane and time interval respectively and on this basis the normalized flux that is the flux relative to the initial flux j j 0 was calculated the rejection rate r of dye was calculated by eq 3 3 r dye 1 c p c f 100 where c p and c f are solute concentrations in permeate and feed solution respectively 2 4 analysis methods the concentration of rtb was determined by absorbance measured with a vis spectrophotometer 722g inesa analytical instrument co ltd china at 660 nm the wavelength scanning showed that salt addition has little effect on the maximum absorption wavelength of rtb the conductivity was measured by a conductivity meter ec200 beijing luoweibang co ltd china the particle size in the rtb nacl mixed solution was measured by nano particle size and zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zse malvern instruments co ltd uk the morphology of membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out was observed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5610lv japan electronics co ltd japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye aggregation and salting out in bulk solution as shown in fig 3 the particle size of dye increased significantly with the increase of salt or dye concentration especially when salt concentration exceeded 20 g l 1 moreover the salting out flocs were clearly observed in the static state as shown in fig 4 these observations can directly confirm the highly aggregative properties of rtb molecules from the molecular structure of rtb fig 1 one can see it contains so3h oh and nh groups which makes it easy to form hydrogen bonds between molecules besides the rtb molecule has a coplanar multi aromatic structure and a large molecular weight making the hydrophobic interaction and van der waals attraction between molecules stronger these properties make rtb molecules easy to aggregate in solution when inorganic salts are added on the one hand the positively charged counterions sodium ions will favourably reduce the mutual repulsive force and help the formation of aggregates 17 on the other hand inorganic ions can capture the bound water around molecules because water would preferentially solvate ions 14 enhancing rtb molecular hydrophobicity aggregation and salting out besides with the increase of dye concentration the collisions between dye molecules increase promoting dye aggregation and salting out fig 5 further showed that the relationship between the dye salting out rate and the added salt concentration and dye concentration obviously the salting out rate of rtb was positively correlated with salt concentration although the effect of dye concentration on salting out rate was not as obvious as that of salt concentration the absolute salting out mass increased with the increase of dye concentration it is worth noting that the salting out of rtb is different from the precipitation of inorganic salt crystals which only precipitates when the salt concentration exceeds the solubility while rtb salting out also exists at lower concentrations similar results have been reported and applied to dyeing processes where the use of high salt concentrations reduces the solubility of the dye and allows it to be exhausted in the dye solution 17 18 20 therefore when nf is used for saline dye wastewater the concentration of dye and salt will continue to rise along the membrane elements the phenomenon of dye aggregation and salting out is likely to exist especially in the terminal membrane elements and so the effect of dye aggregation and salting out on membrane fouling cannot be ignored 3 2 nf membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out the morphology of membrane fouling was observed by sem as shown in fig 6 fig 6 a clearly showed that the membrane fouling had obvious particle characteristics indicating the presence of dye aggregation or salting out in the bulk feed solution in accordance with the results described in section 3 1 as filtration continued the particles accumulated and formed a gel layer as shown in fig 6 b and c therefore the formation mechanism of the fouling layer is not only the adsorption between the dye molecules and the membrane surface but also the deposition of salting out particles furthermore we investigated the changes of the normalized flux j j 0 and dye rejection at different salt concentrations with nf time as shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 showed that salt concentration had a significant influence on the attenuation of the normalized flux when no salt was added control group j j 0 only declined to 0 96 indicating that fouling was marginal in this case the aggregation degree of dye molecules was low and mainly existed in the form of soluble anions resulting in the electrostatic repulsion between dye anions and membrane was stronger than van der waals force and hydrogen bond which made it difficult for dye anions to adsorb on the membrane surface apart from adsorption pore clogging is also a common cause of membrane fouling caused by organic matter 32 but it generally occurs when the molecular size is comparable to the pore size 7 8 in this study the molecular weight of rtb was 1080 da much larger than mwco 168 da so the contribution of pore clogging to membrane fouling should be small the j j 0 line in fig 7 showed a characteristic of slow initial attenuation which supported the conclusion that the pore clogging was marginal if the membrane pores were severely clogged the initial j j 0 should decline sharply therefore the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the adsorption of dye molecules without salt addition and the fouling degree was relatively light when salt was added j j 0 of all experimental groups showed significant attenuation and the degree of attenuation was positively correlated with salt concentration after 180 min of nf j j 0 decreased to 0 84 at 2 5 g l 1 nacl and sharply decreased to 0 42 at 5 0 g l 1 nacl it is known that the increase of salt concentration will lead to the increase of osmotic pressure and the decrease of membrane flux while the decrease of membrane flux will lead to the decrease of concentration polarization therefore theoretically if the decrease of j j 0 is caused by concentration polarization it should decrease slowly with time but our experimental results were the opposite we believed that this result clearly indicated that the increase in salt concentration led to an increase in membrane fouling on the one hand as reported by luo et al 14 the salt addition can affect the surface properties of nf membrane such as hydrophilicity and charge increasing the salt concentration increases the membrane volume charge but decreases the flowing potential and increases the electrostatic screening at the same time the membrane hydrophilicity may decrease according to the salting out and electrostatic screening effects the changes could lead to the decrease of electrostatic repulsion and the increase of hydrophobic interaction between the dye molecules and the membrane resulting in an increase in membrane fouling on the other hand it is undeniable that salt enhanced the aggregation and salting out of rtb which was experimentally confirmed in section 3 1 was also an important reason for the increase of membrane fouling it is worth mentioning that koyuncu et al did not get consistent results when they performed nf experiments with a mixture of reactive black 5 and salt 18 this is probably due to the good solubility of reactive black 5 solubility 367 g l 1 at 25 c 19 no salting out and the high cross flow velocity however for dyes such as rtb the addition of salt enhanced dye aggregation and salting out formed a large number of aggregates easily deposited on the membrane surface and aggravated the membrane fouling in addition salt concentration had little effect on rtb rejection as shown in fig 8 mainly because the molecular weight of rtb was significantly higher than mwco 168 da similar results were reported by tang and van der bruggen 2 33 3 3 control of membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out based on the mechanical analysis of particles in the cross flow filtration system 34 two membrane fouling control measures were proposed one was to increase the cross current velocity and the other was ultrasonic irradiation of feed water the experimental results are shown in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that both cross flow velocity and ultrasonic irradiation had significant effects on membrane flux after nf for 180 min j j 0 only decreased to 0 88 at the cross flow velocity of 3 5 cm s 1 and sharply decreased to 0 42 at 1 5 cm s 1 indicating that increasing the cross flow velocity can significantly reduce membrane fouling similar results have been reported by others 35 37 the mechanism is that increasing the cross flow velocity can increase the shear force of the fluid 38 and can enhance the reverse diffusion of particles which makes it difficult for the dye aggregates in the bulk solution to gather on the membrane surface and can also make the fouling adhered be washed away and flow out of the membrane element in addition increasing cross flow velocity also reduced concentration polarization and inhibited flux reduction caused by osmotic pressure 37 therefore in order to reduce the fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out the cross flow velocity should be appropriately increased in practical applications in addition to increasing the cross flow velocity ultrasonic irradiation of feed water can also reduce membrane fouling in order to avoid the damage of dye molecules and membrane caused by hydroxyl radicals due to strong cavitation effect low frequency ultrasound with 40 khz was selected in fig 9 the j j 0 of ultrasonic irradiation groups did not appear decline even at low cross flow velocity patel et al also found that the flux decline with time could be significantly mitigated under low frequency ultrasonic irradiation compared with the conventional unassisted nf 27 it is well known that ultrasonic wave in water will produce cavitation effect and has a significant dispersion effect and solubilization effect 39 our experiment also proved that ultrasonic irradiation could significantly reduce the particle size of rtb aggregates as shown in fig 10 because of this small fluid shear forces can also prevent the adhesion of small aggregates on the membrane surface in other words ultrasonic irradiation of feed water is as effective as increasing cross flow velocity in reducing membrane fouling caused by dye aggregates in addition we also investigated whether ultrasound irradiation of the feed had a significant effect on the rejection of dyes as shown in fig 11 the results showed that the rtb retention rates were consistently higher than 99 and there was little difference between the ultrasonic irradiation group and the non ultrasonic irradiation group indicating that in similar systems with rtb macromolecular dyes and commercial nanofiltration membranes used in this study reasonable application of low frequency ultrasound can have no significant adverse effect on dye rejection 4 conclusion for a dye like rtb that aggregates and salts out easily the aggregation degree and the salting out rate of dye are positively correlated with the salt concentration suggesting that in the process of nf treatment of salt containing dye wastewater dye aggregation and salting out in membrane elements could occur and exacerbate particulate membrane fouling nf experimental results showed that the normalized flux j j 0 decreased from 0 96 to 0 42 when salt concentration increased from 0 0 g l 1 to 5 0 g l 1 increasing cross flow velocity from 1 5 to 3 5 cm s 1 j j 0 increased from 0 42 to 0 88 after nf for 180 min similarly j j 0 basically did not appear to decline when the feed was irradiated by ultrasonic in conclusion increasing cross flow velocity and applying ultrasonic irradiation are effective strategies to reduce the membrane fouling caused by dye aggregation and salting out declaration of competing interest no conflict

12789,the performance of bioleaching technology was studied for the demulsification oil content reduction and efficient removal of heavy metals from oily sludge a method was established for treating oily sludge from an oil refinery firstly bioleaching bacteria were enriched and acclimated the effects of substrate type feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o concentration and aeration conditions on treatment performance were investigated with response surface methodology used to optimize the treatment process finally the effects of operating parameters on heavy metal removal under continuous flow conditions were investigated results show that an optimal treatment effect was achieved when 5 00 g l feso4 7h2o and 5 64 g l na2s2o3 5h2o were used as substrates and the aeration ratio air water ratio was 14 53 l l under these conditions the oily sludge reduction rate was 51 76 and the oil removal rate was 57 67 the removal rates for pb hg and cu ranged between 40 and 70 with a stable total heavy metal reduction rate of 50 these results show that bioleaching technology is feasible for the treatment of oily sludge and heavy metal removal with good potential for practical application keywords oily sludge bioleaching technology sequential batch processing interspecific coordination mechanism process condition design data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction oily sludge is produced during petrochemical storage and the subsequent transportation and processing of oily sludge or its components and it is a complex and difficult process oily sludge contains a large number of petroleum hydrocarbons asphaltene and other oil substances along with a large number of chemicals heavy metals and other harmful components due to the large scale of industrial processes oily sludge outputs are typically large and present a significant hazard to the area surrounding the discharge site by 2019 the annual production of oily sludge in china had reached 12 million tons with a continually increasing environmental burden and negative ecological impact 1 to effectively achieve oil recovery from waste sludge the currently available sludge treatment technologies mainly rely on combinations of physical chemical and biological methods the most commonly applied method is organic solvent extraction with extraction requiring a large number of organic solvents resulting in a significant secondary pollution risk furthermore organic solvent extraction incurs high operational costs and can only achieve limited levels of recovery 2 chemical demulsification methods require large volumes of chemical surfactants which increase operational costs and present a secondary pollution risk while also reducing the quality of the recovered oil 3 4 chemical methods also include a variety of innovative approaches for example liquid dimethyl ether can be applied in low temperature and high pressure environments to remove water from oily sludge achieving a high water removal rate however the use of this method is limited by complicated reaction conditions the equipment and space requirements and high operational costs 5 the oily sludge treated by these chemical methods exhibits a reduced proportion of oil substances although its composition is more complex and heavy metal elements in sludge are not effectively extracted and separated biological methods for the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and other complex organic compounds mainly utilize functional microbial communities dozens of oil degrading bacteria can now be isolated from oil polluted environments 6 this group of microorganisms is represented by rhodococcus most of which can utilize oil substances as substrates microorganisms disrupt the oil water interface balance by secreting surfactants achieving effective contact with substrates 7 this kind of biological treatment has been shown to have a good performance for hydrocarbon compound removal but is not effective for the removal of heavy metals or other pollutants moreover the degradation of oil substances in oily sludge leads to a reduction in its calorific value which is not conducive to its subsequent treatment and utilization as a sustainable resource 8 9 in contrast bioleaching technology can simultaneously achieve heavy metal removal and oil acidification demulsification via a simple process therefore bioleaching technologies provide the benefits of more comprehensive treatment with improved treatment performance and environmental safety as compared to traditional chemical and biological methods bioleaching technology systems are often dominated by acidithiobacillus among which a ferrooxidans and a thiooxidans are the most widely used functional species with these chemoautotrophs existing widely in soils mine wastewater and acidic sewage 10 11 a thiooxidans utilizes reduced sulfur as a substrate producing sulfuric acid as the final product a ferrooxidans has both iron and sulfur oxidation systems allowing it to survive using ferrous ions and reduced sulfur as substrates generating fe ions and sulfuric acid as metabolites 12 13 at present the acidogenic characteristics and redox capacity of thiobacillus acidophilus have received extensive research attention bioleaching technology has been applied in biological mining 14 and waste circuit board treatment 15 realizing the efficient leaching and recovery of metal elements bioleaching technology has been widely used for environmental protection and solid waste treatment for example the use of bioleaching to treat surplus sludge generated by urban sewage treatment plants achieved good sludge reduction performance without any risk of secondary pollution 16 furthermore the treatment of hazardous landfill waste leachate using bioleaching technology was shown to effectively remove heavy metals 17 in summary the reported applications of bioleaching technology show that this approach can be used to effectively treat hazardous waste with broad application prospects in the field of solid waste treatment in particular however to date no studies on the treatment of oily sludge by bioleaching technology have been reported with no reports on the application of thiobacillus acidophilus in highly toxic environments therefore this study assessed the use of biological leaching technology for the treatment of oily sludge based on the concept of sequencing batch reactor sbr processes in sewage treatment bioleaching technology was innovatively combined with biological bacterial liquid circulation developing a sequencing batch intermittent reaction system for oily sludge treatment bioleaching bacteria from municipal sludge were enriched by culturing in growth medium and acclimated by the addition of oily sludge the sequencing batch reaction system was designed to treat actual oily sludge using the response surface method to optimize process conditions the optimized process was then applied under long term continuous flow conditions to study the operational stability of the process and determine its heavy metal removal performance furthermore molecular biological methods were used to identify the functional species in the bacterial community the aim of this study was to provide theoretical support for the practical application of this novel biological technology for the treatment of oily sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials microbial strains originated from the excess sludge generated by the qingdao municipal sewage treatment plant china the bacterial domestication process used the oily sludge produced in the biochemical tank and air flotation tank of the shouguang refinery the water oil solid ratio of the three phase system was 50 65 27 80 21 55 sludge contained the heavy metals pb hg cu and mn at concentrations mg kg of 557 62 14 79 852 5 and 21 21 while cd and cr were not detected 2 2 enrichment and domestication of bioleaching strains thiobacillus acidophilus was isolated from the municipal sewage treatment plant surplus sludge using iron salt inorganic 9k medium 18 enrichment cultures were maintained at 25 c in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml culture medium and inoculated with 20 g of excess sludge with continual agitation at 170 rpm cultures were maintained until the culture solution became red in color indicating complete substrate oxidation while the ph was monitored to verify the production of acid in each generation of enrichment the rate of substrate oxidation reduced and the enrichment culture ph decreased to 2 after 2 to 3 generations of enrichment 9k solid culture medium was used for the isolation of strains allowing the morphology of colonies to be observed brown color bacterial colonies were isolated and transferred to 9k liquid medium for cultivation with this process repeated several times until the iron oxidation rate of the solution of functional bacteria reached 15 g l d finally high purity thiobacillus ferrooxidans were obtained from the enrichment culture solution oily sludge was inoculated into the screened bacterial solution allowing the acclimation of bacteria using feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o as substrates with the change in system ph observed until it returned to the same level as prior to the first generation inoculation indicating the end of a generation the amount of oily sludge in each system was gradually increased until the strain was acclimated to a high concentration of oily sludge and its acid production capability was retained after 11 generations of culturing the acclimated bacteria were able to survive and maintain essential activities in high concentration oily sludge environments the maximum inoculation concentration was 20 g of oily sludge per 100 ml of bacterial solution at this time the bacterial solution was diluted to the required volume using 9k medium for use in subsequent experiments 2 3 reagents and detection methods the system ph and orp were measured using a phs 3 c ph meter inesa shanghai china cod was determined using a cod rapid tester 5b 3a tianer tianjin china polysaccharides were measured using an anthrone chromogenic spectrophotometric method dna was quantitatively detected using the diphenylamine colorimetric spectrophotometry assay fe2 was determined using the standard phenanthroline colorimetric spectrophotometry method 19 composition of 9k medium feso4 7h2o 50 0 g l nh4 2so4 3 0 g l cacl2 1 0 g l k2hpo4 0 5 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g l kcl 0 1 g l the relative proportions of each of the three phases of sludge were measured using the azeotropic distillation method with the aid of dean stark device measurements heavy metal elements were extracted using a heated hydrochloric acid hydrofluoric acid perchloric acid digestion system using the original sludge sample as a benchmark the oily sludge removal effect was measured after each processing cycle after digestion the icp method was used to detect and quantify heavy metal elements in the digested raw sludge samples 20 2 4 optimization of treatment process and conditions the process of oily sludge treatment using leaching bacteria was performed in taper bottles with an aerator beijing demr china providing intermittent aeration demr beijing china providing the air flow controlled using a rotor flowmeter chem dalian china furthermore a time switch was used to control the pump maintaining on off intervals of 10 5 min throughout each cycle of operation each treatment system was inoculated with 20 g of acclimated oily sludge and the substrate was added according to an orthogonal scheme designed using the response surface method each treatment group included duplicate systems operated in parallel the ph and orp in each treatment system were monitored every 24 h to indirectly characterize the state of the system at the start and end of the experimental period samples from each treatment system were subjected to azeotropic distillation to measure the proportions of sludge water oil and sand phases it is of note that at the end of each experimental period static precipitation was carried out for a 30 min period for extraction and filtration treatment with the extracted mud cake used for azeotropic distillation however at the start of the experimental period the oily sludge was viscous with low fluidity impeding its treatment by filtration therefore azeotropic distillation was carried out by direct sampling when the ph and orp of the system were close to the level observed prior to sludge inoculation the treatment period was considered to be complete a control system was also operated inoculated with tap water instead of the acclimated culture of functional bacteria while all other conditions and parameters were the same as for the experimental groups in this study software design expert v 8 0 was used to assist in the design of orthogonal experiments using three factors and three levels of multiple target responses allowing synchronous analysis of the effects of microorganisms substrate concentration and aeration ratio on the treatment performance based on the oil removal rate the dehydration efficiency was determined reflecting the overall treatment effect the influencing factors and levels are shown in table 1 2 5 heavy metal removal efficiency after the response surface method was completed the optimized process conditions were used and the systems were operated continuously for nine cycles in this process the detoxification of sludge was characterized by the removal efficiency of heavy metals from the treated sludge experimental reaction systems were the same as described for the optimization stage at the start of each cycle iron and sulfur salt substrates were added and intermittent aeration was initiated at the end of the cycle the mud and water mixture in each bottle was transferred to the separation funnel and after standing precipitation the treated sludge was discharged and the remaining liquid was returned to the treatment device with the loss in volume supplemented using distilled water subsequently the discharged oil sludge was analyzed every 24 h determining the system ph orp and the polysaccharide cod and fe2 concentrations allowing the microbial activity to be characterized accordingly 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis samples were collected before the domestication of functional strains was complete in order to characterize the screening performance in addition samples were taken after the acclimation period to characterize the changes in microbial community structure at the end of each treatment cycle samples were collected and retained with the group achieving the optimal treatment effect was selected for analysis at the end of every operational cycle allowing the stability of the community structure and the ideal functional community structure to be characterized the processes for dna extraction pcr amplification recovery and purification of target fragments were carried out according to previously reported methods 21 pcr amplification was performed using 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers for the v3 v4 variable region of the 16s rrna gene subsequently complete sequencing was performed via the illumina miseq pe 300 nova seq pe 250 platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 cultivation of leaching bacteria from oily sludge the purpose of microbial screening is to determine the target microbial population and its intended biochemical functions and to study its requirements to determine the appropriate culture conditions subsequently the bacteria were continuously subcultured until the expected level of function was achieved t acidophilus was screened and isolated from the surplus sludge generated by a municipal sewage treatment plant using 9k medium enrichment the 9k medium changed color from green to red with the oxidation of ferrous ions during the culture process this oxidation process is accompanied by a decrease in ph and the formation of schneider mineral precipitation as shown in eqs 1 and 2 after about 7 days of operation the ph reduced to about 2 0 22 23 after the cultures were diluted the screened strains were dark red and the liquid was turbid 1 4feso 4 2h 2 so 4 o 2 2fe 2 so 4 3 2h 2 o 2 3fe 2 so 4 3 11 h 2 o 2h 3 ofe 3 so 4 2 oh 6 8h 2 so 4 the ferrous oxidation rate of the functional microbes reached 15 g l d with the culture medium ph reducing from 5 5 to 2 0 within 72 h therefore it was determined that the screened bacterial culture was mainly composed of t ferrooxidans similarly the purpose of microbial domestication is to gradually add inhibitory substances under relatively suitable culture conditions so that microorganisms develop resistance in the iterative process the inhibitory substances serve as a target for treatment such as oils antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals after 11 generations of domestication the functional bacteria were able to survive in higher oily sludge concentrations and maintain acid production previous research has proven that t acidophilus can adapt to harsh living environment after domestication providing a novel direction for the utilization of t acidophilus at this time due to the low fe concentration in the system and the complex composition of oily sludge the bacterial suspension was brown and cloudy however the system maintained its acid producing function and was able to convert the neutral environment into an acidic environment therefore it was determined that the functional community at this time included both bioleaching bacteria and oil degrading bacteria 9k medium was then used to dilute the bacterial solution to the required volume in preparation for the response surface experiment 3 2 optimum process conditions the response surface method was designed using design expert software and the experimental results were analyzed to obtain linear regression equations the three dimensional response surface chart shows the influence of the interaction between the two variable factors on the target factor which was fixed at the central value the response surface diagram shows that the interaction between ferrous ion concentration and aeration ratio had a significant impact on the oil removal rate fig 1 a c while the interaction between sulfur and ferrous ion concentration had a significant impact on the dehydration efficiency fig 1 d f these results show that the total dewatering efficiency of sludge was closely related to the operational conditions applied based on the analysis of variance and response surface analysis a module in design expert software was used to search for the horizontal combination of optimization factors that simultaneously meet the criteria of each response and factor the desired target was selected based on the component with the highest total decrement efficiency and the variables of substrate concentration and aeration ratio variables were selected and maintained within the specified range the expected values of all input variables were as follows 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated air water ratio of 14 53 under these conditions the predicted total decrement efficiency was 51 44 in order to verify the obtained conditions a validation experiment was performed under the optimized conditions using parallel duplicate samples table 2 showing good agreement between the expected and predicted total decrement efficiency values and verifying the reliability of the experimental results 24 therefore the treatment of oily sludge by bioleaching technology with microbial acidification and redox could effectively demulsify oily sludge improving the classification of oil water and sludge phases while achieving the reduction and detoxification of oily sludge the optimal treatment conditions were determined as 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated air water ratio of 14 53 for aerobic bacteria in the culture medium the type and concentration of nutrients available are essential as well as sufficient dissolved oxygen levels according to the disposable cell theory higher amounts of nutrients are unbeneficial in addition excessive aeration can also inhibit microbial growth therefore these three factors were selected for analysis to determine the optimal working conditions 3 3 heavy metal removal efficiency and mechanism based on the results of response surface method optimization the continuous flow experiment was maintained for nine cycles over 63 days under continuous flow conditions to study the effect of continuous process operation on the removal of heavy metals fig 2 the oily sludge used in this study was found to contain four heavy metals pb hg cu and mn fig 2 a d shows the heavy metal content of oily sludge before and after 9 cycles of treatment as shown in fig 2 the oily sludge used in this study contained a large amount of cu and hg after bioleaching treatment the maximum removal rate of heavy metals reached 70 however after processing of cu the hg concentration remained 200 mg kg requiring further treatment prior to disposal such as the adsorption and neutralization of heavy metals in acidic waste liquid and the neutralization of sediment the mn and pb concentrations of untreated sludge were low with the corresponding concentrations reduced to 10 mg kg after treatment which meet the standard requirements for application on general construction land 25 fig 2 e shows the dynamic changes in the overall heavy metal removal efficiency and the treatment effect over 9 consecutive cycles the overall heavy metal removal rate initially decreased and then increased with continuous cycles of operation this phenomenon occurred due to the continuous operation process in which the increasing concentration of heavy metals in suspension had an inhibitory effect on microbial activity the removal rate recovery in later cycles occurred due to the adaptability of the microbial population after existing in a high heavy metal concentration environment allowing functional activity and survival rates to recover it is generally accepted that the forms of heavy metals in sludge and soil are complex and diverse according to the degree of dissolution difficulty heavy metals can be divided into seven states water soluble state md exchangeable state me carbonate bound state mc iron and manganese oxide state mfe mn organic bound state morg sulfide bound state ms and residual state mr 26 the mechanisms of heavy metal removal by bioleaching can be divided into direct and indirect mechanisms direct mechanisms include t thioxide either directly oxidizing heavy metals in the sulfide bound state and generating sulfuric acid or oxidizing reduced sulfur elements to generate sulfuric acid generating acidic conditions and dissolving different forms of heavy metals the indirect oxidation mechanism refers to the redox system of t ferrooxidans using divalent iron and metal sulfides which effectively leaches metal sulfides and generates sulfuric acid resulting in further leaching of various forms of heavy metals 27 28 due to the comprehensive action of microbial functions and activities complexed heavy metals in oily sludge are dissolved in cationic form achieving the removal of heavy metals from sludge firstly thiobacillus eosinophilus achieves the direct oxidation of heavy metals in a sulfide bound state resulting in the leaching of some heavy metals with the decrease in system ph various heavy metal forms are solubilized further promoting their dissolution the heavy metals contained in oily sludge continually dissolve during the treatment process resulting in the heavy metal concentration in solution gradually increasing after two or three cycles of operation the heavy metal concentration was excessively high which inhibits microbial activity and reduces the heavy metal removal rate 29 30 after several cycles of acclimation microbial function and activity improved as the community gradually adapts to high heavy metal concentrations in subsequent cycles the heavy metal removal rate gradually increased and the treatment effect recovered to a good level these experimental results show that after several generations of domestication t acidophilus can adapt to complex environments containing toxic substances therefore the related strains and methodologies have broad application prospects in the field of solid waste treatment 3 4 community analysis and interspecific synergy the microbial community structure was characterized by high throughput sequencing with the bacterial solutions before domestication after domestication and after response surface experiments used for high throughput sequencing analysis fig 3 prior to domestication the proportion of rhodococcus was 25 09 while acidithiobacillus accounted for nearly 67 96 of the community most of which were a ferrooxidans however at this time bacteria still maintained their acid production function after completion of the response surface experiment the microbial community structure exhibited significant changes forming a system in which multiple functional bacteria coexisted such as rhodococcus 7 87 bioleaching bacteria 22 57 alicyclobacillus 12 19 desulfurization bacteria 13 38 with the proportion of functional bacteria being 50 according to the analysis of experimental results the main functional strains were identified as 1 rhodococcus which are chemotrophic bacteria capable of degrading oily substances and producing biosurfactants achieving demulsification and oil removal 2 alicyclobacillus which are chemotrophic iron reducing bacteria capable of reducing fe ions to ferrous ions under low dissolved oxygen conditions with growth and reproduction occurring rapidly under high dissolved oxygen conditions 3 acidithiobacillus which are heterotrophic bacteria in terms of chemical energy using acid producing and redox functions to achieve sludge reduction detoxification and recycling of biochemical sludge 31 32 the sources of these bacteria are diverse and may exist in oily sludge or in the surplus sludge originally used for bacterial screening after oily sludge domestication these bacteria exhibited tolerance to oil substances and acidic environment it is of note that the proportion of bacteria dynamically changed highlighting the importance of condition control during the operational process 33 the high flux draw heat maps fig 3 help to intuitively understand microbial population expansion and dynamics firstly acidithiobacillus mutates itself enabling adaptation to environments containing oily substances and complex organics 34 secondly in the process of domestication a synergistic system composed of acidithiobacillus rhodococcus and other bacteria was formed ensuring smooth operation of the system through interspecific synergy 35 36 it can be observed from the heat map that the treatment process of oily sludge resulted in the formation of a new microbial population in this process the reaction conditions should be adjusted accordingly retaining the main functional bacteria as dominant species however it is not necessary to strictly control the number of microbial species within the population and the intermediate cooperative relationship between microorganisms should be rationally utilized in the continuous flow operational process the system ph orp and the concentration of cod fe2 and polysaccharides were monitored every 24 h allowing indirect characterization of the system based on changes in the indicators and microbial activity after 9 consecutive cycles of operation the conditions achieving the optimal comprehensive treatment effect and the highest degree of sludge reduction and detoxification were selected for high throughput sequencing and mechanism analysis fig 4 shows the response curves for various indicators in the third cycle of continuous operation at the beginning of the third cycle sludge was inoculated with the acidic bacterial suspension causing microbial activity and sludge viscosity to reduce gradually this was followed by the deconstruction and dispersion of aggregates causing the system to gradually release buffer materials chemicals phenol aromatic compounds and surfactants as a result the ph of the system increased and orp decreased fig 4 b e the cod value and polysaccharide content increased significantly fig 4 a c and the activity of t eosinophilus was inhibited 37 the data of various test indicators showed that cod was mainly provided by the oily material at the same time it was found that the cod value and polysaccharide content in the blank control group did not increase significantly indicating that the dissolution of viscous substances in oily sludge occurs under acidic conditions resulting in the rapid release of various types of emulsified oil and other substances 38 neutral distilled water was used to dissolve solidified matter but was unable to reduce the viscosity of oily sludge therefore at the end of the blank control experiment there remained large sludge masses which maintained a state of aggregation inhibiting the release of oil and organic matter into the system at this time oil degrading bacteria and other chemotrophic bacteria represented by rhodococcus were dominant effectively degrading dissolved organic matter the alicyclobacillus in the system can consume some organic matter and reduce certain fe ions to ferrous ions under the low dissolved oxygen conditions of the aeration suspension stage the bacterial fe reduction process produces acid as shown in eq 3 39 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 24 fe 3 24 h 2 o 6co 2 24 fe 2 18 h 2 o therefore the presence of bacteria can reduce the required dosage of fe salt and assist in acid production which is of great significance for the long term stable operation of the system this could also explain the increase in ferrous ion concentrations observed during one cycle in the middle of the reaction period inhibitory substance concentrations gradually decreased causing the activity of acidithiobacillus to gradually be restored the iron oxidation rate to gradually increase and the orp to increase gradually in the system as shown in fig 4 a d the cod value was significantly lower four to five days after the start of the experiment with the ferrous oxidation rate in this time period exhibiting a peak as the concentration of inhibitory substances is low enough to allow thiobacillus activity to rapidly recover and subsequently ferrous ions are oxidized completely in the later stage of the reaction dissolved organic matter in the system is almost completely degraded at which point thiobacillus activity is no longer inhibited and the remaining fe and sulfur substrates are rapidly and completely oxidized at this time the system ph was close to or restored to the level prior to sludge inoculation the acidogenic process of t acidophilus is core to this system the mechanism of which can be divided into two categories 1 sulfur oxidation produces sulfuric acid with reduced sulfur elements being oxidized to so4 2 after microbial metabolism achieving biological acid production 2 iron oxidation produces acid with t ferrooxidans oxidizing fe2 into fe3 then promoting fe3 so4 2 and oh to form schneider minerals leading to low ph conditions the reaction formula in eqs 4 and 5 show that ferrous ion oxidation consumes acid while fe ion precipitation produces acid 40 41 therefore promoting fe ion precipitation is of great significance to ensure acid production 4 4fe 2 o 2 4h 4fe 3 2h 2 o 5 8fe 3 xso 4 2 16 2x h 2 o fe 8 o 8 oh 8 2x so 4 x 24 2x h practical application experiments showed that the relative abundance and activity of leaching bacteria are dynamic during the process of bioleaching for the treatment of oily sludge therefore in follow up experiments and practical application changes in the microbial community structure and the performance of leaching bacteria should be monitored allowing the appropriate adjustment of external conditions to ensure the activity and relative abundance of leaching bacteria 4 application prospects in this study the process of oil containing sludge treatment in a sequence batch reaction system was designed using response surface methodology rsm assisted by microbial community screening and acclimation firstly oily wastewater is produced during all stages of the production process in the petrochemical industry with the treatment of oily wastewater producing a large amount of oily sludge the generated oily sludge is typically centrally stored and transferred to a sludge treatment unit for detoxification in the processing phase based on the principle of using water to treat mud the sludge is firstly added into the tank then aerated and stirred fig 5 a b in the process of treatment various indicators are monitored continually and oily substances on the surface are discharged to achieve effective resource utilization each indicator parameter for the treatment tank was close to the level observed prior to inoculation and therefore the treatment was considered to be complete and sludge discharge was carried out the discharged sludge can then be combined with biological thermal drying and other methods to achieve final disposal fig 5 c after sludge discharge a large volume of acidic bacterial solution remained in the treatment tank therefore adsorbents should be added to absorb free heavy metals prior to the next treatment cycle according to the treatment scenario fig 5 d meanwhile the leaching bacterial species should be diluted and expanded in preparation for the next cycle this model can minimize the amount of wastewater generated while also being easier to operate with smaller structural and space requirements this process only requires the addition of inorganic salts as a substrate with no additional carbon sources needed resulting in lower operational costs with the aim of synchronizing sludge reduction recycling and detoxification this method provides a novel approach for the biological advanced treatment of oily sludge as well as a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the recovery of oil based substances from oily sludge 5 conclusions these results show that acidithiobacillus can adapt to highly toxic oil pollution environments after domestication the main functional bacteria were identified as thiobacillus rhodococcus iron reducing bacteria and sulfur removing bacteria the optimal operational conditions for oily sludge treatment using bioleaching technology were as follows 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated gas water ratio of 14 53 the maximum efficiency of the system reached 50 while the heavy metal removal rate was 40 achieving a considerable removal level the use of bioleaching technology for the treatment of oily sludge has the advantages of simple operation good treatment effects and low environmental impact due to the avoidance of secondary pollution generation this indicates that the bioleaching technology is feasible and has good application prospects the results of this study

12789,the performance of bioleaching technology was studied for the demulsification oil content reduction and efficient removal of heavy metals from oily sludge a method was established for treating oily sludge from an oil refinery firstly bioleaching bacteria were enriched and acclimated the effects of substrate type feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o concentration and aeration conditions on treatment performance were investigated with response surface methodology used to optimize the treatment process finally the effects of operating parameters on heavy metal removal under continuous flow conditions were investigated results show that an optimal treatment effect was achieved when 5 00 g l feso4 7h2o and 5 64 g l na2s2o3 5h2o were used as substrates and the aeration ratio air water ratio was 14 53 l l under these conditions the oily sludge reduction rate was 51 76 and the oil removal rate was 57 67 the removal rates for pb hg and cu ranged between 40 and 70 with a stable total heavy metal reduction rate of 50 these results show that bioleaching technology is feasible for the treatment of oily sludge and heavy metal removal with good potential for practical application keywords oily sludge bioleaching technology sequential batch processing interspecific coordination mechanism process condition design data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction oily sludge is produced during petrochemical storage and the subsequent transportation and processing of oily sludge or its components and it is a complex and difficult process oily sludge contains a large number of petroleum hydrocarbons asphaltene and other oil substances along with a large number of chemicals heavy metals and other harmful components due to the large scale of industrial processes oily sludge outputs are typically large and present a significant hazard to the area surrounding the discharge site by 2019 the annual production of oily sludge in china had reached 12 million tons with a continually increasing environmental burden and negative ecological impact 1 to effectively achieve oil recovery from waste sludge the currently available sludge treatment technologies mainly rely on combinations of physical chemical and biological methods the most commonly applied method is organic solvent extraction with extraction requiring a large number of organic solvents resulting in a significant secondary pollution risk furthermore organic solvent extraction incurs high operational costs and can only achieve limited levels of recovery 2 chemical demulsification methods require large volumes of chemical surfactants which increase operational costs and present a secondary pollution risk while also reducing the quality of the recovered oil 3 4 chemical methods also include a variety of innovative approaches for example liquid dimethyl ether can be applied in low temperature and high pressure environments to remove water from oily sludge achieving a high water removal rate however the use of this method is limited by complicated reaction conditions the equipment and space requirements and high operational costs 5 the oily sludge treated by these chemical methods exhibits a reduced proportion of oil substances although its composition is more complex and heavy metal elements in sludge are not effectively extracted and separated biological methods for the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and other complex organic compounds mainly utilize functional microbial communities dozens of oil degrading bacteria can now be isolated from oil polluted environments 6 this group of microorganisms is represented by rhodococcus most of which can utilize oil substances as substrates microorganisms disrupt the oil water interface balance by secreting surfactants achieving effective contact with substrates 7 this kind of biological treatment has been shown to have a good performance for hydrocarbon compound removal but is not effective for the removal of heavy metals or other pollutants moreover the degradation of oil substances in oily sludge leads to a reduction in its calorific value which is not conducive to its subsequent treatment and utilization as a sustainable resource 8 9 in contrast bioleaching technology can simultaneously achieve heavy metal removal and oil acidification demulsification via a simple process therefore bioleaching technologies provide the benefits of more comprehensive treatment with improved treatment performance and environmental safety as compared to traditional chemical and biological methods bioleaching technology systems are often dominated by acidithiobacillus among which a ferrooxidans and a thiooxidans are the most widely used functional species with these chemoautotrophs existing widely in soils mine wastewater and acidic sewage 10 11 a thiooxidans utilizes reduced sulfur as a substrate producing sulfuric acid as the final product a ferrooxidans has both iron and sulfur oxidation systems allowing it to survive using ferrous ions and reduced sulfur as substrates generating fe ions and sulfuric acid as metabolites 12 13 at present the acidogenic characteristics and redox capacity of thiobacillus acidophilus have received extensive research attention bioleaching technology has been applied in biological mining 14 and waste circuit board treatment 15 realizing the efficient leaching and recovery of metal elements bioleaching technology has been widely used for environmental protection and solid waste treatment for example the use of bioleaching to treat surplus sludge generated by urban sewage treatment plants achieved good sludge reduction performance without any risk of secondary pollution 16 furthermore the treatment of hazardous landfill waste leachate using bioleaching technology was shown to effectively remove heavy metals 17 in summary the reported applications of bioleaching technology show that this approach can be used to effectively treat hazardous waste with broad application prospects in the field of solid waste treatment in particular however to date no studies on the treatment of oily sludge by bioleaching technology have been reported with no reports on the application of thiobacillus acidophilus in highly toxic environments therefore this study assessed the use of biological leaching technology for the treatment of oily sludge based on the concept of sequencing batch reactor sbr processes in sewage treatment bioleaching technology was innovatively combined with biological bacterial liquid circulation developing a sequencing batch intermittent reaction system for oily sludge treatment bioleaching bacteria from municipal sludge were enriched by culturing in growth medium and acclimated by the addition of oily sludge the sequencing batch reaction system was designed to treat actual oily sludge using the response surface method to optimize process conditions the optimized process was then applied under long term continuous flow conditions to study the operational stability of the process and determine its heavy metal removal performance furthermore molecular biological methods were used to identify the functional species in the bacterial community the aim of this study was to provide theoretical support for the practical application of this novel biological technology for the treatment of oily sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials microbial strains originated from the excess sludge generated by the qingdao municipal sewage treatment plant china the bacterial domestication process used the oily sludge produced in the biochemical tank and air flotation tank of the shouguang refinery the water oil solid ratio of the three phase system was 50 65 27 80 21 55 sludge contained the heavy metals pb hg cu and mn at concentrations mg kg of 557 62 14 79 852 5 and 21 21 while cd and cr were not detected 2 2 enrichment and domestication of bioleaching strains thiobacillus acidophilus was isolated from the municipal sewage treatment plant surplus sludge using iron salt inorganic 9k medium 18 enrichment cultures were maintained at 25 c in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml culture medium and inoculated with 20 g of excess sludge with continual agitation at 170 rpm cultures were maintained until the culture solution became red in color indicating complete substrate oxidation while the ph was monitored to verify the production of acid in each generation of enrichment the rate of substrate oxidation reduced and the enrichment culture ph decreased to 2 after 2 to 3 generations of enrichment 9k solid culture medium was used for the isolation of strains allowing the morphology of colonies to be observed brown color bacterial colonies were isolated and transferred to 9k liquid medium for cultivation with this process repeated several times until the iron oxidation rate of the solution of functional bacteria reached 15 g l d finally high purity thiobacillus ferrooxidans were obtained from the enrichment culture solution oily sludge was inoculated into the screened bacterial solution allowing the acclimation of bacteria using feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o as substrates with the change in system ph observed until it returned to the same level as prior to the first generation inoculation indicating the end of a generation the amount of oily sludge in each system was gradually increased until the strain was acclimated to a high concentration of oily sludge and its acid production capability was retained after 11 generations of culturing the acclimated bacteria were able to survive and maintain essential activities in high concentration oily sludge environments the maximum inoculation concentration was 20 g of oily sludge per 100 ml of bacterial solution at this time the bacterial solution was diluted to the required volume using 9k medium for use in subsequent experiments 2 3 reagents and detection methods the system ph and orp were measured using a phs 3 c ph meter inesa shanghai china cod was determined using a cod rapid tester 5b 3a tianer tianjin china polysaccharides were measured using an anthrone chromogenic spectrophotometric method dna was quantitatively detected using the diphenylamine colorimetric spectrophotometry assay fe2 was determined using the standard phenanthroline colorimetric spectrophotometry method 19 composition of 9k medium feso4 7h2o 50 0 g l nh4 2so4 3 0 g l cacl2 1 0 g l k2hpo4 0 5 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g l kcl 0 1 g l the relative proportions of each of the three phases of sludge were measured using the azeotropic distillation method with the aid of dean stark device measurements heavy metal elements were extracted using a heated hydrochloric acid hydrofluoric acid perchloric acid digestion system using the original sludge sample as a benchmark the oily sludge removal effect was measured after each processing cycle after digestion the icp method was used to detect and quantify heavy metal elements in the digested raw sludge samples 20 2 4 optimization of treatment process and conditions the process of oily sludge treatment using leaching bacteria was performed in taper bottles with an aerator beijing demr china providing intermittent aeration demr beijing china providing the air flow controlled using a rotor flowmeter chem dalian china furthermore a time switch was used to control the pump maintaining on off intervals of 10 5 min throughout each cycle of operation each treatment system was inoculated with 20 g of acclimated oily sludge and the substrate was added according to an orthogonal scheme designed using the response surface method each treatment group included duplicate systems operated in parallel the ph and orp in each treatment system were monitored every 24 h to indirectly characterize the state of the system at the start and end of the experimental period samples from each treatment system were subjected to azeotropic distillation to measure the proportions of sludge water oil and sand phases it is of note that at the end of each experimental period static precipitation was carried out for a 30 min period for extraction and filtration treatment with the extracted mud cake used for azeotropic distillation however at the start of the experimental period the oily sludge was viscous with low fluidity impeding its treatment by filtration therefore azeotropic distillation was carried out by direct sampling when the ph and orp of the system were close to the level observed prior to sludge inoculation the treatment period was considered to be complete a control system was also operated inoculated with tap water instead of the acclimated culture of functional bacteria while all other conditions and parameters were the same as for the experimental groups in this study software design expert v 8 0 was used to assist in the design of orthogonal experiments using three factors and three levels of multiple target responses allowing synchronous analysis of the effects of microorganisms substrate concentration and aeration ratio on the treatment performance based on the oil removal rate the dehydration efficiency was determined reflecting the overall treatment effect the influencing factors and levels are shown in table 1 2 5 heavy metal removal efficiency after the response surface method was completed the optimized process conditions were used and the systems were operated continuously for nine cycles in this process the detoxification of sludge was characterized by the removal efficiency of heavy metals from the treated sludge experimental reaction systems were the same as described for the optimization stage at the start of each cycle iron and sulfur salt substrates were added and intermittent aeration was initiated at the end of the cycle the mud and water mixture in each bottle was transferred to the separation funnel and after standing precipitation the treated sludge was discharged and the remaining liquid was returned to the treatment device with the loss in volume supplemented using distilled water subsequently the discharged oil sludge was analyzed every 24 h determining the system ph orp and the polysaccharide cod and fe2 concentrations allowing the microbial activity to be characterized accordingly 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis samples were collected before the domestication of functional strains was complete in order to characterize the screening performance in addition samples were taken after the acclimation period to characterize the changes in microbial community structure at the end of each treatment cycle samples were collected and retained with the group achieving the optimal treatment effect was selected for analysis at the end of every operational cycle allowing the stability of the community structure and the ideal functional community structure to be characterized the processes for dna extraction pcr amplification recovery and purification of target fragments were carried out according to previously reported methods 21 pcr amplification was performed using 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806 r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers for the v3 v4 variable region of the 16s rrna gene subsequently complete sequencing was performed via the illumina miseq pe 300 nova seq pe 250 platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 cultivation of leaching bacteria from oily sludge the purpose of microbial screening is to determine the target microbial population and its intended biochemical functions and to study its requirements to determine the appropriate culture conditions subsequently the bacteria were continuously subcultured until the expected level of function was achieved t acidophilus was screened and isolated from the surplus sludge generated by a municipal sewage treatment plant using 9k medium enrichment the 9k medium changed color from green to red with the oxidation of ferrous ions during the culture process this oxidation process is accompanied by a decrease in ph and the formation of schneider mineral precipitation as shown in eqs 1 and 2 after about 7 days of operation the ph reduced to about 2 0 22 23 after the cultures were diluted the screened strains were dark red and the liquid was turbid 1 4feso 4 2h 2 so 4 o 2 2fe 2 so 4 3 2h 2 o 2 3fe 2 so 4 3 11 h 2 o 2h 3 ofe 3 so 4 2 oh 6 8h 2 so 4 the ferrous oxidation rate of the functional microbes reached 15 g l d with the culture medium ph reducing from 5 5 to 2 0 within 72 h therefore it was determined that the screened bacterial culture was mainly composed of t ferrooxidans similarly the purpose of microbial domestication is to gradually add inhibitory substances under relatively suitable culture conditions so that microorganisms develop resistance in the iterative process the inhibitory substances serve as a target for treatment such as oils antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals after 11 generations of domestication the functional bacteria were able to survive in higher oily sludge concentrations and maintain acid production previous research has proven that t acidophilus can adapt to harsh living environment after domestication providing a novel direction for the utilization of t acidophilus at this time due to the low fe concentration in the system and the complex composition of oily sludge the bacterial suspension was brown and cloudy however the system maintained its acid producing function and was able to convert the neutral environment into an acidic environment therefore it was determined that the functional community at this time included both bioleaching bacteria and oil degrading bacteria 9k medium was then used to dilute the bacterial solution to the required volume in preparation for the response surface experiment 3 2 optimum process conditions the response surface method was designed using design expert software and the experimental results were analyzed to obtain linear regression equations the three dimensional response surface chart shows the influence of the interaction between the two variable factors on the target factor which was fixed at the central value the response surface diagram shows that the interaction between ferrous ion concentration and aeration ratio had a significant impact on the oil removal rate fig 1 a c while the interaction between sulfur and ferrous ion concentration had a significant impact on the dehydration efficiency fig 1 d f these results show that the total dewatering efficiency of sludge was closely related to the operational conditions applied based on the analysis of variance and response surface analysis a module in design expert software was used to search for the horizontal combination of optimization factors that simultaneously meet the criteria of each response and factor the desired target was selected based on the component with the highest total decrement efficiency and the variables of substrate concentration and aeration ratio variables were selected and maintained within the specified range the expected values of all input variables were as follows 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated air water ratio of 14 53 under these conditions the predicted total decrement efficiency was 51 44 in order to verify the obtained conditions a validation experiment was performed under the optimized conditions using parallel duplicate samples table 2 showing good agreement between the expected and predicted total decrement efficiency values and verifying the reliability of the experimental results 24 therefore the treatment of oily sludge by bioleaching technology with microbial acidification and redox could effectively demulsify oily sludge improving the classification of oil water and sludge phases while achieving the reduction and detoxification of oily sludge the optimal treatment conditions were determined as 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated air water ratio of 14 53 for aerobic bacteria in the culture medium the type and concentration of nutrients available are essential as well as sufficient dissolved oxygen levels according to the disposable cell theory higher amounts of nutrients are unbeneficial in addition excessive aeration can also inhibit microbial growth therefore these three factors were selected for analysis to determine the optimal working conditions 3 3 heavy metal removal efficiency and mechanism based on the results of response surface method optimization the continuous flow experiment was maintained for nine cycles over 63 days under continuous flow conditions to study the effect of continuous process operation on the removal of heavy metals fig 2 the oily sludge used in this study was found to contain four heavy metals pb hg cu and mn fig 2 a d shows the heavy metal content of oily sludge before and after 9 cycles of treatment as shown in fig 2 the oily sludge used in this study contained a large amount of cu and hg after bioleaching treatment the maximum removal rate of heavy metals reached 70 however after processing of cu the hg concentration remained 200 mg kg requiring further treatment prior to disposal such as the adsorption and neutralization of heavy metals in acidic waste liquid and the neutralization of sediment the mn and pb concentrations of untreated sludge were low with the corresponding concentrations reduced to 10 mg kg after treatment which meet the standard requirements for application on general construction land 25 fig 2 e shows the dynamic changes in the overall heavy metal removal efficiency and the treatment effect over 9 consecutive cycles the overall heavy metal removal rate initially decreased and then increased with continuous cycles of operation this phenomenon occurred due to the continuous operation process in which the increasing concentration of heavy metals in suspension had an inhibitory effect on microbial activity the removal rate recovery in later cycles occurred due to the adaptability of the microbial population after existing in a high heavy metal concentration environment allowing functional activity and survival rates to recover it is generally accepted that the forms of heavy metals in sludge and soil are complex and diverse according to the degree of dissolution difficulty heavy metals can be divided into seven states water soluble state md exchangeable state me carbonate bound state mc iron and manganese oxide state mfe mn organic bound state morg sulfide bound state ms and residual state mr 26 the mechanisms of heavy metal removal by bioleaching can be divided into direct and indirect mechanisms direct mechanisms include t thioxide either directly oxidizing heavy metals in the sulfide bound state and generating sulfuric acid or oxidizing reduced sulfur elements to generate sulfuric acid generating acidic conditions and dissolving different forms of heavy metals the indirect oxidation mechanism refers to the redox system of t ferrooxidans using divalent iron and metal sulfides which effectively leaches metal sulfides and generates sulfuric acid resulting in further leaching of various forms of heavy metals 27 28 due to the comprehensive action of microbial functions and activities complexed heavy metals in oily sludge are dissolved in cationic form achieving the removal of heavy metals from sludge firstly thiobacillus eosinophilus achieves the direct oxidation of heavy metals in a sulfide bound state resulting in the leaching of some heavy metals with the decrease in system ph various heavy metal forms are solubilized further promoting their dissolution the heavy metals contained in oily sludge continually dissolve during the treatment process resulting in the heavy metal concentration in solution gradually increasing after two or three cycles of operation the heavy metal concentration was excessively high which inhibits microbial activity and reduces the heavy metal removal rate 29 30 after several cycles of acclimation microbial function and activity improved as the community gradually adapts to high heavy metal concentrations in subsequent cycles the heavy metal removal rate gradually increased and the treatment effect recovered to a good level these experimental results show that after several generations of domestication t acidophilus can adapt to complex environments containing toxic substances therefore the related strains and methodologies have broad application prospects in the field of solid waste treatment 3 4 community analysis and interspecific synergy the microbial community structure was characterized by high throughput sequencing with the bacterial solutions before domestication after domestication and after response surface experiments used for high throughput sequencing analysis fig 3 prior to domestication the proportion of rhodococcus was 25 09 while acidithiobacillus accounted for nearly 67 96 of the community most of which were a ferrooxidans however at this time bacteria still maintained their acid production function after completion of the response surface experiment the microbial community structure exhibited significant changes forming a system in which multiple functional bacteria coexisted such as rhodococcus 7 87 bioleaching bacteria 22 57 alicyclobacillus 12 19 desulfurization bacteria 13 38 with the proportion of functional bacteria being 50 according to the analysis of experimental results the main functional strains were identified as 1 rhodococcus which are chemotrophic bacteria capable of degrading oily substances and producing biosurfactants achieving demulsification and oil removal 2 alicyclobacillus which are chemotrophic iron reducing bacteria capable of reducing fe ions to ferrous ions under low dissolved oxygen conditions with growth and reproduction occurring rapidly under high dissolved oxygen conditions 3 acidithiobacillus which are heterotrophic bacteria in terms of chemical energy using acid producing and redox functions to achieve sludge reduction detoxification and recycling of biochemical sludge 31 32 the sources of these bacteria are diverse and may exist in oily sludge or in the surplus sludge originally used for bacterial screening after oily sludge domestication these bacteria exhibited tolerance to oil substances and acidic environment it is of note that the proportion of bacteria dynamically changed highlighting the importance of condition control during the operational process 33 the high flux draw heat maps fig 3 help to intuitively understand microbial population expansion and dynamics firstly acidithiobacillus mutates itself enabling adaptation to environments containing oily substances and complex organics 34 secondly in the process of domestication a synergistic system composed of acidithiobacillus rhodococcus and other bacteria was formed ensuring smooth operation of the system through interspecific synergy 35 36 it can be observed from the heat map that the treatment process of oily sludge resulted in the formation of a new microbial population in this process the reaction conditions should be adjusted accordingly retaining the main functional bacteria as dominant species however it is not necessary to strictly control the number of microbial species within the population and the intermediate cooperative relationship between microorganisms should be rationally utilized in the continuous flow operational process the system ph orp and the concentration of cod fe2 and polysaccharides were monitored every 24 h allowing indirect characterization of the system based on changes in the indicators and microbial activity after 9 consecutive cycles of operation the conditions achieving the optimal comprehensive treatment effect and the highest degree of sludge reduction and detoxification were selected for high throughput sequencing and mechanism analysis fig 4 shows the response curves for various indicators in the third cycle of continuous operation at the beginning of the third cycle sludge was inoculated with the acidic bacterial suspension causing microbial activity and sludge viscosity to reduce gradually this was followed by the deconstruction and dispersion of aggregates causing the system to gradually release buffer materials chemicals phenol aromatic compounds and surfactants as a result the ph of the system increased and orp decreased fig 4 b e the cod value and polysaccharide content increased significantly fig 4 a c and the activity of t eosinophilus was inhibited 37 the data of various test indicators showed that cod was mainly provided by the oily material at the same time it was found that the cod value and polysaccharide content in the blank control group did not increase significantly indicating that the dissolution of viscous substances in oily sludge occurs under acidic conditions resulting in the rapid release of various types of emulsified oil and other substances 38 neutral distilled water was used to dissolve solidified matter but was unable to reduce the viscosity of oily sludge therefore at the end of the blank control experiment there remained large sludge masses which maintained a state of aggregation inhibiting the release of oil and organic matter into the system at this time oil degrading bacteria and other chemotrophic bacteria represented by rhodococcus were dominant effectively degrading dissolved organic matter the alicyclobacillus in the system can consume some organic matter and reduce certain fe ions to ferrous ions under the low dissolved oxygen conditions of the aeration suspension stage the bacterial fe reduction process produces acid as shown in eq 3 39 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 24 fe 3 24 h 2 o 6co 2 24 fe 2 18 h 2 o therefore the presence of bacteria can reduce the required dosage of fe salt and assist in acid production which is of great significance for the long term stable operation of the system this could also explain the increase in ferrous ion concentrations observed during one cycle in the middle of the reaction period inhibitory substance concentrations gradually decreased causing the activity of acidithiobacillus to gradually be restored the iron oxidation rate to gradually increase and the orp to increase gradually in the system as shown in fig 4 a d the cod value was significantly lower four to five days after the start of the experiment with the ferrous oxidation rate in this time period exhibiting a peak as the concentration of inhibitory substances is low enough to allow thiobacillus activity to rapidly recover and subsequently ferrous ions are oxidized completely in the later stage of the reaction dissolved organic matter in the system is almost completely degraded at which point thiobacillus activity is no longer inhibited and the remaining fe and sulfur substrates are rapidly and completely oxidized at this time the system ph was close to or restored to the level prior to sludge inoculation the acidogenic process of t acidophilus is core to this system the mechanism of which can be divided into two categories 1 sulfur oxidation produces sulfuric acid with reduced sulfur elements being oxidized to so4 2 after microbial metabolism achieving biological acid production 2 iron oxidation produces acid with t ferrooxidans oxidizing fe2 into fe3 then promoting fe3 so4 2 and oh to form schneider minerals leading to low ph conditions the reaction formula in eqs 4 and 5 show that ferrous ion oxidation consumes acid while fe ion precipitation produces acid 40 41 therefore promoting fe ion precipitation is of great significance to ensure acid production

dynamic during the process of bioleaching for the treatment of oily sludge therefore in follow up experiments and practical application changes in the microbial community structure and the performance of leaching bacteria should be monitored allowing the appropriate adjustment of external conditions to ensure the activity and relative abundance of leaching bacteria 4 application prospects in this study the process of oil containing sludge treatment in a sequence batch reaction system was designed using response surface methodology rsm assisted by microbial community screening and acclimation firstly oily wastewater is produced during all stages of the production process in the petrochemical industry with the treatment of oily wastewater producing a large amount of oily sludge the generated oily sludge is typically centrally stored and transferred to a sludge treatment unit for detoxification in the processing phase based on the principle of using water to treat mud the sludge is firstly added into the tank then aerated and stirred fig 5 a b in the process of treatment various indicators are monitored continually and oily substances on the surface are discharged to achieve effective resource utilization each indicator parameter for the treatment tank was close to the level observed prior to inoculation and therefore the treatment was considered to be complete and sludge discharge was carried out the discharged sludge can then be combined with biological thermal drying and other methods to achieve final disposal fig 5 c after sludge discharge a large volume of acidic bacterial solution remained in the treatment tank therefore adsorbents should be added to absorb free heavy metals prior to the next treatment cycle according to the treatment scenario fig 5 d meanwhile the leaching bacterial species should be diluted and expanded in preparation for the next cycle this model can minimize the amount of wastewater generated while also being easier to operate with smaller structural and space requirements this process only requires the addition of inorganic salts as a substrate with no additional carbon sources needed resulting in lower operational costs with the aim of synchronizing sludge reduction recycling and detoxification this method provides a novel approach for the biological advanced treatment of oily sludge as well as a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the recovery of oil based substances from oily sludge 5 conclusions these results show that acidithiobacillus can adapt to highly toxic oil pollution environments after domestication the main functional bacteria were identified as thiobacillus rhodococcus iron reducing bacteria and sulfur removing bacteria the optimal operational conditions for oily sludge treatment using bioleaching technology were as follows 5 00 g l na2s2o3 5h2o 5 64 g l feso4 7h2o and an aerated gas water ratio of 14 53 the maximum efficiency of the system reached 50 while the heavy metal removal rate was 40 achieving a considerable removal level the use of bioleaching technology for the treatment of oily sludge has the advantages of simple operation good treatment effects and low environmental impact due to the avoidance of secondary pollution generation this indicates that the bioleaching technology is feasible and has good application prospects the results of this study provide a novel perspective for the treatment of oily sludge and fill a gap in the requirements for industrial sludge treatment credit authorship contribution statement songjie li writing original
