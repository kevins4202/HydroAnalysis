13595,synergizing heterogeneous photocatalysis with strong oxidants is a simple and useful way towards the improvement of organic wastewater treatment this study verified that the synergies of tio2 and two oxidants k2cr2o7 cr vi and kmno4 mn vii can effectively improve the degradation of an azo dye acid orange 7 ao7 under simulated solar irradiation which is based on a combination of the oxidizing ability of oxidants and the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity meanwhile nearly 60 of toxic cr vi could be photocatalytically reduced into innocuous cr iii species being free from secondary contamination the measurements of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 by using electron spin resonance esr and fluorescence probe techniques indicated that the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant can be attributed to the facilitated separation of electron hole pairs and the increased utilization of electrons thus promoting overall oh formation analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms the intermediate product distributions of ao7 degradation were determined to further propose the possible degradation pathways through applying the quantification of oh reacted efficiency it was found that the oh reacted concentration shows a satisfactory linear correlation r 0 924 with ao7 degradation the oh reacted concentration was thereby adopted as an indicator parameter to further establish a stoichiometry of oh which can be used to quantitatively describe the occurring mechanisms and product formation characteristics during the photocatalytic degradation of ao7 this study provides an experimental approach for revealing the regularity of product formation in the wastewater treatment by various oh based advanced oxidation processes keywords photocatalytic degradation acid orange 7 hydroxyl radicals electron spin resonance intermediate products 1 introduction under the background of rapid industrialization and urbanization a large number of organic pollutants have been discharged into natural waters without proper treatment and disposal causing a serious threat to human health and entire ecosystem thereby the radical based advanced oxidation processes aops owing to the technical advantage of effectively destroying most organics to achieve the complete removal of organic pollutants have been well studied and developed 1 3 heterogeneous photocatalysis belongs to one of the aops and moreover tio2 is the most suitable and commonly applied photocatalyst due to its strong reactivity excellent chemical stability relative nontoxicity and superhydrophilicity 4 6 as broadly accepted the photogenerated valence holes and conduction electrons can be excitedly formed when tio2 particles are irradiated by a light whose energy is higher than its band gap energy a series of the redox reactions of hole and electron occurring on the surface of tio2 results in the formation of several reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 7 9 of different ros especially oh with higher redox potential of 2 8 v is directly responsible to the degradation of organic pollutants in photocatalytic process 10 unfortunately the traditional and unitary tio2 photocatalysis is not enough to meet the practical application needs because of its wide band gap and the massive electron hole recombination 11 in order to deeply dig up the application potentiality of heterogeneous photocatalysis various modification techniques including the ion doping the noble metal deposition and the semiconductor coupling have been adopted for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts 12 13 in contrast to the modification of photocatalysts adding strong oxidants like k2cr2o7 kmno4 h2o2 and s2o8 2 into the photocatalytic process is a simpler and more direct way 14 16 the existence of oxidants can act as electron trappers to decrease the probability of the recombination of electron hole pairs thus availing more free holes for the oxidation of oh or h2o 17 in the meantime the oxidants via their own oxidizing abilities also can synergize with photocatalysis to form a combination treatment of organic pollutants as previously mentioned there have been many investigations into the improvement of organic pollutant degradation through the synergy of tio2 photocatalysis and oxidants nevertheless the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of ros formation in the synergistic process of tio2 oxidant are hardly studied as a consequence the understanding of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant based on the view point of ros formation still remains a subject of debate furthermore the identification of intermediate products and the determination of degradation mechanisms are regarded as important issues in the field of aops for organic pollutant treatment 18 however it is well known that the nonselective oxidizability of oh easily leads to the degradation process of organic pollutants with a characteristic of the rich diversity and high complexity of intermediate products hence the regularity of product formation cannot be accurately grasped our previous works 19 20 have proposed a concept of oh reacted efficiency that can estimate the time varying oh concentrations reacting with an azo dye acid orange 7 ao7 and its degradation products according to the estimates the stoichiometries of oh corresponding to the degradation mechanisms of ao7 during fenton and fe doped tio2 photocatalysis processes have been tentatively quantified for further clarification of the relationship between product formation and oh attack in order to deepen the mechanistic understandings of the synergetic process of tio2 oxidant and its application for organic degradation this present work investigated the effects of two oxidants k2cr2o7 and kmno4 abbreviated to cr vi and mn vii on the tio2 assisted photocatalytic degradation of ao7 under simulated solar irradiation the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic mechanisms of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii were discussed based on the qualitative and quantitative measurements of ros formation by using the electron spin resonance esr and fluorescence probe techniques the identification of the products of ao7 degradation was carried out by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis and combined with the quantification of oh reacted efficiency applying to bring insights into the potential regularity of product formation during the photocatalytic degradation process 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals a commercial tio2 evonik aeroxide p25 containing approximately 80 anatase and 20 rutile was used as the subject investigated two oxidants cr vi and mn vii were obtained from hayashi pure chemical ind ltd osaka japan and katayama chemical ind co ltd osaka japan respectively the target pollutant azo dye ao7 c16h11n2nao4s λmax 485 nm was purchased from panreac co barcelona spain 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and coumarin using as radical trappers in the ros measurement were obtained from sigma aldrich co shanghai china and alfa aesar co ltd lancashire united kingdom respectively 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments and analyses the photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in a 200 ml pyrex erlenmeyer flask under simulated solar irradiation using three solar led lamps each of 30 w as the light source a wide wavelength ranging from 380 nm to 780 nm for each experiment 200 ml aqueous tio2 suspension 0 5 g l containing 100 μm ao7 was prepared as the reaction solution the reaction solution was adjusted to ph 3 0 and stirred for 30 min in dark for the adsorption desorption equilibrium denoted as 0 h prior to irradiation a certain amount of oxidant final concentration at 100 μm was added into the reaction solution after established time intervals 0 5 1 2 4 and 6 h 5 ml sample was extracted from the reaction solution and filtered through the microfiber filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of reaction systems for the decolorization and mineralization of ao7 the subsequent changes in absorbance at 485 nm and total organic carbon toc were determined by using a spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 20 and a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l csh respectively the intermediate products of ao7 degradation were identified by lc ms analysis dionex ultimate 3000 and bruker amazon sl applying the equipment parameters that were used in our previous work 19 2 3 measurement of ros formation for each esr analysis the tio2 particles and oxidant were mixed with 20 ml deionized water or methanol depending on the measured target ros oh or o2 after adding dmpo 0 02 mm the mixture was immediately analyzed by esr analyzer bruker emx 10 12 to detect the signal characteristic of dmpo oh or dmpo o2 adduct on the other hand in the fluorescence analysis the tio2 suspension 0 5 g l was prepared in coumarin solution with the initial concentration of 10 2 m by employing a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 4500 at the excitation of 332 nm the fluorescence emission spectrum of 7 hydroxycoumarin 7hc that is produced from the reaction of oh with coumarin was measured the obtained fluorescence intensity of 7hc was converted to the corresponding concentration of 7hc c7hc through a predetermined calibration curve and then the formation of oh could be quantified by its mathematical relation to c7hc as eq 1 the approach for quantifying the oh reacted efficiency and the corresponding concentration of oh reacting with organics coh reacted has been described in detail elsewhere 20 1 coh formed 2 0 29 0 0642 c7hc where the numerical values of 2 0 29 and 0 0642 represent the mole ratio of oh and coumarin for producing hydroxylated species the yield ratio of 7hc to all hydroxylated species and the oh trapping efficiency of coumarin respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant for ao7 degradation in order to verify the synergetic effect of oxidants on the tio2 assisted photocatalysis under simulated solar irradiation the photocatalytic activities of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii for ao7 degradation were evaluated and primarily compared with tio2 alone and oxidant alone as shown in fig 1 a in the absence of tio2 photocatalyst only slight ao7 degradation was observed and the decolorization efficiencies after 6 h reaction time reached about 16 and 37 by cr vi and mn vii respectively with their own oxidizing abilities the efficiencies of ao7 decolorization photocatalyzed by tio2 alone under simulated solar and uv 254 nm irradiation for 6 h reached about 32 and 48 respectively the difference of decolorization efficiency between different light sources indicates the fact that traditional tio2 could not effectively absorb incident visible irradiation because of its wide band gap however in the presence of both tio2 and oxidant a significant improvement in the degradation of ao7 could be achieved after 6 h irradiation time the efficiencies of ao7 decolorization by tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii rose to 57 and 71 respectively several reports have suggested the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants in heterogeneous photocatalysis follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics 21 22 as shown in fig 1b the reaction rate constants of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii were calculated as 0 132 and 0 191 h 1 which are approximately 1 55 and 1 48 fold higher than the sum of the rate constants of tio2 alone and oxidant alone besides the improvement of ao7 decolorization the mineralization of ao7 also could be synergistically enhanced by tio2 oxidant process although the oxidizing abilities of cr vi and mn vii were not strong enough to mineralize ao7 molecules see fig 2 a here the incomplete mineralization of ao7 means that various intermediates were probably produced in the degradation process in addition some studies have indicated that cr vi may act as the trapper of electrons which leads to the reduction of toxic cr vi to innocuous cr iii being substantially free from secondary contamination 23 24 the reduction of cr vi was estimated based on the ratio of residual cr vi after photocatalytic experiment to initial total cr ions which were obtained by using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer respectively 25 as shown in fig 2b in the absence of tio2 photocatalyst no cr vi reduction was observed while nearly 60 of cr vi could be reduced by trapping photogenerated electrons in the process of tio2 cr vi through the above results it is practically verified that the existence of oxidants cr vi and mn vii can synergize with tio2 photocatalysis via their own oxidizing abilities and in the meantime effectively facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs to enhance photocatalytic activity thus improving the degradation of ao7 under simulated solar irradiation 3 2 mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity to further clarify the mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant the esr spectra of tio2 tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii were measured for understanding the variation of ros formation in the processes as shown in fig 3 a a strong signal of dmpo oh consisting of a characteristic quartet peak with intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed by tio2 alone under uv irradiation suggesting that oh is the major active species in contrast tio2 exhibited a relatively weaker signal of dmpo oh under simulated solar irradiation which is consistent with its poor photocatalytic performance for ao7 degradation the signal of dmpo oh was not observed in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii instead the typical signal of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide n oxyl dmpox having an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was detected this is due to that the synergy of tio2 oxidant could efficiently increase the formation of oh resulting in that dmpo was rapidly and directly overoxidized to dmpox 26 fig 3b shows the measurement results of oh formation using coumarin as the oh trapper and the contribution order of different processes to the oh formation is similar to the esr observations but further gives quantitative information the oh formed concentrations of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii reached approximately 54 3 μm and 67 6 μm respectively which are much higher than that of tio2 alone 26 7 μm in general the oxidation of h2o or oh by holes and the reduction of dissolved o2 by electrons are supposed to be the major pathways of oh formation in the photocatalytic process according to this mechanistic viewpoint it can be deduced that only the hole induced oxidation of h2o or oh is capable of producing oh in the absence of dissolved o2 27 thus the difference of oh formation measured between aerobic and anaerobic conditions is equivalent to a contribution from the electron induced reduction of dissolved o2 by considering this the esr spectra before and after removing dissolved o2 with the injection of nitrogen gas were compared as shown in fig 4 a all the esr intensities tended to decrease in varying degrees illustrating the less oh formation due to a lack of the electron induced reduction of dissolved o2 however it is noteworthy that a more significant decreasing trend was observed by tio2 alone as compared with those in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii this phenomenon implies that the oxidants cr vi and mn vii not only trap photogenerated electrons to suppress the electron hole recombination but also can play a role like dissolved o2 to steadily tend the formation of oh through their reduction reactions with the photogenerated electrons in this connection our previous studies have preliminarily inferred the reaction proceedings that cr vi and mn vii are reduced into lower valence species by trapping electrons and simultaneously oh may be formed in the reduction processes as eqs 2 and 3 28 here the esr spectroscopic results provided a more precise empirical evidence to support the mechanistic inference for the synergistic formation of oh in the tio2 oxidant process in order to prove the effectiveness of oxidants as electron trappers the esr spectra for the formation of o2 were measured in the methanol media as shown in fig 4b an obvious signal of dmpo o2 with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 was observed by tio2 alone in contrast the dmpo o2 signals in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii exhibited poor noise to signal ratio indicating that the oxidants can effectively trap photogenerated electrons thus reducing the o2 formation based on the above results the mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant was proposed fig 5 which can be mainly attributed to the facilitated separation of electron hole pairs and a more efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons resulting in the enhancement of overall oh formation 2 2cr2o7 2 5e 14h 4cr3 7oh 7 oh 3 2mno4 6e 8h 2mn2 4oh 4 oh 3 3 product formation and pathways of ao7 degradation according to the results of product identification by using lc ms analysis a total of 12 products were identified from the processes of ao7 degradation photocatalyzed by tio2 tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii under simulated solar irradiation the detailed information of 12 degradation products including the given m z value chemical name formula and organic structure is summarized in supplementary data table s1 by considering the organic structural changes of the identified products the possible pathways of the photocatalytic degradation of ao7 can be determined as shown in fig 6 owing to most of the products containing a single bond of nn the cleavage of azo double bond nn through the addition reaction of h atoms was thought as the initiation mechanism of ao7 degradation consequently producing the earliest product with m z 331 0 this is slightly different from the symmetrical cleavage of nn bond reported by previous studies 29 because the crucial products sulfanilic acid and 1 amino 2 naphthol were not detected in this study 30 afterwards three products with m z 391 3 293 0 and 264 9 were detected in all of the processes which represent subsequent degradation mechanisms such as the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation respectively the hydroxylated products with m z 391 3 and 360 8 were produced because of the substitution reaction of hydroxyl groups occurring on the benzene ring and naphthalene ring similar hydroxylated intermediates have also been observed in the photocatalytic degradation of some azo dyes 18 31 it is well known that the ring opening is an important route for the oh initiated oxidative decomposition of cyclic organic compounds with different degrees of ring opening the naphthalene ring on the products containing nn bond underwent partial oxidation to form a subset of products having m z 352 3 312 8 293 0 and 279 1 and complete oxidation to form the product with m z 301 1 the product with m z 264 9 was formed after desulfonation which is caused by oh that attacks the cn bond linked to the benzene ring then underwent deamination and ring opening to form several small molecular products with m z 191 7 174 7 and 147 0 as previously reported 32 33 some smaller molecular intermediates like phthalic aliphatic and aromatic acids may be formed when the product with m z 174 7 further degrades but these smaller intermediates were not found in this study the identified products in species and structure might differ from related literature due to the different treatment technologies and identification methods according to the characteristics of the identified products the process of ao7 degradation still can be divided into four main reaction mechanisms including the nn bond cleavage the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation which is roughly in agreement with most of the literature table s2 shows the time varying product distributions of ao7 degradation with different photocatalytic processes it is clear that there were great differences in the number and species of degradation products in the presence of oxidants the diversity and complexity of product formation increased significantly and in the meantime the yielding of small molecular products became more favorable during the period of ao7 degradation this seems to demonstrate that the reaction sequence of degradation mechanisms varied with different photocatalytic processes and the reason for this phenomenon is probably because of the disparities of oh formation and oh reacted efficiency 3 4 stoichiometry of oh for ao7 degradation process for further understanding the relationship between the oh initiated degradation process and the corresponding characteristic of product formation the time varying concentrations of oh reacting with ao7 and its degradation products in each photocatalytic process were first calculated based on the quantification of oh reacted efficiency the calculated results and relevant data required for calculation are listed in table s3 as shown in in fig 7 a the changing trends of oh reacted efficiency of different photocatalytic processes were quite similar the efficiency values were lower about 50 65 in earlier period and gradually increased to 75 85 probably because there were larger formations of oh with the extension of irradiation time which can provide more opportunities to react with organics furthermore using the data form table s3 the oh formed and oh reacted concentrations were plotted as functions of the ao7 mineralization efficiency as shown in fig 7b through linear regression analysis it can be seen that there was a highly positive correlation between the oh formed concentrations and mineralization efficiencies with the correlation coefficient r of 0 878 indicating oh is the most important species responsible for degrading ao7 34 nevertheless a more satisfactory correlation r 0 924 was found in the dependence of ao7 mineralization on the oh reacted concentration by this study the adequacy of the oh reacted concentration as an indicator parameter for resolving the complex mechanisms of organic degradation process was thereby confirmed only about 7 6 of variation could not be explained probably due to the oxidizing abilities of oxidants theirself or the other unexplained elements in the photocatalytic process by combining the time varying oh reacted concentrations and the corresponding product distributions a stoichiometry of oh to describe the degradation process of ao7 was established as shown in fig 8 while the reacted oh reached 4 8 μm the cleavage of nn bond was successfully proceeded to form a large number of the subsequent products with nn bond it should be noted that the reacted oh of 4 8 μm was the minimum measurable concentration obtained in this study implying that the actual demand may be lower during the period of rising to the reacted oh of 8 7 μm the multiple mechanisms like the hydroxylation the partial oxidation of naphthalene ring and the desulfonation occurred almost in parallel afterwards the desulfonated products were subject to deamination when the reacted oh reached 13 3 μm and the complete oxidation of naphthalene ring could be implemented as the reacted oh approached 26 μm the hydroxylated products in particular were frequently appeared in a wide range of the reacted oh from 4 8 μm to 26 μm on the basics of the above quantitative descriptions the occurring sequence of reaction mechanisms and the characteristics of product formation during the photocatalytic degradation process of ao7 can thereby be better understood and predicted besides the oh stoichiometry for ao7 degradation established in this study was compared with those reported by previous works see table 1 although the edge concentrations of the reacted oh for each degradation mechanism slightly varied with different treatments there was a remarkable consistency which can be observed this is equivalent to confirming the wide applicability of the approach of quantifying oh reacted efficiency and concentration for the determination of product formation regularity in the organic wastewater treatment by various oh based aops 4 conclusions in summary tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii exhibited the excellent performances for the degradation of ao7 under simulated solar irradiation as compared to tio2 or either of oxidants alone which is due to a joint contribution of the oxidizing ability of oxidants and the enhanced photocatalytic activity in addition toxic cr vi could be transformed into innocuous cr iii species via photocatalytic reduction achieving the simultaneous treatment of harmful metal ions and organic pollutants from aquatic environment as proved by the measurements of ros the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant was attributed to that the existence of oxidants as electron trappers can not only facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs but also increase the utilization of electrons thus resulting in a positive promoting effect on the formation of oh the results of lc ms analysis indicated that the diversity and complexity of the degradation product distributions are significantly increased and simultaneously the formation of small molecular products became more easily achieved by the synergistic process of tio2 oxidant with its enhancement of photocatalytic activity the proposed pathways of ao7 degradation belonged to a multi stage and multi reaction process which is composed of four main mechanisms including the nn bond cleavage the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation the established stoichiometry of oh that is based on the quantification of oh reacted efficiency could accurately describe the degradation process of ao7 the development and application of oh reacted efficiency would provide means for promoting the understanding of the variation regularity of product formation during the

synergetic effect of oxidants on the tio2 assisted photocatalysis under simulated solar irradiation the photocatalytic activities of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii for ao7 degradation were evaluated and primarily compared with tio2 alone and oxidant alone as shown in fig 1 a in the absence of tio2 photocatalyst only slight ao7 degradation was observed and the decolorization efficiencies after 6 h reaction time reached about 16 and 37 by cr vi and mn vii respectively with their own oxidizing abilities the efficiencies of ao7 decolorization photocatalyzed by tio2 alone under simulated solar and uv 254 nm irradiation for 6 h reached about 32 and 48 respectively the difference of decolorization efficiency between different light sources indicates the fact that traditional tio2 could not effectively absorb incident visible irradiation because of its wide band gap however in the presence of both tio2 and oxidant a significant improvement in the degradation of ao7 could be achieved after 6 h irradiation time the efficiencies of ao7 decolorization by tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii rose to 57 and 71 respectively several reports have suggested the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants in heterogeneous photocatalysis follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics 21 22 as shown in fig 1b the reaction rate constants of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii were calculated as 0 132 and 0 191 h 1 which are approximately 1 55 and 1 48 fold higher than the sum of the rate constants of tio2 alone and oxidant alone besides the improvement of ao7 decolorization the mineralization of ao7 also could be synergistically enhanced by tio2 oxidant process although the oxidizing abilities of cr vi and mn vii were not strong enough to mineralize ao7 molecules see fig 2 a here the incomplete mineralization of ao7 means that various intermediates were probably produced in the degradation process in addition some studies have indicated that cr vi may act as the trapper of electrons which leads to the reduction of toxic cr vi to innocuous cr iii being substantially free from secondary contamination 23 24 the reduction of cr vi was estimated based on the ratio of residual cr vi after

facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs to enhance photocatalytic activity thus improving the degradation of ao7 under simulated solar irradiation 3 2 mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity to further clarify the mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant the esr spectra of tio2 tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii were measured for understanding the variation of ros formation in the processes as shown in fig 3 a a strong signal of dmpo oh consisting of a characteristic quartet peak with intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed by tio2 alone under uv irradiation suggesting that oh is the major active species in contrast tio2 exhibited a relatively weaker signal of dmpo oh under simulated solar irradiation which is consistent with its poor photocatalytic performance for ao7 degradation the signal of dmpo oh was not observed in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii instead the typical signal of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide n oxyl dmpox having an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was detected this is due to that the synergy of tio2 oxidant could efficiently increase the formation of oh resulting in that dmpo was rapidly and directly overoxidized to dmpox 26 fig 3b shows the measurement results of oh formation using coumarin as the oh trapper and the contribution order of different processes to the oh formation is similar to the esr observations but further gives quantitative information the oh formed concentrations of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii reached approximately 54 3 μm and 67 6 μm respectively which are much higher than that of tio2 alone 26 7 μm in general the oxidation of h2o or oh by holes and the reduction of dissolved o2 by electrons are supposed to be the major pathways of oh formation in the photocatalytic process according to this mechanistic viewpoint it can be deduced that only the hole induced oxidation of h2o or oh is capable of producing oh in the absence of dissolved o2 27 thus the difference of oh formation measured between aerobic and anaerobic conditions is equivalent to a contribution from the electron induced reduction of dissolved o2 by considering this the esr spectra before and after removing dissolved o2 with the injection of nitrogen gas were compared as shown in fig 4 a all the esr intensities tended to decrease in varying degrees illustrating the less oh formation due to a lack of the electron induced reduction of dissolved o2 however it is noteworthy that a more significant decreasing trend was observed by tio2 alone as compared with those in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii this phenomenon implies that the oxidants cr vi and mn vii not only trap photogenerated electrons to suppress the electron hole recombination but also can play a role like dissolved o2 to steadily tend the formation of oh through their reduction reactions with the photogenerated electrons in this connection our previous studies have preliminarily inferred the reaction proceedings that cr vi and mn vii are reduced into lower valence species by trapping electrons and simultaneously oh may be formed in the reduction processes as eqs 2 and 3 28 here the esr spectroscopic results provided a more precise empirical evidence to support the mechanistic inference for the synergistic formation of oh in the tio2 oxidant process in order to prove the effectiveness of oxidants as electron trappers the esr spectra for the formation of o2 were measured in the methanol media as shown in fig 4b an obvious signal of dmpo o2 with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 was observed by tio2 alone in contrast the dmpo o2 signals in the processes of tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii exhibited poor noise to signal ratio indicating that the oxidants can effectively trap photogenerated electrons thus reducing the o2 formation based on the above results the mechanism of the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant was proposed fig 5 which can be mainly attributed to the facilitated separation of electron hole pairs and a more efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons resulting in the enhancement of overall oh formation 2 2cr2o7 2 5e 14h 4cr3 7oh 7 oh 3 2mno4 6e 8h 2mn2 4oh 4 oh 3 3 product formation and pathways of ao7 degradation according to the results of product identification by using lc ms analysis a total of 12 products were identified from the processes of ao7 degradation photocatalyzed by tio2 tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii under simulated solar irradiation the detailed information of 12 degradation products including the given m z value chemical name formula and organic structure is summarized in supplementary data table s1 by considering the organic structural changes of the identified products the possible pathways of the photocatalytic degradation of ao7 can be determined as shown in fig 6 owing to most of the products containing a single bond of nn the cleavage of azo double bond nn through the addition reaction of h atoms was thought as the initiation mechanism of ao7 degradation consequently producing the earliest product with m z 331 0 this is slightly different from the symmetrical cleavage of nn bond reported by previous studies 29 because the crucial products sulfanilic acid and 1 amino 2 naphthol were not detected in this study 30 afterwards three products with m z 391 3 293 0 and 264 9 were detected in all of the processes which represent subsequent degradation mechanisms such as the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation respectively the hydroxylated products with m z 391 3 and 360 8 were produced because of the substitution reaction of hydroxyl groups occurring on the benzene ring and naphthalene ring similar hydroxylated intermediates have also been observed in the photocatalytic degradation of some azo dyes 18 31 it is well known that the ring opening is an important route for the oh initiated oxidative decomposition of cyclic organic compounds with different degrees of ring opening the naphthalene ring on the products containing nn bond underwent partial oxidation to form a subset of products having m z 352 3 312 8 293 0 and 279 1 and complete oxidation to form the product with m z 301 1 the product with m z 264 9 was formed after desulfonation which is caused by oh that attacks the cn bond linked to the benzene ring then underwent deamination and ring opening to form several small molecular products with m z 191 7 174 7 and 147 0 as previously reported 32 33 some smaller molecular intermediates like phthalic aliphatic and aromatic acids may be formed when the product with m z 174 7 further degrades but these smaller intermediates were not found in this study the identified products in species and structure might differ from related literature due to the different treatment technologies and identification methods according to the characteristics of the identified products the process of ao7 degradation still can be divided into four main reaction mechanisms including the nn bond cleavage the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation which is roughly in agreement with most of the literature table s2 shows the time varying product distributions of ao7 degradation with different photocatalytic processes it is clear that there were great differences in the number and species of degradation products in the presence of oxidants the diversity and complexity of product formation increased significantly and in the meantime the yielding of small molecular products became more favorable during the period of ao7 degradation this seems to demonstrate that the reaction sequence of degradation mechanisms varied with different photocatalytic processes and the reason for this phenomenon is probably because of the disparities of oh formation and oh reacted efficiency 3 4 stoichiometry of oh for ao7 degradation process for further understanding the relationship between the oh initiated degradation process and the corresponding characteristic of product formation the time varying concentrations of oh reacting with ao7 and its degradation products in each photocatalytic process were first calculated based on the quantification of oh reacted efficiency the calculated results and relevant data required for calculation are listed in table s3 as shown in in fig 7 a the changing trends of oh reacted efficiency of different photocatalytic processes were quite similar the efficiency values were lower about 50 65 in earlier period and gradually increased to 75 85 probably because there were larger formations of oh with the extension of irradiation time which can provide more opportunities to react with organics furthermore using the data form table s3 the oh formed and oh reacted concentrations were plotted as functions of the ao7 mineralization efficiency as shown in fig 7b through linear regression analysis it can be seen that there was a highly positive correlation between the oh formed concentrations and mineralization efficiencies with the correlation coefficient r of 0 878 indicating oh is the most important species responsible for degrading ao7 34 nevertheless a more satisfactory correlation r 0 924 was found in the dependence of ao7 mineralization on the oh reacted concentration by this study the adequacy of the oh reacted concentration as an indicator parameter for resolving the complex mechanisms of organic degradation process was thereby confirmed only about 7 6 of variation could not be explained probably due to the oxidizing abilities of oxidants theirself or the other unexplained elements in the photocatalytic process by combining the time varying oh reacted concentrations and the corresponding product distributions a stoichiometry of oh to describe the degradation process of ao7 was established as shown in fig 8 while the reacted oh reached 4 8 μm the cleavage of nn bond was successfully proceeded to form a large number of the subsequent products with nn bond it should be noted that the reacted oh of 4 8 μm was the minimum measurable concentration obtained in this study implying that the actual demand may be lower during the period of rising to the reacted oh of 8 7 μm the multiple mechanisms like the hydroxylation the partial oxidation of naphthalene ring and the desulfonation occurred almost in parallel afterwards the desulfonated products were subject to deamination when the reacted oh reached 13 3 μm and the complete oxidation of naphthalene ring could be implemented as the reacted oh approached 26 μm the hydroxylated products in particular were frequently appeared in a wide range of the reacted oh from 4 8 μm to 26 μm on the basics of the above quantitative descriptions the occurring sequence of reaction mechanisms and the characteristics of product formation during the photocatalytic degradation process of ao7 can thereby be better understood and predicted besides the oh stoichiometry for ao7 degradation established in this study was compared with those reported by previous works see table 1 although the edge concentrations of the reacted oh for each degradation mechanism slightly varied with different treatments there was a remarkable consistency which can be observed this is equivalent to confirming the wide applicability of the approach of quantifying oh reacted efficiency and concentration for the determination of product formation regularity in the organic wastewater treatment by various oh based aops 4 conclusions in summary tio2 cr vi and tio2 mn vii exhibited the excellent performances for the degradation of ao7 under simulated solar irradiation as compared to tio2 or either of oxidants alone which is due to a joint contribution of the oxidizing ability of oxidants and the enhanced photocatalytic activity in addition toxic cr vi could be transformed into innocuous cr iii species via photocatalytic reduction achieving the simultaneous treatment of harmful metal ions and organic pollutants from aquatic environment as proved by the measurements of ros the enhanced synergistic photocatalytic activity of tio2 oxidant was attributed to that the existence of oxidants as electron trappers can not only facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs but also increase the utilization of electrons thus resulting in a positive promoting effect on the formation of oh the results of lc ms analysis indicated that the diversity and complexity of the degradation product distributions are significantly increased and simultaneously the formation of small molecular products became more easily achieved by the synergistic process of tio2 oxidant with its enhancement of photocatalytic activity the proposed pathways of ao7 degradation belonged to a multi stage and multi reaction process which is composed of four main mechanisms including the nn bond cleavage the hydroxylation the naphthalene oxidation and the desulfonation the established stoichiometry of oh that is based on the quantification of oh reacted efficiency could accurately describe the degradation process of ao7 the development and application of oh reacted efficiency would provide means for promoting the understanding of the variation regularity of product formation during the

13596,polysilicic acid ferric and zinc sulfate containing boron psbfz flocculants were prepared through reaction of sodium silicate ferric trichloride zinc sulfate and sodium tetraborate a new type of magnetic flocculant psbfz fe3o4 was prepared through a simple method of solid state reaction at room temperature the as prepared psbfz and magnetic psbfz fe3o4 were used in treating water based ink wastewater the influence parameters such as dosage time ph and temperature on the removal rate of decolorization turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod were investigated the results showed the products were suitable for neutral and basic water when the dosage of psbfz fe3o4 was 0 3 g l the turbidity removal rate and the decolorization rate could reach 98 0 and 98 5 at room temperature respectively through recycling by a magnet the magnetic psbfz fe3o4 flocculants residues could be easily separated from the wastewater which makes the reusing of magnetic flocculants become possible keywords psbfz fe3o4 ink wastewater magnetic separation secondary utilization 1 introduction in recent years with the improvement of environmental awareness and the rising price of crude oil the production of ink has gradually turned from oil based ink to water based ink 1 the discharge of water based ink wastewater is increasing currently therefore the research and production of water based ink have been greatly developed how to deal with the large amount of water based ink wastewater is a realistic problem to be solved the ink is mainly composed of color carrier usually some resin compounds containing hydrophilic groups etc pigments fillers auxiliaries and solvents 2 the ink wastewater mainly comes from the production of ink and industrial wastewater generated by the printing and dyeing industry it has high cod several hundred mg l or even tens of thousands mg l chromaticity hundreds or even more than 100 000 times turbidity a large number of micro soluble or insoluble particles makes the ink wastewater poor transmittance with high turbidity and poor degradability the presence of macromolecular color carriers such as resins makes it difficult to degrade which could cause a great harm to the environment 3 5 the above characteristics increase the challenge for treatment of ink wastewater the treatment methods of water based ink wastewater could be divided into three categories according to the principle chemical methods physical methods and biological methods however in order to obtain the best treatment effect a variety of methods were often used with a combination in the actual sewage treatment at present the main treatment process of industrial wastewater usually contains three steps firstly pretreatment such as air flotation 6 acidification coagulation flocculation 7 etc removing small suspended particles in water cutting off the carbon chains of organic molecules in wastewater making them shorter chains which are convenient for subsequent treatment secondly chemical and biochemical treatment such as fenton oxidation 8 activated sludge process 9 reducing the cod of wastewater finally post treatment such as membrane permeation 10 filtering out difficult to degrade substances in wastewater to make it meet national discharge standard as a kind of main industrial wastewater to treat ink wastewater is similar to these three steps flocculation is a widely used method in wastewater pretreatment at present due to having a simpler process and a lower cost it is also suitable for the treatment of water based ink wastewater 11 13 as a large class of flocculant polysilicate flocculants are widely concerned by scholars in the field of water treatment because of their simple synthesis fast results and low cost especially in recent years many metal ions were compounded into activated silicic acid such as fe3 14 15 zn2 16 al3 17 ti2 18 mg2 19 and so on aluminum and iron are firstly introduced into the activated silicic acid to prepare polysilicate based flocculant containing single metal 20 due to the potential toxicity of aluminum based flocculants 21 the demand for aluminum based flocculants is decreasing then titanium tetrachloride 22 and titanium oxysulfate 23 were used as flocculants with the further research bimetallic and multi metallic ions are introduced into polysilicate the multi metallic metal ions composite flocculant includes the advantages of different single metal characteristics and achieves better treatment effect 24 26 recently zinc composite coagulants especially the poly silicate ferric zinc flocculant 27 have received much attention in wastewater treatment for their non toxicity and properties of charge neutralization and bridge aggregation at the same time boron is introduced to the preparation of polysilicate flocculant which can complex with hydroxyl forming b o si bond inhibiting the auto agglutination of hydroxyl among silicic acid molecules to improve its stability 28 not only the stability of the polysilicate flocculants has been improved but also the applications in treatment of various types of sewage have been achieved the above various scientific research achievements have promoted the research and application of polysilicate flocculants making various polysilicate flocculants widely appeared in the field of sewage treatment however the treatment of sewage with flocculants is still in the one use stage that is more attention is paid to the effect of water treatment but the flocculation waste residues with high concentration of pollutants are ignored because of its low density high water content and easy dispersion flocculating waste residues are difficult to separate from water when it remains in the bottom of the water it will cause secondary pollution magnetic recovery of materials is a general and simple separation means 29 31 it is feasible to separate the flocculating waste residues from water by a magnet which makes the recycling and reusing of magnetic flocculants become possible 32 33 in this paper magnetic psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants were prepared through a simple method of combing psbfz with fe3o4 at room temperature after being compounded with fe3o4 the psbfz fe3o4 flocculants could be easily separated from the water avoiding secondary pollution multiple influence parameters such as dosage time temperature and ph on the turbidity removal rate the decolorization rate and the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of simulated ink wastewater were studied the flocculation waste residue was magnetically separated and reused to treat ink wastewater the treatment effect of the recycling use was also investigated after compounding a little psbfz again 2 experiments 2 1 materials sodium

m g black refill model mg 6150 the ink and tail oil lithium based ester were taken from the refill and placed in a 1 5 ml centrifugal tube after ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min 0 02 g of dispersed ink was dissolved in 250 ml water 100 ml of the above solution was used for each water treatment test the related characteristics of simulated ink wastewater are shown in the following table 2 2 characterization the morphologies were characterized by using a hitachi limited us 1510 scanning electron microscope sem infrared spectra were recorded by a nicolet nexus 470 fourier infrared spectrometer germany the crystal structures of psbfz and fe3o4 were analyzed by brukerd8 focus x ray diffraction instrument bruker germany using cuk α radiation under 40 kv and 40 ma with a scan rate of 5 min 2 3 preparation of psbfz fe3o4 2 3 1 preparation of psbfz in a typical synthesis 14 4 ml of na2sio3 0 5 mol l was added in a 250 ml beaker then 25 h2so4 was added in till the system becomes light blue ph 4 after the system was stirred for 3 h wt 25 h2so4 was added in to adjust the ph 2 then 9 6 ml of znso4 1 mol l 12 8 ml of fecl3 0 75 mol l and 24 ml of na2b4o7 0 03 mol l were added in after stirred for 2 h it was dried at 80 in a constant temperature blower finally the products were cooled to room temperature and ground into powder and kept in a dryer 2 3 2 preparation of nanometer fe3o4 34 fecl3 6h2o and feso4 7h2o were added in according to the molar ratio of fe2 to fe3 was slightly more than 2 1 because fe2 was easily oxidized during operation 200 ml of water was added to dissolve the solid and the solution was stirred strongly at room temperature for 30 min then ammonia water was added drop by drop as well it can be observed the colors of the solution changed to brown from yellow when the solution changed into black ammonia water was stopped dropping and stirred for another 10 min finally the solution and the solid in the flask were washed several times with deionized water when the ph of the washing liquid was close to neutral nano fe3o4 could be obtained by taking out the solid liquid mixture and drying it in vacuum the magnetic psbfz fe3o4 was obtained by grinding the mixture of psbfz and fe3o4 with a certain mass proportion 2 4 flocculation test in a typical water treatment test 0 3 g l of psbfz or psbfz fe3o4 were added to 100 ml of simulated ink wastewater under rapid stirring at 200 r min for 10 min then the stirring rate was slowed down to 50 r min for 10 min to allow the growth of flocs finally the flocs were settled for 4 h after sedimentation the supernatant sample was withdrawn for chromaticity turbidity and cod analysis the secondary water treatment experiment has the same procedure as above except that the added flocculant is the flocculation waste residues the flocculation waste residues were separated by a magnet and dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature for use the turbidity of the wastewater was measured by a hi93703 11 turbidity meter hana co ltd the removal rate of turbidity was calculated by eq 1 1 r e m o v a l r a t e f 0 f f 0 f0 the turbidity of the blank wastewater f the turbidity of the treated wastewater the dilution multiple method in the determination of the chromaticity of water quality gb11903 89 of national standard was adopted the removal rate of

the cod of the treated wastewater 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the sem images of the as prepared psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 rod shaped plate shaped particles and tiny irregular particle clusters were the main morphology of psbfz fig 1a after compounded with fe3o4 fig 1 b many cubic crystals fe3o4 crystals could be clearly observed in psbfz fe3o4 which were attached to the surface of flake or rod crystals or mixed into irregular crystal clusters in addition more agglomerated small particles could be seen in fig 1 b which might be caused by the agglomeration of nano fe3o4 it indicated the morphology of psbfz had no obvious change except that the surface was rougher after compounding of fe3o4 in order to investigate whether the addition of iron oxide affects the molecular structure of the flocculant ftir were used to analyze as shown in fig 2 a the strong peak at 3434 cm 1 was the stretching vibration absorption peak of oh the corresponding hoh bending vibration absorption of water was at 1587 cm 1 the peaks at 1207 and 1103 cm 1 were the bending vibration absorption peaks of si o 35 the peak at 770 cm 1 was ascribed to symmetrical stretching vibration the peak of 1381 cm 1 was the absorption produced by bending vibration of b o the introduction of element boron could not only coordinate with polysilicate to form b o si bond but also form coordination bonds zn o b fe o b al o b with some metal ions these special covalent bonds could neutralize the electrical properties making the colloidal particles inactive preventing their further polymerization to form gels and improving the stability of polysilicate 36 39 the peaks at 581 cm 1 939 cm 1 and 652 cm 1 could be attributed to the characteristic absorption of fe o and fe o h 40 compared with psbfz many significant changes appeared in psbfz fe3o4 the stretching vibration absorption peak of oh 3434 cm 1 had clear blue shift with no big change in intensity but the relative intensity of hoh bending vibration 1587 cm 1 decreased obviously this result demonstrated there were less free water molecules in the composite flocculants however there are still abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface in addition the peaks intensities of 1381 cm 1 1207 cm 1 and 461 cm 1 which were attributed to b o si o and zn o respectively were significantly weakened in response to this the two peaks at 652 and 581 cm 1 owed to fe o characteristic absorption are obviously blue shifted instead of weakening this might be due to the decreasing in the proportion of psbfz in fe3o4 psbfz after combined with fe3o4 resulting in si o b o zn o vibration peaks were weakened or be covered by the characteristic peak of the iron containing group in addition a strong absorption peak of fe3o4 which should have appeared at 580 cm 1 did not appear in fe3o4 psbfz these results indicated that there has a strong interaction between fe3o4 and psbfz rather than a simple physical mixing as shown in the x ray diffraction patterns fig 3 the as prepared fe3o4 exhibited characteristic diffractions at 2θ 30 20 35 82 43 26 53 64 57 38 62 96 and 74 52 corresponding to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of fe3o4 with cubic phase structure jcpds card no 019 0629 respectively fe and zn elements were introduced into the prepared psbfz some characteristic peaks representing fe3o4 could be seen in fig 3 c however due to the low proportion of fe3o4 in psbfz fe3o4 the associated fe3o4 feature peaks were weaker this result was in accord with the ftir results demonstrating that the three elements are not simply physical mixing and they were bonded with polysilicate which leaded to the complex crystal structure of the psbfz at present the treatment of sewage with psbfz flocculants is still in the one use stage the flocculation residues are difficult to separate and the post treatment is troublesome which is easy to cause secondary pollution to solve this problem we prepared magnetic psbfz fe3o4 flocculants by compounding magnetic nano fe3o4 with psbfz fig 4 shows the treatment effect of flocculants with different fe3o4 content it could be seen that the addition of fe3o4 could enhance the flocculation ability to a certain extent with the increase of fe3o4 content the flocculation effect of composite agent increases the turbidity removal rate and the color removal rate could reach 95 8 and 98 9 respectively the removal rate of cod increased with the increase of fe3o4 content until the maximum value appears at 0 4 1 when the ratio is more than 0 5 1 the flocculating capacity of the composite flocculants decreases which may be due to the less psbfz content in a certain amount of composite flocculants considering the flocculation ability and magnetic force we choose the composite flocculant prepared with m m psbfz 0 3 1 mass ratio is about 23 wt to further study the flocculation performances of psbfz fe3o4 under different conditions compared with psbfz the influence results of various factors on the flocculation effects of psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 were showed in fig 5 a d fig 5 a shows the dosages on the flocculation effect of psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 as the increasing of the dosage the turbidity removal rate the decolorization rate and the cod removal rate of ink wastewater were continuously increasing within a certain range when the dosage was increased to 0 030 g the turbidity removal rate decolorization rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 reached 98 0 98 5 and 44 0 respectively when the dosage was further increased the effect had little change this was because when the dosage of flocculant was small the colloid concentration in the wastewater and the coagulant volume would increase as the increasing the dosage of flocculant enhancing the adsorption bridging effect and the net trapping sweeping effect but when the dosage of coagulant is excessive which might cause charge reversal of colloidal particles and needing re stabilization 41 42 fig 5 b shows the influence of the reaction time on the flocculation effect as the flocculation time increasing the turbidity removal rate color removal rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 increased respectively the flocculation speed is fast most of the impurities have been settled within 2 h when the reaction time reaches 4 h the flocculation process of psbfz fe3o4 is basically balanced further extension of time the increases of removal rates are limited but the time for psbfz to reach flocculation equilibrium about 12 h is obviously longer than that of psbfz fe3o4 this shows that magnetic force is much beneficial to flocculation and sedimentation there was no significant improvement in the treatment effect of wastewater after flocculation equilibrium when further prolonging the time because the flocculants has agglomerated and sunk the net sweeping effect was relatively weak as shown in fig 5c temperature could also influence the flocculation effect this was because increasing temperature could accelerate the movement of colloidal particles in wastewater at the same time the probability of collision agglomeration of colloidal particles was increased and the flocculation and sedimentation were accelerated so as to improve the effect of water treatment at 40 c the treatment effect reaches an ideal level the turbidity removal rate color removal rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 were 97 9 99 2 and 47 8 respectively but when the temperature exceeded 50 c the agglomeration and the sedimentation of colloidal particles were so fast that they could not fully adsorb the pigments and organic matters in the wastewater therefore the treatment effect of flocculation has a little downward trend table 1 the influence of ph on the flocculation effect was shown in fig 5 d when the solution was acidic the hydrolysis of fe3 was inhibited and the polymerization of polyhydroxyl groups was blocked the formed flocs were small and scattered that was not easy to deposit and the adsorption bridging effect was poor as the ph increasing the treatment effect was improved when the ph value is 9 the ideal treatment effect was achieved and the turbidity removal rate decolorization rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 were 97 5 99 6 and 60 8 respectively the cod removal rate reaches an acceptable range in strong alkali solution which may be partly due to the oxidation and decomposition of organic compounds by strong alkali according to the results of ph on the flocculation effect the ph of simulated water based ink wastewater was adjusted to 9 by sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature t 25 c in a word the turbidity removal rate and the decolorization rate of psbfz fe3o4 have an appropriate improvement than that of psbfz in ink wastewater treatment and the cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 was obviously better than that of psbfz this may be caused by the synergistic effect 31 of psffz and fe3o4 and fe3o4 would cause the flocs attract each other to form larger aggregates which accelerated the flocculation process and improved the effect of water treatment it is worth noting in particular that the flocculation residues could be easily separated by a magnet fig 6 which made the flocculation residues could be easily separated from the water thus avoiding secondary pollution in addition to black ink the flocculants has high treatment effects for blue and red ink wastewater supporting information figure s1 both the turbidity removal rate and the color removal rate could achieve 96 since the flocculation waste residues still have good magnetic properties the secondary utilization of flocculation waste residues became possible the flocculating waste residues was separated by a magnet and collected into an evaporating dish and placed in an oven at 80 c for drying and recovery the apparent morphologies of the recycled flocculants were shown in figure s2 supporting information the secondary water treatment experiment was divided into five groups one group was used as blank control and the other four groups were added into the dried flocculation residues and psbfz the ph of the simulated water based ink wastewater was adjusted to 9 by 10 g l of sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature the specific data is shown in table 2 from table 2 we could see that the magnetic psbfz residue became inactive when used at the second time the removal rates of color and turbidity was very low this illustrates that most of flocculants have been lost activity after using in order to continue reuse its magnetism a small amount of psbfz was added in the residues when 0 02 g of psbfz were added into 0 08 g of flocculation waste residue the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate reached 95 91 and 93 24 respectively by increasing the proportion of psbfz appropriately the water treatment effect could be improved to a certain extent and the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate can reach about 95 and 98 respectively it was worth mentioning that the flocculating waste residue showed good magnetic recovery characteristics again and could be separated from wastewater by magnetic materials avoiding secondary pollution in short compared to psbfz and other polysilicic acid flocculants the as prepared psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants has higher efficiency in processing ink waste water the possible reason is that magnetic fe3o4 can cause the flocs attract each other to form larger aggregates which accelerate the circulation process and improve the effect of water treatment in addition the psbfz fe3o4 can be easily separated from the treated water avoiding secondary water pollution and making secondary use possible this easy separation makes the subsequent stages of water treatment easier and more effective this recyclable feature not only saves resources but also saves labor costs can bring better economic benefits and eco social benefit 4 conclusions the as prepared psbfz were very effective to treat ink wastewater and the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate of wastewater could reach 93 and 95 at room temperature after combined with fe3o4 the removal rate of the turbidity and color has improved achieved 96 and 97 respectively the cod removal rate has obvious improvement due to the synergistic effect the as prepared psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants has high magnetism that could be easily separated from the water avoiding secondary water pollution and making secondary use possible the magnetic recycled flocculation waste residues could be reused after adding a small amount of psbfz when the amount of flocculating waste residue and psbfz was 0 08 g and 0 02 g the turbidity and color removal rate of wastewater reached 95 91 and 93 24 respectively by increasing the specific gravity of the psbfz the turbidity removal rate and color removal rate could reach 94 97 and 98 47 respectively it was worth mentioning that the flocculation waste residues still kept good magnetic characteristics the flocculation waste residues still could be easily separated from waste water by magnetic adsorption to avoid secondary pollution it should be pointed out that the cod removal rate is not in an ideal level whether psbfz or psbfz fe3o4 was used this may be due to the fact that most of the organic matter in the water based ink is ethanol and ethanol can be mutually soluble with water and the as prepared flocculants have no property to decompose organic matter therefore in the following work we will add the composition of mesoporous titanium dioxide tio2 to the above composite flocculants and use the photocatalytic properties of to tio2 degrade organic matter so as to increase the cod removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors

13596,polysilicic acid ferric and zinc sulfate containing boron psbfz flocculants were prepared through reaction of sodium silicate ferric trichloride zinc sulfate and sodium tetraborate a new type of magnetic flocculant psbfz fe3o4 was prepared through a simple method of solid state reaction at room temperature the as prepared psbfz and magnetic psbfz fe3o4 were used in treating water based ink wastewater the influence parameters such as dosage time ph and temperature on the removal rate of decolorization turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod were investigated the results showed the products were suitable for neutral and basic water when the dosage of psbfz fe3o4 was 0 3 g l the turbidity removal rate and the decolorization rate could reach 98 0 and 98 5 at room temperature respectively through recycling by a magnet the magnetic psbfz fe3o4 flocculants residues could be easily separated from the wastewater which makes the reusing of magnetic flocculants become possible keywords psbfz fe3o4 ink wastewater magnetic separation secondary utilization 1 introduction in recent years with the improvement of environmental awareness and the rising price of crude oil the production of ink has gradually turned from oil based ink to water based ink 1 the discharge of water based ink wastewater is increasing currently therefore the research and production of water based ink have been greatly developed how to deal with the large amount of water based ink wastewater is a realistic problem to be solved the ink is mainly composed of color carrier usually some resin compounds containing hydrophilic groups etc pigments fillers auxiliaries and solvents 2 the ink wastewater mainly comes from the production of ink and industrial wastewater generated by the printing and dyeing industry it has high cod several hundred mg l or even tens of thousands mg l chromaticity hundreds or even more than 100 000 times turbidity a large number of micro soluble or insoluble particles makes the ink wastewater poor transmittance with high turbidity and poor degradability the presence of macromolecular color carriers such as resins makes it difficult to degrade which could cause a great harm to the environment 3 5 the above characteristics increase the challenge for treatment of ink wastewater the treatment methods of water based ink wastewater could be divided into three categories according to the principle chemical methods physical methods and biological methods however in order to obtain the best treatment effect a variety of methods were often used with a combination in the actual sewage treatment at present the main treatment process of industrial wastewater usually contains three steps firstly pretreatment such as air flotation 6 acidification coagulation flocculation 7 etc removing small suspended particles in water cutting off the carbon chains of organic molecules in wastewater making them shorter chains which are convenient for subsequent treatment secondly chemical and biochemical treatment such as fenton oxidation 8 activated sludge process 9 reducing the cod of wastewater finally post treatment such as membrane permeation 10 filtering out difficult to degrade substances in wastewater to make it meet national discharge standard as a kind of main industrial wastewater to treat ink wastewater is similar to these three steps flocculation is a widely used method in wastewater pretreatment at present due to having a simpler process and a lower cost it is also suitable for the treatment of water based ink wastewater 11 13 as a large class of flocculant polysilicate flocculants are widely concerned by scholars in the field of water treatment because of their simple synthesis fast results and low cost especially in recent years many metal ions were compounded into activated silicic acid such as fe3 14 15 zn2 16 al3 17 ti2 18 mg2 19 and so on aluminum and iron are firstly introduced into the activated silicic acid to prepare polysilicate based flocculant containing single metal 20 due to the potential toxicity of aluminum based flocculants 21 the demand for aluminum based flocculants is decreasing then titanium tetrachloride 22 and titanium oxysulfate 23 were used as flocculants with the further research bimetallic and multi metallic ions are introduced into polysilicate the multi metallic metal ions composite flocculant includes the advantages of different single metal characteristics and achieves better treatment effect 24 26 recently zinc composite coagulants especially the poly silicate ferric zinc flocculant 27 have received much attention in wastewater treatment for their non toxicity and properties of charge neutralization and bridge aggregation at the same time boron is introduced to the preparation of polysilicate flocculant which can complex with hydroxyl forming b o si bond inhibiting the auto agglutination of hydroxyl among silicic acid molecules to improve its stability 28 not only the stability of the polysilicate flocculants has been improved but also the applications in treatment of various types of sewage have been achieved the above various scientific research achievements have promoted the research and application of polysilicate flocculants making various polysilicate flocculants widely appeared in the field of sewage treatment however the treatment of sewage with flocculants is still in the one use stage that is more attention is paid to the effect of water treatment but the flocculation waste residues with high concentration of pollutants are ignored because of its low density high water content and easy dispersion flocculating waste residues are difficult to separate from water when it remains in the bottom of the water it will cause secondary pollution magnetic recovery of materials is a general and simple separation means 29 31 it is feasible to separate the flocculating waste residues from water by a magnet which makes the recycling and reusing of magnetic flocculants become possible 32 33 in this paper magnetic psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants were prepared through a simple method of combing psbfz with fe3o4 at room temperature after being compounded with fe3o4 the psbfz fe3o4 flocculants could be easily separated from the water avoiding secondary pollution multiple influence parameters such as dosage time temperature and ph on the turbidity removal rate the decolorization rate and the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of simulated ink wastewater were studied the flocculation waste residue was magnetically separated and reused to treat ink wastewater the treatment effect of the recycling use was also investigated after compounding a little psbfz again 2 experiments 2 1 materials sodium silicate na2sio3 9h2o ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o ammonium hydroxide nh3 h2o and ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o were purchased from tianjin fuchen chemical reagent co ltd sulfuric acid h2so4 borax na2b4o7 10h2o and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd zinc sulfate znso4 from tianjin yaohua chemical plant all chemicals were analytically pure ink was taken from the m g black refill model mg 6150 the ink and tail oil lithium based ester were taken from the refill and placed in a 1 5 ml centrifugal tube after ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min 0 02 g of dispersed ink was dissolved in 250 ml water 100 ml of the above solution was used for each water treatment test the related characteristics of simulated ink wastewater are shown in the following table 2 2 characterization the morphologies were characterized by using a hitachi limited us 1510 scanning electron microscope sem infrared spectra were recorded by a nicolet nexus 470 fourier infrared spectrometer germany the crystal structures of psbfz and fe3o4 were analyzed by brukerd8 focus x ray diffraction instrument bruker germany using cuk α radiation under 40 kv and 40 ma with a scan rate of 5 min 2 3 preparation of psbfz fe3o4 2 3 1 preparation of psbfz in a typical synthesis 14 4 ml of na2sio3 0 5 mol l was added in a 250 ml beaker then 25 h2so4 was added in till the system becomes light blue ph 4 after the system was stirred for 3 h wt 25 h2so4 was added in to adjust the ph 2 then 9 6 ml of znso4 1 mol l 12 8 ml of fecl3 0 75 mol l and 24 ml of na2b4o7 0 03 mol l were added in after stirred for 2 h it was dried at 80 in a constant temperature blower finally the products were cooled to room temperature and ground into powder and kept in a dryer 2 3 2 preparation of nanometer fe3o4 34 fecl3 6h2o and feso4 7h2o were added in according to the molar ratio of fe2 to fe3 was slightly more than 2 1 because fe2 was easily oxidized during operation 200 ml of water was added to dissolve the solid and the solution was stirred strongly at room temperature for 30 min then ammonia water was added drop by drop as well it can be observed the colors of the solution changed to brown from yellow when the solution changed into black ammonia water was stopped dropping and stirred for another 10 min finally the solution and the solid in the flask were washed several times with deionized water when the ph of the washing liquid was close to neutral nano fe3o4 could be obtained by taking out the solid liquid mixture and drying it in vacuum the magnetic psbfz fe3o4 was obtained by grinding the mixture of psbfz and fe3o4 with a certain mass proportion 2 4 flocculation test in a typical water treatment test 0 3 g l of psbfz or psbfz fe3o4 were added to 100 ml of simulated ink wastewater under rapid stirring at 200 r min for 10 min then the stirring rate was slowed down to 50 r min for 10 min to allow the growth of flocs finally the flocs were settled for 4 h after sedimentation the supernatant sample was withdrawn for chromaticity turbidity and cod analysis the secondary water treatment experiment has the same procedure as above except that the added flocculant is the flocculation waste residues the flocculation waste residues were separated by a magnet and dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature for use the turbidity of the wastewater was measured by a hi93703 11 turbidity meter hana co ltd the removal rate of turbidity was calculated by eq 1 1 r e m o v a l r a t e f 0 f f 0 f0 the turbidity of the blank wastewater f the turbidity of the treated wastewater the dilution multiple method in the determination of the chromaticity of water quality gb11903 89 of national standard was adopted the removal rate of chromaticity was calculated by eq 2 2 r e m o v a l r a t e a 0 a a 0 a0 the chromaticity of the blank wastewater a the chromaticity of the treated wastewater the cod of simulated ink wastewater were determined according to the national standard of hj 828 2017 the cod removal rate were calculated by eq 3 3 r e m o v a l r a t e c o d 0 c o d c o d 0 100 cod 0 the cod of the blank wastewater cod the cod of the treated wastewater 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the sem images of the as prepared psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 rod shaped plate shaped particles and tiny irregular particle clusters were the main morphology of psbfz fig 1a after compounded with fe3o4 fig 1 b many cubic crystals fe3o4 crystals could be clearly observed in psbfz fe3o4 which were attached to the surface of flake or rod crystals or mixed into irregular crystal clusters in addition more agglomerated small particles could be seen in fig 1 b which might be caused by the agglomeration of nano fe3o4 it indicated the morphology of psbfz had no obvious change except that the surface was rougher after compounding of fe3o4 in order to investigate whether the addition of iron oxide affects the molecular structure of the flocculant ftir were used to analyze as shown in fig 2 a the strong peak at 3434 cm 1 was the stretching vibration absorption peak of oh the corresponding hoh bending vibration absorption of water was at 1587 cm 1 the peaks at 1207 and 1103 cm 1 were the bending vibration absorption peaks of si o 35 the peak at 770 cm 1 was ascribed to symmetrical stretching vibration the peak of 1381 cm 1 was the absorption produced by bending vibration of b o the introduction of element boron could not only coordinate with polysilicate to form b o si bond but also form coordination bonds zn o b fe o b al o b with some metal ions these special covalent bonds could neutralize the electrical properties making the colloidal particles inactive preventing their further polymerization to form gels and improving the stability of polysilicate 36 39 the peaks at 581 cm 1 939 cm 1 and 652 cm 1 could be attributed to the characteristic absorption of fe o and fe o h 40 compared with psbfz many significant changes appeared in psbfz fe3o4 the stretching vibration absorption peak of oh 3434 cm 1 had clear blue shift with no big change in intensity but the relative intensity of hoh bending vibration 1587 cm 1 decreased obviously this result demonstrated there were less free water molecules in the composite flocculants however there are still abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface in addition the peaks intensities of 1381 cm 1 1207 cm 1 and 461 cm 1 which were attributed to b o si o and zn o respectively were significantly weakened in response to this the two peaks at 652 and 581 cm 1 owed to fe o characteristic absorption are obviously blue shifted instead of weakening this might be due to the decreasing in the proportion of psbfz in fe3o4 psbfz after combined with fe3o4 resulting in si o b o zn o vibration peaks were weakened or be covered by the characteristic peak of the iron containing group in addition a strong absorption peak of fe3o4 which should have appeared at 580 cm 1 did not appear in fe3o4 psbfz these results indicated that there has a strong interaction between fe3o4 and psbfz rather than a simple physical mixing as shown in the x ray diffraction patterns fig 3 the as prepared fe3o4 exhibited characteristic diffractions at 2θ 30 20 35 82 43 26 53 64 57 38 62 96 and 74 52 corresponding to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of fe3o4 with cubic phase structure jcpds card no 019 0629 respectively fe and zn elements were introduced into the prepared psbfz some characteristic peaks representing fe3o4 could be seen in fig 3 c however due to the low proportion of fe3o4 in psbfz fe3o4 the associated fe3o4 feature peaks were weaker this result was in accord with the ftir results demonstrating that the three elements are not simply physical mixing and they were bonded with polysilicate which leaded to the complex crystal structure of the psbfz at present the treatment of sewage with psbfz flocculants is still in the one use stage the flocculation residues are difficult to separate and the post treatment is troublesome which is easy to cause secondary pollution to solve this problem we prepared magnetic psbfz fe3o4 flocculants by compounding magnetic nano fe3o4 with psbfz fig 4 shows the treatment effect of flocculants with different fe3o4 content it could be seen that the addition of fe3o4 could enhance the flocculation ability to a certain extent with the increase of fe3o4 content the flocculation effect of composite agent increases the turbidity removal rate and the color removal rate could reach 95 8 and 98 9 respectively the removal rate of cod increased with the increase of fe3o4 content until the maximum value appears at 0 4 1 when the ratio is more than 0 5 1 the flocculating capacity of the composite flocculants decreases which may be due to the less psbfz content in a certain amount of composite flocculants considering the flocculation ability and magnetic force we choose the composite flocculant prepared with m m psbfz 0 3 1 mass ratio is about 23 wt to further study the flocculation performances of psbfz fe3o4 under different conditions compared with psbfz the influence results of various factors on the flocculation effects of psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 were showed in fig 5 a d fig 5 a shows the dosages on the flocculation effect of psbfz and psbfz fe3o4 as the increasing of the dosage the turbidity removal rate the decolorization rate and the cod removal rate of ink wastewater were continuously increasing within a certain range when the dosage was increased to 0 030 g the turbidity removal rate decolorization rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 reached 98 0 98 5 and 44 0 respectively when the dosage was further increased the effect had little change this was because when the dosage of flocculant was small the colloid concentration in the wastewater and the coagulant volume would increase as the increasing the dosage of flocculant enhancing the adsorption bridging effect and the net trapping sweeping effect but when the dosage of coagulant is excessive which might cause charge reversal of colloidal particles and needing re stabilization 41 42 fig 5 b shows the influence of the reaction time on the flocculation effect as the flocculation time increasing the turbidity removal rate color removal rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 increased respectively the flocculation speed is fast most of the impurities have been settled within 2 h when the reaction time reaches 4 h the flocculation process of psbfz fe3o4 is basically balanced further extension of time the increases of removal rates are limited but the time for psbfz to reach flocculation equilibrium about 12 h is obviously longer than that of psbfz fe3o4 this shows that magnetic force is much beneficial to flocculation and sedimentation there was no significant improvement in the treatment effect of wastewater after flocculation equilibrium when further prolonging the time because the flocculants has agglomerated and sunk the net sweeping effect was relatively weak as shown in fig 5c temperature could also influence the flocculation effect this was because increasing temperature could accelerate the movement of colloidal particles in wastewater at the same time the probability of collision agglomeration of colloidal particles was increased and the flocculation and sedimentation were accelerated so as to improve the effect of water treatment at 40 c the treatment effect reaches an ideal level the turbidity removal rate color removal rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 were 97 9 99 2 and 47 8 respectively but when the temperature exceeded 50 c the agglomeration and the sedimentation of colloidal particles were so fast that they could not fully adsorb the pigments and organic matters in the wastewater therefore the treatment effect of flocculation has a little downward trend table 1 the influence of ph on the flocculation effect was shown in fig 5 d when the solution was acidic the hydrolysis of fe3 was inhibited and the polymerization of polyhydroxyl groups was blocked the formed flocs were small and scattered that was not easy to deposit and the adsorption bridging effect was poor as the ph increasing the treatment effect was improved when the ph value is 9 the ideal treatment effect was achieved and the turbidity removal rate decolorization rate and cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 were 97 5 99 6 and 60 8 respectively the cod removal rate reaches an acceptable range in strong alkali solution which may be partly due to the oxidation and decomposition of organic compounds by strong alkali according to the results of ph on the flocculation effect the ph of simulated water based ink wastewater was adjusted to 9 by sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature t 25 c in a word the turbidity removal rate and the decolorization rate of psbfz fe3o4 have an appropriate improvement than that of psbfz in ink wastewater treatment and the cod removal rate of psbfz fe3o4 was obviously better than that of psbfz this may be caused by the synergistic effect 31 of psffz and fe3o4 and fe3o4 would cause the flocs attract each other to form larger aggregates which accelerated the flocculation process and improved the effect of water treatment it is worth noting in particular that the flocculation residues could be easily separated by a magnet fig 6 which made the flocculation residues could be easily separated from the water thus avoiding secondary pollution in addition to black ink the flocculants has high treatment effects for blue and red ink wastewater supporting information figure s1 both the turbidity removal rate and the color removal rate could achieve 96 since the flocculation waste residues still have good magnetic properties the secondary utilization of flocculation waste residues became possible the flocculating waste residues was separated by a magnet and collected into an evaporating dish and placed in an oven at 80 c for drying and recovery the apparent morphologies of the recycled flocculants were shown in figure s2 supporting information the secondary water treatment experiment was divided into five groups one group was used as blank control and the other four groups were added into the dried flocculation residues and psbfz the ph of the simulated water based ink wastewater was adjusted to 9 by 10 g l of sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature the specific data is shown in table 2 from table 2 we could see that the magnetic psbfz residue became inactive when used at the second time the removal rates of color and turbidity was very low this illustrates that most of flocculants have been lost activity after using in order to continue reuse its magnetism a small amount of psbfz was added in the residues when 0 02 g of psbfz were added into 0 08 g of flocculation waste residue the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate reached 95 91 and 93 24 respectively by increasing the proportion of psbfz appropriately the water treatment effect could be improved to a certain extent and the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate can reach about 95 and 98 respectively it was worth mentioning that the flocculating waste residue showed good magnetic recovery characteristics again and could be separated from wastewater by magnetic materials avoiding secondary pollution in short compared to psbfz and other polysilicic acid flocculants the as prepared psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants has higher efficiency in processing ink waste water the possible reason is that magnetic fe3o4 can cause the flocs attract each other to form larger aggregates which accelerate the circulation process and improve the effect of water treatment in addition the psbfz fe3o4 can be easily separated from the treated water avoiding secondary water pollution and making secondary use possible this easy separation makes the subsequent stages of water treatment easier and more effective this recyclable feature not only saves resources but also saves labor costs can bring better economic benefits and eco social benefit 4 conclusions the as prepared psbfz were very effective to treat ink wastewater and the turbidity removal rate and decolorization rate of wastewater could reach 93 and 95 at room temperature after combined with fe3o4 the removal rate of the turbidity and color has improved achieved 96 and 97 respectively the cod removal rate has obvious improvement due to the synergistic effect the as prepared psbfz fe3o4 composite flocculants has high magnetism that could be easily separated from the water avoiding secondary water pollution and making secondary use possible the magnetic recycled flocculation waste residues could be reused after adding a small amount of psbfz when the amount of flocculating waste residue and psbfz was 0 08 g and 0 02 g the turbidity and color removal rate of wastewater reached 95 91 and 93 24 respectively by increasing the specific gravity of the psbfz the turbidity removal rate and color removal rate could reach 94 97 and 98 47 respectively it was worth mentioning that the flocculation waste residues still kept good magnetic characteristics the flocculation waste residues still could be easily separated from waste water by magnetic adsorption to avoid secondary pollution it should be pointed out that the cod removal rate is not in an ideal level whether psbfz or psbfz fe3o4 was used this may be due to the fact that most of the organic matter in the water based ink is ethanol and ethanol can be mutually soluble with water and the as prepared flocculants have no property to decompose organic matter therefore in the following work we will add the composition of mesoporous titanium dioxide tio2 to the above composite flocculants and use the photocatalytic properties of to tio2 degrade organic matter so as to increase the cod removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors

13597,the agricultural sector requires a large volume of water 70 of global water which makes this sector difficult to produce enough food for the rapidly growing population demand with the existing scarce available freshwater source as a viable alternative water source urban wastewater reuse is a potential candidate however wastewater reuse and disposal before treatment pose a significant threat to human health and ecological systems this study was aimed to treat urban wastewater using aerobic anoxic system and then effluent evaluated to grow different vegetables wastewater samples collected arba minch town at nine sites during different seasons were used to characterized water quality physicochemical and biological parameters and feed aerobic anoxic reactors health risk as a result of

and hi values for cd and pb 1 0 exceeded who and fao limits for vegetables irrigated with wastewater which could result in health risk in adults and children overall results confirmed that wastewater after aerobic anoxic treatment is a sustainable approach to maintain safe environmental and human health keywords wastewater reuse arba minch town aerobic anoxic treatment health risk heavy metals 1 introduction available freshwater used for various purposes is a scarce natural resource 1 climate change population growth contamination of water uneven distribution of water industrial and agricultural activities increased the demand for available freshwater use 2 3 for instance about 70 of the freshwater is used for agricultural activities 4 the shortage of available freshwater forced people to find an alternative solution that can sustain life in this regard wastewater is a potential candidate that can support the high water demanding sector i e agriculture 5 untreated wastewater utw utilization agriculture industry aquifers recharge ecosystems rehabilitation in various countries is well documented in the literature 1 3 4 6 although the use of utw has many advantages good nutrient supply and cheaper water sources it contains different contaminants that have a direct or indirect effect on human and environmental health 7 8 human health risks mostly contracted via consuming plants vegetables irrigated with utw include pathogens microbes and helminths and chemicals heavy elements 4 7 consumption of vegetables contaminated with heavy metals hms can develop potential diseases such as heart kidney brain blood liver and bone diseases 9 arsenic as cadmium cd cobalt co copper cu iron fe lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn are the most commonly reported hms in vegetables soil and wastewater 10 14 reports showed that consumption of food that contains an excess amount of cd brings renal damage hypertension emphysema carcinogenic changes mainly of kidney and prostate skeletal deformation and low reproduction functions in human beings 11 15 18 although the human body bones and teeth stores a large amounts of pb the excess amount of pb ingested from food may damage nervous systems inhibit heme formation damage kidneys cause anemia impaired mental development of young children cause carcinogenicity and genotoxicity 18 although mn is important to human health an excess amount of mn could be associated with devastating neurological impairments which are clinically called manganism 11 excessive fe deposition in the human body has also been reported to cause disease in the liver glands and heart a stomach disorder less bowel movement and black colored stools 18 19 poor wound healing anorexia depression diarrhea dermatitis and immune dysfunction also resulted from a deficiency of zn in the diet 20 21 heavy metal transfer in the soil is governed by organic matter om ph and cation exchange capacity cec for example metals form complex with om under alkaline soil ph which makes hms in the soil less mobile 22 23 aydin et al 23 observed less phytoavailability of hms in soil that contains high om which indicates the positive effect of wastewater application to irrigate vegetables with contaminated wastewater a detailed explanation about soil microbial activity cec ph and om also reviewed in other studies 4 22 24 disposal of utw containing a higher amount of nutrients and om to the surrounding water bodies also an important water quality concern that affects environmental health 25 26 recovering those nutrients including phosphorus and nitrogen brings a double environmental and economic benefit the main value is decreasing the amount of nutrients released into the aquatic environment eutrophication which is resulted from the discharge of om and nutrients p and n into the aquatic systems depleted the amount of dissolved oxygen conditions of hypoxia or anoxia in the water environment 27 oxygen depletion in the water body causes a huge amount of biodiversity loss 25 additional value recovering those nutrients for agricultural activity reduces the dependence on industrial fertilizers that require a significant amount of energy and resources 27 28 as a result utw utilization before treatment is restricted by the food and agriculture organization fao 29 and the world health organization who 30 the federal government of ethiopia also established the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa to safeguard the overall environment resulted from different contaminants 31 particularly the ethiopian regulation gave much emphasis to ph nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss which is also the interest of many other countries pollution control 2 to meet the regulations for discharge limits set for various wastewater contaminants treatment is very crucial recent studies have paid significant attention to biological organic matter and nutrient removal methods from wastewater 25 26 32 34 various environmental factors including do seasonal temperature ph organic loading rate and contact time affect nutrient and organic biological treatment 26 35 36 for instance domestic organic matter removal requires a sufficient amount of do for efficient biological wastewater treatment systems the same is true for nh4 n oxidation that demands a sufficient amount of do in its first step during the nitrification process nh4 n is first oxidized to no2 n eq 1 and then no3 n eq 2 by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria respectively under aerobic state nitrate in the absence of do is also reduced into n2 gas by heterotrophic bacteria eq 3 25 34 37 1 n h 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n

sites and samples were collected at these sites and analyzed for the various physical chemical and biological parameters based on the preliminary water quality parameters and other factors environmental data sources of wastewater discharge and volume of wastewater released aerobic anoxic reactor configuration was designed the phytotoxicity effect of untreated and treated effluent was evaluated using lettuce cabbage and tomato commonly growing vegetables in the study area heavy metal contents were also analyzed to identify health risk exposure resulted from vegetable ingestion and

microbial consortia were first acclimatized with synthetic media used by guadie et al 25 with some modifications it comprises 175 mg l starch 200 mg l c6h6o6 28 mg l peptone 64 mg l nh2conh2 150 mg l nh4cl 52 5 mg l kh2po4 150 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l caso4 2h2o and one ml of trace solution 25 the acclimatization with synthetic wastewater was done for a month and gradually reduced the synthetic wastewater with actual wastewater with a proportion of synthetic actual wastewater 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 after acclimatization the raw wastewater collected periodically from different sites were mixed in a big influent storage tank 80 l and pumped to the aerobic reactor at various organic loading rate and hydraulic residence time the organic loading rate 2 978 12 47 kg m3 day for summer and 6 854 18 774 kg m3 day for winter seasons was considered after the cod and flow rate identified the effluent collected from aerobic reactor becomes influent of anoxic reactor that feeds the system at a constant flow rate the effluent from the anoxic reactor was also pumped into the sedimentation tank where the effluent and the activated sludge separated a portion of the activated sludge from the sedimentation tank was returned to the aerobic tank so as to keep enough biomass concentration in the aerobic reactor the aerobic reactor was also continuously stirred at 300 rpm to mix biomass and air supplied to maintain the do level 2 0 mg l in the reactor 2 3 wastewater sampling and analysis wastewater from nine sampling sites fig 1 were collected using a pre sterilized 2000 ml sampling bottle at a depth of 40 50 cm below the water surfaces 41 this was done to avoid the collection of surface impurities and suspended solids after samples collected it was placed in ice box transported to the laboratory and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c until analysis is done similarly samples were also periodically collected from reactors to identify key wastewater indexes 41 wastewater quality was analyzed for temperature ph ec do tds tss cod bod5 nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus metals na k mg ca mn pb cu ni fe cd co cr and non metals cl co3 2 hco3 so4 2 among these ec

metal concentrations microbial contamination analysis was also conducted according to apha 41 methods to evaluate the removal efficiency of the wastewater contaminants in the aerobic anoxic reactors

the phytotoxicity analysis was used to assess the toxicity of seed germination for this experiment certified healthy and equally sized seeds of tomato solanum lycopersicum lettuce lactuca sativa and cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata were procured from the local seed supplier located in debrezeit town and were scarified in 85 h2so4 for 35 min and sterilized in 0 2 hgcl2 for 2 min to remove any fungal growth 43 the seeds were placed in petri dishes 10 cm lined with filter paper each petridish was watering with five ml of utw and treated wastewater trw into the respective petridish and then incubated at room temperature the tap water tpw was also used as control various growth morphological parameters such as germination eq 5 seedling length eq 6 and seedling vigor index svi eq 7 were evaluated 44 the relative toxicity of trw and utw on the seed germination and seedling growth of each vegetable was also calculated to determine the degree of inhibition of control eq 8 following

was conducted to investigate the toxicity effect of utw and trw on the same vegetable tomato lettuce and cabbage with reference to irrigation of tpw as a control group for pot culture 27 plastic pots 23 in top diameter 10 bottom and 15 cm high were filled with an equal 2 kg amount of air dried sandy loam soil the seeds of tomato lettuce and cabbage were sown in each pot irrigation was carried out from the seedling stage based on actual water requirement irrigated approximately every day 100 ml target wastewater at a time in one pot followed by 50 ml of nutrient solution following the method used elsewhere 45 the experiment was run under standard local conditions of temperature and relative humidity when the plants were growing morphological characteristics like length shoot and root leaf area and number weight fresh and dry and chlorophyll contents were measured at different times 4 8 and 16 weeks 2 5 evaluating the potential health risks reports showed that human beings contracted hms mainly via the food chain 20 46 heavy metal concentration in vegetables soil and body weight of consumers were used to calculate health related risks such as daily metal intake dmi health risk index hri target hazard quotient thq and hazard index hi the risk index dmi hri thq and hi values were calculated based on eqs 9 12 a detail explanation of each equation has been shown in our previous

the one way analysis of variance anova with tukey post hoc test was done to obtain statistical significance between mean values pearson correlation analysis was also performed to analyze the relationship between aerobic anoxic treatment and the physicochemical values of the wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater quality according to the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma the whole country has three seasons based on the mean trends of temperature and rainfall 50 these are summer june september winter october january and spring february may seasons which are characterized by long time heavy rainfall dry and short moderate rainfall respectively fig 3 shows the mean average results of different water quality parameters collected at different sites of amt during summer and winter seasons among the sampling sites higher water index such as cod bod5 tss ec tn and tp values were identified from sh tf which have no dyeing step ef and mc sites which released untreated sewage into the surrounding environment table s2 however due to the dilution effect during mixing equal amounts of the nine samples that used for feed preparation the overall wastewater composite values were found in the range of domestic wastewater previously reported 51 53 it is suitable bod5 cod 0 63 for biological treatment that is readily biodegradable without any kind of pretreatment 54 so far there is no wwtp in the town rather sewage at different sites is directly discharging into the surrounding water bodies particularly lakes abaya and chamo fig 1 the two rift valley lakes separated by god bridge among the current sampling sites arba minch university mc wastewater released from staff resident areas student dormitories offices cafeterias and laboratories goes to hare river that later ends to abaya lake kulfo river which crosses the town also received wastewater discharges from the rest of the sampling sites and finally ends at lake chamo during rainy seasons the kulfo river overflow discharge from normal watercourse also led to lake abaya which is currently becoming a serious concern of water pollution particularly rampant water hyacinth growth problem in the area the wastewater temperature varied in summer 15 9 28 6 c and winter 17 1 31 8 c seasons fig 2a the average winter season temperature 25 8 2 3 c was significantly p 0 001 higher than the summer season average temperature 23 1 1 2 c fig 2a which is similar to another study 52 temperature is a crucial physicochemical wastewater parameter that significantly influences biological and chemical reactions in the aquatic ecosystem and wwtp 8 40 51 55 the mean ph value of all sites found to be 9 1 0 2 for summer and 9 4 0 2 for winter seasons fig 2a since amt is situated in the rift valley region which is characterized by higher temperature salinity and basic natures ph 9 0 40 42 alkaline ph is expected from the raw wastewater textile wastewater which is characterized by higher ph value ph 10 5 also part of the mix formation increased ph value in the current study from most domestic wastewater ph value 8 0 reported from the literature 35 51 is not surprising comparing seasonal variations a range of higher ph values 9 3 9 8 were observed in the winter season than summer 8 7 9 4 which is similar to other studies 8 52 however the ph variation was statistically insignificant p 0 08 between summer and winter seasons table s3 as observed in other studies 52 56 relatively higher ph values observed during the summer seasons also most likely due to the effect of lower temperatures and carbonic acid in the wastewater it is known that temperature and ph have an inverse relationship which means that at lower summer temperature a higher ph value is expected a higher concentration of co3 2 in the wastewater table s3 also leads it to react with h2o that forms oh which increased the ph value the correlation coefficient matrix table s4 showed that ph with co3 2 r 0 89 has a strong positive significant correlation that indicates carbonate contributed to the alkalinity in the wastewater it has been reported that ph range 6 5 8 4 is recommended for reuse purposes 29 but ph out of this range values fig 2a might cause a nutritional imbalance or may increase the level of toxic ions 57 total suspended solids in produced water may include the floating or drifting materials found in the water such as silt sediment sand algae and plankton 24 the tss results were found to be 636 8 59 1 456 0 763 0 for summer and 803 0 96 9 629 0 1189 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 2b these values have been found insignificantly different among seasons p 0 064 table s3 the bod5 concentration from all sampling sites has fluctuated between 185 5 439 0 300 9 55 2 mg l for summer and 293 9 672 5 402 4 47 9 mg l for winter seasons fig 2b but the fluctuation is statistically insignificant among seasons p 0 057 table s3 insignificant variation p 0 066 of cod values was also observed in summer 471 0 45 4 and winter 636 8 59 0 seasons fig 2b the lower bod5 and cod concentration in summer might be due to the dilution effect of the rainy summer season and mesophilic range of temperature 20 45 c 40 that stimulates heterotrophic bacteria to consume a large amount of organic contaminants and do the ratio of bod5 to cod 0 63 suggests that the mixed wastewater collected at different sites are easily biodegradable and could be treated through conventional biological treatment method 58 the magnitude of pollutant removal using microbial activity is closely linked to the existence of simply biodegradable carbon source which is the limiting factor in most biological treatment processes 26 although fao and who have no standard for bod5 and cod the current result did not fulfill the ethiopian environmental protection standard limits set 31 for bod5 and cod discharge values to the water body table s3 the tn and nh4 n concentration vary from 52 6 169 8 115 2 44 8 and 21 0 67 9 46 1 16 8 mg l for summer and 27 8 157 5 99 3 48 9 and 9 3 52 5 33 1 16 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 2c the mean no3 n and no2 n concentrations were also found to be 3 8 1 4 and 0 2 0 1 mg l for summer and 2 5 1 3 and 0 4 0 1 mg l for winter seasons except for no2 n p 0 006 and nh4 n p 0 016 there was no significant difference between the different nitrogen forms observed in both seasons table s3 the concentration of the different nitrogen forms is higher in the summer seasons which presumably the greater rate of microbial biodegradation of protein urea and amino acids at higher summer temperatures the other higher nitrogen forms in the summer season most likely due to higher fertilizer applied in the surrounding area washed into the different sampling sites with the heavy summer rain correlation coefficient matrix table s4 revealed that a strong positive correlation was found between tn with bod5 r 0 63 cod r 0 72 tss r 0 77 and tds r 0 81 while negative correlation was observed with do r 0 83 the nh4 n concentration identified during summer and winter values is higher than the eepa 31 standard value 30 mg l set for wastewater effluent discharges to the water bodies table s3 however the no3 n concentration was found to be lower than the fao standard value set for wastewater recommended for reuse purposes although the values of tp fluctuated among different sites between 6 3 27 2 15 5 7 0 mg l for summer and 1 2 24 8 12 2 8 3 mg l for winter there is no clear evidence p 0 390 to support the seasonal variation fig 2c however a relatively higher tp concentration in summer might be due to the rain supposed to brought phosphate and phosphate containing loaded compounds from a different point and non point sources runoff carrying phosphate containing fertilizer use from agricultural land the average tp values detected in both seasons have been found exceeded the fao 29 standard limit table s3 although higher values of ec were recorded during the winter dry season 3 5 0 9 ds m than the summer rainy season 2 7 0 7 ds m fig 2d the variations were found insignificant p 0 190 the average mean ec values recorded in all sites fig 2d were higher than the fao 29 and who 30 guideline values wastewater with high ec concentration is unfit for various domestic and irrigation reuse purposes as it can lead to an increase in soil salinity in the agricultural fields 4 the tds values are also an important parameter like ec for determining salinity 4 which has been found significantly vary among sampling sites p 0 02 but the variation was insignificant among seasons p 0 106 total dissolved solids were highest in winter seasons most probably due to evaporation resulted from the higher temperature observed in the winter season fig 2a the average values recorded at all sampling sites 1269 4 1523 2 mg l were above 500 mg l the maximum permissible limit set by who 30 for domestic purposes and effluent discharge in water bodies and environment the significant variation of ca2 and k and insignificant variation of mg2 and na observed during the summer and winter seasons have direct implications on the sodium adsorption ratio sar value eq 13 whenever wastewater is planned for reuse purposes considering sar value is an important factor the average sar value of utw in the current study value ranged from 10 7 to 11 5 11 0 0 3 for summer and 5 9 6 8 6 3 0 3 fig 2d for winter seasons have significant variation p 0 004 and exceeded the fao limit 13 sar n a ca mg 2 2 heavy metal results showed that chromium nickel and arsenic were not identified in our study data are not presented here however hms in the order of fe pb zn cu mn cd were identified fig 2e except for fe p 0 002 the concentrations of hms have no significant difference with seasons fig 2e the values ranged 3 2 12 0 mg l for fe 1 20 0 4 3 mg l for pb 0 1 0 6 mg l for zn 0 0 1 7 mg l for cu 0 1 1 7 mg l for mn and 0 003 0 130 mg l for cd fig 2e metals like fe and mn are necessary for plant growth however they are required in trace amounts 6 if the required concentrations of hms are exceeded from fao recommendation table s3 from wastewater they can cause toxic and limit wastewater reuse potential 29 excessive iron eating may lead to the impairment of hematopoiesis by rescinding the progenitor cells as well as the microenvironment for hematopoiesis 19 the origin of hms that occur in the environment has resulted from natural processes and anthropogenic activities 59 a higher concentration of hms leads to degradation of soil health causing a potential risk to human health and plant growth 6 12 in this study the wastewater biological quality was analyzed by considering coliforms total and fecal coliforms and helminths eggs at different seasons fig 2f during both seasons the values were ranged from 2 9 to 6 3 log units for total coliform 2 6 6 8 log units for fecal coliform and 1 0 6 0 egg numbers l for helminths fig 2f there is no statistically significant difference for coliforms and helminths egg during summer and winter seasons however their mean averages were found to be higher than who 30 reuse recommended limits as a result the town utw was not recommended for reuse to grow crops without treatment table s3 fecal coliform bacteria when exists in wastewater indicate the presence of pathogenic bacteria that pose a health hazard especially for people consuming raw vegetables and fruits in the same study area 7 the level of microbial quality was investigated from vegetables irrigated with utw and found coliform levels that exceeded the who recommended level a recent study carried out in oman 60 about the environmental impact of using wastewater for irrigation purposes also identified higher indicator organisms in soil and groundwater that exceeded who standards 3 2 aerobic anoxic reactor contaminate removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 most of the utw wastewater quality indexes were found to be beyond the standard limits recommended by either fao who or eepa table s3 as a result amt wastewater quality is not fit for disposal or reuse purposes before treatment fig 3 shows the 60 actual wastewater feed to the treatment systems synthetic wastewater was used to acclimatize the alkaline microbial consortia which have no previous contact with known wastewater pollutants initially the reactors were operated with synthetic wastewater to acclimatize the lake microbes and then gradually replaced by actual wastewater for the synthetic wastewater the cod and nh4 n influent concentrations have fluctuated with a narrow range of variations however the influent concentrations have significantly fluctuated after the actual wastewater was used the influent cod concentrations were higher during summer seasons fig 3a while the nh4 n influent concentration was higher during winter seasons fig 3b the cod metabolizing microbes showed a significant reduction of the influent concentration before 25 days of acclimatization while the nh4 n oxidizing bacteria reduced half of the influent concentration after 35 days this suggests that alkaline microbes collected from rift valley lake and used as seed inoculum for the reactors respond rapidly to the om than nitrogen however acclimatization using activated sludge collected from wwtp reported from various treatment studies mentioned a more rapid cod consumption 25 34 37 than our results suggesting that relatively extended time is needed to the alkaline non effluent adapted organisms than effluent adapted activated sludge bacteria after one month of acclimatization the lake microbes adapt the system and became active to significantly reduce cod and nh4 n concentrations after two weeks of acclimation galvez et al 37 were also observed steady state conditions of nitrification from aerobic anoxic processes designed to evaluate the influence of hydraulic loading and air flowrate on urban wastewater nitrogen removal after three months of continuous operation using actual wastewater kim et al 34 also observed stable total nitrogen 76 3 and phosphorus 83 7 removals from aerobic anoxic reactors influent chemical oxygen demand tss and bod5 concentrations table 1 have been significantly decreased after treatment and below the eepa 31 recommendation level table s3 the overall cod concentration reduced from 471 0 23 5 mg l and 636 8 46 6 mg l table 1 for summer 95 0 and winter 92 7 fig 4 a seasons respectively after aerobic anoxic treatment the final tss 96 0 and bod5 91 0 effluent concentration were also reduced from 636 8 and 300 9 to 20 0 mg l for summer and 803 0 and 402 4 to 35 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 4a respectively relatively higher tss cod and bod5 removal efficiencies were observed during summer and aerobic treatment than winter season and anoxic reactor fig 4a the overall tss cod and bod5 removal efficiencies have also shown a statistical difference between the two seasons table 1 and aerobic and anoxic reactors p 0 05 of course during wintertime the cod loading rates were higher 6 854 18 774 kg day m3 than in summer 2 978 12 470 kg day m3 which might cause lower removal efficiency observed in the winter season table 1 overall efficient organic matter removal performance observed in the current reactor indicates that the seed biomass collected from rift valley chamo lake has been well acclimatized and consumed the organic contaminants enter into the reactor which actually differs from most studies that used activated sludge collected from wwtp as initial inoculum 34 37 51 similar to this study aerobic anoxic treatment was also designed to treat urban wastewater 37 and wastewater denitrification 34 and comparable results were observed for tss cod and bod5 resulted from the metabolic activity of the sludge bacteria during the aerobic anoxic treatment process total nitrogen and nh4 n values in the influent were found to be reduced from 115 2 8 2 and 46 1 3 6 mg l for summer and 99 3 15 0 and 33 1 2 5 mg l for winter seasons respectively total nitrogen and nh4 n removal efficiencies were higher in summer 92 0 seasons than winter season 85 0 fig 4b which is related to favorable summer temperature values that enhanced the activity of nitrifying bacteria best temperature range 20 30 c involved in the nitrogen cycle 51 higher tn and nh4 n removal efficiency observed in the aerobic reactor than anoxic reactor 1 0 mg l were also related to the higher do concentration that exists in the aerobic system the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic reactor was maintained between 2 0 3 0 mg l which is critical for aerobic bacteria to carry out the ammonification and nitrification process table s3 do is an important parameter that determines the rate of nitrifier growth and removal efficiency for biological wwtp 25 35 the influent no3 n and no2 n concentrations that enter into the aerobic anoxic process were low 2 5 3 8 and 0 2 0 4 mg l respectively however the concentration increased to 14 3 18 5 and 1 7 3 4 mg l in the aerobic reactor due to the nitrification process table 1 in the anoxic reactor no3 n and no2 n decreased 15 9 22 7 and 34 7 37 4 respectively from the aerobic reactor due to denitrification activity that could be occurred due to low do concentrations exist in the anoxic reactor 34 35 during the nitrification process nh4 n is initially converted into no2 n eq 1 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and then to no3 n by nitrite oxidizing bacteria eq 2 based on the result of different nitrogen form removals we can say that the advantage of combing the aerobic and anoxic system was effective for biological nitrogen removal for wastewater discharged at various sources rather than another previous study anoxic aerobic configuration that achieved 68 79 tn 35 with aerobic anoxic reactor configuration 42 tn removal was also achieved in another treatment which is by far lower than the results obtained in the current study table 2 34 this could be most probably due to various factors including the rift valley alkaline lake microbial seed inoculum used in this study wastewater type subjected for treatment and operating conditions indeed rift valley lake chamo 40 and lake chitu 42 microbial isolates had confirmed the potential candidate for alkaline wastewater treatment particularly textile wastewater which is known for color pollution resulted from nitrogen containing azo dyes phosphorus is a vital element for all forms of life however a higher amount of p released with untreated wastewater has a deleterious effect on the aquatic environment 27 as shown in table 1 the total phosphorus concentration before aerobic anoxic treatment has been surpassed the fao 29 standard limits the total phosphorus values after aerobic treatment were decreased from 15 5 to 1 3 mg l 91 6 for summer and 12 2 to 1 7 mg l 86 1 for winter seasons fig 4b table 1 however instead of further decreasing in the anoxic reactor the tp concentration has slightly increased to 4 0 mg l in summer and 5 1 mg l in winter seasons that leads the overall tp removal efficiency to be 73 8 and 58 2 in the aerobic anoxic reactor configuration respectively fig 4b this indicates that if amt wastewater treatment is targeting to fulfill discharge limits and safeguard the water environment post phosphorus treatment is necessary after aerobic anoxic treatment nevertheless the presence of n and p to a certain amount is advantageous and recommended for agricultural activities the better removal efficiency of tp observed under aerobic reactor than anoxic reactor is expected for phosphorus removal that phosphate accumulating organisms and released phosphate from to the solution under high and low oxygen conditions respectively a similar observation was also identified from other studies under the aerobic anoxic reactor configuration of wwtp 34 37 61 to figure out the aerobic anoxic reactor for various contaminants removal performance the overall reactor removal efficiencies of this study were compared with other previously published results table 2 although raw wastewater is collected from a domestic slaughterhouse textile factory hospital and fish processing sites that discharged different quality of water the overall mean water quality indexes have been found in the range of domestic wastewater previously reported 8 26 52 the wastewater is suitable for biological treatment without any sort of chemical pretreatment 54 62 the overall removal efficiency of the aerobic anoxic reactors for cod bod5 and tss have been found 96 91 94 and 92 95 fig 4 which is comparable to another aerobic anoxic treatment performance 90 that designed to remove organic matter from domestic wastewater table 2 34 61 however with the same reactor configuration lower cod 75 and tss 80 removal performance were observed from galvez et al 37 investigation dhaouefi et al 36 also achieved lower cod and tss removal efficiency with aerobic anoxic reactor configurations table 2 this could be due to the nature of wastewater quality inoculum used and operating conditions while the nature of wastewater for this study is domestic type others are shown here textile 36 and slaughterhouse 39 compared with other reactor configurations such as anoxic aerobic 32 35 anaerobic oxic anoxic 33 63 and anaerobic anoxic oxic 53 similar even higher organic matter removal efficiency results were observed in the current study table 2 however aerobic anoxic for tp removal efficiencies were relatively lower in the current study than organic matter removal of course other studies similar to the current configuration or other types also reported lower tp and tn removal efficiencies table 2 3 3 phytotoxicity effect of different water sources on crops the phytotoxicity effects of utw and trw on seed germination are depicted in table 3 in terms of germination there is no statistical difference between trw and tpw but both treatments significantly differed from vegetable seeds irrigated with utw table 3 the relative average toxicity of germinated seeds of cabbage with trw 100 and utw 33 table 3 was recorded 15 3 2 5 and 67 0 4 4 p 0 05 table 3 respectively in the case of tomato and lettuce irrigated with utw both 20 the relative germination rate was less than the control irrigated with and tpw which is statistically significant p 0 05 however the germination rates of cabbage p 0 158 and lettuce p 0 069 irrigated with trw have been found insignificant as compared to seedlings with tpw relatively higher germination percentage observed for the application of trw to irrigate cabbage tomato and lettuce than tpw most probably due to the optimum quantities of micronutrients and macronutrients available in trw essential for seedling growth but the germination percentage was statistically insignificant table 3 on the other hand inhibition of seed germination and consequent decline in germination percentage of the young seedlings irrigated with utw might be due to the high levels of salinity resulted due to ec tds and sar fig 2d that can be imbibed by the seed before germination starts this situation might be disturbed by the osmotic relation of the seeds with a water source and thus decrease the volume of water and oxygen uptake due to enhanced salinity several researchers mentioned that higher concentrations from different effluent sources cause higher osmotic pressure for the growing seeds and decrease overall growth performance 36 42 44 64 according to lenin et al 64 who has reported that the higher industrial effluent concentration application for growing sesamum indicum decreased enzyme dehydrogenase activity which is considered as one of the biochemical changes that might have disrupted germination and seedling growth activity the inhibitory effect on seed germination vigor index root length shoot length and dry weight also stated that utw brings high toxicity which is unsuitable for plant growth in the current study the average shoot length result of cabbage 1 3 cm tomato 1 2 cm and lettuce 1 4 cm irrigated with utw were significantly lower than trw table 3 the application of uww effects was most significant on the seedling physiology of cabbage 67 followed by lettuce 52 and tomato 22 table 3 suggesting that the capacity of tolerance depends on vegetable species 65 the reduction in seedling dry weight in utw effluent observed may be due to the presence of an excess amount of elements present in the wastewater effluent which results in the poor growth of seedlings in the lower concentration of municipal wastewater there might be no toxic effect on the seed rather it has some beneficial effect on the growth and development of the crops in certain concentrations of wastewater 44 the overall pot experiment results of this study showed that the length leaf chlorophyll content and root type of vegetables irrigated with trw were significantly higher than those vegetables irrigated with utw table 4 for example the average values of shoot length root length number of leaf and leaf area of tomatoes irrigated with trw were found 72 0 5 6 cm 15 0 2 7 cm 293 0 13 5 and 2 6 1 8 cm2 while it was 51 3 5 3 cm 8 7 1 5 cm 189 3 26 1 cm and 1 6 0 8 cm2 respectively for utw table 4 similarly previous studies have also demonstrated that various plant species irrigated with utw accumulate different contaminates into their tissue which has an effect on the shoot and root growth 10 11 20 66 for instance tiwari et al 67 studied metal contamination of soil and translocation in vegetables growing under industrial wastewater irrigated agricultural field of vadodara india and reported higher concentration of hms from uwt particularly in roots than trw which is consistent with this study the effects of pb and cd on seed germination growth root and shoot and dry weight of thespesia populnea l were also studied 68 and results showed that germination and growth of plant parts were significantly p 0 05 affected by different concentrations 10 30 50 and 70 μmol l of pb and cd as compared to control although some hms like cu co fe mn and zn are essential mineral nutrients for the shoot and root growth excess concentration of these hms is toxic to plant growth 10 11 13 20 21 69 for instance fe which is used to build chlorophyll toxicity in plants occurs when they accumulate 300 mg kg of fe at soil ph 5 0 70 naidoo 71 investigated the uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and their cellular effects in the mangrove bruguiera gymnorrhiza and observed the pahs deleterious effects on cells of the root cap meristem and conducting tissue than the control which supports our study in general comparing the different morphological growth of vegetables in the pot experiment showed that either tomato or cabbage takes the first highest place in the order of arrangements table 4 for instance the order of shoot length and chlorophyll chl a and b were tomato lettuce cabbage the orders for leaf number and tertiary root were also tomato cabbage lettuce the order for root length and secondary roots were found to be cabbage tomato lettuce as it is clearly seen from supplementary fig s2 the vegetables morphological growth were not significantly affected by different water source used for irrigating in the first four weeks of growth however after eight weeks of growth the leaf area the number of leaves secondary roots and tertiary roots increased significantly p 0 05 in irrigation with trw as compared to irrigation with utw in all vegetable crops figs s2a1 c2 table 4 the reduction in most of the growth morphology in vegetables under irrigation with utw might be attributed to higher concentrations exceeding fao and who of most parameters observed for utw figs 2a f as different literature reveals that micronutrients found in wastewater may be beneficial for plant growth 2 but several hms might produce undesirable effects on vegetables at higher concentrations 46 this is supported by the present study which indicated that visible indicators of toxicity looked on the vegetables irrigated with utw such as brown spots on tomato fruit fig s2a3 and leaf color and chlorosis and curling leaf margin figs s2a2 b2 and c2 color of the leaf as green with yellow and ovate shape was observed in vegetables irrigated with trw figs s2a1 b1 and c1 which is similar to tpw the average results of most detected hms from utw have been found exceeding fao and who standard limits set for domestic wastewater used for irrigation purposes cadmium and pb were reported to affect chlorophyll biosynthesis and inhibit protochlorophyll reductase and aminolevulinic acid synthesis 72 in this study the significant fall in the chlorophyll content under the utw might have been due to the inhibitory effect of toxicants of effluent on chlorophyll synthesis in an exposed plant most probably related to a higher concentration of cd and pb observed from raw effluent fig 2e and higher accumulation in vegetables fig 5 3 4 heavy metals in vegetables as shown in fig 5 fe detected in vegetables were highest among hms analyzed and then followed by mn and zn however the concentration of cd identified in vegetables has been found the least among all hms analyzed compared with vegetable edible parts the concentration of hms detected in tomato were found to be highest than cabbage and lettuce for example tomato was the highest 65 285 mg kg accumulator of fe followed by cabbage 55 190 mg kg and lettuce 45 180 mg kg fig 5 for zn lettuce irrigated with untreated wastewater has been the highest 40 1 2 0 mg kg accumulator followed by cabbage 31 0 1 5 mg kg and tomato 28 5 2 8 mg kg the average cu values identified in different vegetables were below who 60 mg kg 30 and fao 99 4 mg kg 29 standard limits however its concentrations for vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater were found to be exceeded the vegetables that grew with treated wastewater the values of cu for untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables have been found 4 8 5 3 and 4 4 times greater than treated wastewater for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively fig 5 similarly the pb values identified from untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables cabbage 75 times lettuce 57 times tomato 50 times exceeding who 30 standard limits set for vegetables 0 3 mg kg the cd concentrations identified in vegetables grew with untreated wastewater also greater tomato 10 times and cabbage lettuce 11 times than who 30 standard limit 0 2 mg kg as shown in fig 5 the level of cd concentration was highest in cabbage followed by lettuce and tomato 3 5 health risk assessment to understand the health risks of human being resulted from vegetable consumption identifying the daily metal intake is very essential 17 table 5 shows the values of dmi estimated in children and adults although human beings contracted hms in different ways 13 17 20 its health risk via food chain consumption is the main route of exposure reported in several studies 10 12 67 comparing the sources of water used for vegetable irrigation consuming untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables contributed highest hms exposure than tpw and trw table 5 for instance the highest daily metal intake of hms cd cu zn fe pb and mn for both age groups were found to be due to ingestion of vegetables tomato cabbage lettuce irrigated with untreated wastewater than other water sources trw and tpw as shown in table s1 the different body weight considered to estimate eq 9 is the main reason for higher dmi results observed in children than higher age groups adults irrespective of age vegetables and source of water used to grow vegetables the daily metal intake results were in the following order fe mn zn cu pb cd even though all the daily metal intake results 1 0 the result identified at lower age children that ingest tomato grew with untreated wastewater is 4250 times higher than the lowest daily metal intake result identified for cd in adults who consume tomato irrigated with the control water source tpw this indicates that the water source used to grow vegetables need a special consideration mainly for adults and children who ingest vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater as shown in table 6 the hri results observed in vegetables that grew with untreated wastewater significantly greater than vegetables irrigated with treated and control water sources for untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables the total health risk index results have been found highest for pb and least for cu however the hri was highest for cd followed by zn pb mn fe and cu for the control tpw and treated effluent cultivated vegetables the hri 1 0 and 1 0 are associated with adverse and safe levels of health respectively 11 17 48 73 except for pb children and cd adult and children greater than unity in vegetables irrigated with treated effluent the result of other hms hri for vegetables irrigated with treated and tpw was less than 1 0 table 6 this indicates that consuming untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables are contributing to a higher risk of pb and cd related disease than people consuming vegetables irrigated with treated effluent nevertheless vegetable consumption didn t cause a significant health risk associated with fe cu and mn although data not shown thq results of heavy metal in vegetables were found to be in the same order observed in hri in agreement with the current study relatively higher hri results for cd and pb were also identified in morocco 66 tanzania 21 china 47 india 67 and ethiopia 69 as stated above except for pb and cd grew with untreated wastewater vegetables consumption of vegetables didn t cause a health risk to consumers when considering individual hms however the probable health risks of hms can be increased when considering the hi value eq 12 21 the hi result orders follow cabbage lettuce tomato for both age groups children and adults considered fig 6 a in terms of water source used for irrigating vegetables the hi results were highest for untreated wastewater 3 217 6 259 followed by treated effluent 1 247 2 021 and tpw 0 467 0 915 fig 6a the sum of hi results was found to be greater than one for treated and untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables indicating that the health risk effect of consuming vegetables when all hms are evaluated togather as shown in fig 6b d cd and pb contributes the lion share among hms when computing hi percentage for instance in children the sum of cd and pb contributions for vegetable grown with treated effluent was found to be 57 7 59 0 and 55 6 for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively for the same age these metal cd and pb contributions for vegetable grown with untreated wastewater were found to be 74 1 81 3 and 76 4 for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively this suggests that cd and pb most likely be the main hms causing a potential health hazard for people in the study area who ingest vegetables irrigated with wastewater 4 conclusions wastewater reuse is a common practice in both developed and developing countries however in terms of environmental and public health concerns wastewater reuse is not recommended by fao and who before treatment aerobic anoxic reactors treatment designed to treat the domestic wastewater has been found efficiently to remove the organic and nutrients to the standard levels that can be reused safely for various purposes relative phytotoxicity tests showed that treated effluent vegetable seed germination showed minimal impact tomato lettuce cabbage than untreated effluent the concentration of cd and pb identified in vegetables irrigated with treated and untreated effluents have been found exceeding standard limits and become a potential health risk if eaten by the local inhabitants declaration of competing

13597,the agricultural sector requires a large volume of water 70 of global water which makes this sector difficult to produce enough food for the rapidly growing population demand with the existing scarce available freshwater source as a viable alternative water source urban wastewater reuse is a potential candidate however wastewater reuse and disposal before treatment pose a significant threat to human health and ecological systems this study was aimed to treat urban wastewater using aerobic anoxic system and then effluent evaluated to grow different vegetables wastewater samples collected arba minch town at nine sites during different seasons were used to characterized water quality physicochemical and biological parameters and feed aerobic anoxic reactors health risk as a result of vegetable ingestion was investigated using hri thq and hi statistically significant p 0 05 seasonal variation results were observed for temperature nh4 n no2 n and sodium adsorption ratio the performance of aerobic anoxic treatment for cod bod5 tss nh4 n tn and tp was 91 94 92 95 96 92 88 and 58 respectively the order of heavy metals concentration in raw wastewater was fe pb zn mn cu cd which is lower than corresponding heavy metals in vegetables having the order fe mn zn pb cu cd the phytotoxicity effect was significantly higher for cabbage followed by lettuce and tomato the hri thq and hi values for cd and pb 1 0 exceeded who and fao limits for vegetables irrigated with wastewater which could result in health risk in adults and children overall results confirmed that wastewater after aerobic anoxic treatment is a sustainable approach to maintain safe environmental and human health keywords wastewater reuse arba minch town aerobic anoxic treatment health risk heavy metals 1 introduction available freshwater used for various purposes is a scarce natural resource 1 climate change population growth contamination of water uneven distribution of water industrial and agricultural activities increased the demand for available freshwater use 2 3 for instance about 70 of the freshwater is used for agricultural activities 4 the shortage of available freshwater forced people to find an alternative solution that can sustain life in this regard wastewater is a potential candidate that can support the high water demanding sector i e agriculture 5 untreated wastewater utw utilization agriculture industry aquifers recharge ecosystems rehabilitation in various countries is well documented in the literature 1 3 4 6 although the use of utw has many advantages good nutrient supply and cheaper water sources it contains different contaminants that have a direct or indirect effect on human and environmental health 7 8 human health risks mostly contracted via consuming plants vegetables irrigated with utw include pathogens microbes and helminths and chemicals heavy elements 4 7 consumption of vegetables contaminated with heavy metals hms can develop potential diseases such as heart kidney brain blood liver and bone diseases 9 arsenic as cadmium cd cobalt co copper cu iron fe lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn are the most commonly reported hms in vegetables soil and wastewater 10 14 reports showed that consumption of food that contains an excess amount of cd brings renal damage hypertension emphysema carcinogenic changes mainly of kidney and prostate skeletal deformation and low reproduction functions in human beings 11 15 18 although the human body bones and teeth stores a large amounts of pb the excess amount of pb ingested from food may damage nervous systems inhibit heme formation damage kidneys cause anemia impaired mental development of young children cause carcinogenicity and genotoxicity 18 although mn is important to human health an excess amount of mn could be associated with devastating neurological impairments which are clinically called manganism 11 excessive fe deposition in the human body has also been reported to cause disease in the liver glands and heart a stomach disorder less bowel movement and black colored stools 18 19 poor wound healing anorexia depression diarrhea dermatitis and immune dysfunction also resulted from a deficiency of zn in the diet 20 21 heavy metal transfer in the soil is governed by organic matter om ph and cation exchange capacity cec for example metals form complex with om under alkaline soil ph which makes hms in the soil less mobile 22 23 aydin et al 23 observed less phytoavailability of hms in soil that contains high om which indicates the positive effect of wastewater application to irrigate vegetables with contaminated wastewater a detailed explanation about soil microbial activity cec ph and om also reviewed in other studies 4 22 24 disposal of utw containing a higher amount of nutrients and om to the surrounding water bodies also an important water quality concern that affects environmental health 25 26 recovering those nutrients including phosphorus and nitrogen brings a double environmental and economic benefit the main value is decreasing the amount of nutrients released into the aquatic environment eutrophication which is resulted from the discharge of om and nutrients p and n into the aquatic systems depleted the amount of dissolved oxygen conditions of hypoxia or anoxia in the water environment 27 oxygen depletion in the water body causes a huge amount of biodiversity loss 25 additional value recovering those nutrients for agricultural activity reduces the dependence on industrial fertilizers that require a significant amount of energy and resources 27 28 as a result utw utilization before treatment is restricted by the food and agriculture organization fao 29 and the world health organization who 30 the federal government of ethiopia also established the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa to safeguard the overall environment resulted from different contaminants 31 particularly the ethiopian regulation gave much emphasis to ph nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss which is also the interest of many other countries pollution control 2 to meet the regulations for discharge limits set for various wastewater contaminants treatment is very crucial recent studies have paid significant attention to biological organic matter and nutrient removal methods from wastewater 25 26 32 34 various environmental factors including do seasonal temperature ph organic loading rate and contact time affect nutrient and organic biological treatment 26 35 36 for instance domestic organic matter removal requires a sufficient amount of do for efficient biological wastewater treatment systems the same is true for nh4 n oxidation that demands a sufficient amount of do in its first step during the nitrification process nh4 n is first oxidized to no2 n eq 1 and then no3 n eq 2 by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria respectively under aerobic state nitrate in the absence of do is also reduced into n2 gas by heterotrophic bacteria eq 3 25 34 37 1 n h 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n

collected from different sites during the reconnaissance survey the possible source of wastewater discharged into water bodies has been identified from houses industries slaughterhouses and commercial sites and samples were collected at these sites and analyzed for the various physical chemical and biological parameters based on the preliminary water quality parameters and other factors environmental data sources of wastewater discharge and volume of wastewater released aerobic anoxic reactor configuration was designed the phytotoxicity effect of untreated and treated effluent was evaluated using lettuce cabbage and tomato commonly growing vegetables in the study area heavy metal contents were also analyzed to identify health risk exposure resulted from vegetable ingestion and the results were compared with different standards 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 arba minch town is geographically situated between 6 2 n and 37 33 e with an altitude of 1100 1350 m a s l the town received its name called arba minch from forty springs available at the outskirt of the town it is located in the southern part of ethiopia part of rift valley region more information about the study area is available in our previous study 38 in the study area banana mango avocado maize and different vegetables are irrigated with rivers kulfo and hare and utw for example utw discharged from arba minch university main campus mc is commonly used in the study area to grow different fruits and vegetables untreated wastewater discharge from hospital h textile factory tf abaya campus ac secha town st kulfo kebele kk sikela town skt ethio fishery ef and slaughterhouse sh was also commonly used to grow various crops vegetables and considered here as a potential sample collection site fig 1 2 2 experimental design and microbial inoculum acclimatization to evaluate amt wastewater quality and reuse potential aerobic anoxic treatment system was designed in arba minch university abaya campus fig 1 fig s1 since there is no wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the town finding an initial inoculum sludge as used in most other studies 35 36 39 was a problem however our previous study showed that isolates from alkaline rift valley lake i e lake chamo efficiently treated textile wastewater 40 and considered here as a potential candidate microbial consortia initially seeded to the aerobic anoxic reactors the reason behind using such rift valley alkaline lake microbial consortia for this study was also based on the results from the pre analysis of amt wastewater ph which has been found alkaline in nature fig 2 a the aerobic and anoxic reactors were initially filled 10 with microbial consortia collected from chamo lake water and sediment 20 cm depth samples were collected from lake chamo and filled 10 of the aerobic 20 l and anoxic 20 l reactors respectively by considering the topwater aerobic and sediment anoxic states the lake microbial consortia were first acclimatized with synthetic media used by guadie et al 25 with some modifications it comprises 175 mg l starch 200 mg l c6h6o6 28 mg l peptone 64 mg l nh2conh2 150 mg l nh4cl 52 5 mg l kh2po4 150 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l caso4 2h2o and one ml of trace solution 25 the acclimatization with synthetic wastewater was done for a month and gradually reduced the synthetic wastewater with actual wastewater with a proportion of synthetic actual wastewater 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 after acclimatization the raw wastewater collected periodically from different sites were mixed in a big influent storage tank 80 l and pumped to the aerobic reactor at various organic loading rate and hydraulic residence time the organic loading rate 2 978 12 47 kg m3 day for summer and 6 854 18 774 kg m3 day for winter seasons was considered after the cod and flow rate identified the effluent collected from aerobic reactor becomes influent of anoxic reactor that feeds the system at a constant flow rate the effluent from the anoxic reactor was also pumped into the sedimentation tank where the effluent and the activated sludge separated a portion of the activated sludge from the sedimentation tank was returned to the aerobic tank so as to keep enough biomass concentration in the aerobic reactor the aerobic reactor was also continuously stirred at 300 rpm to mix biomass and air supplied to maintain the do level 2 0 mg l in the reactor 2 3 wastewater sampling and analysis wastewater from nine sampling sites fig 1 were collected using a pre sterilized 2000 ml sampling bottle at a depth of 40 50 cm below the water surfaces 41 this was done to avoid the collection of surface impurities and suspended solids after samples collected it was placed in ice box transported to the laboratory and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c until analysis is done similarly samples were also periodically collected from reactors to identify key wastewater indexes 41 wastewater quality was analyzed for temperature ph ec do tds tss cod bod5 nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus metals na k mg ca mn pb cu ni fe cd co cr and non metals cl co3 2 hco3 so4 2 among these ec temperature tds do and ph were measured on the sites 41 the remaining parameters were also analyzed following standard protocols 41 the temperature and ph values were measured in situ using a thermometer and ph meter hq40d hach usa respectively 42 conductivity value also measured using a conductivity meter 430 jenway uk faas pe aa400 perkin elmer usa has been used to identify different metal concentrations microbial contamination analysis was also conducted according to apha 41 methods to evaluate the removal efficiency of the wastewater contaminants in the aerobic anoxic reactors

the phytotoxicity analysis was used to assess the toxicity of seed germination for this experiment certified healthy and equally sized seeds of tomato solanum lycopersicum lettuce lactuca sativa and cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata were procured from the local seed supplier located in debrezeit town and were scarified in 85 h2so4 for 35 min and sterilized in 0 2 hgcl2 for 2 min to remove any fungal growth 43 the seeds were placed in petri dishes 10 cm lined with filter paper each petridish was watering with five ml of utw and treated wastewater trw into the respective petridish and then incubated at room temperature the tap water tpw was also used as control various growth morphological parameters such as germination eq 5 seedling length eq 6 and seedling vigor index svi eq 7 were evaluated 44 the relative toxicity of trw and utw on the seed germination and seedling growth of each vegetable was also calculated to determine the degree of inhibition of control eq 8 following

control at a particular hour of incubation y germination percentage or seedling length in the presence of effluent at the same hour of incubation after the germination test the pots experimental setup was conducted to investigate the toxicity effect of utw and trw on the same vegetable tomato lettuce and cabbage with reference to irrigation of tpw as a control group for pot culture 27 plastic pots 23 in top diameter 10 bottom and 15 cm high were filled with an equal 2 kg amount of air dried sandy loam soil the seeds of tomato lettuce and cabbage were sown in each pot irrigation was carried out from the seedling stage based on actual water requirement irrigated approximately every day 100 ml target wastewater at a time in one pot followed by 50 ml of nutrient solution following the method used elsewhere 45 the experiment was run under standard local conditions of temperature and relative humidity when the plants were growing morphological characteristics like length shoot and root leaf area and number weight fresh and dry and chlorophyll contents were measured at different times 4 8 and 16 weeks 2 5 evaluating the potential health risks reports showed that human beings contracted hms mainly via the food chain 20 46 heavy metal concentration in vegetables soil and body weight of consumers were used to calculate health related risks such as daily metal intake dmi health risk index hri target hazard quotient thq and hazard index hi the risk index dmi hri thq and hi values were calculated based on eqs 9 12 a detail explanation of each equation has been shown in our previous study 38 more information about daily food intake dfi conversion factor cf from fresh to dry vegetable weight body weight bw exposure frequency ef exposure duration ed and the average time for non

the one way analysis of variance anova with tukey post hoc test was done to obtain statistical significance between mean values pearson correlation analysis was also performed to analyze the relationship between aerobic anoxic treatment and the physicochemical values of the wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater quality according to the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma the whole country has three seasons based on the mean trends of temperature and rainfall 50 these are summer june september winter october january and spring february may seasons which are characterized by long time heavy rainfall dry and short moderate rainfall respectively fig 3 shows the mean average results of different water quality parameters collected at different sites of amt during summer and winter seasons among the sampling sites higher water index such as cod bod5 tss ec tn and tp values were identified from sh tf which have no dyeing step ef and mc sites which released untreated sewage into the surrounding environment table s2 however due to the dilution effect during mixing equal amounts of the nine samples that used for feed preparation the overall wastewater composite values were found in the range of domestic wastewater previously reported 51 53 it is suitable bod5 cod 0 63 for biological treatment that is readily biodegradable without any kind of pretreatment 54 so far there is no wwtp in the town rather sewage at different sites is directly discharging into the surrounding water bodies particularly lakes abaya and chamo fig 1 the two rift valley lakes separated by god bridge among the current sampling sites arba minch university mc wastewater released from staff resident areas student dormitories offices cafeterias and laboratories goes to hare river that later ends to abaya lake kulfo river which crosses the town also received wastewater discharges from the rest of the sampling sites and finally ends at lake chamo during rainy seasons the kulfo river overflow discharge from normal watercourse also led to lake abaya which is currently becoming a serious concern of water pollution particularly rampant water hyacinth growth problem in the area the wastewater temperature varied in summer 15 9 28 6 c and winter 17 1 31 8 c seasons fig 2a the average winter season temperature 25 8 2 3 c was significantly p 0 001 higher than the summer season average temperature 23 1 1 2 c fig 2a which is similar to another study 52 temperature is a crucial physicochemical wastewater parameter that significantly influences biological and chemical reactions in the aquatic ecosystem and wwtp 8 40 51 55 the mean ph value of all sites found to be 9 1 0 2 for summer and 9 4 0 2 for winter seasons fig 2a since amt is situated in the rift valley region which is characterized by higher temperature salinity and basic natures ph 9 0 40 42 alkaline ph is expected from the raw wastewater textile wastewater which is characterized by higher ph value ph 10 5 also part of the mix formation increased ph value in the current study from most domestic wastewater ph value 8 0 reported from the literature 35 51 is not surprising comparing seasonal variations a range of higher ph values 9 3 9 8 were observed in the winter season than summer 8 7 9 4 which is similar to other studies 8 52 however the ph variation was statistically insignificant p 0 08 between summer and winter seasons table s3 as observed in other studies 52 56 relatively higher ph values observed during the summer seasons also most likely due to the effect of lower temperatures and carbonic acid in the wastewater it is known that temperature and ph have an inverse relationship which means that at lower summer temperature a higher ph value is expected a higher concentration of co3 2 in the wastewater table s3 also leads it to react with h2o that forms oh which increased the ph value the correlation coefficient matrix table s4 showed that ph with co3 2 r 0 89 has a strong positive significant correlation that indicates carbonate contributed to the alkalinity in the wastewater it has been reported that ph range 6 5 8 4 is recommended for reuse purposes 29 but ph out of this range values fig 2a might cause a nutritional imbalance or may increase the level of toxic ions 57 total suspended solids in produced water may include the floating or drifting materials found in the water such as silt sediment sand algae and plankton 24 the tss results were found to be 636 8 59 1 456 0 763 0 for summer and 803 0 96 9 629 0 1189 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 2b these values have been found insignificantly different among seasons p 0 064 table s3 the bod5 concentration from all sampling sites has fluctuated between 185 5 439 0 300 9 55 2 mg l for summer and 293 9 672 5 402 4 47 9 mg l for winter seasons fig 2b but the fluctuation is statistically insignificant among seasons p 0 057 table s3 insignificant variation p 0 066 of cod values was also observed in summer 471 0 45 4 and winter 636 8 59 0 seasons fig 2b the lower bod5 and cod concentration in summer might be due to the dilution effect of the rainy summer season and mesophilic range of temperature 20 45 c 40 that stimulates heterotrophic bacteria to consume a large amount of organic contaminants and do the ratio of bod5 to cod 0 63 suggests that the mixed wastewater collected at different sites are easily biodegradable and could be treated through conventional biological treatment method 58 the magnitude of pollutant removal using microbial activity is closely linked to the existence of simply biodegradable carbon source which is the limiting factor in most biological treatment processes 26 although fao and who have no standard for bod5 and cod the current result did not fulfill the ethiopian environmental protection standard limits set 31 for bod5 and cod discharge values to the water body table s3 the tn and nh4 n concentration vary from 52 6 169 8 115 2 44 8 and 21 0 67 9 46 1 16 8 mg l for summer and 27 8 157 5 99 3 48 9 and 9 3 52 5 33 1 16 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 2c the mean no3 n and no2 n concentrations were also found to be 3 8 1 4 and 0 2 0 1 mg l for summer and 2 5 1 3 and 0 4 0 1 mg l for winter seasons except for no2 n p 0 006 and nh4 n p 0 016 there was no significant difference between the different nitrogen forms observed in both seasons table s3 the concentration of the different nitrogen forms is higher in the summer seasons which presumably the greater rate of microbial biodegradation of protein urea and amino acids at higher summer temperatures the other higher nitrogen forms in the summer season most likely due to higher fertilizer applied in the surrounding area washed into the different sampling sites with the heavy summer rain correlation coefficient matrix table s4 revealed that a strong positive correlation was found between tn with bod5 r 0 63 cod r 0 72 tss r 0 77 and tds r 0 81 while negative correlation was observed with do r 0 83 the nh4 n concentration identified during summer and winter values is higher than the eepa 31 standard value 30 mg l set for wastewater effluent discharges to the water bodies table s3 however the no3 n concentration was found to be lower than the fao standard value set for wastewater recommended for reuse purposes although the values of tp fluctuated among different sites between 6 3 27 2 15 5 7 0 mg l for summer and 1 2 24 8 12 2 8 3 mg l for winter there is no clear evidence p 0 390 to support the seasonal variation fig 2c however a relatively higher tp concentration in summer might be due to the rain supposed to brought phosphate and phosphate containing loaded compounds from a different point and non point sources runoff carrying phosphate containing fertilizer use from agricultural land the average tp values detected in both seasons have been found exceeded the fao 29 standard limit table s3 although higher values of ec were recorded during the winter dry season 3 5 0 9 ds m than the summer rainy season 2 7 0 7 ds m fig 2d the variations were found insignificant p 0 190 the average mean ec values recorded in all sites fig 2d were higher than the fao 29 and who 30 guideline values wastewater with high ec concentration is unfit for various domestic and irrigation reuse purposes as it can lead to an increase in soil salinity in the agricultural fields 4 the tds values are also an important parameter like ec for determining salinity 4 which has been found significantly vary among sampling sites p 0 02 but the variation was insignificant among seasons p 0 106 total dissolved solids were highest in winter seasons most probably due to evaporation resulted from the higher temperature observed in the winter season fig 2a the average values recorded at all sampling sites 1269 4 1523 2 mg l were above 500 mg l the maximum permissible limit set by who 30 for domestic purposes and effluent discharge in water bodies and environment the significant variation of ca2 and k and insignificant variation of mg2 and na observed during the summer and winter seasons have direct implications on the sodium adsorption ratio sar value eq 13 whenever wastewater is planned for reuse purposes considering sar value is an important factor the average sar value of utw in the current study value ranged from 10 7 to 11 5 11 0 0 3 for summer and 5 9 6 8 6 3 0 3 fig 2d for winter seasons have significant variation p 0 004 and exceeded the fao limit 13 sar n a ca mg 2 2 heavy metal results showed that chromium nickel and arsenic were not identified in our study data are not presented here however hms in the order of fe pb zn cu mn cd were identified fig 2e except for fe p 0 002 the concentrations of hms have no significant difference with seasons fig 2e the values ranged 3 2 12 0 mg l for fe 1 20 0 4 3 mg l for pb 0 1 0 6 mg l for zn 0 0 1 7 mg l for cu 0 1 1 7 mg l for mn and 0 003 0 130 mg l for cd fig 2e metals like fe and mn are necessary for plant growth however they are required in trace amounts 6 if the required concentrations of hms are exceeded from fao recommendation table s3 from wastewater they can cause toxic and limit wastewater reuse potential 29 excessive iron eating may lead to the impairment of hematopoiesis by rescinding the progenitor cells as well as the microenvironment for hematopoiesis 19 the origin of hms that occur in the environment has resulted from natural processes and anthropogenic activities 59 a higher concentration of hms leads to degradation of soil health causing a potential risk to human health and plant growth 6 12 in this study the wastewater biological quality was analyzed by considering coliforms total and fecal coliforms and helminths eggs at different seasons fig 2f during both seasons the values were ranged from 2 9 to 6 3 log units for total coliform 2 6 6 8 log units for fecal coliform and 1 0 6 0 egg numbers l for helminths fig 2f there is no statistically significant difference for coliforms and helminths egg during summer and winter seasons however their mean averages were found to be higher than who 30 reuse recommended limits as a result the town utw was not recommended for reuse to grow crops without treatment table s3 fecal coliform bacteria when exists in wastewater indicate the presence of pathogenic bacteria that pose a health hazard especially for people consuming raw vegetables and fruits in the same study area 7 the level of microbial quality was investigated from vegetables irrigated with utw and found coliform levels that exceeded the who recommended level a recent study carried out in oman 60 about the environmental impact of using wastewater for irrigation purposes also identified higher indicator organisms in soil and groundwater that exceeded who standards 3 2 aerobic anoxic reactor contaminate removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 most of the utw wastewater quality indexes were found to be beyond the standard limits recommended by either fao who or eepa table s3 as a result amt wastewater quality is not fit for disposal or reuse purposes before treatment fig 3 shows the 60 actual wastewater feed to the treatment systems synthetic wastewater was used to acclimatize the alkaline microbial consortia which have no previous contact with known wastewater pollutants initially the reactors were operated with synthetic wastewater to acclimatize the lake microbes and then gradually replaced by actual wastewater for the synthetic wastewater the cod and nh4 n influent concentrations have fluctuated with a narrow range of variations however the influent concentrations have significantly fluctuated after the actual wastewater was used the influent cod concentrations were higher during summer seasons fig 3a while the nh4 n influent concentration was higher during winter seasons fig 3b the cod metabolizing microbes showed a significant reduction of the influent concentration before 25 days of acclimatization while the nh4 n oxidizing bacteria reduced half of the influent concentration after 35 days this suggests that alkaline microbes collected from rift valley lake and used as seed inoculum for the reactors respond rapidly to the om than nitrogen however acclimatization using activated sludge collected from wwtp reported from various treatment studies mentioned a more rapid cod consumption 25 34 37 than our results suggesting that relatively extended time is needed to the alkaline non effluent adapted organisms than effluent adapted activated sludge bacteria after one month of acclimatization the lake microbes adapt the system and became active to significantly reduce cod and nh4 n concentrations after two weeks of acclimation galvez et al 37 were also observed steady state conditions of nitrification from aerobic anoxic processes designed to evaluate the influence of hydraulic loading and air flowrate on urban wastewater nitrogen removal after three months of continuous operation using actual wastewater kim et al 34 also observed stable total nitrogen 76 3 and phosphorus 83 7 removals from aerobic anoxic reactors influent chemical oxygen demand tss and bod5 concentrations table 1 have been significantly decreased after treatment and below the eepa 31 recommendation level table s3 the overall cod concentration reduced from 471 0 23 5 mg l and 636 8 46 6 mg l table 1 for summer 95 0 and winter 92 7 fig 4 a seasons respectively after aerobic anoxic treatment the final tss 96 0 and bod5 91 0 effluent concentration were also reduced from 636 8 and 300 9 to 20 0 mg l for summer and 803 0 and 402 4 to 35 0 mg l for winter seasons fig 4a respectively relatively higher tss cod and bod5 removal efficiencies were observed during summer and aerobic treatment than winter season and anoxic reactor fig 4a the overall tss cod and bod5 removal efficiencies have also shown a statistical difference between the two seasons table 1 and aerobic and anoxic reactors p 0 05 of course during wintertime the cod loading rates were higher 6 854 18 774 kg day m3 than in summer 2 978 12 470 kg day m3 which might cause lower removal efficiency observed in the winter season table 1 overall efficient organic matter removal performance observed in the current reactor indicates that the seed biomass collected from rift valley chamo lake has been well acclimatized and consumed the organic contaminants enter into the reactor which actually differs from most studies that used activated sludge collected from wwtp as initial inoculum 34 37 51 similar to this study aerobic anoxic treatment was also designed to treat urban wastewater 37 and wastewater denitrification 34 and comparable results were observed for tss cod and bod5 resulted from the metabolic activity of the sludge bacteria during the aerobic anoxic treatment process total nitrogen and nh4 n values in the influent were found to be reduced from 115 2 8 2 and 46 1 3 6 mg l for summer and 99 3 15 0 and 33 1 2 5 mg l for winter seasons respectively total nitrogen and nh4 n removal efficiencies were higher in summer 92 0 seasons than winter season 85 0 fig 4b which is related to favorable summer temperature values that enhanced the activity of nitrifying bacteria best temperature range 20 30 c involved in the nitrogen cycle 51 higher tn and nh4 n removal efficiency observed in the aerobic reactor than anoxic reactor 1 0 mg l were also related to the higher do concentration that exists in the aerobic system the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic reactor was maintained between 2 0 3 0 mg l which is critical for aerobic bacteria to carry out the ammonification and nitrification process table s3 do is an important parameter that determines the rate of nitrifier growth and removal efficiency for biological wwtp 25 35 the influent no3 n and no2 n concentrations that enter into the aerobic anoxic process were low 2 5 3 8 and 0 2 0 4 mg l respectively however the concentration increased to 14 3 18 5 and 1 7 3 4 mg l in the aerobic reactor due to the nitrification process table 1 in the anoxic reactor no3 n and no2 n decreased 15 9 22 7 and 34 7 37 4 respectively from the aerobic reactor due to denitrification activity that could be occurred due to low do concentrations exist in the anoxic reactor 34 35 during the nitrification process nh4 n is initially converted into no2 n eq 1 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and then to no3 n by nitrite oxidizing bacteria eq 2 based on the result of different nitrogen form removals we can say that the advantage of combing the aerobic and anoxic system was effective for biological nitrogen removal for wastewater discharged at various sources rather than another previous study anoxic aerobic configuration that achieved 68 79 tn 35 with aerobic anoxic reactor configuration 42 tn removal was also achieved in another treatment which is by far lower than the results obtained in the current study table 2 34 this could be most probably due to various factors including the rift valley alkaline lake microbial seed inoculum used in this study wastewater type subjected for treatment and operating conditions indeed rift valley lake chamo 40 and lake chitu 42 microbial isolates had confirmed the potential candidate for alkaline wastewater treatment particularly textile wastewater which is known for color pollution resulted from nitrogen containing azo dyes phosphorus is a vital element for all forms of life however a higher amount of p released with untreated wastewater has a deleterious effect on the aquatic environment 27 as shown in table 1 the total phosphorus concentration before aerobic anoxic treatment has been surpassed the fao 29 standard limits the total phosphorus values after aerobic treatment were decreased from 15 5 to 1 3 mg l 91 6 for summer and 12 2 to 1 7 mg l 86 1 for winter seasons fig 4b table 1 however instead of further decreasing in the anoxic reactor the tp concentration has slightly increased to 4 0 mg l in summer and 5 1 mg l in winter seasons that leads the overall tp removal efficiency to be 73 8 and 58 2 in the aerobic anoxic reactor configuration respectively fig 4b this indicates that if amt wastewater treatment is targeting to fulfill discharge limits and safeguard the water environment post phosphorus treatment is necessary after aerobic anoxic treatment nevertheless the presence of n and p to a certain amount is advantageous and recommended for agricultural activities the better removal efficiency of tp observed under aerobic reactor than anoxic reactor is expected for phosphorus removal that phosphate accumulating organisms and released phosphate from to the solution under high and low oxygen conditions respectively a similar observation was also identified from other studies under the aerobic anoxic reactor configuration of wwtp 34 37 61 to figure out the aerobic anoxic reactor for various contaminants removal performance the overall reactor removal efficiencies of this study were compared with other previously published results table 2 although raw wastewater is collected from a domestic slaughterhouse textile factory hospital and fish processing sites that discharged different quality of water the overall mean water quality indexes have been found in the range of domestic wastewater previously reported 8 26 52 the wastewater is suitable for biological treatment without any sort of chemical pretreatment 54 62 the overall removal efficiency of the aerobic anoxic reactors for cod bod5 and tss have been found 96 91 94 and 92 95 fig 4 which is comparable to another aerobic anoxic treatment performance 90 that designed to remove organic matter from domestic wastewater table 2 34 61 however with the same reactor configuration lower cod 75 and tss 80 removal performance were observed from galvez et al 37 investigation dhaouefi et al 36 also achieved lower cod and tss removal efficiency with aerobic anoxic reactor configurations table 2 this could be due to the nature of wastewater quality inoculum used and operating conditions while the nature of wastewater for this study is domestic type others are shown here textile 36 and slaughterhouse 39 compared with other reactor configurations such as anoxic aerobic 32 35 anaerobic oxic anoxic 33 63 and anaerobic anoxic oxic 53 similar even higher organic matter removal efficiency results were observed in the current study table 2 however aerobic anoxic for tp removal efficiencies were relatively lower in the current study than organic matter removal of course other studies similar to the current configuration or other types also reported lower tp and tn removal efficiencies table 2 3 3 phytotoxicity effect of different water sources on crops the phytotoxicity effects of utw and trw on seed germination are depicted in table 3 in terms of germination there is no statistical difference between trw and tpw but both treatments significantly differed from vegetable seeds irrigated with utw table 3 the relative average toxicity of germinated seeds of cabbage with trw 100 and utw 33 table 3 was recorded 15 3 2 5 and 67 0 4 4 p 0 05 table 3 respectively in the case of tomato and lettuce irrigated with utw both 20 the relative germination rate was less than the control irrigated with and tpw which is statistically significant p 0 05 however the germination rates of cabbage p 0 158 and lettuce p 0 069 irrigated with trw have been found insignificant as compared to seedlings with tpw relatively higher germination percentage observed for the application of trw to irrigate cabbage tomato and lettuce than tpw most probably due to the optimum quantities of micronutrients and macronutrients available in trw essential for seedling growth but the germination percentage was statistically insignificant table 3 on the other hand inhibition of seed germination and consequent decline in germination percentage of the young seedlings irrigated with utw might be due to the high levels of salinity resulted due to ec tds and sar fig 2d that can be imbibed by the seed before germination starts this situation might be disturbed by the osmotic relation of the seeds with a water source and thus decrease the volume of water and oxygen uptake due to enhanced salinity several researchers mentioned that higher concentrations from different effluent sources cause higher osmotic pressure for the growing seeds and decrease overall growth performance 36 42 44 64 according to lenin et al 64 who has reported that the higher industrial effluent concentration application for growing sesamum indicum decreased enzyme dehydrogenase activity which is considered as one of the biochemical changes that might have disrupted germination and seedling growth activity the inhibitory effect on seed germination vigor index root length shoot length and dry weight also stated that utw brings high toxicity which is unsuitable for plant growth in the current study the average shoot length result of cabbage 1 3 cm tomato 1 2 cm and lettuce 1 4 cm irrigated with utw were significantly lower than trw table 3 the application of uww effects was most significant on the seedling physiology of cabbage 67 followed by lettuce 52 and tomato 22 table 3 suggesting that the capacity of tolerance depends on vegetable species 65 the reduction in seedling dry weight in utw effluent observed may be due to the presence of an excess amount of elements present in the wastewater effluent which results in the poor growth of seedlings in the lower concentration of municipal wastewater there might be no toxic effect on the seed rather it has some beneficial effect on the growth and development of the crops in certain concentrations of wastewater 44 the overall pot experiment results of this study showed that the length leaf chlorophyll content and root type of vegetables irrigated with trw were significantly higher than those vegetables irrigated with utw table 4 for example the average values of shoot length root length number of leaf and leaf area of tomatoes irrigated with trw were found 72 0 5 6 cm 15 0 2 7 cm 293 0 13 5 and 2 6 1 8 cm2 while it was 51 3 5 3 cm 8 7 1 5 cm 189 3 26 1 cm and 1 6 0 8 cm2 respectively for utw table 4 similarly previous studies have also demonstrated that various plant species irrigated with utw accumulate different contaminates into their tissue which has an effect on the shoot and root growth 10 11 20 66 for instance tiwari et al 67 studied metal contamination of soil and translocation in vegetables growing under industrial wastewater irrigated agricultural field of vadodara india and reported higher concentration of hms from uwt particularly in roots than trw which is consistent with this study the effects of pb and cd on seed germination growth root and shoot and dry weight of thespesia populnea l were also studied 68 and results showed that germination and growth of plant parts were significantly p 0 05 affected by different concentrations 10 30 50 and 70 μmol l of pb and cd as compared to control although some hms like cu co fe mn and zn are essential mineral nutrients for the shoot and root growth excess concentration of these hms is toxic to plant growth 10 11 13 20 21 69 for instance fe which is used to build chlorophyll toxicity in plants occurs when they accumulate 300 mg kg of fe at soil ph 5 0 70 naidoo 71 investigated the uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and their cellular effects in the mangrove bruguiera gymnorrhiza and observed the pahs deleterious effects on cells of the root cap meristem and conducting tissue than the control which supports our study in general comparing the different morphological growth of vegetables in the pot experiment showed that either tomato or cabbage takes the first highest place in the order of arrangements table 4 for instance the order of shoot length and chlorophyll chl a and b were tomato lettuce cabbage the orders for leaf number and tertiary root were also tomato cabbage lettuce the order for root length and secondary roots were found to be cabbage tomato lettuce as it is clearly seen from supplementary fig s2 the vegetables morphological growth were not significantly affected by different water source used for irrigating in the first four weeks of growth however after eight weeks of growth the leaf area the number of leaves secondary roots and tertiary roots increased significantly p 0 05 in irrigation with trw as compared to irrigation with utw in all vegetable crops figs s2a1 c2 table 4 the reduction in most of the growth morphology in vegetables under irrigation with utw might be attributed to higher concentrations exceeding fao and who of most parameters observed for utw figs 2a f as different literature reveals that micronutrients found in wastewater may be beneficial for plant growth 2 but several hms might produce undesirable effects on vegetables at higher concentrations 46 this is supported by the present study which indicated that visible indicators of toxicity looked on the vegetables irrigated with utw such as brown spots on tomato fruit fig s2a3 and leaf color and chlorosis and curling leaf margin figs s2a2 b2 and c2 color of the leaf as green with yellow and ovate shape was observed in vegetables irrigated with trw figs s2a1 b1 and c1 which is similar to tpw the average results of most detected hms from utw have been found exceeding fao and who standard limits set for domestic wastewater used for irrigation purposes cadmium and pb were reported to affect chlorophyll biosynthesis and inhibit protochlorophyll reductase and aminolevulinic acid synthesis 72 in this study the significant fall in the chlorophyll content under the utw might have been due to the inhibitory effect of toxicants of effluent on chlorophyll synthesis in an exposed plant most probably related to a higher concentration of cd and pb observed from raw effluent fig 2e and higher accumulation in vegetables fig 5 3 4 heavy metals in vegetables as shown in fig 5 fe detected in vegetables were highest among hms analyzed and then followed by mn and zn however the concentration of cd identified in vegetables has been found the least among all hms analyzed compared with vegetable edible parts the concentration of hms detected in tomato were found to be highest than cabbage and lettuce for example tomato was the highest 65 285 mg kg accumulator of fe followed by cabbage 55 190 mg kg and lettuce 45 180 mg kg fig 5 for zn lettuce irrigated with untreated wastewater has been the highest 40 1 2 0 mg kg accumulator followed by cabbage 31 0 1 5 mg kg and tomato 28 5 2 8 mg kg the average cu values identified in different vegetables were below who 60 mg kg 30 and fao 99 4 mg kg 29 standard limits however its concentrations for vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater were found to be exceeded the vegetables that grew with treated wastewater the values of cu for untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables have been found 4 8 5 3 and 4 4 times greater than treated wastewater for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively fig 5 similarly the pb values identified from untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables cabbage 75 times lettuce 57 times tomato 50 times exceeding who 30 standard limits set for vegetables 0 3 mg kg the cd concentrations identified in vegetables grew with untreated wastewater also greater tomato 10 times and cabbage lettuce 11 times than who 30 standard limit 0 2 mg kg as shown in fig 5 the level of cd concentration was highest in cabbage followed by lettuce and tomato 3 5 health risk assessment to understand the health risks of human being resulted from vegetable consumption identifying the daily metal intake is very essential 17 table 5 shows the values of dmi estimated in children and adults although human beings contracted hms in different ways 13 17 20 its health risk via food chain consumption is the main route of exposure reported in several studies 10 12 67 comparing the sources of water used for vegetable irrigation consuming untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables contributed highest hms exposure than tpw and trw table 5 for instance the highest daily metal intake of hms cd cu zn fe pb and mn for both age groups were found to be due to ingestion of vegetables tomato cabbage lettuce irrigated with untreated wastewater than other water sources trw and tpw as shown in table s1 the different body weight considered to estimate eq 9 is the main reason for higher dmi results observed in children than higher age groups adults irrespective of age vegetables and source of water used to grow vegetables the daily metal intake results were in the following order fe mn zn cu pb cd even though all the daily metal intake results 1 0 the result identified at lower age children that ingest tomato grew with untreated wastewater is 4250 times higher than the lowest daily metal intake result identified for cd in adults who consume tomato irrigated with the control water source tpw this indicates that the water source used to grow vegetables need a special consideration mainly for adults and children who ingest vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater as shown in table 6 the hri results observed in vegetables that grew with untreated wastewater significantly greater than vegetables irrigated with treated and control water sources for untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables the total health risk index results have been found highest for pb and least for cu however the hri was highest for cd followed by zn pb mn fe and cu for the control tpw and treated effluent cultivated vegetables the hri 1 0 and 1 0 are associated with adverse and safe levels of health respectively 11 17 48 73 except for pb children and cd adult and children greater than unity in vegetables irrigated with treated effluent the result of other hms hri for vegetables irrigated with treated and tpw was less than 1 0 table 6 this indicates that consuming untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables are contributing to a higher risk of pb and cd related disease than people consuming vegetables irrigated with treated effluent nevertheless vegetable consumption didn t cause a significant health risk associated with fe cu and mn although data not shown thq results of heavy metal in vegetables were found to be in the same order observed in hri in agreement with the current study relatively higher hri results for cd and pb were also identified in morocco 66 tanzania 21 china 47 india 67 and ethiopia 69 as stated above except for pb and cd grew with untreated wastewater vegetables consumption of vegetables didn t cause a health risk to consumers when considering individual hms however the probable health risks of hms can be increased when considering the hi value eq 12 21 the hi result orders follow cabbage lettuce tomato for both age groups children and adults considered fig 6 a in terms of water source used for irrigating vegetables the hi results were highest for untreated wastewater 3 217 6 259 followed by treated effluent 1 247 2 021 and tpw 0 467 0 915 fig 6a the sum of hi results was found to be greater than one for treated and untreated wastewater irrigated vegetables indicating that the health risk effect of consuming vegetables when all hms are evaluated togather as shown in fig 6b d cd and pb contributes the lion share among hms when computing hi percentage for instance in children the sum of cd and pb contributions for vegetable grown with treated effluent was found to be 57 7 59 0 and 55 6 for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively for the same age these metal cd and pb contributions for vegetable grown with untreated wastewater were found to be 74 1 81 3 and 76 4 for tomato cabbage and lettuce respectively this suggests that cd and pb most likely be the main hms causing a potential health hazard for people in the study area who ingest vegetables irrigated with wastewater 4 conclusions wastewater reuse is a common practice in both developed and developing countries however in terms of environmental and public health concerns wastewater reuse is not recommended by fao and who before treatment aerobic anoxic reactors treatment designed to treat the domestic wastewater has been found efficiently to remove the organic and nutrients to the standard levels that can be reused safely for various purposes relative phytotoxicity tests showed that treated effluent vegetable seed germination showed minimal impact tomato lettuce cabbage than untreated effluent the concentration of cd and pb identified in vegetables irrigated with treated and untreated effluents have been found exceeding standard limits and become a potential health risk if eaten by the local inhabitants declaration of competing

13598,surplus sludge disintegration to produce soluble organic matter for biological nutrient removal have been widely studied however the performance of mechanical disintegration of primary sludge is still unclear a new mechanical cutting mc approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge in this study the production and bioavailability of the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod was analyzed and the mechanism of organic matter release from primary sludge was investigated with the mechanical cutting speed of 35 000 rpm scod production increased with the increase of mechanical cutting time when mechanical cutting for 8 min the yield of organic matter reached the maximum scod concentration and sludge disintegration degree dd were 1604 mg l and 6 4 respectively 32 3 and 23 5 of the scod was readily biodegradable organic matter ss and slowly biodegradable organic matter xs the denitrification rate of activated sludge was 2 23 mgno3 n gmlss h with the organic matter released from primary sludge as carbon source which was basically consistent with glucose mechanical cutting centrifugation and pyrolysis were the main mechanisms for sludge disintegration and organic matter release and pyrolysis played a major role keywords primary sludge mechanical cutting sludge disintegration organics release 1 introduction nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plant was accomplished by nitrification and denitrification organic matter as electron donor was consumed in denitrification inadequate carbon sources would lead to low nitrogen removal efficiency in biological systems in order to improve nitrogen removal performance external carbon sources such as methanol and ethanol et al was added to biological process which increased the cost of sewage treatment 1 3 a large amount of waste activated sludge was was produced during the operation of biological system containing rich protein polysaccharide and other organic compounds 4 5 was anaerobic fermentation could transform the organic matter in sludge into dissolved organic matter and volatile fatty acids vfas which could be used as electron donor to enhance nitrogen removal in biological system 6 however sludge anaerobic fermentation requires a long sludge residence time srt although pretreatment technology could significantly improve the hydrolysis rate srt was still about 5 10 d 7 a large fermenter was essential for sludge fermentation which covered a large area and the cost was expensive 8 therefore it is necessary to develop novel approaches to extract organic matter quickly from the sludge sludge disintegration is a method to quickly produce soluble organic matter from sludge which destroys the sludge structure by physical chemical and biological methods and makes the intracellular organic matter and extracellular polymer release to liquid quickly physical methods include microwave ultrasonic high pressure homogenization heat treatment etc 4 9 10 chemical methods mainly include acid or alkali surface active agent etc 11 13 and the biological methods are mainly inoculated with fermentation bacteria and added with enzyme preparation 14 15 various single and combined sludge disintegration methods have been applied to disintegrate the extracellular polymeric substance eps and cytoderm of was to release the organic components 9 16 18 dauknys et al 19 showed that scod production was 5094 mg l and 5509 mg l in was disintegration by ultrasonic and high pressure homogenization respectively li et al 20 used high pressure homogenization to disintegrate was the scod yield increasing with pressure and scod yield was 2569 6 mg l at 60 mpa the soluble protein concentration in supernatant of was had increased to 30 times after the freezing thawing geobacillus pretreatment which increased to 1226 24 mg cod l 16 the present researches have shown that the organics produced by sludge disintegration were suitable as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal kampas et al 21 showed that the denitrification performance of carbon resource produced from sludge by mechanical disintegration was better than that of acetic acid the organic matters released from sludge disintegration by mircrowave h2o2 was used as internal carbon source and tn and tp removal efficiencies were improved by 11 and 28 34 respectively 22 liu et al 23 showed that the averaged total nitrogen by disintegrated sludge with hydrocyclone reached 97 14 while that of the control was 82 71 the researches of sludge disintegration mainly focused on was and the mechanism of rapid carbon release from was is to disintegrate tough cell wall and eps releasing eps and intracellular carbon sources into the liquid 13 24 some studies showed that the primary sludge also contained a large number of organic compounds which were more easily degraded than those in was 5 25 the composition and property of primary sludge are different from was and the bottleneck of organic release from primary sludge depends on the reduction of sludge size and destruction of sludge structure zheng et al 26 disintegrated the primary sludge with the microwave making the particulate organic matter dissolved and the scod concentration increased from 1390 mg l to 3304 mg l the ultrasonic was an effective method to disintegrate primary sludge and the scod concentration increasing from 791 mg l to 4096 3 mg l 27 in addition studies have shown that it was more economical for wwtp to use primary sludge as carbon source to enhance nitrogen removal 28 at present a few methods have been applied to disintegrate primary sludge but the mechanism of the organics release from primary sludge is still unclear disintegrate sludge by mechanical method which could disintegrate sludge rapidly and release the organic matter in a short time is simple to conduct and without secondary pollution a new mechanical cutting mc approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge in this study specific objectives of this study are to i investigate the performance of primary sludge disintegration by mc ii evaluate the bioavailability of carbon resource produced from primary sludge and iii clarify the mechanism of carbon source release from primary sludge by mc 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge the sludge used in this study was collected from the primary settling tank of a wastewater treatment plant with a design capacity of 2 0 105 m3 day in xi an china coarse matters in the sludge were removed with grid 2 mm and then stored at 4 before usage characteristics of the sludge used in the study are showed in table 1 2 2 characteristics of disintegration device the primary sludge was disintegrated using a jyl y99 high speed blender joyang china with the power of 900 w the device consisted of a sharp blade placed at the bottom of the tank the capacity of the tank was about 2 0 l with a diameter φ of 130 mm and a height h of 150 mm the primary sludge was disintegrated by the device with the rotation speed of 35 000 rpm in the experiment the sludge was disintegrated in the device by three main pathways first the primary sludge particles were disintegrated by mechanical cutting at the bottom of the apparatus with a high speed rotating blade second the sludge was rotated rapidly with the blades in the apparatus where the shear stress and centrifugal force could crush the sludge owing to the velocity difference between the flow layers third owing to the friction generated during the process of high speed blade rotation the temperature of the sludge increased rapidly and thermal hydrolysis also likely led to sludge disintegration 2 3 sludge disintegration 2 3 1 mechanical cutting in this experiment 4 8 l primary sludge was divided into six equal groups and placed in the high speed blender separately the primary sludge was disintegrated with the rotation speed of 35 000 rpm for 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min respectively after sludge disintegration the temperature of sludge was measured with a thermometer meanwhile the particle size and suspended solids ss of the disintegrated sludge were measured and scod protein pn polysaccharide ps nh4 n and po4 3 p in the filtrate were analyzed 2 3 2 the sludge pyrolysis experiment in the process of sludge disintegration with mc part of mechanical energy was converted into internal energy which made the temperature of sludge rise in order to study the contribution of thermal effect on sludge disintegration the sludge pyrolysis experiment was conducted first the temperature of primary sludge processed under different mechanical cutting times 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min was measured second 800 ml raw primary sludge was placed into a beaker and stirred at a speed of 50 rpm the primary sludge was heated by a water bath and temperature change of primary sludge was controlled the same as that of sludge under different mechanical cutting time third ss and scod was analyzed at different times 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min during sludge pyrolysis and then the effect of pyrolysis on sludge disintegration was evaluated 2 4 analytical methods except for ss and particle size the other analysis was conducted in the ﬁltered supernatant 0 45 μm the analysis of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p was conducted according to standard methods 29 ps was measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard 30 and pn was determined by coomassie brilliant blue 31 particle size distributions of sludge were monitored using ms2001 mastersizer malvern uk the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrometry fs5 spectrophotometer edinburgh uk three dimensional eem spectrometry was applied for characterizing the organics 32 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy vector 22 brooke bruker company german was used to identify the functional groups the sludge disintegration degree dd was used to evaluate the sludge disintegration efficiency by mechanical cutting as the following formula 33 dd scod1 scod0 tcod0 scod0 where scod1 and scod0 are the scod of the disintegrated and raw primary sludge mg l tcod0 is the total cod of raw primary sludge mg l batch oxygen uptake rate our respirometry experiments was used to estimate the organic biodegradable fractions 7 readily biodegradable organic matter ss and slowly biodegradable organic matter xs were analysed via respirometric assessment the biomass 2000 ml was taken from the aerobic tank of a wastewater treatment and elutriated three times the biomass was precipitated to 1000 ml and then aerated until the biomass was in the endogenous respiration stage the biomass was placed into a hermetic reactor 1000 ml of filtrate from primary sludge disintegration was added the sludge was maintained in suspension by a magnetic stirrer and contolled at 20 1 the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 by the phosphate buffer solution the allyl thiourea was added to the reactor to inhibit nitrification the dissolved oxygen do in the reactor was monitored online with a do meter hamilton bonaduz ag arc120 bonaduz switzerland the reactor was aerated until do reached 6 mg l then do change was monitored on line the aeration was repeated when do in the reactor was reduced by 2 mg l this procedure was repeated to monitor the oxygen uptake rate our of the hermetic reactor ss and xs concentrations were calculated using matlab software and correlation formulas and inert organic matter i was calculated as the difference between scod and ss and xs the denitrification experiment was used to evaluate the performance of soluble organic matter produced from primary sludge as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal an aliquot of 800 ml of biomass from the anoxic tank of a wastewater treatment was placed into a beaker 1000 ml and kept at 20 potassium nitrate was added to the beaker to obtain an initial nitrate concentration of 35 mg l the initial cod was about 500 mg l which was obtained by adding sodium acetate eight samples were taken over time to determine the denitriﬁcation rate which was based on the consumption of no3 n linear correlation coefﬁcient r2 0 98 3 results and discussion 3 1 soluble organic matter production by primary sludge disintegration 3 1 1 scod polysaccharide and protein production the effectiveness of primary sludge disintegration by mc could be expressed by the scod production and dd the scod concentration and dd with different mechanical disintegration time is shown in fig 1 a within 0 8 min the concentration of scod increased with the increase of operation time and was 398 626 718 1354 and 1604 mg l respectively however scod concentration decreased to 1426 mg l when mechanical disintegration time was 10 min the decline in scod could be attributed to evaporation of soluble organics and maillard reaction 34 35 in the process of sludge disintegration part of the mechanical energy was converted into internal energy thus temperature of sludge raised as shown in fig 1a the temperature increased linearly with the sludge disintegration time the temperature was up to 75 and 81 when sludge was disintegrated for 8 and 10 min eskicioglu et al 34 found that scod decreased when temperature increased from 75 to 96 with microwave treatment and this phenomenon was caused by temperature rapid rising which led to part of organics volatile kavitha et al 36 and ebenezer et al 37 disintegrated waste activated sludge by microwave and observed the reduction of scod at elevated microwave energy level both studies imputed this to evaporation of soluble organics meanwhile a previous study has shown that elevated temperatures 80 during the sludge disintegration would result in maillard reaction which refers to the condensation of reducing sugars and amino group at high temperature to form recalcitrant polymer like organic compounds resulting in the decrease of scod 38 coelho et al 39 studied the effect of microwave on the solubilization of thickened waste activated sludge and pointed out the high temperature of microwave pretreatment favored the occurrence of maillard reactions that caused low weight sugars and proteins to react and formed inhibitory and hard to degrade end products elbing and donnebeil 40 found that maillard reaction occurred at high temperatures during sludge hydro thermal pretreatment which led to the decline in scod concentration scod production reached the maximum with mechanical disintegration for 8 min and the dd of primary sludge was 6 4 zubrowska sudol and walczak 41 used mechanical method to disintegrate was and dd was up to 10 2 43 which was higher than this study vergine et al 42 used the same method to disintegrate primary sludge and was and it also found that the dd of was was higher than that of primary sludge due to the cytoplasm contained a large amount of organic matter the cytoplasm entered to the supernatant when the cell wall was broken resulted in a rapid increase in soluble organic matter therefore higher scod yield and dd was found in was disintegration it can be seen from table 1 polysaccharide and protein are the major components of organic matter in primary sludge fig 1b displays the trend of soluble polysaccharide sps and soluble protein spn concentration variations at different sludge disintegration time as with scod yield sps and spn concentrations increased gradually within 0 8 min the maximum concentration of sps and spn was 144 49 and 160 48 mg l the solubilisation degree of ps 6 25 was close to dd of sludge 6 4 while solubilisation degree of pn was only 1 08 appels et al 43 also found more polysaccharide than protein were solubilized when the sludge was disintegrated by microwave and he suggested this phenomenon could be attributed to the higher concentration of polysaccharide at the exterior of the sludge when the primary sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the spn concentration was unchanged basically while the concentration of sps and the solubilisation degree decreased to 130 8 mg l and 5 67 this phenomenon was previously observed in the was disintegration by microwave 38 the sps concentration decreased might be caused by maillard reaction occurring at high temperature studies have shown that there were abundant potential reactants of maillard reaction in municipal sludge and was contains more protein polysaccharide and higher ph than primary sludge which was more prone to maillard reaction 44 sludge disintegration not only releases organic matter but also some adverse by products such as nitrogen and phosphorus as shown in fig 1c the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p gradually increased with disintegration time between 0 8 min nh4 n concentration increased from 51 75 mg l to 81 25 mg l and po4 3 p concentration increased from 17 75 mg l to 25 27 mg l ammonia nitrogen was the product of proteolysis and the deamination of amino acids in the pn was limited by maillard reaction when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min to be able to consider the process of sludge disintegration as an alternative method of obtaining the source of organic carbon the amount of dissolved organic compounds recovered from sludge should significantly exceed the demand for organic carbon to remove nitrogen compounds released from sludge the concentration of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p were 1604 81 25 and 25 27 mg l respectively when primary sludge was disintegrated for 8 min scod nh4 n and scod po4 3 p were 19 7 and 63 5 respectively zubrowska sudol and walczak 41 disintegrated was by mechanical method and the concentration of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p after disintegration was 1456 72 91 and 73 44 mg l with scod nh4 n and scod po4 3 p were 20 0 and 19 8 respectively because the was stores a lot of phosphorus in the cells and the release of po4 3 p in was disintegration were higher than those in primary sludge therefore it was appropriate to produce carbon source for biological nutrient removal by disintegrating primary sludge zubrowska sudol 4 found scod stn in excess sludge processed mechanical disintegration under different energy density input 70 140 and 210 kj l was 7 87 11 39 and 11 41 and pointed out the amounts of organic compounds released from the activated sludge flocs at all tested levels of energy density were high enough to be used to intensify the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater in the experiment scod nh4 n in filtrate after primary sludge disintegration was 19 7 indicating that the carbon sources released from primary sludge was sufficient for biological nitrogen removal 3 1 2 ftir spectroscopy to further investigate the changes in chemical structure of the organic matter released from primary sludge by mechanical cutting ftir analysis was carried out the ftir results at wavenumbers 4000 1000 cm 1 for all disintegrated sludge samples displayed almost similar spectra with typical functional groups belong to protein and polysaccharide fig 2 peak at 2900 2920 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 could be assigned to stretching vibrations of ch2 belonging to fat peak observed at 3300 3600 cm 1 and 1020 1030 cm 1 was oh co and coc stretch vibration of polysaccharide 45 peaks in the regions of 1242 cm 1 1360 1430 cm 1 1542 cm 1 and 1600 1660 cm 1 were cn stretching coo symmetric stretching and nh stretching associated with polysaccharide peptides 46 as shown in fig 2 almost all the relative intensity of peaks increased with the increase of disintegration time indicating the functional group properties were enhanced that is to say the content of functional groups in supernatant increased which indicated particulate polysaccharide and protein in primary sludge were dissolved and transferred to the liquid by the infrared spectroscopy it was found that there were proteins amino acids and polysaccharides in the supernatant of sludge after hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation 47 when the sludge was disintegrated for 8 min the peaks reached the maximum which was consistent with the production of spn and sps 3 1 3 3d eem assays 3d eem spectroscopy was applied for characterizing the organic matter from primary sludge with different mc time compared to conventional photometric methods eem provides more information about the presence and concentration of fluorescent organics 46 li et al 48 used 3d eem spectroscopy to measure sludge pretreated with rhamnolipids and observed tyrosine like substances protein like substances and the others as shown in fig 3 only one peak peak a was identified from eem spectra for the sample without disintegration indicating the tyrosine like substances which identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 325 nm 48 49 however three peaks peak a peak b and peak c were identified from eem spectra for the sample with different disintegration time peak b was observed at the ex em of 325 350 425 440 nm which was assigned to fulvic acid like substances 48 50 peak c was identified at the ex em of 400 440 450 500 nm which was related to humic acid like substance 46 51 it indicated that organic matter in primary sludge was dissolved and transformed into supernatant by mechanical disintegration moreover the fluorescence intensity of the three peaks increased with the increase of disintegration time indicating fluorescent substances in supernatant increase which was consisted with the increase of soluble organic matter production 3 2 the bioavailability of organic matter production by sludge disintegration the biodegradability of organic matter released from primary sludge disintegration by mc for 8 min was analyze with batch our respirometry the experiment was conducted for about 33 h and the variation of our in reactor with time during the experiment was shown in fig 4 a the profile of our could be divided into three distinct stages in the first 415 min our decreased sharply from 44 1 12 9 mgo2 l h which was caused by the oxidation of ss the second stage was from 415 min to 1670 min our decreased slowly from 12 9 to 4 74 mg o2 l h which attributed to the depletion of xs the third stage started at 1670 min and our was less than 4 74 mg o2 l h the consumption of dissolved oxygen was due to microbial endogenous respiration in this stage according to the calculation ss xs and si accounted for 32 3 23 5 44 2 of the total soluble organic matter respectively fig 4b the previous study obtained internal carbon source from sludge disintegration by microwave h2o2 the biodegradable substances accounted for 46 of scod and ss was less than 30 of scod 22 jin et al 3 proposed a novel activated primary tank process to recover carbon source by fermentation and elutriation of primary sludge and pointed out the ss accounted for about 34 5 of the cod compared to the municipal wastewater in which ss and xs accounted for about 15 8 and 54 2 52 more ss and less xs was found in the organic matter produced by primary sludge disintegration the total biodegradable substances accounted for 55 8 of organic matter released from primary sludge in this experiment indicating the organic matter produced by primary sludge disintegration could be used as carbon source for biological nutrient removal it was reported that around 60 of the soluble cod generated from ozonated sludge was in a biodegradable form and the remaining soluble organic matter was refractory 53 in order to evaluate the performance of organic matter for biological nitrogen removal the denitrification experiment was conducted with organic matter released from primary sludge disintegration and glucose as carbon source respectively the variation of no3 n concentration with different time is given in fig 4c with the organic matter released from primary sludge as carbon source the concentration of nitrate decreased from 35 mg l to 11 25 mg l in an hour with the nitrate removal rate of 2 23 mgno3 n gmlss h with the glucose as carbon source the nitrate removal rate was 2 39 mgno3 n gmlss h the results indicated that the organic matter released from primary sludge by mc was a relatively high quality carbon source for biological nitrogen removal walczak and zubrowska sudol 54 showed the nitrate removal rate using hydrodynamically disintegrated was as carbon source was about 2 8 0 4 mgnox n gvss h which was 1 3 1 6 times higher than that achieved by municipal sewage liu et al 20 showed that the fermentation liquor of the primary sludge as a carbon source had a high denitrification rate with 7 08 mgno3 n gmlss h because sludge fermentation produced more readily biodegradable organic compounds such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid etc 3 3 mechanism of organic matter release from primary sludge 3 3 1 particle size distribution and suspended solid reduction fig 5 a displays the distribution of sludge particle size with different disintegration time the mean particle size of the initial primary sludge was 45 7 μm and decreased sharply to 10 9 10 4 and 7 0 μm respectively with the disintegration time of 4 6 8 min the average particle size of primary sludge with disintegration for 8 min was only 15 3 of the initial primary sludge when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the average particle size was 7 5 μm and a new peak appeared at 52 4 μm which indicated the formation of large particulate matter this could be attributed to the maillard reaction which indirectly verified the cause of scod reduction when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min this phenomenon has been reported by erden and filibeli 55 and liu et al 56 and liu et al 56 believed that the re flocculation of sludge was caused by temperature rise ss reduction was suggested as an important criterion to evaluate the efﬁciency of sludge disintegration fig 5b depicts the ss variation of primary sludge over time under the mechanical cutting and sludge pyrolysis with mechanical disintegration time of 0 8 min ss decreased rapidly from the original 37700 to 36800 35730 33450 and 31300 mg l the ss reduction percentage was 2 4 5 2 11 3 and 17 0 respectively when the primary sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the ss was about 31050 mg l with ss reduction percentage of 17 6 when the primary sludge was disintegrated by mc for 8 min the specific energy input was about 14 320 kj kg ts and ss reduction was 17 0 ebenezer et al 37 disintegrated was by microwave and ss reduction was observed to be 22 at specific energy input of 14 000 kj kg ts however kavitha et al 36 found that the ss reduction in was disintegration by microwave was only 9 3 at specific energy input of 18 000 kj kg ts ss reduction was also be observed in sludge pyrolysis experiment thus pyrolysis induced by high temperature was an important factor for ss reduction in primary sludge disintegration by mc when primary sludge was mechanical disintegration for 8 min the temperature rose to 75 pyrolysis resulted in ss reduction of 10 1 the ss of primary sludge decreased by 6400 mg l with mechanical disintegration for 8 min in which the pyrolysis resulted in ss decrease of 3800 mg l accounting for 59 4 of the ss reduction 3 3 2 mechanism of soluble organic matter production the soluble organic matter released from primary sludge by mc could be classified to three pathways fig 6 first the sludge particulate was broken into smaller particles by the mechanical cutting and the small particles was dissolved by stirring second the centrifugal force produced by high speed also could crush the sludge and release the organic matter adsorbed on the particle surface into the liquid 8 the cutting and centrifugal force could be classified to non thermal effect third as shown in fig 1a part of the mechanical energy was converted into internal energy in the process of mechanical cutting thus temperature of sludge increased rapidly pyrolysis made the sludge particles breakup and dissolve which could be classified by thermal effect fig 7 depicts the contribution of thermal and non thermal effects to scod yield during sludge disintegration by mc it could be seen that thermal effect was the main pathway to produce scod accounting for 60 70 of scod yield and non thermal effect contributed about 30 40 of scod yield organic matter released from was by ultrasonic also included two mechanisms first the structure of sludge was decomposed by the cavitation and then the sludge was dissolved by the thermal effect 57 3 4 energy analysis the cost of external carbon source for denitrification is also an important factor to consider in addition to ensuring high denitrification performance according to the calculation it took 447 kj energy to produce 1 g scod by disintegrating primary sludge by mc kampas et al 58 used mechanical method to disintegrate was and produced 1 g cod with only 175 75 kj energy the study of walczak and zubrowska sudol 54 showed that 117 35 kj gcod energy was needed to disintegrate was by mechanical method the studies show that more energy needed be input into primary sludge than was in order to produce scod by sludge disintegration negral et al 27 suggested that the yield of scod released by was was much higher than that of the primary sludge under the same energy consumption with the same method this was because the cytoplasm contained a large amount of organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which was easily released into liquid when the cell wall was broken however a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus were produced in the was disintegration which need to be removed before the organic source was used as carbon source for biological nutrient removal 59 the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus released in primary sludge disintegration was acceptable therefore the economy of the carbon source release from the primary sludge and was by mechanical disintegration need be analyzed more comprehensively and deeply 4 conclusions a new mechanical cutting approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge and produce soluble organic matter with the action of mechanical cutting the particle size and ss of primary sludge decreased significantly the particulate organic matter was converted to scod a large amount of soluble protein and polysaccharide were produced mechanical cutting centrifugation and pyrolysis were the main mechanisms for sludge disintegration and organic matter release and pyrolysis played a major role the soluble organic matter produced from primary sludge by mechanical cutting showed the high bioavailability about one third of which was readily biodegradable organic matter the organic matter released from primary sludge was appropriate as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal declaration of interest

13598,surplus sludge disintegration to produce soluble organic matter for biological nutrient removal have been widely studied however the performance of mechanical disintegration of primary sludge is still unclear a new mechanical cutting mc approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge in this study the production and bioavailability of the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod was analyzed and the mechanism of organic matter release from primary sludge was investigated with the mechanical cutting speed of 35 000 rpm scod production increased with the increase of mechanical cutting time when mechanical cutting for 8 min the yield of organic matter reached the maximum scod concentration and sludge disintegration degree dd were 1604 mg l and 6 4 respectively 32 3 and 23 5 of the scod was readily biodegradable organic matter ss and slowly biodegradable organic matter xs the denitrification rate of activated sludge was 2 23 mgno3 n gmlss h with the organic matter released from primary sludge as carbon source which was basically consistent with glucose mechanical cutting centrifugation and pyrolysis were the main mechanisms for sludge disintegration and organic matter release and pyrolysis played a major role keywords primary sludge mechanical cutting sludge disintegration organics release 1 introduction nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plant was accomplished by nitrification and denitrification organic matter as electron donor was consumed in denitrification inadequate carbon sources would lead to low nitrogen removal efficiency in biological systems in order to improve nitrogen removal performance external carbon sources such as methanol and ethanol et al was added to biological process which increased the cost of sewage treatment 1 3 a large amount of waste activated sludge was was produced during the operation of biological system containing rich protein polysaccharide and other organic compounds 4 5 was anaerobic fermentation could transform the organic matter in sludge into dissolved organic matter and volatile fatty acids vfas which could be used as electron donor to enhance nitrogen removal in biological system 6 however sludge anaerobic fermentation requires a long sludge residence time srt although pretreatment technology could significantly improve the hydrolysis rate srt was still about 5 10 d 7 a large fermenter was essential for sludge fermentation which covered a large area and the cost was expensive 8 therefore it is necessary to develop novel approaches to extract organic matter quickly from the sludge sludge disintegration is a method to quickly produce soluble organic matter from sludge which destroys the sludge structure by physical chemical and biological methods and makes the intracellular organic matter and extracellular polymer release to liquid quickly physical methods include microwave ultrasonic high pressure homogenization heat treatment etc 4 9 10 chemical methods mainly include acid or alkali surface active agent etc 11 13 and the biological methods are mainly inoculated with fermentation bacteria and added with enzyme preparation 14 15 various single and combined sludge disintegration methods have been applied to disintegrate the extracellular polymeric substance eps and cytoderm of was to release the organic components 9 16 18 dauknys et al 19 showed that scod production was 5094 mg l and 5509 mg l in was disintegration by ultrasonic and high pressure homogenization respectively li et al 20 used high pressure homogenization to disintegrate was the scod yield increasing with pressure and scod yield was 2569 6 mg l at 60 mpa the soluble protein concentration in supernatant of was had increased to 30 times after the freezing thawing geobacillus pretreatment which increased to 1226 24 mg cod l 16 the present researches have shown that the organics produced by sludge disintegration were suitable as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal kampas et al 21 showed that the denitrification performance of carbon resource produced from sludge by mechanical disintegration was better than that of acetic acid the organic matters released from sludge disintegration by mircrowave h2o2 was used as internal carbon source and tn and tp removal efficiencies were improved by 11 and 28 34 respectively 22 liu et al 23 showed that the averaged total nitrogen by disintegrated sludge with hydrocyclone reached 97 14 while that of the control was 82 71 the researches of sludge disintegration mainly focused on was and the mechanism of rapid carbon release from was is to disintegrate tough cell wall and eps releasing eps and intracellular carbon sources into the liquid 13 24 some studies showed that the primary sludge also contained a large number of organic compounds which were more easily degraded than those in was 5 25 the composition and property of primary sludge are different from was and the bottleneck of organic release from primary sludge depends on the reduction of sludge size and destruction of sludge structure zheng et al 26 disintegrated the primary sludge with the microwave making the particulate organic matter dissolved and the scod concentration increased from 1390 mg l to 3304 mg l the ultrasonic was an effective method to disintegrate primary sludge and the scod concentration increasing from 791 mg l to 4096 3 mg l 27 in addition studies have shown that it was more economical for wwtp to use primary sludge as carbon source to enhance nitrogen removal 28 at present a few methods have been applied to disintegrate primary sludge but the mechanism of the organics release from primary sludge is still unclear disintegrate sludge by mechanical method which could disintegrate sludge rapidly and release the organic matter in a short time is simple to conduct and without secondary pollution a new mechanical cutting mc approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge in this study specific objectives of this study are to i investigate the performance of primary sludge disintegration by mc ii evaluate the bioavailability of carbon resource produced from primary sludge and iii clarify the mechanism of carbon source release from primary sludge by mc 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of sludge the sludge used in this study was collected from the primary settling tank of a wastewater treatment plant with a design capacity of 2 0 105 m3 day in xi an china coarse matters in the sludge were removed with grid 2 mm and then stored at 4 before usage characteristics of the sludge used in the study are showed in table 1 2 2 characteristics of disintegration device the primary sludge was disintegrated using a jyl y99 high speed blender joyang china with the power of 900 w the device consisted of a sharp blade placed at the bottom of the tank the capacity of the tank was about 2 0 l with a diameter φ of 130 mm and a height h of 150 mm the primary sludge was disintegrated by the device with the rotation speed of 35 000 rpm in the experiment the sludge was disintegrated in the device by three main pathways first the primary sludge particles were disintegrated by mechanical cutting at the bottom of the apparatus with a high speed rotating blade second the sludge was rotated rapidly with the blades in the apparatus where the shear stress and centrifugal force could crush the sludge owing to the velocity difference between the flow layers third owing to the friction generated during the process of high speed blade rotation the temperature of the sludge increased rapidly and thermal hydrolysis also likely led to sludge disintegration 2 3 sludge disintegration 2 3 1 mechanical cutting in this experiment 4 8 l primary sludge was divided into six equal groups and placed in the high speed blender separately the primary sludge was disintegrated with the rotation speed of 35 000 rpm for 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min respectively after sludge disintegration the temperature of sludge was measured with a thermometer meanwhile the particle size and suspended solids ss of the disintegrated sludge were measured and scod protein pn polysaccharide ps nh4 n and po4 3 p in the filtrate were analyzed 2 3 2 the sludge pyrolysis experiment in the process of sludge disintegration with mc part of mechanical energy was converted into internal energy which made the temperature of sludge rise in order to study the contribution of thermal effect on sludge disintegration the sludge pyrolysis experiment was conducted first the temperature of primary sludge processed under different mechanical cutting times 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min was measured second 800 ml raw primary sludge was placed into a beaker and stirred at a speed of 50 rpm the primary sludge was heated by a water bath and temperature change of primary sludge was controlled the same as that of sludge under different mechanical cutting time third ss and scod was analyzed at different times 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min during sludge pyrolysis and then the effect of pyrolysis on sludge disintegration was evaluated 2 4 analytical methods except for ss and particle size the other analysis was conducted in the ﬁltered supernatant 0 45 μm the analysis of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p was conducted according to standard methods 29 ps was measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard 30 and pn was determined by coomassie brilliant blue 31 particle size distributions of sludge were monitored using ms2001 mastersizer malvern uk the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was measured using a fluorescence spectrometry fs5 spectrophotometer edinburgh uk three dimensional eem spectrometry was applied for characterizing the organics 32 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy vector 22 brooke bruker company german was used to identify the functional groups the sludge disintegration degree dd was used to evaluate the sludge disintegration efficiency by mechanical cutting as the following formula 33 dd scod1 scod0 tcod0 scod0 where scod1 and scod0 are the scod of the disintegrated and raw primary sludge mg l tcod0 is the total cod of raw primary sludge mg l batch oxygen uptake rate our respirometry experiments was used to estimate the organic biodegradable fractions 7 readily biodegradable organic matter ss and slowly biodegradable organic matter xs were analysed via respirometric assessment the biomass 2000 ml was taken from the aerobic tank of a wastewater treatment and elutriated three times the biomass was precipitated to 1000 ml and then aerated until the biomass was in the endogenous respiration stage the biomass was placed into a hermetic reactor 1000 ml of filtrate from primary sludge disintegration was added the sludge was maintained in suspension by a magnetic stirrer and contolled at 20 1 the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 by the phosphate buffer solution the allyl thiourea was added to the reactor to inhibit nitrification the dissolved oxygen do in the reactor was monitored online with a do meter hamilton bonaduz ag arc120 bonaduz switzerland the reactor was aerated until do reached 6 mg l then do change was monitored on line the aeration was repeated when do in the reactor was reduced by 2 mg l this procedure was repeated to monitor the oxygen uptake rate our of the hermetic reactor ss and xs concentrations were calculated using matlab software and correlation formulas and inert organic matter i was calculated as the difference between scod and ss and xs the denitrification experiment was used to evaluate the performance of soluble organic matter produced from primary sludge as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal an aliquot of 800 ml of biomass from the anoxic tank of a wastewater treatment was placed into a beaker 1000 ml and kept at 20 potassium nitrate was added to the beaker to obtain an initial nitrate concentration of 35 mg l the initial cod was about 500 mg l which was obtained by adding sodium acetate eight samples were taken over time to determine the denitriﬁcation rate which was based on the consumption of no3 n linear correlation coefﬁcient r2 0 98 3 results and discussion 3 1 soluble organic matter production by primary sludge disintegration 3 1 1 scod polysaccharide and protein production the effectiveness of primary sludge disintegration by mc could be expressed by the scod production and dd the scod concentration and dd with different mechanical disintegration time is shown in fig 1 a within 0 8 min the concentration of scod increased with the increase of operation time and was 398 626 718 1354 and 1604 mg l respectively however scod concentration decreased to 1426 mg l when mechanical disintegration time was 10 min the decline in scod could be attributed to evaporation of soluble organics and maillard reaction 34 35 in the process of sludge disintegration part of the mechanical energy was converted into internal energy thus temperature of sludge raised as shown in fig 1a the temperature increased linearly with the sludge disintegration time the temperature was up to 75 and 81 when sludge was disintegrated for 8 and 10 min eskicioglu et al 34 found that scod decreased when temperature increased from 75 to 96 with microwave treatment and this phenomenon was caused by temperature rapid rising which led to part of organics volatile kavitha et al 36 and ebenezer et al 37 disintegrated waste activated sludge by microwave and observed the reduction of scod at elevated microwave energy level both studies imputed this to evaporation of soluble organics meanwhile a previous study has shown that elevated temperatures 80 during the sludge disintegration would result in maillard reaction which refers to the condensation of reducing sugars and amino group at high temperature to form recalcitrant polymer like organic compounds resulting in the decrease of scod 38 coelho et al 39 studied the effect of microwave on the solubilization of thickened waste activated sludge and pointed out the high temperature of microwave pretreatment favored the occurrence of maillard reactions that caused low weight sugars and proteins to react and formed inhibitory and hard to degrade end products elbing and donnebeil 40 found that maillard reaction occurred at high temperatures during sludge hydro thermal pretreatment which led to the decline in scod concentration scod production reached the maximum with mechanical disintegration for 8 min and the dd of primary sludge was 6 4 zubrowska sudol and walczak 41 used mechanical method to disintegrate was and dd was up to 10 2 43 which was higher than this study vergine et al 42 used the same method to disintegrate primary sludge and was and it also found that the dd of was was higher than that of primary sludge due to the cytoplasm contained a large amount of organic matter the cytoplasm entered to the supernatant when the cell wall was broken resulted in a rapid increase in soluble organic matter therefore higher scod yield and dd was found in was disintegration it can be seen from table 1 polysaccharide and protein are the major components of organic matter in primary sludge fig 1b displays the trend of soluble polysaccharide sps and soluble protein spn concentration variations at different sludge disintegration time as with scod yield sps and spn concentrations increased gradually within 0 8 min the maximum concentration of sps and spn was 144 49 and 160 48 mg l the solubilisation degree of ps 6 25 was close to dd of sludge 6 4 while solubilisation degree of pn was only 1 08 appels et al 43 also found more polysaccharide than protein were solubilized when the sludge was disintegrated by microwave and he suggested this phenomenon could be attributed to the higher concentration of polysaccharide at the exterior of the sludge when the primary sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the spn concentration was unchanged basically while the concentration of sps and the solubilisation degree decreased to 130 8 mg l and 5 67 this phenomenon was previously observed in the was disintegration by microwave 38 the sps concentration decreased might be caused by maillard reaction occurring at high temperature studies have shown that there were abundant potential reactants of maillard reaction in municipal sludge and was contains more protein polysaccharide and higher ph than primary sludge which was more prone to maillard reaction 44 sludge disintegration not only releases organic matter but also some adverse by products such as nitrogen and phosphorus as shown in fig 1c the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 p gradually increased with disintegration time between 0 8 min nh4 n concentration increased from 51 75 mg l to 81 25 mg l and po4 3 p concentration increased from 17 75 mg l to 25 27 mg l ammonia nitrogen was the product of proteolysis and the deamination of amino acids in the pn was limited by maillard reaction when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min to be able to consider the process of sludge disintegration as an alternative method of obtaining the source of organic carbon the amount of dissolved organic compounds recovered from sludge should significantly exceed the demand for organic carbon to remove nitrogen compounds released from sludge the concentration of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p were 1604 81 25 and 25 27 mg l respectively when primary sludge was disintegrated for 8 min scod nh4 n and scod po4 3 p were 19 7 and 63 5 respectively zubrowska sudol and walczak 41 disintegrated was by mechanical method and the concentration of scod nh4 n and po4 3 p after disintegration was 1456 72 91 and 73 44 mg l with scod nh4 n and scod po4 3 p were 20 0 and 19 8 respectively because the was stores a lot of phosphorus in the cells and the release of po4 3 p in was disintegration were higher than those in primary sludge therefore it was appropriate to produce carbon source for biological nutrient removal by disintegrating primary sludge zubrowska sudol 4 found scod stn in excess sludge processed mechanical disintegration under different energy density input 70 140 and 210 kj l was 7 87 11 39 and 11 41 and pointed out the amounts of organic compounds released from the activated sludge flocs at all tested levels of energy density were high enough to be used to intensify the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater in the experiment scod nh4 n in filtrate after primary sludge disintegration was 19 7 indicating that the carbon sources released from primary sludge was sufficient for biological nitrogen removal 3 1 2 ftir spectroscopy to further investigate the changes in chemical structure of the organic matter released from primary sludge by mechanical cutting ftir analysis was carried out the ftir results at wavenumbers 4000 1000 cm 1 for all disintegrated sludge samples displayed almost similar spectra with typical functional groups belong to protein and polysaccharide fig 2 peak at 2900 2920 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 could be assigned to stretching vibrations of ch2 belonging to fat peak observed at 3300 3600 cm 1 and 1020 1030 cm 1 was oh co and coc stretch vibration of polysaccharide 45 peaks in the regions of 1242 cm 1 1360 1430 cm 1 1542 cm 1 and 1600 1660 cm 1 were cn stretching coo symmetric stretching and nh stretching associated with polysaccharide peptides 46 as shown in fig 2 almost all the relative intensity of peaks increased with the increase of disintegration time indicating the functional group properties were enhanced that is to say the content of functional groups in supernatant increased which indicated particulate polysaccharide and protein in primary sludge were dissolved and transferred to the liquid by the infrared spectroscopy it was found that there were proteins amino acids and polysaccharides in the supernatant of sludge after hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation 47 when the sludge was disintegrated for 8 min the peaks reached the maximum which was consistent with the production of spn and sps 3 1 3 3d eem assays 3d eem spectroscopy was applied for characterizing the organic matter from primary sludge with different mc time compared to conventional photometric methods eem provides more information about the presence and concentration of fluorescent organics 46 li et al 48 used 3d eem spectroscopy to measure sludge pretreated with rhamnolipids and observed tyrosine like substances protein like substances and the others as shown in fig 3 only one peak peak a was identified from eem spectra for the sample without disintegration indicating the tyrosine like substances which identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 325 nm 48 49 however three peaks peak a peak b and peak c were identified from eem spectra for the sample with different disintegration time peak b was observed at the ex em of 325 350 425 440 nm which was assigned to fulvic acid like substances 48 50 peak c was identified at the ex em of 400 440 450 500 nm which was related to humic acid like substance 46 51 it indicated that organic matter in primary sludge was dissolved and transformed into supernatant by mechanical disintegration moreover the fluorescence intensity of the three peaks increased with the increase of disintegration time indicating fluorescent substances in supernatant increase which was consisted with the increase of soluble organic matter production 3 2 the bioavailability of organic matter production by sludge disintegration the biodegradability of organic matter released from primary sludge disintegration by mc for 8 min was analyze with batch our respirometry the experiment was conducted for about 33 h and the variation of our in reactor with time during the experiment was shown in fig 4 a the profile of our could be divided into three distinct stages in the first 415 min our decreased sharply from 44 1 12 9 mgo2 l h which was caused by the oxidation of ss the second stage was from 415 min to 1670 min our decreased slowly from 12 9 to 4 74 mg o2 l h which attributed to the depletion of xs the third stage started at 1670 min and our was less than 4 74 mg o2 l h the consumption of dissolved oxygen was due to microbial endogenous respiration in this stage according to the calculation ss xs and si accounted for 32 3 23 5 44 2 of the total soluble organic matter respectively fig 4b the previous study obtained internal carbon source from sludge disintegration by microwave h2o2 the biodegradable substances accounted for 46 of scod and ss was less than 30 of scod 22 jin et al 3 proposed a novel activated primary tank process to recover carbon source by fermentation and elutriation of primary sludge and pointed out the ss accounted for about 34 5 of the cod compared to the municipal wastewater in which ss and xs accounted for about 15 8 and 54 2 52 more ss and less xs was found in the organic matter produced by primary sludge disintegration the total biodegradable substances accounted for 55 8 of organic matter released from primary sludge in this experiment indicating the organic matter produced by primary sludge disintegration could be used as carbon source for biological nutrient removal it was reported that around 60 of the soluble cod generated from ozonated sludge was in a biodegradable form and the remaining soluble organic matter was refractory 53 in order to evaluate the performance of organic matter for biological nitrogen removal the denitrification experiment was conducted with organic matter released from primary sludge disintegration and glucose as carbon source respectively the variation of no3 n concentration with different time is given in fig 4c with the organic matter released from primary sludge as carbon source the concentration of nitrate decreased from 35 mg l to 11 25 mg l in an hour with the nitrate removal rate of 2 23 mgno3 n gmlss h with the glucose as carbon source the nitrate removal rate was 2 39 mgno3 n gmlss h the results indicated that the organic matter released from primary sludge by mc was a relatively high quality carbon source for biological nitrogen removal walczak and zubrowska sudol 54 showed the nitrate removal rate using hydrodynamically disintegrated was as carbon source was about 2 8 0 4 mgnox n gvss h which was 1 3 1 6 times higher than that achieved by municipal sewage liu et al 20 showed that the fermentation liquor of the primary sludge as a carbon source had a high denitrification rate with 7 08 mgno3 n gmlss h because sludge fermentation produced more readily biodegradable organic compounds such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid etc 3 3 mechanism of organic matter release from primary sludge 3 3 1 particle size distribution and suspended solid reduction fig 5 a displays the distribution of sludge particle size with different disintegration time the mean particle size of the initial primary sludge was 45 7 μm and decreased sharply to 10 9 10 4 and 7 0 μm respectively with the disintegration time of 4 6 8 min the average particle size of primary sludge with disintegration for 8 min was only 15 3 of the initial primary sludge when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the average particle size was 7 5 μm and a new peak appeared at 52 4 μm which indicated the formation of large particulate matter this could be attributed to the maillard reaction which indirectly verified the cause of scod reduction when sludge was disintegrated for 10 min this phenomenon has been reported by erden and filibeli 55 and liu et al 56 and liu et al 56 believed that the re flocculation of sludge was caused by temperature rise ss reduction was suggested as an important criterion to evaluate the efﬁciency of sludge disintegration fig 5b depicts the ss variation of primary sludge over time under the mechanical cutting and sludge pyrolysis with mechanical disintegration time of 0 8 min ss decreased rapidly from the original 37700 to 36800 35730 33450 and 31300 mg l the ss reduction percentage was 2 4 5 2 11 3 and 17 0 respectively when the primary sludge was disintegrated for 10 min the ss was about 31050 mg l with ss reduction percentage of 17 6 when the primary sludge was disintegrated by mc for 8 min the specific energy input was about 14 320 kj kg ts and ss reduction was 17 0 ebenezer et al 37 disintegrated was by microwave and ss reduction was observed to be 22 at specific energy input of 14 000 kj kg ts however kavitha et al 36 found that the ss reduction in was disintegration by microwave was only 9 3 at specific energy input of 18 000 kj kg ts ss reduction was also be observed in sludge pyrolysis experiment thus pyrolysis induced by high temperature was an important factor for ss reduction in primary sludge disintegration by mc when primary sludge was mechanical disintegration for 8 min the temperature rose to 75 pyrolysis resulted in ss reduction of 10 1 the ss of primary sludge decreased by 6400 mg l with mechanical disintegration for 8 min in which the pyrolysis resulted in ss decrease of 3800 mg l accounting for 59 4 of the ss reduction 3 3 2 mechanism of soluble organic matter production the soluble organic matter released from primary sludge by mc could be classified to three pathways fig 6 first the sludge particulate was broken into smaller particles by the mechanical cutting and the small particles was dissolved by stirring second the centrifugal force produced by high speed also could crush the sludge and release the organic matter adsorbed on the particle surface into the liquid 8 the cutting and centrifugal force could be classified to non thermal effect third as shown in fig 1a part of the mechanical energy was converted into internal energy in the process of mechanical cutting thus temperature of sludge increased rapidly pyrolysis made the sludge particles breakup and dissolve which could be classified by thermal effect fig 7 depicts the contribution of thermal and non thermal effects to scod yield during sludge disintegration by mc it could be seen that thermal effect was the main pathway to produce scod accounting for 60 70 of scod yield and non thermal effect contributed about 30 40 of scod yield organic matter released from was by ultrasonic also included two mechanisms first the structure of sludge was decomposed by the cavitation and then the sludge was dissolved by the thermal effect 57 3 4 energy analysis the cost of external carbon source for denitrification is also an important factor to consider in addition to ensuring high denitrification performance according to the calculation it took 447 kj energy to produce 1 g scod by disintegrating primary sludge by mc kampas et al 58 used mechanical method to disintegrate was and produced 1 g cod with only 175 75 kj energy the study of walczak and zubrowska sudol 54 showed that 117 35 kj gcod energy was needed to disintegrate was by mechanical method the studies show that more energy needed be input into primary sludge than was in order to produce scod by sludge disintegration negral et al 27 suggested that the yield of scod released by was was much higher than that of the primary sludge under the same energy consumption with the same method this was because the cytoplasm contained a large amount of organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which was easily released into liquid when the cell wall was broken however a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus were produced in the was disintegration which need to be removed before the organic source was used as carbon source for biological nutrient removal 59 the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus released in primary sludge disintegration was acceptable therefore the economy of the carbon source release from the primary sludge and was by mechanical disintegration need be analyzed more comprehensively and deeply 4 conclusions a new mechanical cutting approach was proposed to disintegrate primary sludge and produce soluble organic matter with the action of mechanical cutting the particle size and ss of primary sludge decreased significantly the particulate organic matter was converted to scod a large amount of soluble protein and polysaccharide were produced mechanical cutting centrifugation and pyrolysis were the main mechanisms for sludge disintegration and organic matter release and pyrolysis played a major role the soluble organic matter produced from primary sludge by mechanical cutting showed the high bioavailability about one third of which was readily biodegradable organic matter the organic matter released from primary sludge was appropriate as carbon source for biological nitrogen removal declaration of interest

13599,using photocatalysts to harvest photon energy from sunlight renewable fuel is a promising pathway for a wide range of applications especially for the removal of contaminants from water porphyrin and its derivatives are analogs of natural chlorophyll both compounds have similar structures and photochemical properties therefore various porphyrin derivatives have been extensively studied as effective sensitizers for light energy absorption and as nature inspired photocatalysts for water treatment in this study a simple solvophobic self assembly protocol is employed to obtain nanostructured porphyrin from monomeric tetrakis triphenylamine porphyrin ttpap in a mixture of thf h2o the porphyrin is assembled into various forms such as rod like and belt like microstructures depending on the water fraction in the thf h2o mixture the main driving forces for self assembly of the ttpap monomers into nanostructured materials are balanced stacking involving hydrophobic

in aqueous media under simulated visible irradiation the belt like porphyrin aggregates exhibit better performance than the rod like counterparts under the same reaction conditions a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of the ttpap aggregates in rhb degradation is also presented keywords porphyrin based nanostructures tetrakis triphenylamine porphyrin photocatalyst photodegradation rhodamine b dye 1 introduction economic development has led to severe threats to the ecosystem and especially human health because of contamination of the environment with various toxic chemicals from industrial wastewater 1 3 intensive global research has been directed toward amending this problem one of the largest water pollutants is dye from industrial sectors such as the food leather mining paper pharmaceutical printing and textile industries the three most common dyes present in industrial wastewater are azo derivatives triphenylmethane and phenothiazine 4 rhodamine b rhb is a dye that is commonly found in the wastewater from many industrial manufacturing processes rhb is toxic neurotoxic and carcinogenic to human beings as well as ecosystems 5 10 consequently the removal of rhb dye from wastewater is critical for human health and the ecosystem and is thus the subject of extensive research in order to remove rhb dye from wastewater many techniques have been developed including but not limited to chemical and biological treatment physical and chemical adsorption photocatalytic degradation and combined methods 11 16 among these techniques the photodegradation approach has been demonstrated as a cheap and effective method for the remediation of rhb containing wastewater 17 21 many inorganic semiconductors such as tio2 zno g c3n4 mos2 and cufe2o4 have been employed as photocatalysts for the removal of rhb dyes 22 25 however these photocatalysts only absorb photon energy in the uv region and some of them exhibit low photocatalytic performance which hinders their practical applications thus it is crucial to unearth a new range of photocatalysts for effective utilization of photon energy over the broad spectrum of light 26 organic semiconductors are an emerging field of research and have attracted widespread attention from many scientists as they afford the ability to tailor their photocatalytic properties as well as effective charge separation 27 29 some of the most studied organic semiconductors as photocatalysts are porphyrin based nanostructures 30 many porphyrin nanostructures with various morphologies such as nanosheets nanoplates nanorods nano cloves nanofibers nanowires nanoflowers and nanobelts have been successfully fabricated and show remarkable photocatalytic activity toward various contaminant dyes in wastewater 12 31 36 the majority of porphyrin based nanostructures can be easily obtained via supramolecular self assembly of monomeric π conjugated porphyrin molecules which is an effective approach for the fabrication of functional soft nanomaterials 37 38 the three typical types of self assembly techniques are reprecipitation 39 42 surfactant assisted self assembly sas 43 and ionic self assembly 44 these approaches are commonly used to obtain porphyrin nanomaterials for photocatalysis applications for example hierarchical porphyrin nanocrystals such as nanosheets octahedra and microspheres were successfully obtained via self assembly and these nanostructured porphyrins showed high photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of certain dyes 45 recently our group fabricated several nanostructured porphyrin based hybrid nanomaterials by self assembly of tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphyrin tcpp these hybrids showed high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhb dye 31 46 49 nevertheless there is still a need to develop new porphyrins that can be synthesized easily and can provide better photocatalytic activity herein a new porphyrin based nanomaterial is synthesized via the solvophobic self assembly of tetrakis triphenylamine porphyrin ttpap monomers into various forms such as rod like and belt like microstructures depending on the water fraction in thf the physical and chemical properties of the nanostructured porphyrin are determined while both porphyrin microstructures rod like and belt like show reasonable photocatalytic activity toward rhodamine b rhb dye under simulated visible irradiation the belt like porphyrin aggregates exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activity toward rhb degradation compared to the rod like congeners under the same reaction conditions a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of the ttpap aggregates in rhb degradation is also presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used herein triphenylamine pyrrole propionic acid pocl3 n n dimethyl formamide dmf tetrahydrofuran thf and rhodamine b were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification synthesis of triphenylamine porphyrin ttpap synthesis of 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde was synthesized using a literature procedure s2 typically triphenylamine 2 5 g 10 1 mmol was dissolved in 6 ml of dmf and then cooled to 0 c pocl3 4 7 ml 52 mmol was added slowly dropwise to the mixture at 0 c after complete addition the reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature the mixture changed color to red the reaction mixture was then heated to 45 c for 2 h the reaction mixture was then poured into an ice water mixture and the precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol to give the product in 86 yield the identity of this compound 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde was confirmed by 1h nmr where the nmr data correctly matched the reported data in the literature s1 synthesis of ttpap ttpap was synthesized using a literature procedure s3 typically ttap was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of fresh pyrrole 0 64 ml 9 1 mmol and 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde 2 5 g 9 1 mmol in 40 ml propionic acid 40 ml in a 250 ml round bottom flask rbf and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 5 h after completion of the reaction the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature the precipitate formed was filtered off and washed with excess methanol a purple solid was obtained with an overall yield of 9 ttpap was characterized by nmr spectroscopy the 1h nmr profile of porphyrin 1 matched that reported in the literature s3 2 2 fabrication of porphyrin microstructures from ttpap monomers first 8 mg of ttpap was dissolved in thf various fractions of water 0 100 v v were added to the porphyrin solution under stirring at room temperature in the dark for 1 h the obtained aggregates were then filtered and dried for further characterization 2 3 photocatalytic investigation the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap micro rod and belt crystals was evaluated in the degradation of rhb in aqueous media in a typical photodegradation measurement 0 1 mg of ttpap assembled in 50 or 60 thf h2o was dispersed in 20 ml of 5 mg l 1 rhb dye the resulting dispersions were stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption desorption equilibrium before irradiation the visible light source for the photocatalytic reaction was a 350 w air cooled xenon lamp with a uv cut off filter which only allowed wavelengths of 400 nm to penetrate every 30 min a 1 5 ml aliquot of the dispersion was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst the photocatalytic performance of the as fabricated samples for rhb degradation was evaluated by recording the real time uv vis absorption spectra of rhb at a wavelength of 553 nm 2 4 characterization ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption measurements of the samples in solution and in the solid state were carried out using a cary 50 bio spectrophotometer with 1 cm path length cell uv vis absorption measurements were also employed to monitor the photocatalytic performance for rhodamine b degradation a horiba jobinyvon fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer was used to record the fluorescence emission spectra of ttpap in the thf h2o mixtures all experiments were performed in a quartz cell with a 1 cm path length under excitation at a wavelength of 420 nm the supramolecular self assembled nanostructured morphology of ttpap in the thf h2o mixtures was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem using a fei verios 460 l instrument operating under hv and stage bias conditions at 1 kev using stage bias and a circular scatter detector for low conductivity samples a bruker axs d8 discover instrument with a general area detector diffraction system gadds and a cu kα source was utilized to obtain x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the ttpap monomer and aggregates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ttpap the molecular structure of ttpap is shown in fig 1 a uv vis spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties of the ttpap monomer and aggregates formed in the thf h2o mixture as shown in fig 1b the uv vis spectrum of monomeric ttpap in thf showed a strong soret band at 435 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition in the porphyrin structure along with four typical q bands in the 500 700 nm range corresponding to the transition from a2u π to e g π 50 51 when water was added to ttpap in thf solution a remarkable red shift 17 nm was observed in the absorption spectra with a significant decrease in the intensity compared to that of the monomer when 60 h2o in thf was used the absorbance peak of the soret band appeared at 452 nm this significant red shift demonstrates the formation of j aggregates within the supramolecular assemblies 46 52 furthermore the integration of four peaks in the q bands of the ttpap monomer into one relatively strong peak at around 660 nm in the uv vis spectrum of ttpap in the thf h2o mixture also supports j type aggregates the optical properties of ttpap in the monomers as well as in the aggregated states were investigated by monitoring the fluoresence emission after excitation a wavelength of 435 nm as shown in fig 2 a the photoluminescence pl spectrum of the monomeric ttpap molecules in pure thf shows a strong peak at 682 nm and a shoulder at around 744 nm when 60 water was added to the ttpap solution the pl intensity decreased significantly suggesting a quenching effect the quenching effect can also be clearly seen by the naked eye in the inset of fig 2a and b where ttpap in pure thf solution emits strong red fluorescence under excitation at 435 nm the red emission disappeared when the water fraction was increased to 90 the quenching effect or in other words the decrease in the emission intensity is due to coupling via spatial packing of the ttpap molecules during aggregation 31 45 which further confirms the self assembly of ttpap in the thf h2o mixture the supramolecular self assembled structures of ttpap in pure thf and thf h2o mixtures were investigated using sem the samples for sem observation were prepared by dropping porphyrin aggregates on the surface of a silicon wafer followed by evaporation of the solvent at ambient temperature the results are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly seen that without the addition of water the ttpap monomer has undefined particle structures interestingly at the water fraction of 50 ttpap assembled into a rod like microstructure with a length of about 5 μm and diameter of 0 5 1 5 μm fig 3b further increasing the water fraction to 60 resulted in the formation of belt like microstructures with a diameter of approximately 2 μm and length of more than 10 μm fig 3c we believe that this assembly may be ascribed to balanced stacking between the hydrophobic periphery of ttpap accompanied by π π interactions of the porphyrin core these interactions are responsible for the formation of ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the mixed thf h2o solvent however when the water fraction was increased to 70 the well defined microstructures tended to aggregate fig 3d further at a water fraction of 90 only fused particles were observed fig 3e this phenomenon is explained by the low solubility of ttpap in higher percentages of water thus the high water fraction prevents crystal nucleation for self assembly 45 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to confirm the role of non covalent interactions of porphyrin molecules during the formation of microstructures via self assembly the ftir spectra of the ttpap monomers and self assembled ttpap in the thf h2o mixture are shown in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of the monomeric ttpap molecules red line exhibits two strong stretching vibration bands at 1484 and 1585 cm 1 which are ascribed to the cc bonds of the aromatic porphyrin cores and aromatic triphenyl amines respectively as discussed above π π interactions are responsible for the formation of the ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the thf h2o mixture these interactions plausibly arise via stacking of the cc functional groups in the porphyrin molecules this is demonstrated by a shift in the vibration bands of the cc groups in the aromatic porphyrin cores and aromatic periphery from 1484 cm 1 to 1492 cm 1 and from 1585 cm 1 to 1592 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum of assembled ttpap in the thf h2o mixture gray line 47 53 the significant decrease in the peak intensity in the ftir spectrum of assembled ttpap also confirms the occurrence of the self assembly process the crystallinity of the assembled ttpap microstructures formed in thf h2o was characterized by xrd and compared with that of the monomeric form of ttpap fig 5 shows the xrd patterns of the ttpap monomers red line and ttpap microstructures black line formed in the thf h2o mixture with a water fraction of 60 no peaks were observed in the xrd pattern of the monomeric ttpap molecules which indicates the amorphous nature of ttpap in the monomeric form interestingly the xrd pattern of ttpap assembled in the thf h2o mixture showed several sharp peaks in the range of 15 to 60 indicating that aggregated ttpap had a crystalline structure these results further support the formation of ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the thf h2o mixtures 3 2 photocatalytic degradation activity the basic core of ttpap is structurally similar to natural chlorophyll from plants and algae which is a photoactive molecule that exhibits high photocatalytic activity in many biological systems 53 many porphyrin based nanomaterials obtained via self assembly from previous works including our work on the field show high photocatalytic performance under sunlight irradiation 49 54 57 therefore we believe that assembled ttpap may have good photocatalytic activity in the uv vis region the band gap energy of the ttpap aggregates formed with water fractions of 50 and 60 was calculated to be approximately 2 818 and 2 75 ev respectively which indicates that self assembled ttpap may be photocatalytically active in the visible light region thus in this study photodegradation of rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation with a xenon lamp 350 w was utilized to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap aggregates in comparison with the monomeric ttpap molecule fig 6 shows the percentage removal of rhb and ln c co versus time plot when the ttpap monomer and aggregates were used as photocatalysts for rhb degradation under visible light irradiation the control experiment without photocatalysts black curve reveals that there is no self photodegradation of rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation when the rhb solution was added to monomeric ttpap a slow change in the rhb concentration slow degradation rate was observed with a rhb removal percentage of approximately 20 after 325 min fig 6a interestingly the degradation rate of rhb increased significantly when the ttpap aggregates were utilized as photocatalysts the percentage rhb degradation visible light irradiation was enhanced to approximately 48 and 70 when the ttpap aggregates assembled in thf h2o with water fractions of 50 and 60 were used respectively the higher photocatalytic activity of nanostructured ttpap obtained with a water fraction of 60 compared with that obtained with 50 water fraction might be ascribed to the higher surface area and well defined nanostructures of the ttpap aggregates obtained with a water fraction of 60 as discussed in relation to the sem images the results indicate that the aggregated form of ttpap can act as an organic semiconductor which enables photocatalytic activity under light irradiation the degradation kinetics for rhb removal by the ttpap photocatalysts in aqueous solution were investigated by plotting ln c co vs time where c is the rhb concentration at time t and co is the initial rhb concentration as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of rhb under controlled conditions and in the presence of the ttpap monomers was negligible whereas a significant enhancement in the rate of rhb degradation was observed when the ttpap aggregates were used as photocatalysts the relative rate constants were determined to be 1 87 10 3 and 3 4 103 min 1 for rhb degradation by the ttpap catalyst obtained in the thf h2o mixtures with water fractions of 50 and 60 respectively in comparison the relative rate constants for rhb degradation with the tio2 p25 photocatalyst was approximately 1 2 10 3 min 1 48 58 thus our results show that the degradation rates for rhb dye are superior this can be explained by the well arranged porphyrin nanostructures formed by the ttpap molecules which are structurally similar to biological light harvesting molecules of chlorophyll these structures afford high stability and better charge separation for photocatalysis 59 the reusability of the self assembled ttpap nanostructures as photocatalysts for the removal of rhb was evaluated in a bath experiment under visible light irradiation after each cycle the photocatalyst was removed by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with distilled water before use for the next photocatalytic cycle this process was repeated for 5 cycles and the results are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap photocatalyst decreased negligibly after each cycle of reuse in particular in the 1st cycle the rhb degradation efficiency was approximately 95 however after 5 cycles the removal efficiency remained as high as 78 which indicates that the activity of the ttpap photocatalyst is relatively stable under the experimental conditions 3 3 proposed photocatalytic degradation reaction mechanism porphyrin derivatives the structure and photochemical properties of which are similar to those of natural chlorophyll have been extensively studied as effective sensitizers for light energy absorption well defined nanostructures formed from monomeric porphyrin molecules can be used as effective photocatalysts 30 the semiconducting properties of nanostructured porphyrin are believed to be due to strong π π interactions between the porphyrin molecules via the formation of j aggregates because of their semiconducting nature porphyrin aggregates can absorb light energy to generate electrons and holes which are active species that form radicals for the degradation of dyes 49 importantly the exciton coupled charge transfer processes in j aggregates could improve the charge separation of the e h pairs and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity of porphyrin semiconductors 60 highly stable photoexcited electrons and holes can react with water and oxygen to form active species such as oh or o2 which can oxidize hazardous pollutants into co2 and h2o 61 in our previous work the photocatalytic mechanisms for various porphyrin derivatives were thoroughly investigated and discussed 46 47 49 53 57 thus based on well established literature our previous work and especially from the above results and discussion a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity in the degradation of rhb dye is proposed fig 8 when nanostructured ttpap semiconductors are activated by visible irradiation the photon energy is absorbed on the surface of the ttpap aggregates and generates electron and hole e h pairs by the jumping phenomenon of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band 62 under normal conditions these generated e h facilely combine to release energy mostly in the form of photoluminescence however owing to the ease of charge transfer in the j type stacking of ttpap aggregates the photoexcited electrons and holes are well separated the generated electrons react with oxygen in water to form o2 on the surface of the materials these active species can then oxidize rhb dye into harmless species such as h2o and co2 the photoexcited holes take part in the direct oxidation of rhb dye and react with h2o to form negative oh ions which can further oxidize rhb dye to form harmless species 4 conclusions rod and belt like porphyrin microstructures were successfully formed via the solvophobic self assembly of ttpap monomers in thf h2o mixed solvent the assembled porphyrin microrods and microbelts had a length of 5 and 2 μm and diameter of 0 5 1 5 and 10 μm respectively the main driving forces for the formation of well defined morphologies from supramolecular porphyrin molecules in the thf h2o mixture were determined to be stacking between the aromatic periphery of the porphyrin monomer and the π π interactions of the porphyrin cores the resultant porphyrin aggregates exhibit high photocatalytic activity for rhb degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation with degradation rates of 1 87 10 3 and 3 4 103 min 1 for the rod and belt like structures respectively which are superior to those of several inorganic semiconductors used as photocatalysts the j type stacking of ttpap aggregates is believed to enhance charge separation resulting in improved photocatalytic performance these results indicate that supramolecular nanomaterials can be easily self assembled through the introduction of triphenylamine groups onto a porphyrin core along with control of the solvent properties allowing monomeric porphyrin molecules to aggregate into morphologically well defined species that can be employed as effective photocatalysts for harvesting the photon energy from sunlight thereby generating a renewable fuel radicals free oxygen for safe environmental remediation declaration of competing interest the authors

in aqueous media under simulated visible irradiation the belt like porphyrin aggregates exhibit better performance than the rod like counterparts under the same reaction conditions a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of the ttpap aggregates in rhb degradation is also presented keywords porphyrin based nanostructures tetrakis triphenylamine porphyrin photocatalyst photodegradation rhodamine b dye 1 introduction economic development has led to severe threats to the ecosystem and especially human health because of contamination of the environment with various toxic chemicals from industrial wastewater 1 3 intensive global research has been directed toward amending this problem one of the largest water pollutants is dye from industrial sectors such as the food leather mining paper pharmaceutical printing and textile industries the three most common dyes present in industrial wastewater are azo derivatives triphenylmethane and phenothiazine 4 rhodamine b rhb is a dye that is commonly found in the wastewater from many industrial manufacturing processes rhb is toxic neurotoxic and carcinogenic to human beings as well as ecosystems 5 10 consequently the removal of rhb dye from wastewater is critical for human health and the ecosystem and is thus the subject of extensive research in order to remove rhb dye from wastewater many techniques have been developed including but not limited to chemical and biological treatment physical and chemical adsorption photocatalytic degradation and combined methods 11 16 among these techniques the photodegradation approach has been demonstrated as a cheap and effective method for the remediation of rhb containing wastewater 17 21 many inorganic semiconductors such as tio2 zno g c3n4 mos2 and cufe2o4 have been employed as photocatalysts for the removal of rhb dyes 22 25 however these photocatalysts only absorb photon energy in the uv region and some of them exhibit low photocatalytic performance which hinders their practical applications thus it is crucial to unearth a new range of photocatalysts for effective utilization of photon energy over the broad spectrum of light 26 organic semiconductors are an emerging field of research and have attracted widespread attention from many scientists as they afford the ability to tailor their photocatalytic properties as well as effective charge separation 27 29 some of the most studied organic semiconductors as photocatalysts are porphyrin based nanostructures 30 many porphyrin nanostructures with various morphologies such as nanosheets nanoplates nanorods nano cloves nanofibers nanowires nanoflowers and nanobelts have been successfully fabricated and show remarkable photocatalytic activity toward various contaminant dyes in wastewater 12 31 36 the majority of porphyrin based nanostructures can be easily obtained via supramolecular self assembly of monomeric π conjugated porphyrin molecules which is an effective approach for the fabrication of functional soft nanomaterials 37 38 the three typical types of self assembly techniques are reprecipitation 39 42 surfactant assisted self assembly sas 43 and ionic self assembly 44 these approaches are commonly used to obtain porphyrin nanomaterials for photocatalysis applications for example hierarchical porphyrin nanocrystals such as nanosheets octahedra and microspheres were successfully obtained via self assembly and these nanostructured porphyrins showed high photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of certain dyes 45 recently our group fabricated several nanostructured porphyrin based hybrid nanomaterials by self assembly of tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphyrin tcpp these hybrids showed high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhb dye 31 46 49 nevertheless there is still a need to develop new porphyrins that can be synthesized easily and can provide better photocatalytic activity herein a new porphyrin based nanomaterial is synthesized via the solvophobic self assembly of tetrakis triphenylamine porphyrin ttpap monomers into various forms such as rod like and belt like microstructures depending on the water fraction in thf the physical and chemical properties of the nanostructured porphyrin are determined while both porphyrin microstructures rod like and belt like show reasonable photocatalytic activity toward rhodamine b rhb dye under simulated visible irradiation the belt like porphyrin aggregates exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activity toward rhb degradation compared to the rod like congeners under the same reaction conditions a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of the ttpap aggregates in rhb degradation is also presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used herein triphenylamine pyrrole propionic acid pocl3 n n dimethyl formamide dmf tetrahydrofuran thf and rhodamine b were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification synthesis of triphenylamine porphyrin ttpap synthesis of 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde was synthesized using a literature procedure s2 typically triphenylamine 2 5 g 10 1 mmol was dissolved in 6 ml of dmf and then cooled to 0 c pocl3 4 7 ml 52 mmol was added slowly dropwise to the mixture at 0 c after complete addition the reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature the mixture changed color to red the reaction mixture was then heated to 45 c for 2 h the reaction mixture was then poured into an ice water mixture and the precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol to give the product in 86 yield the identity of this compound 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde was confirmed by 1h nmr where the nmr data correctly matched the reported data in the literature s1 synthesis of ttpap ttpap was synthesized using a literature procedure s3 typically ttap was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of fresh pyrrole 0 64 ml 9 1 mmol and 4 diphenylamino benzaldehyde 2 5 g 9 1 mmol in 40 ml propionic acid 40 ml in a 250 ml round bottom flask rbf and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 5 h after completion of the reaction the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature the precipitate formed was filtered off and washed with excess methanol a purple solid was obtained with an overall yield of 9 ttpap was characterized by nmr spectroscopy the 1h nmr profile of porphyrin 1 matched that reported in the literature s3 2 2 fabrication of porphyrin microstructures from ttpap monomers first 8 mg of ttpap was dissolved in thf various fractions of water 0 100 v v were added to the porphyrin solution under stirring at room temperature in the dark for 1 h the obtained aggregates were then filtered and dried for further characterization 2 3 photocatalytic investigation the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap micro rod and belt crystals was evaluated in the degradation of rhb in aqueous media in a typical photodegradation measurement 0 1 mg of ttpap assembled in 50 or 60 thf h2o was dispersed in 20 ml of 5 mg l 1 rhb dye the resulting dispersions were stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption desorption equilibrium before irradiation the visible light source for the photocatalytic reaction was a 350 w air cooled xenon lamp with a uv cut off filter which only allowed wavelengths of 400 nm to penetrate every 30 min a 1 5 ml aliquot of the dispersion was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst the photocatalytic performance of the as fabricated samples for rhb degradation was evaluated by recording the real time uv vis absorption spectra of rhb at a wavelength of 553 nm 2 4 characterization ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption measurements of the samples in solution and in the solid state were carried out using a cary 50 bio spectrophotometer with 1 cm path length cell uv vis absorption measurements were also employed to monitor the photocatalytic performance for rhodamine b degradation a horiba jobinyvon fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer was used to record the fluorescence emission spectra of ttpap in the thf h2o mixtures all experiments were performed in a quartz cell with a 1 cm path length under excitation at a wavelength of 420 nm the supramolecular self assembled nanostructured morphology of ttpap in the thf h2o mixtures was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem using a fei verios 460 l instrument operating under hv and stage bias conditions at 1 kev using stage bias and a circular scatter detector for low conductivity samples a bruker axs d8 discover instrument with a general area detector diffraction system gadds and a cu kα source was utilized to obtain x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the ttpap monomer and aggregates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ttpap the molecular structure of ttpap is shown in fig 1 a uv vis spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties of the ttpap monomer and aggregates formed in the thf h2o mixture as shown in fig 1b the uv vis spectrum of monomeric ttpap in thf showed a strong soret band at 435 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition in the porphyrin structure along with four typical q bands in the 500 700 nm range corresponding to the transition from a2u π to e g π 50 51 when water was added to ttpap in thf solution a remarkable red shift 17 nm was observed in the absorption spectra with a significant decrease in the intensity compared to that of the monomer when 60 h2o in thf was used the absorbance peak of the soret band appeared at 452 nm this significant red shift demonstrates the formation of j aggregates within the supramolecular assemblies 46 52 furthermore the integration of four peaks in the q bands of the ttpap monomer into one relatively strong peak at around 660 nm in the uv vis spectrum of ttpap in the thf h2o mixture also supports j type aggregates the optical properties of ttpap in the monomers as well as in the aggregated states were investigated by monitoring the fluoresence emission after excitation a wavelength of 435 nm as shown in fig 2 a the photoluminescence pl spectrum of the monomeric ttpap molecules in pure thf shows a strong peak at 682 nm and a shoulder at around 744 nm when 60 water was added to the ttpap solution the pl intensity decreased significantly suggesting a quenching effect the quenching effect can also be clearly seen by the naked eye in the inset of fig 2a and b where ttpap in pure thf solution emits strong red fluorescence under excitation at 435 nm the red emission disappeared when the water fraction was increased to 90 the quenching effect or in other words the decrease in the emission intensity is due to coupling via spatial packing of the ttpap molecules during aggregation 31 45 which further confirms the self assembly of ttpap in the thf h2o mixture the supramolecular self assembled structures of ttpap in pure thf and thf h2o mixtures were investigated using sem the samples for sem observation were prepared by dropping porphyrin aggregates on the surface of a silicon wafer followed by evaporation of the solvent at ambient temperature the results are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly seen that without the addition of water the ttpap monomer has undefined particle structures interestingly at the water fraction of 50 ttpap assembled into a rod like microstructure with a length of about 5 μm and diameter of 0 5 1 5 μm fig 3b further increasing the water fraction to 60 resulted in the formation of belt like microstructures with a diameter of approximately 2 μm and length of more than 10 μm fig 3c we believe that this assembly may be ascribed to balanced stacking between the hydrophobic periphery of ttpap accompanied by π π interactions of the porphyrin core these interactions are responsible for the formation of ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the mixed thf h2o solvent however when the water fraction was increased to 70 the well defined microstructures tended to aggregate fig 3d further at a water fraction of 90 only fused particles were observed fig 3e this phenomenon is explained by the low solubility of ttpap in higher percentages of water thus the high water fraction prevents crystal nucleation for self assembly 45 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to confirm the role of non covalent interactions of porphyrin molecules during the formation of microstructures via self assembly the ftir spectra of the ttpap monomers and self assembled ttpap in the thf h2o mixture are shown in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of the monomeric ttpap molecules red line exhibits two strong stretching vibration bands at 1484 and 1585 cm 1 which are ascribed to the cc bonds of the aromatic porphyrin cores and aromatic triphenyl amines respectively as discussed above π π interactions are responsible for the formation of the ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the thf h2o mixture these interactions plausibly arise via stacking of the cc functional groups in the porphyrin molecules this is demonstrated by a shift in the vibration bands of the cc groups in the aromatic porphyrin cores and aromatic periphery from 1484 cm 1 to 1492 cm 1 and from 1585 cm 1 to 1592 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum of assembled ttpap in the thf h2o mixture gray line 47 53 the significant decrease in the peak intensity in the ftir spectrum of assembled ttpap also confirms the occurrence of the self assembly process the crystallinity of the assembled ttpap microstructures formed in thf h2o was characterized by xrd and compared with that of the monomeric form of ttpap fig 5 shows the xrd patterns of the ttpap monomers red line and ttpap microstructures black line formed in the thf h2o mixture with a water fraction of 60 no peaks were observed in the xrd pattern of the monomeric ttpap molecules which indicates the amorphous nature of ttpap in the monomeric form interestingly the xrd pattern of ttpap assembled in the thf h2o mixture showed several sharp peaks in the range of 15 to 60 indicating that aggregated ttpap had a crystalline structure these results further support the formation of ttpap microstructures via self assembly in the thf h2o mixtures 3 2 photocatalytic degradation activity the basic core of ttpap is structurally similar to natural chlorophyll from plants and algae which is a photoactive molecule that exhibits high photocatalytic activity in many biological systems 53 many porphyrin based nanomaterials obtained via self assembly from previous works including our work on the field show high photocatalytic performance under sunlight irradiation 49 54 57 therefore we believe that assembled ttpap may have good photocatalytic activity in the uv vis region the band gap energy of the ttpap aggregates formed with water fractions of 50 and 60 was calculated to be approximately 2 818 and 2 75 ev respectively which indicates that self assembled ttpap may be photocatalytically active in the visible light region thus in this study photodegradation of rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation with a xenon lamp 350 w was utilized to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap aggregates in comparison with the monomeric ttpap molecule fig 6 shows the percentage removal of rhb and ln c co versus time plot when the ttpap monomer and aggregates were used as photocatalysts for rhb degradation under visible light irradiation the control experiment without photocatalysts black curve reveals that there is no self photodegradation of rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation when the rhb solution was added to monomeric ttpap a slow change in the rhb concentration slow degradation rate was observed with a rhb removal percentage of approximately 20 after 325 min fig 6a interestingly the degradation rate of rhb increased significantly when the ttpap aggregates were utilized as photocatalysts the percentage rhb degradation visible light irradiation was enhanced to approximately 48 and 70 when the ttpap aggregates assembled in thf h2o with water fractions of 50 and 60 were used respectively the higher photocatalytic activity of nanostructured ttpap obtained with a water fraction of 60 compared with that obtained with 50 water fraction might be ascribed to the higher surface area and well defined nanostructures of the ttpap aggregates obtained with a water fraction of 60 as discussed in relation to the sem images the results indicate that the aggregated form of ttpap can act as an organic semiconductor which enables photocatalytic activity under light irradiation the degradation kinetics for rhb removal by the ttpap photocatalysts in aqueous solution were investigated by plotting ln c co vs time where c is the rhb concentration at time t and co is the initial rhb concentration as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of rhb under controlled conditions and in the presence of the ttpap monomers was negligible whereas a significant enhancement in the rate of rhb degradation was observed when the ttpap aggregates were used as photocatalysts the relative rate constants were determined to be 1 87 10 3 and 3 4 103 min 1 for rhb degradation by the ttpap catalyst obtained in the thf h2o mixtures with water fractions of 50 and 60 respectively in comparison the relative rate constants for rhb degradation with the tio2 p25 photocatalyst was approximately 1 2 10 3 min 1 48 58 thus our results show that the degradation rates for rhb dye are superior this can be explained by the well arranged porphyrin nanostructures formed by the ttpap molecules which are structurally similar to biological light harvesting molecules of chlorophyll these structures afford high stability and better charge separation for photocatalysis 59 the reusability of the self assembled ttpap nanostructures as photocatalysts for the removal of rhb was evaluated in a bath experiment under visible light irradiation after each cycle the photocatalyst was removed by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with distilled water before use for the next photocatalytic cycle this process was repeated for 5 cycles and the results are shown in fig 7 it is obvious that the photocatalytic performance of the ttpap photocatalyst decreased negligibly after each cycle of reuse in particular in the 1st cycle the rhb degradation efficiency was approximately 95 however after 5 cycles the removal efficiency remained as high as 78 which indicates that the activity of the ttpap photocatalyst is relatively stable under the experimental conditions 3 3 proposed photocatalytic degradation reaction mechanism porphyrin derivatives the structure and photochemical properties of which are similar to those of natural chlorophyll have been extensively studied as effective sensitizers for light energy absorption well defined nanostructures formed from monomeric porphyrin molecules can be used as effective photocatalysts 30 the semiconducting properties of nanostructured porphyrin are believed to be due to strong π π interactions between the porphyrin molecules via the formation of j aggregates because of their semiconducting nature porphyrin aggregates can absorb light energy to generate electrons and holes which are active species that form radicals for the degradation of dyes 49 importantly the exciton coupled charge transfer processes in j aggregates could improve the charge separation of the e h pairs and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity of porphyrin semiconductors 60 highly stable photoexcited electrons and holes can react with water and oxygen to form active species such as oh or o2 which can oxidize hazardous pollutants into co2 and h2o 61 in our previous work the photocatalytic mechanisms for various porphyrin derivatives were thoroughly investigated and discussed 46 47 49 53 57 thus based on well established literature our previous work and especially from the above results and discussion a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity in the degradation of rhb dye is proposed fig 8 when nanostructured ttpap semiconductors are activated by visible irradiation the photon energy is absorbed on the surface of the ttpap aggregates and generates electron and hole e h pairs by the jumping phenomenon of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band 62 under normal conditions these generated e h facilely combine to release energy mostly in the form of photoluminescence however owing to the ease of charge transfer in the j type stacking of ttpap aggregates the photoexcited electrons and holes are well separated the generated electrons react with oxygen in water to form o2 on the surface of the materials these active species can then oxidize rhb dye into harmless species such as h2o and co2 the photoexcited holes take part in the direct oxidation of rhb dye and react with h2o to form negative oh ions which can further oxidize rhb dye to form harmless species 4 conclusions rod and belt like porphyrin microstructures were successfully formed via the solvophobic self assembly of ttpap monomers in thf h2o mixed solvent the assembled porphyrin microrods and microbelts had a length of 5 and 2 μm and diameter of 0 5 1 5 and 10 μm respectively the main driving forces for the formation of well defined morphologies from supramolecular porphyrin molecules in the thf h2o mixture were determined to be stacking between the aromatic periphery of the porphyrin monomer and the π π interactions of the porphyrin cores the resultant porphyrin aggregates exhibit high photocatalytic activity for rhb degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation with degradation rates of 1 87 10 3 and 3 4 103 min 1 for the rod and belt like structures respectively which are superior to those of several inorganic semiconductors used as photocatalysts the j type stacking of ttpap aggregates is believed to enhance charge separation resulting in improved photocatalytic performance these results indicate that supramolecular nanomaterials can be easily self assembled through the introduction of triphenylamine groups onto a porphyrin core along with control of the solvent properties allowing monomeric porphyrin molecules to aggregate into morphologically well defined species that can be employed as effective photocatalysts for harvesting the photon energy from sunlight thereby generating a renewable fuel radicals free oxygen for safe environmental remediation declaration of competing interest the authors
