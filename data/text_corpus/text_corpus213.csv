environmental factors macroinvertebrates methods 1 introduction coastal wetlands are a special ecosystem distributed between terrestrial ecosystems and marine ecosystems due to the particularity of the location coiacetto 1996 ryan and ntiamoa baidu 2000 zhou et al 2011 the biodiversity and ecological functions of coastal wetlands have become the hotspots of international wetland scientific research ryan and ntiamoa baidu 2000 frança et al 2009 coastal wetlands provide habitat and breeding grounds for tens of thousands of fish birds benthic organisms and plankton bildstein et al 1991 kim 2010 yang et al 2017 among these living organisms macroinvertebrates are an important part of the coastal wetland ecosystem and they are one of the most widely distributed fauna groups in coastal wetlands playing a very important role in the nutrient cycle and energy flux of the coastal wetland ecosystem alongi and christoffersen 1992 proffitt and devlin 2005 lee 2008 okyere et al 2011 tantikamton et al 2015 walag and canencia 2016 there are many studies on macroinvertebrates mainly focusing on their biodiversity barros et al 2014 blanchet et al 2014 japoshvili et al 2016 d alessandro et al 2018 the analytical methods mainly include the biological characteristics such as shannon wiener index simpson index margalef index abundance density richness as well as physico chemical variables fernandes and soares gomes 2006 pavlyuk and trebukhova 2011 qiu et al 2014 srinivas et al 2019 and statistical analysis principal component analysis pca analysis of variance anova non multidimensional scale nmds cluster analysis analysis of similarity anosim etc spruzen et al 2008 rumisha et al 2015 palmer et al 2016 camargo et al 2017 currently it is popular for researchers to combine ecological characteristics with the statistical analysis to achieve the research objective for example richness evenness shannon wiener index simpson index margalef index cluster analysis nmds and principal component analysis pca were used to study the distribution and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in pondicherry mangroves india kumar and khan 2013 richness abundance anova cluster analysis and multivariate analysis were used to study differential response of benthic macrofauna to the formation of novel oyster reefs crassostrea gigas thunberg on soft and rocky substrate in the intertidal of the bay of brest france lejart and hily 2011 most of the existing researches focus on the dominant species community structure influencing factors diversity characteristics of macroinvertebrates and the role of macroinvertebrates in ecological environment assessment in a single coastal wetland warwick et al 1991 chainho et al 2007 dauvin et al 2009 yu et al 2012 morais and lee 2014 shi et al 2014 noman et al 2019 it has been pointed out that the environmental factors affect their diversity and directly lead to the changes of macroinvertebrate taxa composition in coastal wetlands flemer et al 1998 vale et al 2010 de juan and hewitt 2011 at present the identification of major environmental factors and analysis of their impact on the dominant species and species diversity of macroinvertebrates in coastal wetlands are still lacking systematic review at the regional scale the environmental factors of coastal wetlands are necessary for the growth and reproduction of macroinvertebrates stenert et al 2008 elliott et al 2013 the relationship between macroinvertebrate diversity and environmental factors salinity temperature ph etc was revealed in existing studies yildiz et al 2010 elliott et al 2013 galván et al 2016 for example salinity has a significant impact on macroinvertebrate communities the diversity and number of macroinvertebrates species decrease with decreasing salinity in the intertidal zone of the scheldt estuary in europe hampel et al 2009 the dissolved oxygen do concentration affects the community structure of macroinvertebrates in the intertidal zone of sanhewan in japan and reduced macroinvertebrates species with the do concentration decreasing suzuki 1998 the total organic carbon content in sediments is the main factor affecting the distribution of macroinvertebrates on the eastern coast of the mediterranean sea kröncke et al 2003 macroinvertebrate community is affected by the eutrophication of water bodies in the intertidal zone of hangzhou bay so most of them are polychaetes with strong ability to adapt to harsh environment the nature of the substrate has a decisive effect on the species composition of macroinvertebrates in the dongzhaigang mangrove wetland the different substrates have different types and quantities of macroinvertebrates ma et al 2012 studies have shown that the dominant environmental factors affecting the biodiversity of macroinvertebrate communities differ in different study areas the objective of this study was to review the current state of knowledge regarding the study methods of macroinvertebrate in coastal wetland specifically we use the data of macroinvertebrate and environmental characteristics in coastal wetlands to understand responses of macroinvertebrate to the environmental factor in global scale at the same time sampling methodology such as sampling equipment analytical methods are summarized in this paper we aim to seek the answers of the following questions 1 the hotspots of the studies on coastal macroinvertebrate 2 the most popular methods used in recent study 3 the key factors that affect the diversity of macroinvertebrates 2 methods 2 1 literature collection the data set originated from published scientific literature on macroinvertebrate in coastal wetlands we screened the isi web of science and sciencedirect online for papers about macroinvertebrates published before 2019 the papers were collected by a search using the terms benthic macroinvertebrate benthic macrofauna with coastal wetland s estuary mangrove forest intertidal zone marine a total of published 335 articles containing 122 coastal wetlands were collected over the last two decades and then we removed inappropriate articles based on study area such as the marine freshwater etc therefore 104 coastal wetlands belonging to 68 studies were selected owing to the availability of the related parameters used in this study according to the details of collected papers the data set of the other coastal wetlands were eliminated because of the lack of ecological variables or statistical data we also searched for other published studies that had relatively complete species and environmental data we used the mean value of macroinvertebrate richness and environmental parameters for each coastal wetland if two or more were available to broaden and adjust the data on macroinvertebrate richness and coastal wetland environment parameters 2 2 data collection firstly the habitat types were classified into four categories according to the geographic features e g land formation and climate and the distribution of flora and fauna in coastal wetlands the location longitude and latitude and dominant species top three if less than three being recorded as many as possible of each coastal wetland were recorded secondly macroinvertebrate species diversity data and environment characteristics of each coastal wetland were obtained from published studies to explore the impact of different environmental factors on macroinvertebrate species diversity we collected temperature c salinity ph dissolved oxygen do mg l biological oxygen demand bod mg l organic matter content and many other kinds of environmental variables however we excluded most of chemical variables because of the insufficiency of such data to constitute a statistical sample less than 30 data points in addition the details of field and desk work were collected including biodiversity characteristics analysis method sampling period sampling instrument mesh sieve and fixed solutions in each study the total area total number of samples multiplies sample area and volume sampling area multiplies depth of sampling for each experiment site were calculated fig 1 2 3 data analysis four indices shannon wiener index shannon and weaver 1949 simpson index simpson 1949 margalef index margalef 1967 and evenness pielou 1966 were calculated from collected macroinvertebrate data to assess the diversity of macroinvertebrate species in coastal wetlands the data were analyzed in the software microsoft excel 2016 spss 25 and origin 9 0 spss version 25 was used for correlation analyses in the macroinvertebrate diversity index diversity richness and evenness and coastal wetland environment parameters temperature salinity ph do bod and organic matter content and performed to identify the variables that were most closely related to macroinvertebrate diversity the geographical distributions maps of macroinvertebrate habitation and richness sampling time replication and sampling sites were drawn by the software arcgis 10 2 the pie chart of the sampling instrument mesh sieve type and fixed solution type were draw with the software origin 9 0 the histogram of analytical methods and biodiversity characteristics were draw with the software microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 research hotspots at present the study of macroinvertebrates in coastal wetlands is mainly distributed in seven regions the coastal areas of east asia i south asia ii eastern oceania iii southeastern africa vi western europe v eastern north america vi and eastern south america vii at the same time there are also a small number of studies in coastal areas such as western south america western north america western africa and western oceania fig 2 3 2 research area the location of research sites showed that studies on macroinvertebrate were mainly carried out in middle and low latitude area most of the studied coastal wetlands 87 8 were located ranging from 45 s to 45 n whereas no study about macroinvertebrates were found in high latitudes area continental coastal wetlands beyond 63 5 n and 63 5 s the 104 coastal wetlands are divided into four types estuary 51 intertidal zone 32 7 mangrove 8 7 and others 7 6 fig 3 the average species richness in estuarine intertidal mangroves is 53 51 35 respectively the richness generally ranges from 5 to 172 except the coastal wetland with 409 taxa in eastern australia 3 3 analytical methods a total of 34 analytical methods were recorded in collected articles 15 methods occurred more than five times and these methods were grouped into two categories statistical methods 8 and biological variables 7 fig 4 richness shannon wiener index evenness and abundance are often used to indicate biodiversity characteristics especially richness is used in 57 39 of the research anova is the most commonly used in statistical method followed by nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds cluster analysis similarity percentage analysis simper 3 4 diversity and its correlation with environmental factors a total of 198 different dominant species were obtained in 100 coastal wetlands the highest species repetition rate is cerithedia cingulate which has a frequency of six there are four species with a frequency of four four species with a frequency of three and 15 dominant species with a frequency of two table 1 it indicates that the dominant species of macroinvertebrates have lower repetition rates and greater differences in different coastal wetlands the mean values of shannon wiener index simpson index margalef index and evenness were 2 37 0 66 1 45 and 0 68 table 2 it can be seen that the macroinvertebrates have higher diversity and rich species in coastal wetlands pearson correlation analysis indicated that the main environmental factors affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates were temperature ph bod and do significant correlations between shannon wiener index with ph r 0 404 p 0 05 do r 0 484 p 0 05 bod r 0 673 p 0 05 were determined simpson index has significant correlation with do r 0 547 p 0 05 a strong correlation was found between margalef index and bod r 0 663 p 0 05 significant associations with evenness were found with the temperature r 0 607 p 0 05 and do r 0 687 p 0 05 richness was significantly correlated with ph r 0 487 p 0 01 fig 5 in the study area pearson correlation analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate species shannon wiener index was positively related to do fig 6 a r 2 0 234 p 0 05 simpson index was positively associated with the do fig 6b r 2 0 30 p 0 05 we noted the strongest association between evenness index and do fig 6c r 2 0 472 p 0 01 besides evenness index was negative correlated with temperature fig 6d r 2 0 368 p 0 05 3 5 sampling protocols the study duration is mainly classified into two groups single year study 45 9 and multiple year study 54 1 fig 7 a total of 14 400 samples were taken from a research site in western europe because the sampling repetition times are up to 10 times the sampling period is up to 3 years and its single sampling area is only 0 0177 m2 the corer diameter is 7 5 cm which is easy to operate a total of 2660 samples were taken from a study site in eastern australia due to a study period of up to six years the correlation between sampling area and species richness was analyzed it was found that there was significant correlation between sampling area and species richness r 0 627 p 0 01 at the same time it was found that there was significant correlation between the sampling volume and the species richness r 0 422 p 0 01 tube sampler quadrat sampler grab sampler were main sampling instruments which occupied 33 7 33 7 and 26 7 respectively other samplers such as shovel chisel tweezers etc took up in total 5 9 the rest of the studies the mesh screen is mainly divided into three types of 0 5 mm 1 0 mm and others e g 0 63 mm mesh sieve 0 25 mm mesh sieve of which 45 1 used the 0 5 mm mesh sieve and 42 8 used the 1 0 mm mesh sieve there are two kinds of fixative solutions formalin solution 81 2 3 5 formalin solution 4 formaldehyde solution 5 formalin solution 8 formalin solution 10 formalin solution and alcohol solution 18 8 70 alcohol 75 ethyl alcohol 95 ethyl alcohol fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 habitats and sampling coastal wetlands include seagrass meadows intertidal flats salt marshes mangrove forests estuarine deltaic and tidal freshwater wetlands wolanski et al 2009 semeniuk and semeniuk 2016 perillo et al 2018 they are distributed in coastal areas around the world this paper mainly records three common wetland types in the estuary intertidal zone and mangrove forest at present there are more and more researches on benthic animals in coastal wetlands in sampling research at least three effective samplings are performed for each sample point in addition studies have shown that sampling with a large number of small sample units 0 25 m2 is more effective than a small number of large sample units 4 0 m2 pringle 1984 a special survey is recommended to determine the most effective sampling unit size before starting sampling which can improve the accuracy of the experiment pielou 1974 pringle 1984 it may be a reasonable and effective method to consider the predation relationship when choosing the sampling time and location of coastal wetlands coastal wetlands are one of the important habitats for birds e g shorebirds migratory birds as a gas station during migratory bird migration butler et al 2001 barter 2002 ma et al 2013 as a food source for birds the abundance of benthos will decrease when birds migrate to the area choi et al 2014 therefore it is a better to select sampling period by avoiding migration bird appearances ensuring the quality of samples 4 2 dominant species and richness there are no dominant species in the collected literatures that are highly similar in this study species composition and richness varies greatly among coastal wetlands while macroinvertebrate species are rich and varied mainly due to differences in environmental factors firstly the differences in habitat types of coastal wetlands are one of the causes of the different dominant species strayer 2007 tweedley and valesini 2008 the dominant species of macroinvertebrates are closely related to environmental factors the combined effects of multiple environmental factors lead to the difference of dominant species which is consistent with the results of li et al 2015 on the biodiversity of macroinvertebrate communities in different habitats of maoyan island china secondly the dominant factors affecting macroinvertebrates are also different in coastal wetlands such as do ph etc which is also the cause of species differences besides the sampling time is also one of the reasons for this result the researchers select not only different experimental sites but also different sampling time the seasonal changes will lead to changes in the dominant species of wetlands studies have shown that the distribution of large invertebrates is affected by seasons and shows seasonal variations choi et al 2014 noman et al 2019 generally the density and abundance of large invertebrates decrease in autumn and winter and then increase in spring and summer franz and harris 1988 lu 2005 chainho et al 2006 the reproduction of large invertebrates and the emergence of new individuals in early summer may explain this situation zhang et al 2016 changes in freshwater input and evaporation intensity are due to seasonal changes which may lead to changes in estuarine and intertidal salinity chainho et al 2006 kundu et al 2010 some large invertebrates other than anabaena will migrate seasonally leading to changes in species community structure rundle et al 1998 in addition long term ice free cover of high latitude coastal wetlands in winter can also affect the abundance and density of large invertebrates zhang et al 2016 therefore the structure of large invertebrate communities obtained at different sampling periods is different species richness and density are also different and the dominant species change accordingly in the present study most research areas had a macroinvertebrate species richness is less than 200 the result that is similar to that of domestic and foreign studies on macroinvertebrates this condition might be attributed to the fact that the productivity of a habitat is limited and that the threshold will be incapable of harboring an excessive number of macroinvertebrate species there is an estuary wetland with a species richness of up to 409 on the eastern coast of australia the reasons are as follows the climate in this area is subtropical monsoon humid climate located at the junction of sea and land with suitable for natural conditions providing a suitable habitat for a variety of animals besides this region has been studied for a long time with the sampling time up to 6 years and the cumulative sampling of 2660 in 30 stations involving the subtidal zone and intertidal zone which can fully understand the species diversity such as richness density etc of macroinvertebrate and their seasonal and interannual variations currie and small 2005 4 3 environmental factors simple correlations indicated that macroinvertebrate diversity was significantly related to temperature ph do and bod except for salinity and organic matter content our results indicate that macroinvertebrate species diversity had significantly correlation with temperature as a driving factor of species diversity temperature is one of the important factors affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates allen et al 2002 the diversity of macroinvertebrates is limited by excessive temperatures al bakri and kittaneh 1998 in the appropriate temperature range the growth rate of macroinvertebrates can be accelerated the turnover rate is shortened the productivity and species diversity are improved with the increase of temperature benke 1993 the greater influence of temperature changes on the smaller individuals this was evidenced by the growth experiments on different sizes of bellamya purificate in temperature gradient cao and jiang 1998 which may be due to the fact that small individuals are less adaptable to the environment than larger individuals in addition a relatively stable aquatic environment of coastal wetlands offers a gentle habitat for macroinvertebrates which have less temperature fluctuation compared with other ecosystems and are suitable for their survival beck et al 2001 this provides conditions for the diversity of macroinvertebrates this study suggests that the ph of coastal wetland and the community diversity of macroinvertebrates show significantly correlation in the present study the observed ph values ranged from 5 09 to 8 5 the ph of most coastal wetlands fluctuated around 7 changes in ph have a major impact on macroinvertebrates studies have shown that the ph affects the birth rate and survival rate of macroinvertebrates walag and canencia 2016 resulting in diversity changes when the ph is too low or too high ph 5 0 or ph 10 0 the reproductive capacity of macroinvertebrates is significantly weakened which may cause death of macroinvertebrates in severe cases with biomass and diversity being reduced the decrease in ph can also trigger the release of heavy metals leading to poisoning of macroinvertebrates which in turn affects the community structure and distribution of macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates have different tolerances for ph studies have shown that ampharetidae polychaeta are most sensitive to ph changes del pilar ruso et al 2008 while bellamya quadrata gastropoda and limnodrilus udekemianus oligochaeta which have a relatively narrow tolerance to ph are negatively correlated with ph chen et al 2012 bod concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the diversity of large invertebrates the higher of the bod value indicated that the more organic pollutants in the water and the more serious the pollution some of the macroinvertebrates that are sensitive to water pollution are often more difficult to survive in organically polluted bodies of water in the present study there is a significant difference in the bod concentration between the coastal wetlands this study shows that the number of macroinvertebrates species and biomass are lower in water with higher bod concentration indicating that organic pollution has greater stress on macroinvertebrates do was significantly associated with shannon wiener index simpson index and evenness index do is an essential substance for life activities such as metabolism of macroinvertebrates and its concentration has direct or indirect effects on macroinvertebrates lim et al 2006 researched the seasonal variation of macroinvertebrates which drawed the conclusion that do plays an important role in the diversity of macroinvertebrates yokoyama 2002 studied the effect of farming on the benthic environments in gokasho bay and realized that do can affect the macroinvertebrates community by affecting the content of sulfide in the sediment macroinvertebrates have a certain adaptability to dissolved oxygen concentration studies have shown that the diversity of macroinvertebrates does not increase continuously with increasing do concentration and it can persist in hypoxic conditions in the short term but hypoxia has a significant impact on the diversity of macroinvertebrates diaz et al 1992 the food assimilation rate of macroinvertebrates will be reduced or even stopped in a hypoxic environment and only maintaining sufficient do levels can maintain their normal life activities martien and benke 1977 the content of do varies from region to region and do availability is one of the main factors affecting the composition and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities the salinity of coastal wetlands was not related to the diversity of macroinvertebrate communities this result is consistent with the conclusions of shou et al 2009 which studied on seasonal distribution of macroinvertebrate and its relations to environmental factors in oujiang river estuary sea area this may be related to the location of coastal wetlands which are mainly distributed at the junction of brackish and fresh water macroinvertebrate species have broad salinity which are highly tolerant to salinity so salinity is less restrictive to them in addition the tolerance range of different species of macroinvertebrates for salinity is also very different most of the macroinvertebrates with low salt tolerance are distributed in estuaries with relatively low salinity such as potamocorbula ustulata species with high salinity tolerance are mostly distributed in offshore areas with relatively high salinity such as palaemon gravieri zhang et al 2007 4 4 sampling protocols benthos are divided into three types according to their size macrobenthos meiobenthos and nanobenthos in the research the benthic invertebrates that cannot pass the 0 5 mm also used in the actual research 1 mm aperture mesh screen are called macroinvertebrates in this paper the two aperture mesh screens of 0 5 mm and 1 0 mm are collected accounting for 87 9 of the total the choice of mesh screen will affect the richness of macroinvertebrates if a 1 0 mm aperture mesh screen is selected macroinvertebrates between 0 5 and 1 0 mm will be missed which will lead to low species richness one hand the fine sieve retains more macroinvertebrate species and its classification and identification requires more time thus increasing the cost of research therefore some benthic studies have used a 1 0 mm sieve because this is considered to be the most cost effective compromise between results reliability and sorting costs lampadariou et al 2005 one the other hand the size of the mesh sieve should be selected according to the situation of macroinvertebrates in the research site if a large aperture mesh sieve is used the number of species and dominant populations in the research site will not be significantly changed compared with the 0 5 mm mesh sieve large mesh screens can be selected to reduce workload houston et al 1983 when studying the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in estuary southampton water found that using a 0 5 mm sieve did not significantly alter the number of species retained or observed dominant species compared with the 1 mm mesh sieve the fixative solutions mainly include formalin and alcohol the formalin solution is a colorless transparent solution which has a strong volatility with a strong pungent taste and is corrosive and toxic dotti et al 2011 compared with formalin alcohol has the advantages of low irritation no corrosiveness no toxicity and the like alcohol solutions are used to store macroinvertebrates enough to kill them and store them for long periods of time however the alcohol solution will decolorize the benthic animals if alcohol is used as the fixative solution the color of the sample should be recorded before adding the alcohol fixing solution so most researchers choose to use formalin solution in addition alcohol can cause the mollusks to shrink so it is necessary to use formaldehyde for anesthesia crustaceans are not suitable for preservation in formalin solution because formaldehyde is neutral but its solution is acidic since formaldehyde is naturally oxidized in the air to form formic acid the formaldehyde solution will converted to a formic acid solution after a long period of time fox et al 1985 so formalin solution can cause damage to the crustacean shell and should be preserved with alcohol the selection of the sampler is mainly based on the environmental conditions dry and wet water depth high tide low tide etc of the sampling point and its convenience downing 1984 quadrat sampler and tube sampler are usually used in areas with low water such as light beach and medium high tide beach the grab sampler is mainly used for underwater sampling in addition the choice of sampler should also consider its cost and efficiency the efficiency of the grab sampler is much higher than quadrat sampler and tube sampler but the cost is relatively high the above two aspects that are usually considered more when sampling 4 5 analytical methods the most frequent occurrences of diversity characteristics are richness shannon wiener index evenness and abundance among which richness is one of the most commonly used indicators to measure biodiversity the most used analysis method is analysis of variance anova as a more traditional analytical method anova has the advantages of simultaneously analyzing the effects of multiple factors and the interaction between analyzable factors and the data used for analysis of variance should be comply with the following assumptions the samples are independent on each other the sample data are from the normal population normality and the treatment group population variance is equal homogeneity of variance therefore before the analysis of variance the normality test and the homogeneity test of variance should be performed if the above requirements are not met variable transformation can be considered in this paper anova is mainly used for the analysis of the richness abundance diversity index community structure biomass and density of macroinvertebrates at present the widely used analytical methods in coastal wetland ecosystems are mostly used to analyze the spatial distribution pattern frança et al 2009 tantikamton et al 2017 community structure hodgson 1987 rumisha et al 2015 zapata hernández et al 2016 and relationship between environmental factors spruzen et al 2008 yu et al 2012 of macroinvertebrates in freshwater ecosystems more attention is paid to the research and analysis of species dufrêne and legendre 1997 fleishman et al 2005 such as the biological monitoring working party bmwp index based on sensitivity silveira et al 2005 gutiérrez fonseca and lorion 2014 and the ept index e ephemeroptera p plecoptera t trichoptera based on indicator species amaral et al 2015 fikri et al 2016 masese and raburu 2017 etc coastal wetlands seldom focus on research on specific species non economic species even though the coastal wetland approach is similar to that of freshwater ecosystems in terms of data analysis the understanding of species is far less than that of freshwater ecosystem organisms so the results of the study are limited these widely used methods are based on solid theoretical foundations and are known to perform well keck et al 2017 however the method used mainly involves identification based on morphological criteria which is a time consuming complicated and technically demanding process whether it is a freshwater ecosystem or a coastal wetland ecosystem mandelik et al 2010 current research trends based on large scale and big data have led to classical α diversity biological characteristics and β diversity analytic methods have limitations cao et al 1996 rice 2003 so it is necessary to introduce more effective methods such as dna metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing methods keck et al 2017 these molecular methods will push biological research into the information age and bring new opportunities to make the effectiveness of biological research 5 conclusions and prospects in conclusion every step from field to desk work affects the accuracy of benthos research in this study we provide coastal ecologist with more clear experimental details in sampling experiments repeated sampling is needed to ensure uniformity due to the diverse habitats the richness of macroinvertebrates is closely related to the research period period length seasonal difference etc sampling tools and lowest species identification level therefore the accuracy of the experiment can be ensured by developing a well designed plan for example to achieve the goal of uniform sampling the number of designed samples the sampling area and the number of design repeats should be required in the process of macroinvertebrate screening a suitable mesh screen should be selected which can reduce errors in species richness therefore proper pre experiment and careful design of each step in the experimental process as issues to be considered although a lot of research has been carried out on the coastal wetlands macroinvertebrates there are still some shortcomings and the following aspects still need to be strengthened 1 strengthen the mechanism research at present the research of macroinvertebrates mostly focuses on the composition distribution and its influencing factors while the mechanism research is less it is necessary to strengthen the interaction relationship and mechanism between macroinvertebrates and wetland environmental factors physical factors chemical factors biological factors human disturbances and comprehensive factors etc in coastal wetlands and to clarify the succession characteristics of macroinvertebrates with ecosystem changes in coastal wetlands 2 deepen the research content explain the relationship between macroinvertebrates and environmental factors in coastal wetlands establish an indicator system on the changes of macroinvertebrates with the environment integrate macroinvertebrates into the coastal wetland ecological quality evaluation index system further clarify the relationship between macroinvertebrates and other environmental indicators of coastal wetlands indicating the degree of pollution and health of coastal wetlands conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no

macroinvertebrates in 104 coastal wetlands seven hotspots area have been identified in coastal wetlands the low repetition rate of dominant species in the most studied area estuary intertidal zone and mangrove indicated that environmental factors played decisive role in biodiversity the species richness has significant correlation with temperature ph do and bod both biological indices and analysis methods have been employed successfully to analyze the relationship between the biodiversity of coastal benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental factors quantitatively and qualitatively the selection of sampler tube sampler quadrat sampler and grab sampler indicates the difference in the environment conditions at the study site which is also affected by cost and efficiency the mesh sieves 0 5 mm 1 0 mm and others which affected the workload of soil screening and the abundance of macroinvertebrates suggested that researchers had different understandings of macroinvertebrate while the selection of fixative solution such as alcohol and formalin should be also considered to meet the experimental demands because of their shortcomings decolorization and acidity in conclusion each

cluster analysis and multivariate analysis were used to study differential response of benthic macrofauna to the formation of novel oyster reefs crassostrea gigas thunberg on soft and rocky substrate in the intertidal of the bay of brest france lejart and hily 2011 most of the existing researches focus on the dominant species community structure influencing factors diversity characteristics of macroinvertebrates and the role of macroinvertebrates in ecological environment assessment in a single coastal wetland warwick et al 1991 chainho et al 2007 dauvin et al 2009 yu et al 2012 morais and lee 2014 shi et al 2014 noman et al 2019 it has been pointed out that the environmental factors affect their diversity and directly lead to the changes of macroinvertebrate taxa composition in coastal wetlands flemer et al 1998 vale et al 2010 de juan and hewitt 2011 at present the identification of major environmental factors and analysis of their impact on the dominant species and species diversity of macroinvertebrates in coastal wetlands are still lacking systematic review at the regional scale the environmental factors of coastal wetlands are necessary for the growth and reproduction of macroinvertebrates stenert et al 2008 elliott et al 2013 the relationship between macroinvertebrate diversity and environmental factors salinity temperature ph etc was revealed in existing studies yildiz et al 2010 elliott et al 2013 galván et al 2016 for example salinity has a significant impact on macroinvertebrate communities the diversity and number of macroinvertebrates species decrease with decreasing salinity in the intertidal zone of the scheldt estuary in europe hampel et al 2009 the dissolved oxygen do concentration affects the community structure of macroinvertebrates in the intertidal zone of sanhewan in japan and reduced macroinvertebrates species with the do concentration decreasing suzuki 1998 the total organic carbon content in sediments is the main factor affecting the distribution of macroinvertebrates on the eastern coast of the mediterranean sea kröncke et al 2003 macroinvertebrate community is affected by the eutrophication of water bodies in the intertidal zone of hangzhou bay so most of them are polychaetes with strong ability to adapt to harsh environment the nature of the substrate has a decisive effect on the species composition of macroinvertebrates in the dongzhaigang mangrove wetland the different substrates have different types and quantities of macroinvertebrates ma et al 2012 studies have shown that the dominant environmental factors affecting the biodiversity of macroinvertebrate communities differ in different study areas the objective of this study was to review the current state of knowledge regarding the study methods of macroinvertebrate in coastal wetland specifically we use the data of macroinvertebrate and environmental characteristics in coastal wetlands to understand responses of macroinvertebrate to the environmental factor in global scale at the same time sampling methodology such as sampling equipment analytical methods are summarized in this paper we aim to seek the answers of the following questions 1 the hotspots of the studies on coastal macroinvertebrate 2 the most popular methods used in recent study 3 the key factors that affect the diversity of macroinvertebrates 2 methods 2 1 literature collection the data set originated from published scientific literature on macroinvertebrate in coastal wetlands we screened the isi web of science and sciencedirect online for papers about macroinvertebrates published before 2019 the papers were collected by a search using the terms benthic macroinvertebrate benthic macrofauna with coastal wetland s estuary mangrove forest intertidal zone marine a total of published 335 articles containing 122 coastal wetlands were collected over the last two decades and then we removed inappropriate articles based on study area such as the marine freshwater etc therefore 104 coastal wetlands belonging to 68 studies were selected owing to the availability of the related parameters used in this study according to the details of collected papers the data set of the other coastal wetlands were eliminated because of the lack of ecological variables or statistical data we also searched for other published studies that had relatively complete species and environmental data we used the mean value of macroinvertebrate richness and environmental parameters for each coastal wetland if two or more were available to broaden and adjust the data on macroinvertebrate richness and coastal wetland environment parameters 2 2 data collection firstly the habitat types were classified into four categories according to the geographic features e g land formation and climate and the distribution of flora and fauna in coastal wetlands the location longitude and latitude and dominant species top three if less than three being recorded as many as possible of each coastal wetland were recorded secondly macroinvertebrate species diversity data and environment characteristics of each coastal wetland were obtained from published studies to explore the impact of different environmental factors on macroinvertebrate species diversity we collected temperature c salinity ph dissolved oxygen do mg l biological oxygen demand bod mg l organic matter content and many other kinds of environmental variables however we excluded most of chemical variables because of the insufficiency of such data to constitute a statistical sample less than 30 data points in addition the details of field and desk work were collected including biodiversity characteristics analysis method sampling period sampling instrument mesh sieve and fixed solutions in each study the total area total number of samples multiplies sample area and volume sampling area multiplies depth of sampling for each experiment site were calculated fig 1 2 3 data analysis four indices shannon wiener index shannon and weaver 1949 simpson index simpson 1949 margalef index margalef 1967 and evenness pielou 1966 were calculated from collected macroinvertebrate data to assess the diversity of macroinvertebrate species in coastal wetlands the data were analyzed in the software microsoft excel 2016 spss 25 and origin 9 0 spss version 25 was used for correlation analyses in the macroinvertebrate diversity index diversity richness and evenness and coastal wetland environment parameters temperature salinity ph do bod and organic matter content and performed to identify the variables that were most closely related to macroinvertebrate diversity the geographical distributions maps of macroinvertebrate habitation and richness sampling time replication and sampling sites were drawn by the software arcgis 10 2 the pie chart of the sampling instrument mesh sieve type and fixed solution type were draw with the software origin 9 0 the histogram of analytical methods and biodiversity characteristics were draw with the software microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 research hotspots at present the study of macroinvertebrates in coastal wetlands is mainly distributed in seven regions the coastal areas of east asia i south asia ii eastern oceania iii southeastern africa vi western europe v eastern north america vi and eastern south america vii at the same time there are also a small number of studies in coastal areas such as western south america western north america western africa and western oceania fig 2 3 2 research area the location of research sites showed that studies on macroinvertebrate were mainly carried out in middle and low latitude area most of the studied coastal wetlands 87 8 were located ranging from 45 s to 45 n whereas no study about macroinvertebrates were found in high latitudes area continental coastal wetlands beyond 63 5 n and 63 5 s the 104 coastal wetlands are divided into four types estuary 51 intertidal zone 32 7 mangrove 8 7 and others 7 6 fig 3 the average species richness in estuarine intertidal mangroves is 53 51 35 respectively the richness generally ranges from 5 to 172 except the coastal wetland with 409 taxa in eastern australia 3 3 analytical methods a total of 34 analytical methods were recorded in collected articles 15 methods occurred more than five times and these methods were grouped into two categories statistical methods 8 and biological variables 7 fig 4 richness shannon wiener index evenness and abundance are often used to indicate biodiversity characteristics especially richness is used in 57 39 of the research anova is the most commonly used in statistical method followed by nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds cluster analysis similarity percentage analysis simper 3 4 diversity and its correlation with environmental factors a total of 198 different dominant species were obtained in 100 coastal wetlands the highest species repetition rate is cerithedia cingulate which has a frequency of six there are four species with a frequency of four four species with a frequency of three and 15 dominant species with a frequency of two table 1 it indicates that the dominant species of macroinvertebrates have lower repetition rates and greater differences in different coastal wetlands the mean values of shannon wiener index simpson index margalef index and evenness were 2 37 0 66 1 45 and 0 68 table 2 it can be seen that the macroinvertebrates have higher diversity and rich species in coastal wetlands pearson correlation analysis indicated that the main environmental factors affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates were temperature ph bod and do significant correlations between shannon wiener index with ph r 0 404 p 0 05 do r 0 484 p 0 05 bod r 0 673 p 0 05 were determined simpson index has significant correlation with do r 0 547 p 0 05 a strong correlation was found between margalef index and bod r 0 663 p 0 05 significant associations with evenness were found with the temperature r 0 607 p 0 05 and do r 0 687 p 0 05 richness was significantly correlated with ph r 0 487 p 0 01 fig 5 in the study area pearson correlation analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate species shannon wiener index was positively related to do fig 6 a r 2 0 234 p 0 05 simpson index was positively associated with the do fig 6b r 2 0 30 p 0 05 we noted the strongest association between evenness index and do fig 6c r 2 0 472 p 0 01 besides evenness index was negative correlated with temperature fig 6d r 2 0 368 p 0 05 3 5 sampling protocols the study duration is mainly classified into two groups single year study 45 9 and multiple year study 54 1 fig 7 a total of 14 400 samples were taken from a research site in western europe because the sampling repetition times are up to 10 times the sampling period is up to 3 years and its single sampling area is only 0 0177 m2 the corer diameter is 7 5 cm which is easy to operate a total of 2660 samples were taken from a study site in eastern australia due to a study period of up to six years the correlation between sampling area and species richness was analyzed it was found that there was significant correlation between sampling area and species richness r 0 627 p 0 01 at the same time it was found that there was significant correlation between the sampling volume and the species richness r 0 422 p 0 01 tube sampler quadrat sampler grab sampler were main sampling instruments which occupied 33 7 33 7 and 26 7 respectively other samplers such as shovel chisel tweezers etc took up in total 5 9 the rest of the studies the mesh screen is mainly divided into three types of 0 5 mm 1 0 mm and others e g 0 63 mm mesh sieve 0 25 mm mesh sieve of which 45 1 used the 0 5 mm mesh sieve and 42 8 used the 1 0 mm mesh sieve there are two kinds of fixative solutions formalin solution 81 2 3 5 formalin solution 4 formaldehyde solution 5 formalin solution 8 formalin solution 10 formalin solution and alcohol solution 18 8 70 alcohol 75 ethyl alcohol 95 ethyl alcohol fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 habitats and sampling coastal wetlands include seagrass meadows intertidal flats salt marshes mangrove forests estuarine deltaic and tidal freshwater wetlands wolanski et al 2009 semeniuk and semeniuk 2016 perillo et al 2018 they are distributed in coastal areas around the world this paper mainly records three common wetland types in the estuary intertidal zone and mangrove forest at present there are more and more researches on benthic animals in coastal wetlands in sampling research at least three effective samplings are performed for each sample point in addition studies have shown that sampling with a large number of small sample units 0 25 m2 is more effective than a small number of large sample units 4 0 m2 pringle 1984 a special survey is recommended to determine the most effective sampling unit size before starting sampling which can improve the accuracy of the experiment pielou 1974 pringle 1984 it may be a reasonable and effective method to consider the predation relationship when choosing the sampling time and location of coastal wetlands coastal wetlands are one of the important habitats for birds e g shorebirds migratory birds as a gas station during migratory bird migration butler et al 2001 barter 2002 ma et al 2013 as a food source for birds the abundance of benthos will decrease when birds migrate to the area choi et al 2014 therefore it is a better to select sampling period by avoiding migration bird appearances ensuring the quality of samples 4 2 dominant species and richness there are no dominant species in the collected literatures that are highly similar in this study species composition and richness varies greatly among coastal wetlands while macroinvertebrate species are rich and varied mainly due to differences in environmental factors firstly the differences in habitat types of coastal wetlands are one of the causes of the different dominant species strayer 2007 tweedley and valesini 2008 the dominant species of macroinvertebrates are closely related to environmental factors the combined effects of multiple environmental factors lead to the difference of dominant species which is consistent with the results of li et al 2015 on the biodiversity of macroinvertebrate communities in different habitats of maoyan island china secondly the dominant factors affecting macroinvertebrates are also different in coastal wetlands such as do ph etc which is also the cause of species differences besides the sampling time is also one of the reasons for this result the researchers select not only different experimental sites but also different sampling time the seasonal changes will lead to changes in the dominant species of wetlands studies have shown that the distribution of large invertebrates is affected by seasons and shows seasonal variations choi et al 2014 noman et al 2019 generally the density and abundance of large invertebrates decrease in autumn and winter and then increase in spring and summer franz and harris 1988 lu 2005 chainho et al 2006 the reproduction of large invertebrates and the emergence of new individuals in early summer may explain this situation zhang et al 2016 changes in freshwater input and evaporation intensity are due to seasonal changes which may lead to changes in estuarine and intertidal salinity chainho et al 2006 kundu et al 2010 some large invertebrates other than anabaena will migrate seasonally leading to changes in species community structure rundle et al 1998 in addition long term ice free cover of high latitude coastal wetlands in winter can also affect the abundance and density of large invertebrates zhang et al 2016 therefore the structure of large invertebrate communities obtained at different sampling periods is different species richness and density are also different and the dominant species change accordingly in the present study most research areas had a macroinvertebrate species richness is less than 200 the result that is similar to that of domestic and foreign studies on macroinvertebrates this condition might be attributed to the fact that the productivity of a habitat is limited and that the threshold will be incapable of harboring an excessive number of macroinvertebrate species there is an estuary wetland with a species richness of up to 409 on the eastern coast of australia the reasons are as follows the climate in this area is subtropical monsoon humid climate located at the junction of sea and land with suitable for natural conditions providing a suitable habitat for a variety of animals besides this region has been studied for a long time with the sampling time up to 6 years and the cumulative sampling of 2660 in 30 stations involving the subtidal zone and intertidal zone which can fully understand the species diversity such as richness density etc of macroinvertebrate and their seasonal and interannual variations currie and small 2005 4 3 environmental factors simple correlations indicated that macroinvertebrate diversity was significantly related to temperature ph do and bod except for salinity and organic matter content our results indicate that macroinvertebrate species diversity had significantly correlation with temperature as a driving factor of species diversity temperature is one of the important factors affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates allen et al 2002 the diversity of macroinvertebrates is limited by excessive temperatures al bakri and kittaneh 1998 in the appropriate temperature range the growth rate of macroinvertebrates can be accelerated the turnover rate is shortened the productivity and species diversity are improved with the increase of temperature benke 1993 the greater influence of temperature changes on the smaller individuals this was evidenced by the growth experiments on different sizes of bellamya purificate in temperature gradient cao and jiang 1998 which may be due to the fact that small individuals are less adaptable to the environment than larger individuals in addition a relatively stable aquatic environment of coastal wetlands offers a gentle habitat for macroinvertebrates which have less temperature fluctuation compared with other ecosystems and are suitable for their survival beck et al 2001 this provides conditions for the diversity of macroinvertebrates this study suggests that the ph of coastal wetland and the community diversity of macroinvertebrates show significantly correlation in the present study the observed ph values ranged from 5 09 to 8 5 the ph of most coastal wetlands fluctuated around 7 changes in ph have a major impact on macroinvertebrates studies have shown that the ph affects the birth rate and survival rate of macroinvertebrates walag and canencia 2016 resulting in diversity changes when the ph is too low or too high ph 5 0 or ph 10 0 the reproductive capacity of macroinvertebrates is significantly weakened which may cause death of macroinvertebrates in severe cases with biomass and diversity being reduced the decrease in ph can also trigger the release of heavy metals leading to poisoning of macroinvertebrates which in turn affects the community structure and distribution of macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates have different tolerances for ph studies have shown that ampharetidae polychaeta are most sensitive to ph changes del pilar ruso et al 2008 while bellamya quadrata gastropoda and limnodrilus udekemianus oligochaeta which have a relatively narrow tolerance to ph are negatively correlated with ph chen et al 2012 bod concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the diversity of large invertebrates the higher of the bod value indicated that the more organic pollutants in the water and the more serious the pollution some of the macroinvertebrates that are sensitive to water pollution are often more difficult to survive in organically polluted bodies of water in the present study there is a significant difference in the bod concentration between the coastal wetlands this study shows that the number of macroinvertebrates species and biomass are lower in water with higher bod concentration indicating that organic pollution has greater stress on macroinvertebrates do was significantly associated with shannon wiener index simpson index and evenness index do is an essential substance for life activities such as metabolism of macroinvertebrates and its concentration has direct or indirect effects on macroinvertebrates lim et al 2006 researched the seasonal variation of macroinvertebrates which drawed the conclusion that do plays an important role in the diversity of macroinvertebrates yokoyama 2002 studied the effect of farming on the benthic environments in gokasho bay and realized that do can affect the macroinvertebrates community by affecting the content of sulfide in the sediment macroinvertebrates have a certain adaptability to dissolved oxygen concentration studies have shown that the diversity of macroinvertebrates does not increase continuously with increasing do concentration and it can persist in hypoxic conditions in the short term but hypoxia has a significant impact on the diversity of macroinvertebrates diaz et al 1992 the food assimilation rate of macroinvertebrates will be reduced or even stopped in a hypoxic environment and only maintaining sufficient do levels can maintain their normal life activities martien and benke 1977 the content of do varies from region to region and do availability is one of the main factors affecting the composition and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities the salinity of coastal wetlands was not related to the diversity of macroinvertebrate communities this result is consistent with the conclusions of shou et al 2009 which studied on seasonal distribution of macroinvertebrate and its relations to environmental factors in oujiang river estuary sea area this may be related to the location of coastal wetlands which are mainly distributed at the junction of brackish and fresh water macroinvertebrate species have broad salinity which are highly tolerant to salinity so salinity is less restrictive to them in addition the tolerance range of different species of macroinvertebrates for salinity is also very different most of the macroinvertebrates with low salt tolerance are distributed in estuaries with relatively low salinity such as potamocorbula ustulata species with high salinity tolerance are mostly distributed in offshore areas with relatively high salinity such as palaemon gravieri zhang et al 2007 4 4 sampling protocols benthos are divided into three types according to their size macrobenthos meiobenthos and nanobenthos in the research the benthic invertebrates that cannot pass the 0 5 mm also used in the actual research 1 mm aperture mesh screen are called macroinvertebrates in this paper the two aperture mesh screens of 0 5 mm and 1 0 mm are collected accounting for 87 9 of the total the choice of mesh screen will affect the richness of macroinvertebrates if a 1 0 mm aperture mesh screen is selected macroinvertebrates between 0 5 and 1 0 mm will be missed which will lead to low species richness one hand the fine sieve retains more macroinvertebrate species and its classification and identification requires more time thus increasing the cost of research therefore some benthic studies have used a 1 0 mm sieve because this is considered to be the most cost effective compromise between results reliability and sorting costs lampadariou et al 2005 one the other hand the size of the mesh sieve should be selected according to the situation of macroinvertebrates in the research site if a large aperture mesh sieve is used the number of species and dominant populations in the research site will not be significantly changed compared with the 0 5 mm mesh sieve large mesh screens can be selected to reduce workload houston et al 1983 when studying the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in estuary southampton water found that using a 0 5 mm sieve did not significantly alter the number of species retained or observed dominant species compared with the 1 mm mesh sieve the fixative solutions mainly include formalin and alcohol the formalin solution is a colorless transparent solution which has a strong volatility with a strong pungent taste and is corrosive and toxic dotti et al 2011 compared with formalin alcohol has the advantages of low irritation no corrosiveness no toxicity and the like alcohol solutions are used to store macroinvertebrates enough to kill them and store them for long periods of time however the alcohol solution will decolorize the benthic animals if alcohol is used as the fixative solution the color of the sample should be recorded before adding the alcohol fixing solution so most researchers choose to use formalin solution in addition alcohol can cause the mollusks to shrink so it is necessary to use formaldehyde for anesthesia crustaceans are not suitable for preservation in formalin solution because formaldehyde is neutral but its solution is acidic since formaldehyde is naturally oxidized in the air to form formic acid the formaldehyde solution will converted to a formic acid solution after a long period of time fox et al 1985 so formalin solution can cause damage to the crustacean shell and should be preserved with alcohol the selection of the sampler is mainly based on the environmental conditions dry and wet water depth high tide low tide etc of the sampling point and its convenience downing 1984 quadrat sampler and tube sampler are usually used in areas with low water such as light beach and medium high tide beach the grab sampler is mainly used for underwater sampling in addition the choice of sampler should also consider its cost and efficiency the efficiency of the grab sampler is much higher than quadrat sampler and tube sampler but the cost is relatively high the above two aspects that are usually considered more when sampling 4 5 analytical methods the most frequent occurrences of diversity characteristics are richness shannon wiener index evenness and abundance among which richness is one of the most commonly used indicators to measure biodiversity the most used analysis method is analysis of variance anova as a more traditional analytical method anova has the advantages of simultaneously analyzing the effects of multiple factors and the interaction between analyzable factors and the data used for analysis of variance should be comply with the following assumptions the samples are independent on each other the sample data are from the normal population normality and the treatment group population variance is equal homogeneity of variance therefore before the analysis of variance the normality test and the homogeneity test of variance should be performed if the above requirements are not met variable transformation can be considered in this paper anova is mainly used for the analysis of the richness abundance diversity index community structure biomass and density of macroinvertebrates at present the widely used analytical methods in coastal wetland ecosystems are mostly used to analyze the spatial distribution pattern frança et al 2009 tantikamton et al 2017 community structure hodgson 1987 rumisha et al 2015 zapata hernández et al 2016 and relationship between environmental factors spruzen et al 2008 yu et al 2012 of macroinvertebrates in freshwater ecosystems more attention is paid to the research and analysis of species dufrêne and legendre 1997 fleishman et al 2005 such as the biological monitoring working party bmwp index based on sensitivity silveira et al 2005 gutiérrez fonseca and lorion 2014 and the ept index e ephemeroptera p plecoptera t trichoptera based on indicator species amaral et al 2015 fikri et al 2016 masese and raburu 2017 etc coastal wetlands seldom focus on research on specific species non economic species even though the coastal wetland approach is similar to that of freshwater ecosystems in terms of data analysis the understanding of species is far less than that of freshwater ecosystem organisms so the results of the study are limited these widely used methods are based on solid theoretical foundations and are known to perform well keck et al 2017 however the method used mainly involves identification based on morphological criteria which is a time consuming complicated and technically demanding process whether it is a freshwater ecosystem or a coastal wetland ecosystem mandelik et al 2010 current research trends based on large scale and big data have led to classical α diversity biological characteristics and β diversity analytic methods have limitations cao et al 1996 rice 2003 so it is necessary to introduce more effective methods such as dna metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing methods keck et al 2017 these molecular methods will push biological research into the information age and bring new opportunities to make the effectiveness of biological research 5 conclusions and prospects in conclusion every step from field to desk work affects the accuracy of benthos research in this study we provide coastal ecologist with more clear experimental details in sampling experiments repeated sampling is needed to ensure uniformity due to the diverse habitats the richness of macroinvertebrates is closely related to the research period period length seasonal difference etc sampling tools and lowest species identification level therefore the accuracy of the experiment can be ensured by developing a well designed plan for example to achieve the goal of uniform sampling the number of designed samples the sampling area and the number of design repeats should be required in the process of macroinvertebrate screening a suitable mesh screen should be selected which can reduce errors in species richness therefore proper pre experiment and careful design of each step in the experimental process as issues to be considered although a lot of research has been carried out on the coastal wetlands macroinvertebrates there are still some shortcomings and the following aspects still need to be strengthened 1 strengthen the mechanism research at present the research of macroinvertebrates mostly focuses on the composition distribution and its influencing factors while the mechanism research is less it is necessary to strengthen the interaction relationship and mechanism between macroinvertebrates and wetland environmental factors physical factors chemical factors biological factors human disturbances and comprehensive factors etc in coastal wetlands and to clarify the succession characteristics of macroinvertebrates with ecosystem changes in coastal wetlands 2 deepen the research content explain the relationship between macroinvertebrates and environmental factors in coastal wetlands establish an indicator system on the changes of macroinvertebrates with the environment integrate macroinvertebrates into the coastal wetland ecological quality evaluation index system further clarify the relationship between macroinvertebrates and other environmental indicators of coastal wetlands indicating the degree of pollution and health of coastal wetlands conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no

1066,near saturated hydraulic properties are the key parameters for water transport models in the unsaturated zone and essential for management practices this study was conducted to compare efficacy of multiple linear regression mlr and hybrid method of genetic algorithm with artificial neural network ga ann for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic properties in moghan plain north western iran the results of mlr analysis indicated that this method had low potential to predict near saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area which only could explain 14 38 of variability in the studied properties otherwise ga ann was much higher powerful that could explain about 35 80 of total variability in the mentioned properties in the study area the results of sensitivity analysis suggest that soil particle size distribution organic matter electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most crucial with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area in the semiarid region in overall it was concluded that application of intelligent system using the easily available soil properties as predictors could provide reliable estimates of near saturated soil hydraulic properties at the filed scale keywords modeling hydraulic conductivity intrinsic soil properties genetic algorithm sensitivity analysis 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties are very important for irrigation scheduling nutrients and water transport processes and water balances in the field or watershed scale hillel 1998 owuor et al 2018 the soil hydraulic properties especially in the surface layer can influence water infiltration soil water storage surface run off and groundwater recharge price et al 2010 therefore the knowledge about variability of soil hydraulic properties is crucial for soil and water management and decision making at field or watershed scale it is believed that even after rainfall and runoff generation soil is not fully saturated but near saturated due to air entrapment in soil pores surface seal barrier to water infiltration and dynamic non equilibrium condition bodhinayake and si 2004 kelishadi et al 2014 soil hydraulic properties are mainly influenced by intrinsic natural and human made anthropogenic factors intrinsic environmental attributes such as soil properties organic matter particle size distribution carbonates minerals etc as well as topography parent materials schwartz et al 2003 zhou et al 2008 and vegetation have major role in controlling soil hydraulic properties likewise several studies proved that human activities such as land use change kelishadi et al 2014 management practices li et al 2010 tillage practices soracco et al 2019 grazing of crop residues rakkar and blanco canqui 2018 and overgrazing zhang et al 2019 also have significant contributions in regulating soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties such as sorptivity s sorptive number a macroscopic capillary length λ c saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k s and k h could meaningfully be influenced by intrinsic variations in the soils azadmard et al 2018 knowledge about importance and variability of the intrinsic factors controlling variability of unsaturated hydraulic properties provides valuable information at the field scale therefore several scholars have paid attentions to predict hydraulic properties at field or watershed scale using easily available data by various models such as rosetta e g schaap et al 2001 the application of physically based or process based simulation models at regional scales for management purposes is often troubled by a lack of information according to the input model parameters for estimating soil hydraulic properties jarvis et al 2002 one of the well known approach to solve this problem is to construct pedotransfer functions ptfs to obtain the required parameter values from easily available soil survey data e g rawls et al 1993 tietje and hennings 1996 ptfs can perform as a convenient means of parameterizing complex models as long as the accuracy level obtained is satisfactory in a functional sense and that the achieved functional relationships by them are applicable in many studies mayr and jarvis 1999 jarvis et al 2002 ptfs are principally useful for regional scale employment of models where the measurement of soil hydraulic properties is difficult and the data are widely limited across the large areas to date several studies have been done to develop linear and non linear ptfs to estimate soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the world e g wösten et al 1999 also some attempts have been made to derive linear ptfs such as multiple linear regression wagner et al 2001 and boosted regression trees jorda et al 2015 for estimating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the regional or field scale however intelligent methods of developing ptfs for prediction of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties have been received less attention in this study our hypothesis was that application of intelligent systems such as artificial neural network and genetic algorithms may improve accuracy of prediction of soil hydraulic parameters besides as stated before near saturated hydraulic parameters are important in soil and water management at the field and watershed scales e g kelishadi et al 2014 hence the major objectives of this study were to i compare efficacy of multiple linear regression mlr artificial neural network ann and hybrid method of genetic algorithm ga and ann ga ann for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters and ii determine the most affecting soil intrinsic properties governing the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters using sensitivity analysis in north western iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area this research was carried out in an area of 20

ranged from 32 to 150 m a s l the cold winters and hot humid summers are the climatic characteristics of this region the mean annual temperature and rainfall of the region were 17 5 c and 332 mm respectively azaddmard et al 2018 the major crops which are cultivated in this area include sugarcane barley corn wheat colza and alfalfa according to geological setting the study area is covered by quaternary deposits and soils are mainly classified as typic calcixerepts typic haplosalids and typic xerorthents 2 2 soil sampling field measurements and laboratory analysis nested grid sampling was

furthermore the infiltration data was modeled in disc software developed by us department of agriculture using numerical approach and the van genuchten parameters including scaling and shape parameters α and n saturated water content θ s and saturated hydraulic conductivity k s disc were optimized šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 2000 s dexter as a soil physical parameter the slope of the soil water retention curve at its inflection point when plotted as the logarithm to base e of the matric suction against the gravimetric water content kg kg 1 was determined by using of the van genuchten fitted parameters dexter 2004 the details of analytical and numerical modeling and determination of near saturated soil hydraulic properties are presented in azadmard et al 2018 soil samples

electrical conductivity ec ph na ca and mg concentrations and sodium adsorption ratio sar were determined according to protocols proposed in methods of soil analysis black et al 1965 calcium carbonate equivalent cce was measured by the bernard s calcimetric method richard and suarez 1996 and soil bulk density ρ b was determined using undisturbed soil samples collected by kopecky rings of 100 cm3 the soil cores were dried at 105 c for 48 h and then weighed the relative bulk density ρ b rel was calculated using the following equation håkansson and lipiec 2000 to characterize the degree of compactness 1 ρ b rel ρ b ρ b ref where ρ b ref is a reference bulk density mg m 3 and was calculated by the equation proposed by jones 1983 and used by dexter 2004 for the lower limit of critical ρ b

shirazi and boersma 1984 2 3 classical statistics and multiple linear regression mlr descriptive statistics of the studied variables comprising minimum mean maximum standard deviation sd coefficient

of genetic algorithm ga and ann ga ann ann is a simulation method which is modeled based on brain system and neural network of organisms and has a high capability for simulation and detection of complex and nonlinear relationships zolfaghari et al 2015 for neural network analysis ann we used the multiple layer perceptron mlp with back propagation bp learning rule fig 2 which is the greatest frequently applied neural network structure in soil science and ecological modeling pradhan et al 2011 besalatpour et al 2013 as the output of the mlp network near saturated soil hydraulic parameters nshp were calculated by 4 nshp f 2 b 0 k 1 n w k f 1 b h k i 1 m w i k x i where b 0 is the bias at the output layer w k is the weight of connection between neuron k of the hidden layer and the single output layer neuron bhk is the bias at neuron k of the hidden layer k 1 n w ik is the weight of connection between input variable i i 1 m and neuron k of the hidden layer x i is the normalized input

the normalized input variable and w i is the weight of connections between layers the numbers of neurons and epochs were adjusted by trial and error neural network analyses were done using matlab 7 6 neural networks toolbox mathworks inc natick ma usa due to the complexity and high variability of soil hydraulic properties feature selection could be efficient in this regard genetic algorithm ga as one of the well known feature selection methods could efficiently shrink data dimensionality by excluding irrelevant features accelerating learning algorithms and occasionally enlightening their performance besalatpour et al 2014 spolaôr et al 2011 artificial neural networks have many advantages for modeling and prediction tajik et al 2012 but sometimes suffer from some shortcomings such as slow convergence and stammering in a local minimum to overcome these shortcomings scholars have recently proposed a hybrid method of ga ann for enhancing the anns performance to obtain the global minimum tonnizam et al 2016 in this hybrid method reflecting a suitable fitness function the imperative parameters of ann i e the initial weights the finest numbers of hidden layers would be regulated and adjusted saemi et al 2007 the major goal of applying hybrid ga ann model is adopting a set of biases and weights for minimizing the given function this approach has been effectively developed and used to overcome numerous environmental and engineering problems e g momeni et al 2014 2 5 evaluation of the developed models performance of the developed models was evaluated by coefficients of

designates the expected value of observation i i e near saturated soil hydraulic parameters m i is the observed value of observations i m is the average of observed values and n is the number of observations in the validation dataset i e 40 2 6 sensitivity analysis identification of most important variables controlling variability of near saturated soil hydraulic properties was one of the goals of this research the statsoft method hill and lewicki 2007 was employed for sensitivity analysis in order to identify priority and importance of input variables in ann models for explaining the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters total error of developed network when a given variable was excluded was divided to the total error of network when measured values of the given variable is included for determining the relative sensitivity coefficient rsc as follows 8 rsc 1 n i 1 n p i p i 2 1 n i 1 n p i t m i 2 where p i is the predicted output value by application of all the inputs p i is the predicted output value by application of all inputs except the given input variable i e equal to zero p it is the predicted output for the validation dataset m i is the observed output n is the total number of data i e 212 and n is the number of validation dataset i e 22 when rsc is higher than 1 0 consequently the variable had high contribution to the output variable hill and lewicki 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the selected soil physical and chemical properties are summarized in table 1 chemical properties mostly indicated high variability high variance and cv oppositely soil physical properties indicated minimum variability the minimum cv was obtained for ph among all studied properties cv 2 similarly lopez granados et al 2002 reported the least cv of 1 for soil ph in seville southern spain and ayoubi et al 2007 found cv 2 for soil ph in northern iran na concentration showed partially high variability with cv 54 table 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar indicated low to moderate variability cv 33 the values of soil organic matter content sar and ec varied between 0 48 and 3 9 kg 100 kg 1 0 7 and 9 26 and 0 69 and 1 7 ds m 1 respectively this confirmed that variability among the studies variables was high this observation may be ascribed to the presence of hardpan enriched by clays i e claypan in some places existence of poorly drained soils in some points large variability in particle size distribution applying various management practices within the studied fields our results also showed that almost all of the studied soil physical and chemical properties showed normal distribution based upon the skewness values varied from 1 to 1 and kolmogorov smirnov test except for ec which indicated non normal distribution table 1 descriptive statistics of soil hydraulic parameters including k s wooding k h k s disc λc n and α are given in table 1 the mean k h value at matric suction of 2 cm was 2 02 cm h 1 while the mean value at matric suction of 15 cm was 0 22 cm h 1 the highest cv 212 was observed for k s disc whereas the lowest cv was observed for parameter n table 1 according to skewness values see table 1 and the results of kolmogorov smirnov test almost all of the soil hydraulic parameters showed normal distribution our results for high variability in k s disc and low variability in n parameter are in accordance with the findings of moosavi and sepaskhah 2012 who investigated soil hydraulic conductivity at various matric suctions in carbonate enriched soils of iran reduction of the h towards saturation status led to a rise in the variation of the α and k h in accordance with the findings of hu et al 2008 among all the k h values the highest cv value 82 was observed at the lowest matric suction of 2 cm regarding to proposed classification of cvs by wilding 1985 all the measured soil hydraulic parameters in this region showed moderate to high variability excepting ec other soil chemical and physical properties had low to moderate variability these results are in consistence with the findings of ayoubi et al 2007 moosavi and sepaskhah 2012 and zolfaghari et al 2015 who reported low to moderate variability of soil properties in semiarid regions of iran 3 2 mlr analysis the results of mlr modeling is presented in table 2 some soil physical and chemical properties were included as predictors in the developed models the coefficients of determination r 2 varied from 0 14 for s dexter to 0 38 for k s disc the developed mlr models explained 17 21 14 19 and 19 of total variability of k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 and k s wooding respectively moreover mlr models could explain 22 23 and 28 of total variability of the van genuchten parameters of θ s n and α respectively overall the developed linear regression models with low validation criteria were not considered powerful to predict near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area this is in the line with the findings of other researchers who reported low capability of linear regression methods for prediction of complex environmental variables ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 besalatpour et al 2013 in contrast wagner et al 2001 successfully predicted unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameters using linear regression models they also compared the efficacy of eight existing ptfs for a 63 german soil data and concluded that wösten et al 1999 ptfs were the best ptfs for predicting the unsaturated hydraulic parameters they also showed that bulk density and organic matter content were the most important variables controlling unsaturated hydraulic parameters jorda et al 2015 by developing ptfs using boosted regression tree showed that this linear modeling could only explain 36 and 15 of total variability in k s and k 10 3 3 hybrid ga ann modeling hybrid ga ann model was used for different combinations of the input variables 1 17 in order to decrease the number of predictors for the modeling step fig 3 a combination of 12 variables showed the least error and thus was deliberated as the most efficient variables combination to be used for predicting the soil hydraulic parameters in the study area these 12 variables predictors extracted by the ga ann were then employed for the final modeling processes by all developed models these variables predictors extracted by the ga ann algorithm including ec ph om cce sand silt clay bd rbd d g and σg were employed for the final modeling processes by the mlp model the ann model was run with 60 20 and 20 of the data for training verification and validation respectively optimized structures and parameters were applied in the final ann models to estimate near saturated soil hydraulic parameters and are given in table 3 each of the trained models had 12 input nodes and one output node the optimized hidden layer nodes were 22 24 23 22 23 20 24 26 25 23 and 22 for k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 k s disc s dexter n α θ s λc and k s wooding respectively previous studies e g norouzi et al 2010 zolfaghari et al 2015 stated that the optimum hidden nodes were twice that of number of input nodes as confirmed in this study see table 3 furthermore the optimized iteration learning rates were 8500 10 000 9000 10 000 8000 8500 8000 8500 9000 10 000 and 7500 for k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 k s disc s dexter n α θ s λc and k s wooding respectively these models could explain 40 53 35 and 43 of the variability of k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 respectively moreover the developed ann models could explain about 43 55 51 65 70 51 80 and 75 of total variability of λc k s wooding θ s α n k s disc and s dexter respectively in accordance with the findings of norouzi et al 2010 zolfaghari et al 2015 and ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 our results indicated that the tangential sigmoid tangsig was the most efficient transfer function for predicting the target variables some near saturated soil hydraulic parameters for the test data set predicted by ann models compared with measured values are given in figs 4 and 5 artificial neural networks showed the most ability to predict k s disc r 2 0 80 nrmse 0 09 and s dexter r 2 0 75 nrmse 0 007 and the weakest ability to predict k 5 r 2 0 35 nrmse 0 61 the observed versus simulated values of soil hydraulic parameters for the test data of the artificial neural network model showed that almost all of the parameters in some points were overestimated and to a lesser extent were underestimated figs 4 and 5 3 4 comparison of mlr and ga ann models considering the values of r 2 rmse and mefs indicated that multivariate linear regression models did not reliably estimate the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area in all cases ga ann models showed higher model efficiency factor mef than mlr models table 2 however the predicted and measured data for the validation dataset were plotted for comparing mlr and ga ann models figs 4 and 5 the predicted values are well in accordance with real data for the ga ann models while for the mlr models predicted values did not well follow the observed data at the field scale applying ga ann models could improve r 2 significantly for all target variables see table 2 for the k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 r 2 values were improved by 23 32 21 and 24 when using ga ann models as compared to mlr models the ga ann modeling improved r 2 values from 15 to 55 for λc from 19 to 51 for k s wooding from 38 to 80 for k s disc and from 23 to 75 for s dexter moreover for θ s α and n r 2 values were improved by 43 47 and 28 in the ga ann models compared to mlr models similar trends were obtained for rmse nrmse and mef values for the two developed models such as lower rmse and rmse and higher mef values were observed in the ga ann compared to mlr models likely other scholars i e besalatpour et al 2013 2014 identified that hybrid methods of ga with ann led to higher r 2 and mef and lower rmse compared to the mlr methods yi et al 2013 estimated soil field capacity and saturated water content in a permafrost zone and stated that the capability of ann was the highest among three estimation methods comprising rosetta schaap et al 2001 ann and mlr models the greater performance of ga ann as a nonlinear method compared to a linear statistical method mlr indicates the existence of non linear relationships between input easily available soil properties and target variables near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in such cases the correlation analysis presumably affords erroneous and even misrepresentative results according to the relationships among variables liu et al 2001 norouzi et al 2010 actually linear regression models could solely discover linear relationships among the dependent and independent variables and if there is any nonlinear association among these variables the effectiveness of these models is prominently decreased yilmaz and kaynar 2011 3 5 sensitivity analysis in many cases determination of importance of input variables and their priorities is more valuable than just listing them this would support more information to modify the designated list to accommodate other considerations of the data analysis the relative importance of input variables i e soil physical and chemical properties based upon the relative sensitivity coefficient rsc of the developed hybrid ga ann models for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters is given in figs 6 and 7 the variables with greater rsc values had higher contribution to the variability of soil hydraulic parameters as the radar plot figures shows various variables were identified as the most important variables for explaining variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area geometric mean diameter of primary particles d g had significant contribution for determining the variability in most of the unsaturated hydraulic parameters including k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 k s θ s and α the d g is an indicator of particle size distribution and characterizes the coarseness and fineness of the soil texture similarly other researchers reported high contributions of particles size distribution to unsaturated and near saturated soil hydraulic parameters for example jarvis et al 2002 found that d g was the most important variable for explaining the variability of k 10 in a wide range of soils using the regression boosted tree jorda et al 2015 in a large scale showed that the most important predictors for k 10 were the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the measurement sites which are crucial variables for soil formation and soil characteristics they also showed that soil clay and organic matter contents were the principal predictors of k 10 such that k 10 reduced as organic matter content increased to 1 5 and as clay content raised from 10 to 40 in some parts of our study area the soils were highly affected by salinity see table 1 ec 17 2 ds m 1 as the maximum value therefore ec was one of the other important variables influencing all the studied hydraulic parameters in our soils in this regard the highest contributions were observed for λc fig 7 particle size distribution has vital contribution to most of soil hydraulic parameters such as α and n vereecken et al 1989 by developing ptfs for predicting unsaturated hydraulic properties reported that soil particle size distribution indicators were the major controlling factors organic matter content was also identified as other important variable for some hydraulic parameters like k s disc s dexter n k 2 and α which is consistent with the findings of vereecken et al 1989 for some soil hydraulic parameters such as k 10 k 5 k 2 θ s k s wooding α and s dexter relative bulk density rbd as an indicator of degree of soil compactness aggregation and soil structure showed the significant contribution jorda et al 2015 showed that bulk density in combination with land use were the most important variables for prediction k 10 bayat et al 2015 using a dataset from five provinces of iran by combining basic soil properties and parameters of confined compression curve as predictors showed that inclusion of particle size distribution parameters i e clay silt and sand contents and bulk density improved the accuracy of models for prediction of n and α 4 conclusions 1 the results of mlr modeling showed that these linear models could only explain 14 38 of the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in north western iran the results confirmed that mlr had low use potential for predicting the mentioned soil properties in the study area 2 ga ann modeling showed that by reducing the number of input variables to 12 the validity and accuracy of predictions were improved significantly compared to mlr models ga ann models could explain 35 80 of total variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area higher performance of ga ann models compared to mlr models confirmed the existence of non linear relationships among the soil physical and chemical properties with hydraulic properties 3 the results of sensitivity analysis revealed that soil particle size distribution organic matter content electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most important with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area in semiarid region conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

1066,near saturated hydraulic properties are the key parameters for water transport models in the unsaturated zone and essential for management practices this study was conducted to compare efficacy of multiple linear regression mlr and hybrid method of genetic algorithm with artificial neural network ga ann for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic properties in moghan plain north western iran the results of mlr analysis indicated that this method had low potential to predict near saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area which only could explain 14 38 of variability in the studied properties otherwise ga ann was much higher powerful that could explain about 35 80 of total variability in the mentioned properties in the study area the results of sensitivity analysis suggest that soil particle size distribution organic matter electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most crucial with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic properties in the study area in the semiarid region in overall it was concluded that application of intelligent system using the easily available soil properties as predictors could provide reliable estimates of near saturated soil hydraulic properties at the filed scale keywords modeling hydraulic conductivity intrinsic soil properties genetic algorithm sensitivity analysis 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties are very important for irrigation scheduling nutrients and water transport processes and water balances in the field or watershed scale hillel 1998 owuor et al 2018 the soil hydraulic properties especially in the surface layer can influence water infiltration soil water storage surface run off and groundwater recharge price et al 2010 therefore the knowledge about variability of soil hydraulic properties is crucial for soil and water management and decision making at field or watershed scale it is believed that even after rainfall and runoff generation soil is not fully saturated but near saturated due to air entrapment in soil pores surface seal barrier to water infiltration and dynamic non equilibrium condition bodhinayake and si 2004 kelishadi et al 2014 soil hydraulic properties are mainly influenced by intrinsic natural and human made anthropogenic factors intrinsic environmental attributes such as soil properties organic matter particle size distribution carbonates minerals etc as well as topography parent materials schwartz et al 2003 zhou et al 2008 and vegetation have major role in controlling soil hydraulic properties likewise several studies proved that human activities such as land use change kelishadi et al 2014 management practices li et al 2010 tillage practices soracco et al 2019 grazing of crop residues rakkar and blanco canqui 2018 and overgrazing zhang et al 2019 also have significant contributions in regulating soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties such as sorptivity s sorptive number a macroscopic capillary length λ c saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k s and k h could meaningfully be influenced by intrinsic variations in the soils azadmard et al 2018 knowledge about importance and variability of the intrinsic factors controlling variability of unsaturated hydraulic properties provides valuable information at the field scale therefore several scholars have paid attentions to predict hydraulic properties at field or watershed scale using easily available data by various models such as rosetta e g schaap et al 2001 the application of physically based or process based simulation models at regional scales for management purposes is often troubled by a lack of information according to the input model parameters for estimating soil hydraulic properties jarvis et al 2002 one of the well known approach to solve this problem is to construct pedotransfer functions ptfs to obtain the required parameter values from easily available soil survey data e g rawls et al 1993 tietje and hennings 1996 ptfs can perform as a convenient means of parameterizing complex models as long as the accuracy level obtained is satisfactory in a functional sense and that the achieved functional relationships by them are applicable in many studies mayr and jarvis 1999 jarvis et al 2002 ptfs are principally useful for regional scale employment of models where the measurement of soil hydraulic properties is difficult and the data are widely limited across the large areas to date several studies have been done to develop linear and non linear ptfs to estimate soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the world e g wösten et al 1999 also some attempts have been made to derive linear ptfs such as multiple linear regression wagner et al 2001 and boosted regression trees jorda et al 2015 for estimating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the regional or field scale however intelligent methods of developing ptfs for prediction of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties have been received less attention in this study our hypothesis was that application of intelligent systems such as artificial neural network and genetic algorithms may improve accuracy of prediction of soil hydraulic parameters besides as stated before near saturated hydraulic parameters are important in soil and water management at the field and watershed scales e g kelishadi et al 2014 hence the major objectives of this study were to i compare efficacy of multiple linear regression mlr artificial neural network ann and hybrid method of genetic algorithm ga and ann ga ann for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters and ii determine the most affecting soil intrinsic properties governing the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters using sensitivity analysis in north western iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area this research was carried out in an area of 20

furthermore the infiltration data was modeled in disc software developed by us department of agriculture using numerical approach and the van genuchten parameters including scaling and shape

the soil cores were dried at 105 c for 48 h and then weighed the relative bulk density ρ b rel was calculated using the following equation håkansson and lipiec 2000 to characterize the degree of

used to overcome numerous environmental and engineering problems e g momeni et al 2014 2 5 evaluation of the developed models performance of the developed models was evaluated by coefficients of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and model efficiency factor mef the rmse and mef were computed as follows 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i m i 2 7 mef 1 i 1 n p i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 100 where p i designates the expected value of observation i i e near saturated soil hydraulic parameters m i is the observed value of observations i m is the average of observed values and n is the number of observations in the validation dataset i e 40 2 6 sensitivity analysis identification of most important variables controlling variability of near saturated soil hydraulic properties was one of the goals of this research the statsoft method hill and lewicki 2007 was employed for sensitivity analysis in order to identify priority and importance of input variables in ann models for explaining the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters total error of developed network when a given variable was excluded was divided to the total error of network when measured values of the given variable is included for determining the relative sensitivity coefficient rsc as follows 8 rsc 1 n i 1 n p i p i 2 1 n i 1 n p i t m i 2 where p i is the predicted output value by application of all the inputs p i is the predicted output value by application of all inputs except the given input variable i e equal to zero p it is the predicted output for the validation dataset m i is the observed output n is the total number of data i e 212 and n is the number of validation dataset i e 22 when rsc is higher than 1 0 consequently the variable had high contribution to the output variable hill and lewicki 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the selected soil physical and chemical properties are summarized in table 1 chemical properties mostly indicated high variability high variance and cv oppositely soil physical properties indicated minimum variability the minimum cv was obtained for ph among all studied properties cv 2 similarly lopez granados et al 2002 reported the least cv of 1 for soil ph in seville southern spain and ayoubi et al 2007 found cv 2 for soil ph in northern iran na concentration showed partially high variability with cv 54 table 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar indicated low to moderate variability cv 33 the values of soil organic matter content sar and ec varied between 0 48 and 3 9 kg 100 kg 1 0 7 and 9 26 and 0 69 and 1 7 ds m 1 respectively this confirmed that variability among the studies variables was high this observation may be ascribed to the presence of hardpan enriched by clays i e claypan in some places existence of poorly drained soils in some points large variability in particle size distribution applying various management practices within the studied fields our results also showed that almost all of the studied soil physical and chemical properties showed normal distribution based upon the skewness values varied from 1 to 1 and kolmogorov smirnov test except for ec which indicated non normal distribution table 1 descriptive statistics of soil hydraulic parameters including k s wooding k h k s disc λc n and α are given in table 1 the mean k h value at matric suction of 2 cm was 2 02 cm h 1 while the mean value at matric suction of 15 cm was 0 22 cm h 1 the highest cv 212 was observed for k s disc whereas the lowest cv was observed for parameter n table 1 according to skewness values see table 1 and the results of kolmogorov smirnov test almost all of the soil hydraulic parameters showed normal distribution our results for high variability in k s disc and low variability in n parameter are in accordance with the findings of moosavi and sepaskhah 2012 who investigated soil hydraulic conductivity at various matric suctions in carbonate enriched soils of iran reduction of the h towards saturation status led to a rise in the variation of the α and k h in accordance with the findings of hu et al 2008 among all the k h values the highest cv value 82 was observed at the lowest matric suction of 2 cm regarding to proposed classification of cvs by wilding 1985 all the measured soil hydraulic parameters in this region showed moderate to high variability excepting ec other soil chemical and physical properties had low to moderate variability these results are in consistence with the findings of ayoubi et al 2007 moosavi and sepaskhah 2012 and zolfaghari et al 2015 who reported low to moderate variability of soil properties in semiarid regions of iran 3 2 mlr analysis the results of mlr modeling is presented in table 2 some soil physical and chemical properties were included as predictors in the developed models the coefficients of determination r 2 varied from 0 14 for s dexter to 0 38 for k s disc the developed mlr models explained 17 21 14 19 and 19 of total variability of k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 and k s wooding respectively moreover mlr models could explain 22 23 and 28 of total variability of the van genuchten parameters of θ s n and α respectively overall the developed linear regression models with low validation criteria were not considered powerful to predict near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area this is in the line with the findings of other researchers who reported low capability of linear regression methods for prediction of complex environmental variables ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 besalatpour et al 2013 in contrast wagner et al 2001 successfully predicted unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameters using linear regression models they also compared the efficacy of eight existing ptfs for a 63 german soil data and concluded that wösten et al 1999 ptfs were the best ptfs for predicting the unsaturated hydraulic parameters they also showed that bulk density and organic matter content were the most important variables controlling unsaturated hydraulic parameters jorda et al 2015 by developing ptfs using boosted regression tree showed that this linear modeling could only explain 36 and 15 of total variability in k s and k 10 3 3 hybrid ga ann modeling hybrid ga ann model was used for different combinations of the input variables 1 17 in order to decrease the number of predictors for the modeling step fig 3 a combination of 12 variables showed the least error and thus was deliberated as the most efficient variables combination to be used for predicting the soil hydraulic parameters in the study area these 12 variables predictors extracted by the ga ann were then employed for the final modeling processes by all developed models these variables predictors extracted by the ga ann algorithm including ec ph om cce sand silt clay bd rbd d g and σg were employed for the final modeling processes by the mlp model the ann model was run with 60 20 and 20 of the data for training verification and validation respectively optimized structures and parameters were applied in the final ann models to estimate near saturated soil hydraulic parameters and are given in table 3 each of the trained models had 12 input nodes and one output node the optimized hidden layer nodes were 22 24 23 22 23 20 24 26 25 23 and 22 for k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 k s disc s dexter n α θ s λc and k s wooding respectively previous studies e g norouzi et al 2010 zolfaghari et al 2015 stated that the optimum hidden nodes were twice that of number of input nodes as confirmed in this study see table 3 furthermore the optimized iteration learning rates were 8500 10 000 9000 10 000 8000 8500 8000 8500 9000 10 000 and 7500 for k 15 k 10 k 5 k 2 k s disc s dexter n α θ s λc and k s wooding respectively these models could explain 40 53 35 and 43 of the variability of k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 respectively moreover the developed ann models could explain about 43 55 51 65 70 51 80 and 75 of total variability of λc k s wooding θ s α n k s disc and s dexter respectively in accordance with the findings of norouzi et al 2010 zolfaghari et al 2015 and ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 our results indicated that the tangential sigmoid tangsig was the most efficient transfer function for predicting the target variables some near saturated soil hydraulic parameters for the test data set predicted by ann models compared with measured values are given in figs 4 and 5 artificial neural networks showed the most ability to predict k s disc r 2 0 80 nrmse 0 09 and s dexter r 2 0 75 nrmse 0 007 and the weakest ability to predict k 5 r 2 0 35 nrmse 0 61 the observed versus simulated values of soil hydraulic parameters for the test data of the artificial neural network model showed that almost all of the parameters in some points were overestimated and to a lesser extent were underestimated figs 4 and 5 3 4 comparison of mlr and ga ann models considering the values of r 2 rmse and mefs indicated that multivariate linear regression models did not reliably estimate the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area in all cases ga ann models showed higher model efficiency factor mef than mlr models table 2 however the predicted and measured data for the validation dataset were plotted for comparing mlr and ga ann models figs 4 and 5 the predicted values are well in accordance with real data for the ga ann models while for the mlr models predicted values did not well follow the observed data at the field scale applying ga ann models could improve r 2 significantly for all target variables see table 2 for the k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 r 2 values were improved by 23 32 21 and 24 when using ga ann models as compared to mlr models the ga ann modeling improved r 2 values from 15 to 55 for λc from 19 to 51 for k s wooding from 38 to 80 for k s disc and from 23 to 75 for s dexter moreover for θ s α and n r 2 values were improved by 43 47 and 28 in the ga ann models compared to mlr models similar trends were obtained for rmse nrmse and mef values for the two developed models such as lower rmse and rmse and higher mef values were observed in the ga ann compared to mlr models likely other scholars i e besalatpour et al 2013 2014 identified that hybrid methods of ga with ann led to higher r 2 and mef and lower rmse compared to the mlr methods yi et al 2013 estimated soil field capacity and saturated water content in a permafrost zone and stated that the capability of ann was the highest among three estimation methods comprising rosetta schaap et al 2001 ann and mlr models the greater performance of ga ann as a nonlinear method compared to a linear statistical method mlr indicates the existence of non linear relationships between input easily available soil properties and target variables near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in such cases the correlation analysis presumably affords erroneous and even misrepresentative results according to the relationships among variables liu et al 2001 norouzi et al 2010 actually linear regression models could solely discover linear relationships among the dependent and independent variables and if there is any nonlinear association among these variables the effectiveness of these models is prominently decreased yilmaz and kaynar 2011 3 5 sensitivity analysis in many cases determination of importance of input variables and their priorities is more valuable than just listing them this would support more information to modify the designated list to accommodate other considerations of the data analysis the relative importance of input variables i e soil physical and chemical properties based upon the relative sensitivity coefficient rsc of the developed hybrid ga ann models for prediction of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters is given in figs 6 and 7 the variables with greater rsc values had higher contribution to the variability of soil hydraulic parameters as the radar plot figures shows various variables were identified as the most important variables for explaining variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area geometric mean diameter of primary particles d g had significant contribution for determining the variability in most of the unsaturated hydraulic parameters including k 15 k 10 k 5 and k 2 k s θ s and α the d g is an indicator of particle size distribution and characterizes the coarseness and fineness of the soil texture similarly other researchers reported high contributions of particles size distribution to unsaturated and near saturated soil hydraulic parameters for example jarvis et al 2002 found that d g was the most important variable for explaining the variability of k 10 in a wide range of soils using the regression boosted tree jorda et al 2015 in a large scale showed that the most important predictors for k 10 were the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the measurement sites which are crucial variables for soil formation and soil characteristics they also showed that soil clay and organic matter contents were the principal predictors of k 10 such that k 10 reduced as organic matter content increased to 1 5 and as clay content raised from 10 to 40 in some parts of our study area the soils were highly affected by salinity see table 1 ec 17 2 ds m 1 as the maximum value therefore ec was one of the other important variables influencing all the studied hydraulic parameters in our soils in this regard the highest contributions were observed for λc fig 7 particle size distribution has vital contribution to most of soil hydraulic parameters such as α and n vereecken et al 1989 by developing ptfs for predicting unsaturated hydraulic properties reported that soil particle size distribution indicators were the major controlling factors organic matter content was also identified as other important variable for some hydraulic parameters like k s disc s dexter n k 2 and α which is consistent with the findings of vereecken et al 1989 for some soil hydraulic parameters such as k 10 k 5 k 2 θ s k s wooding α and s dexter relative bulk density rbd as an indicator of degree of soil compactness aggregation and soil structure showed the significant contribution jorda et al 2015 showed that bulk density in combination with land use were the most important variables for prediction k 10 bayat et al 2015 using a dataset from five provinces of iran by combining basic soil properties and parameters of confined compression curve as predictors showed that inclusion of particle size distribution parameters i e clay silt and sand contents and bulk density improved the accuracy of models for prediction of n and α 4 conclusions 1 the results of mlr modeling showed that these linear models could only explain 14 38 of the variability of near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in north western iran the results confirmed that mlr had low use potential for predicting the mentioned soil properties in the study area 2 ga ann modeling showed that by reducing the number of input variables to 12 the validity and accuracy of predictions were improved significantly compared to mlr models ga ann models could explain 35 80 of total variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area higher performance of ga ann models compared to mlr models confirmed the existence of non linear relationships among the soil physical and chemical properties with hydraulic properties 3 the results of sensitivity analysis revealed that soil particle size distribution organic matter content electrical conductivity and relative bulk density were the most important with variety of priorities for explaining variability of the near saturated soil hydraulic parameters in the study area in semiarid region conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

1067,the presence of microorganisms in potable water can alter its quality and cause public health issues when ingested or after contact with skin and mucous membranes especially in individuals with impaired immune system the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and seasonality of potentially pathogenic yeast in the public water supply of a municipality in the state of são paulo brazil in addition to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility profiles of the isolates against four antifungal drugs water samples n 1923 were collected from distinct points of the public water system 15 days after the beginning of each climatic season they were filtered through a cellulose membrane which was subsequently upturned on an agar plate results show that 11 5 of the samples were positive for yeasts after identification of the isolates rhodotorula minuta was the most prevalent in spring 48 6 fall 35 2 and summer 46 3 and candida spp in winter 68 2 resistant phenotypes were observed in 54 2 of the isolates mainly because of rhodotorula spp as conclusions yeasts are present in the water supply during all seasons of the year with great species variability and significant rates of resistance these results indicate a health concern suggesting that water quality control protocols require changes to minimize exposure to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and selection of resistant strains keywords water antimicrobials resistance yeasts environmental health 1 introduction the conveyance of microorganisms in potable water is receiving special attention recently since the quality of the water is altered and contaminated water can affect public health when ingested or after contact with skin and mucous membranes especially in hospitals and immunocompromised individuals carneiro et al 2015 oliveira et al 2016 in brazil the regulation described in ordinance no 2 914 of december 2011 determine quality control constituted by the physicochemical and microbiological analysis of water the physicochemical analysis follows the parameters of maximum allowed values ph between 6 0 and 9 5 color of 15 hu hazen unit mgpt col 1 5 turbidity units tu 10mgl 1 nitrate 1 5mgl 1 of fluorine and free residual chlorine between 0 2mgl 1 and 2mgl 1 the microbiological norms include the absence of pathogenic microorganisms and fecal bacteria brazilian ministry of health 2011 for the european community and the us environmental protection agency the physicochemical criteria of water follow the same guidelines as the brazilian norms but other groups of microorganisms such as cryptosporidium spp giardia lamblia and legionella spp are not included council of the european union 1998 apha awwa wef 2012 it is noteworthy that fungi are not included as possible agents of water contamination in any of these documents domestic hospital and food industry activities depend on water for routine sanitation and cleaning practices water for human consumption regardless of its origin whether from wells or the public supply systems is analyzed by official bodies for quality standards however the final consumer is responsible for preserving the quality of the domestic supply brazilian ministry of health 2011 several researchers have found a wide diversity of fungal species in the surface waters of lakes and rivers domestic sources storage tanks and hospitals with the following fungi being prevalent aspergillus spp fusarium spp scedosporium spp penicillium spp phialophora spp exophiala spp phoma spp acremonium spp cladosporium spp candida spp and rhodotorula spp medeiros et al 2012 sisti et al 2012 al gabr et al 2014 ma et al 2015 studies in health institutions have confirmed the correlation of pathogens present in water and diseases in humans with or without immunological impairment sisti et al 2012 oliveira et al 2016 water in hospitals can be in contact with patients through faucets and showers becoming a risk for infectious diseases the concentration of microorganisms varies according to the physicochemical conditions of the water supply systems and the formation of biofilm often occur the biological and chemical environment created by the biofilm leads to phenotypic alterations of virulence and antimicrobial resistance resulting in new communities of microorganisms brilhante et al 2011 nunes et al 2013 altun et al 2014 posteraro et al 2015 when present in the pipes of the water supply network al gabr et al 2014 fish et al 2015 nett and andes 2015 oliveira et al 2016 corroded and retentive areas are created by the products of the biofilm that contribute to the formation of complex microbial systems yeasts are common inhabitants in aquatic environments some authors suggest that yeasts should be used as bioindicators of water pollution in association with fecal bacteria medeiros et al 2012 silva bedoya et al 2014 carneiro et al 2015 monapathi et al 2017 however these microorganisms when present in domestic and hospital water supplies are considered etiological agents of opportunistic fungal diseases as demonstrated by several studies pontara et al 2011 nunes et al 2013 additionally reports on the occurrence of yeasts resistant to antifungal agents have an impact on public health due to the inexistence of specific treatment arendrup et al 2014 mahmoudabadi et al 2014 mata et al 2015 lovero et al 2017 monapathi et al 2017 the objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of yeast species through all seasons of the year in the public water supply as well as to evaluate susceptibility profiles of the isolates against four antifungal drugs 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples water samples were collected directly from faucets of the public water distribution system of a municipality in the state of são paulo brazil during the four seasons of a year winter of 2009 to fall of 2010 sampling began at 15 days after the beginning of each season with a duration from 10 to 28 days the collection points were divided into two geographic regions of the city north n 113 and south n 130 according to the position in relation to the lakes formed by the city dam in the central part of the city fig 1 the samples were extracted from faucets installed from wells with different depths in addition two points were from water treatment plant reservoirs representing water from city dam in each collection point up to four samples were collected for each season totaling 1923 samples 605 in the spring 497 in summer 456 in the fall and 365 in the winter sterile glass vials containing a 10 sodium thiosulfate pellet were used to collect 100ml of water after opening the faucet for two minutes with a continuous water flow brazilian ministry of health 2011 samples were

total of 1923 water samples yeasts were found in 11 5 n 221 regarding the geographical regions the treatment plant reservoirs showed greater positivity 24 5 34 positives 139 total while the northern region showed 11 9 110 925 and the southern region 9 0 77 859 fifteen samples presented more than one species totaling 236 yeast isolates most of them were obtained in the fall 37 3 n 88 followed by spring 30 5 n 72 summer 22 9 n 54 and winter 9 3 n 22 considering the species distribution 66 5 n 157 of the isolates were identified as rhodotorula spp 29 2 n 69 were candida spp 1 7 n 4 trichosporon spp and 1 3 n 3 aureobasidium pullulans cryptococcus neoformans geotrichum candidum and kodamaea ohmeri were isolated just once 0 4 table 1 according to the seasonal distribution rhodotorula spp showed clear predominance in spring and summer rhodotorula minuta the prevalent species in this study was the most frequent in the hot seasons with 48 6 n 35 in the spring 46 3 n 25 in the summer and 35 2 n 31 in the fall the c parapsilosis complex c orthopsilosis c metapsilosis and c parapsilosis occurred in all seasons especially c parapsilosis stricto sensu in fall n 22 and c orthopsilosis in winter n 4 only one isolate of c metapsilosis occurred in winter although summer and winter recovered less isolates the number of species in these two seasons were greater than in the others especially because of the presence of candida spp however trichosporon spp were recovered only in the fall table 1 in relation to the physicochemical characteristics of the water most samples exhibited parameters within the permitted range according to the brazilian legislation the color parameter was considered normal for all samples 15 hazen units in the platinum cobalt color scale for the chlorine 19 samples exhibited low concentrations resulting in fungal growth in all of them one sample showed altered ph value two samples had low fluorine concentrations and another two with abnormal turbidity 3 2 antifungal susceptibility testing of the 236 yeasts isolated from water 54 2 n 128 presented resistance to at least one of the antifungal agents tested here among those isolates 66 28 were resistant to one antifungal agent 62 26 2 to two according to the drugs 102 isolates were resistant to fluconazole 81 to itraconazole 4 to ketoconazole and 3 to amphotericin b considering the most frequent species isolated here rhodotorula glutinis showed the highest resistant rate with 88 9 of the isolates 8 9 followed by r mucilaginosa with 78 2 43 55 and rhodotorula minuta with 75 3 70 93 the other resistant isolates are summarized in table 2 according to each antifungal drug and to the species regarding the seasons the highest rate of resistant yeasts was found in spring with 69 4 n 50 although this was not statistically significant in the other seasons the percentages varied between 53 7 n 29 in the summer 48 9 n 43 in the fall and less resistance occurred in the winter with 27 3 n 6 the resistance profile in relation to the geographical origin could not be statistically associated however in the northern region the rates were higher 69 out of 117 59 than the south 37 out of 79 46 9 in the southern region at the two collection points of the water treatment plant reservoirs resistant yeasts were found in 55 22 out of 40 of the samples 4 discussion the presence of yeast in the public water supply in this study was relatively low 11 5 however considering the various species detected at 221 collection points across one municipality there is a high risk of contamination in addition proliferation of yeasts in domestic water tanks is a possibility which increases the risk of infections caused by these agents superficial subcutaneous and deep mycoses can be caused by direct skin contact trauma rupture of the digestive tract barriers or simply by inhalation in this sense when the fungus is present in water the potential of transmission is high either as a primary pathogen or in individuals with immunological impairment as an opportunistic agent monapathi et al 2017 studies in australia brazil and egypt have reported yeasts in public water supplies and in water sold for human consumption with incidence rates ranging from 18 to 75 sammon et al 2010 pontara et al 2011 sessegolo et al 2011 samah et al 2014 great variations in fungi contamination rates in different water sources such as the sea lakes and domestic water supplies was reported by al gabr et al 2014 medeiros et al 2012 and oliveira et al 2011 it was found that salinity ph temperature outside the allowed range and presence of organic and inorganic compounds may favor the appearance of some fungi but control other more sensitive species thereby explaining the differences found pontara et al 2011 sessegolo et al 2011 silva bedoya et al 2014 unfortunately these parameters except for ph presence of chlorine and nitrate were not evaluated in the current research because they are not included in the parameters analyzed by the municipal water and sewage service which examined the physicochemical parameters in general fungal epidemiology studies in environmental settings report high incidences in periods of high temperatures and low humidity carneiro et al 2015 shahbazy et al 2015 which was corroborated in the current investigation the climate of the region where the samples were taken is characterized by tropical climate with humid and hot summer and dry and relatively cold winter the fall the season with most isolates presents average temperatures of 21 c and relatively dry weather 50mm of rain the geographical characteristics of the collection points north and south were different as they draw water from different aquifers in the northern region wells are deeper 1000m drawing water from the guarani aquifer at high temperatures 43 c however the water in the southern region is predominantly from the bauru aquifer which is closer to the surface 200 300m deep the positivity rates of both regions were similar with a slightly higher rate in the north 11 9 against 9 0 in the south data from the literature show that more superficial waters usually contain a higher number of microorganisms hageskal et al 2006 2007 which could be observed here on the samples taken from the water treatment plant reservoirs that came from superficial waters showing the highest positivity rate 24 5 the presence of fungi in water samples with insufficient chlorination occurred as expected as all 19 samples with levels below the accepted were positive for yeast in the water supply system the automatic pumps used to add the chlorine may malfunction favoring microbial contamination however the presence of fungi in chlorinated water could also be expected previous results have already pointed to the inefficiency of this chemical in microbial control including fungi doggett 2000 ekowati et al 2017 we observed here that although chlorine levels were normal for most samples it did not prevent yeast growth in over 200 samples fluoride and turbidity levels found in this study did not affect yeast growth in the water samples rhodotorula spp and candida parapsilosis were the most common yeasts thus corroborating the studies of medeiros et al 2012 silva bedoya et al 2014 and monapathi et al 2017 although in the present investigation no analysis of biofilm formation by yeasts was performed this event may justify the wide distribution of these species in water samples and have a direct impact on public health infections caused by these fungi range from localized involvement of the skin paranasal sinuses or lungs to disseminated infections and may be related to ineffective hygiene procedures moreover rhodotorula species are considered intrinsically resistant to azoles and echinocandins fact that may lead to therapeutic failure arendrup et al 2014 consequently the high rates of resistance found in rhodotorula spp were expected and consistent with the literature nunes et al 2013 altun et al 2014 posteraro et al 2015 isolates identified as from the c parapsilosis complex did not show antifungal resistance which was also expected despite the fact they have acquired clinical importance in recent years being the cause of many fungal infections they are considered intrinsically susceptible to most of the antifungal agents xiao et al 2015 lovero et al 2016 unfortunately we were not able to assess the presence of drugs or other molecules that could induce antifungal resistance in the water isolates from the northern region had the highest resistance rate 59 this fact may be explained by the proximity to rural areas and the use of antifungal agents in agricultural which are absorbed by the soil and could contaminate the water data considering antifungal resistance in the water supply are scarce future studies are needed to assess how the water can select resistant fungi the results obtained in this study show the common presence of yeast species in water during all seasons dissemination of these agents poses a risk to public health since many of them are frequent opportunistic pathogens causing human and

1067,the presence of microorganisms in potable water can alter its quality and cause public health issues when ingested or after contact with skin and mucous membranes especially in individuals with impaired immune system the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and seasonality of potentially pathogenic yeast in the public water supply of a municipality in the state of são paulo brazil in addition to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility profiles of the isolates against four antifungal drugs water samples n 1923 were collected from distinct points of the public water system 15 days after the beginning of each climatic season they were filtered through a cellulose membrane which was subsequently upturned on an agar plate results show that 11 5 of the samples were positive for yeasts after identification of the isolates rhodotorula minuta was the most prevalent in spring 48 6 fall 35 2 and summer 46 3 and candida spp in winter 68 2 resistant phenotypes were observed in 54 2 of the isolates mainly because of rhodotorula spp as conclusions yeasts are present in the water supply during all seasons of the year with great species variability and significant rates of resistance these results indicate a health concern suggesting that water quality control protocols require changes to minimize exposure to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and selection of resistant strains keywords water antimicrobials resistance yeasts environmental health 1 introduction the conveyance of microorganisms in potable water is receiving special attention recently since the quality of the water is altered and contaminated water can affect public health when ingested or after contact with skin and mucous membranes especially in hospitals and immunocompromised individuals carneiro et al 2015 oliveira et al 2016 in brazil the regulation described in ordinance no 2 914 of december 2011 determine quality control constituted by the physicochemical and microbiological analysis of water the physicochemical analysis follows the parameters of maximum allowed values ph between 6 0 and 9 5 color of 15 hu hazen unit mgpt col 1 5 turbidity units tu 10mgl 1 nitrate 1 5mgl 1 of fluorine and free residual chlorine between 0 2mgl 1 and 2mgl 1 the microbiological norms include the absence of pathogenic microorganisms and fecal bacteria brazilian ministry of health 2011 for the european community and the us environmental protection agency the physicochemical criteria of water follow the same guidelines as the brazilian norms but other groups of microorganisms such as cryptosporidium spp giardia lamblia and legionella spp are not included council of the european union 1998 apha awwa wef 2012 it is noteworthy that fungi are not included as possible agents of water contamination in any of these documents domestic hospital and food industry activities depend on water for routine sanitation and cleaning practices water for human consumption regardless of its origin whether from wells or the public supply systems is analyzed by official bodies for quality standards however the final consumer is responsible for preserving the quality of the domestic supply brazilian ministry of health 2011 several researchers have found a wide diversity of fungal species in the surface waters of lakes and rivers domestic sources storage tanks and hospitals with the following fungi being prevalent aspergillus spp fusarium spp scedosporium spp penicillium spp phialophora spp exophiala spp phoma spp acremonium spp cladosporium spp candida spp and rhodotorula spp medeiros et al 2012 sisti et al 2012 al gabr et al 2014 ma et al 2015 studies in health institutions have confirmed the correlation of pathogens present in water and diseases in humans with or without immunological impairment sisti et al 2012 oliveira et al 2016 water in hospitals can be in contact with patients through faucets and showers becoming a risk for infectious diseases the concentration of microorganisms varies according to the physicochemical conditions of the water supply systems and the formation of biofilm often occur the biological and chemical environment created by the biofilm leads to phenotypic alterations of virulence and antimicrobial resistance resulting in new communities of microorganisms brilhante et al 2011 nunes et al 2013 altun et al 2014 posteraro et al 2015 when present in the pipes of the water supply network al gabr et al 2014 fish et al 2015 nett and andes 2015 oliveira et al 2016 corroded and retentive areas are created by the products of the biofilm that contribute to the formation of complex microbial systems yeasts are common inhabitants in aquatic environments some authors suggest that yeasts should be used as bioindicators of water pollution in association with fecal bacteria medeiros et al 2012 silva bedoya et al 2014 carneiro et al 2015 monapathi et al 2017 however these microorganisms when present in domestic and hospital water supplies are considered etiological agents of opportunistic fungal diseases as demonstrated by several studies pontara et al 2011 nunes et al 2013 additionally reports on the occurrence of yeasts resistant to antifungal agents have an impact on public health due to the inexistence of specific treatment arendrup et al 2014 mahmoudabadi et al 2014 mata et al 2015 lovero et al 2017 monapathi et al 2017 the objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of yeast species through all seasons of the year in the public water supply as well as to evaluate susceptibility profiles of the isolates against four antifungal drugs 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples water samples were collected directly from faucets of the public water distribution system of a municipality in the state of são paulo brazil during the four seasons of a year winter of 2009 to fall of 2010 sampling began at 15 days after the beginning of each season with a duration from 10 to 28 days the collection points were divided into two geographic regions of the city north n 113 and south n 130 according to the position in relation to the lakes formed by the city dam in the central part of the city fig 1 the samples were extracted from faucets installed from wells with different depths in addition two points were from water treatment plant reservoirs representing water from city dam in each collection point up to four samples were collected for each season totaling 1923 samples 605 in the spring 497 in summer 456 in the fall and 365 in the winter sterile glass vials containing a 10 sodium thiosulfate pellet were used to collect 100ml of water after opening the faucet for two minutes with a continuous water flow brazilian ministry of health 2011 samples were placed in isothermal boxes and transported to the microbiology laboratory for the analyses they were processed in the same day they were collected by filtration through a 0 2μm cellulose membrane millipore ca usa which was subsequently upturned on a petri dish with sabouraud dextrose agar sda difco detroit mi plates were incubated at 30 c and checked daily for yeast growth for up to 30 days the physicochemical analyses were carried out by municipal water and sewage service according to the methodologies proposed regulations color turbidity ph presence of free residual chlorine and nitrate were the parameters analyzed brazilian ministry of health 2011 2 2 identification of the isolates for differentiation of the morphological types and presumptive identification macro and micromorphological aspects of the isolates were observed from sabouraud dextrose agar difco detroit mi yeasts were inoculated in chromagar candida medium chromagar microbiology paris france the plates

applied to evaluate the dependence of resistant yeasts in the different seasons of the year and collection points 3 results 3 1 isolation identification and seasonal distribution of samples from the total of 1923 water samples yeasts were found in 11 5 n 221 regarding the geographical regions the treatment plant reservoirs showed greater positivity 24 5 34 positives 139 total while the northern region showed 11 9 110 925 and the southern region 9 0 77 859 fifteen samples presented more than one species totaling 236 yeast isolates most of them were obtained in the fall 37 3 n 88 followed by spring 30 5 n 72 summer 22 9 n 54 and winter 9 3 n 22 considering the species distribution 66 5 n 157 of the isolates were identified as rhodotorula spp 29 2 n 69 were candida spp 1 7 n 4 trichosporon spp and 1 3 n 3 aureobasidium pullulans cryptococcus neoformans geotrichum candidum and kodamaea ohmeri were isolated just once 0 4 table 1 according to the seasonal distribution rhodotorula spp showed clear predominance in spring and summer rhodotorula minuta the prevalent species in this study was the most frequent in the hot seasons with 48 6 n 35 in the spring 46 3 n 25 in the summer and 35 2 n 31 in the fall the c parapsilosis complex c orthopsilosis c metapsilosis and c parapsilosis occurred in all seasons especially c parapsilosis stricto sensu in fall n 22 and c orthopsilosis in winter n 4 only one isolate of c metapsilosis occurred in winter although summer and winter recovered less isolates the number of species in these two seasons were greater than in the others especially because of the presence of candida spp however trichosporon spp were recovered only in the fall table 1 in relation to the physicochemical characteristics of the water most samples exhibited parameters within the permitted range according to the brazilian legislation the color parameter was considered normal for all samples 15 hazen units in the platinum cobalt color scale for the chlorine 19 samples exhibited low concentrations resulting in fungal growth in all of them one sample showed altered ph value two samples had low fluorine concentrations and another two with abnormal turbidity 3 2 antifungal susceptibility testing of the 236 yeasts isolated from water 54 2 n 128 presented resistance to at least one of the antifungal agents tested here among those isolates 66 28 were resistant to one antifungal agent 62 26 2 to two according to the drugs 102 isolates were resistant to fluconazole 81 to itraconazole 4 to ketoconazole and 3 to amphotericin b considering the most frequent species isolated here rhodotorula glutinis showed the highest resistant rate with 88 9 of the isolates 8 9 followed by r mucilaginosa with 78 2 43 55 and rhodotorula minuta with 75 3 70 93 the other resistant isolates are summarized in table 2 according to each antifungal drug and to the species regarding the seasons the highest rate of resistant yeasts was found in spring with 69 4 n 50 although this was not statistically significant in the other seasons the percentages varied between 53 7 n 29 in the summer 48 9 n 43 in the fall and less resistance occurred in the winter with 27 3 n 6 the resistance profile in relation to the geographical origin could not be statistically associated however in the northern region the rates were higher 69 out of 117 59 than the south 37 out of 79 46 9 in the southern region at the two collection points of the water treatment plant reservoirs resistant yeasts were found in 55 22 out of 40 of the samples 4 discussion the presence of yeast in the public water supply in this study was relatively low 11 5 however considering the various species detected at 221 collection points across one municipality there is a high risk of contamination in addition proliferation of yeasts in domestic water tanks is a possibility which increases the risk of infections caused by these agents superficial subcutaneous and deep mycoses can be caused by direct skin contact trauma rupture of the digestive tract barriers or simply by inhalation in this sense when the fungus is present in water the potential of transmission is high either as a primary pathogen or in individuals with immunological impairment as an opportunistic agent monapathi et al 2017 studies in australia brazil and egypt have reported yeasts in public water supplies and in water sold for human consumption with incidence rates ranging from 18 to 75 sammon et al 2010 pontara et al 2011 sessegolo et al 2011 samah et al 2014 great variations in fungi contamination rates in different water sources such as the sea lakes and domestic water supplies was reported by al gabr et al 2014 medeiros et al 2012 and oliveira et al 2011 it was found that salinity ph temperature outside the allowed range and presence of organic and inorganic compounds may favor the appearance of some fungi but control other more sensitive species thereby explaining the differences found pontara et al 2011 sessegolo et al 2011 silva bedoya et al 2014 unfortunately these parameters except for ph presence of chlorine and nitrate were not evaluated in the current research because they are not included in the parameters analyzed by the municipal water and sewage service which examined the physicochemical parameters in general fungal epidemiology studies in environmental settings report high incidences in periods of high temperatures and low humidity carneiro et al 2015 shahbazy et al 2015 which was corroborated in the current investigation the climate of the region where the samples were taken is characterized by tropical climate with humid and hot summer and dry and relatively cold winter the fall the season with most isolates presents average temperatures of 21 c and relatively dry weather 50mm of rain the geographical characteristics of the collection points north and south were different as they draw water from different aquifers in the northern region wells are deeper 1000m drawing water from the guarani aquifer at high temperatures 43 c however the water in the southern region is predominantly from the bauru aquifer which is closer to the surface 200 300m deep the positivity rates of both regions were similar with a slightly higher rate in the north 11 9 against 9 0 in the south data from the literature show that more superficial waters usually contain a higher number of microorganisms hageskal et al 2006 2007 which could be observed here on the samples taken from the water treatment plant reservoirs that came from superficial waters showing the highest positivity rate 24 5 the presence of fungi in water samples with insufficient chlorination occurred as expected as all 19 samples with levels below the accepted were positive for yeast in the water supply system the automatic pumps used to add the chlorine may malfunction favoring microbial contamination however the presence of fungi in chlorinated water could also be expected previous results have already pointed to the inefficiency of this chemical in microbial control including fungi doggett 2000 ekowati et al 2017 we observed here that although chlorine levels were normal for most samples it did not prevent yeast growth in over 200 samples fluoride and turbidity levels found in this study did not affect yeast growth in the water samples rhodotorula spp and candida parapsilosis were the most common yeasts thus corroborating the studies of medeiros et al 2012 silva bedoya et al 2014 and monapathi et al 2017 although in the present investigation no analysis of biofilm formation by yeasts was performed this event may justify the wide distribution of these species in water samples and have a direct impact on public health infections caused by these fungi range from localized involvement of the skin paranasal sinuses or lungs to disseminated infections and may be related to ineffective hygiene procedures moreover rhodotorula species are considered intrinsically resistant to azoles and echinocandins fact that may lead to therapeutic failure arendrup et al 2014 consequently the high rates of resistance found in rhodotorula spp were expected and consistent with the literature nunes et al 2013 altun et al 2014 posteraro et al 2015 isolates identified as from the c parapsilosis complex did not show antifungal resistance which was also expected despite the fact they have acquired clinical importance in recent years being the cause of many fungal infections they are considered intrinsically susceptible to most of the antifungal agents xiao et al 2015 lovero et al 2016 unfortunately we were not able to assess the presence of drugs or other molecules that could induce antifungal resistance in the water isolates from the northern region had the highest resistance rate 59 this fact may be explained by the proximity to rural areas and the use of antifungal agents in agricultural which are absorbed by the soil and could contaminate the water data considering antifungal resistance in the water supply are scarce future studies are needed to assess how the water can select resistant fungi the results obtained in this study show the common presence of yeast species in water during all seasons dissemination of these agents poses a risk to public health since many of them are frequent opportunistic pathogens causing human and animal infections in addition antifungal resistance observed constitutes a worth noting warning to the authorities adaptations of public water supply quality control protocols are necessary to include investigations for fungi conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements authors wish to thank the

1068,the ganga river is the national river of india due to its very high socio cultural economic and ecological significance it forms the largest river basin of india that supports more than 500 million people it has been the cradle of civilization in india since antiquity the northern plain formed by the ganga river system underpins food production in india the ganga basin is the home of rich flora and fauna in the changing environment the ganga river is under the trends of declining health primarily due to anthropogenic activities despite various initiatives by the government of india to rejuvenate and manage this most sacred river of the country the health of the ganga is declining at an alarming rate the absence of stakeholder s involvement and focused on technical solutions have been among the major factors for failure of various initiatives in the current scenario of environmental problems an integrated management of the ganga river is an urgent need we advocate for an ecohydrological approach for integrated management of the ganga river ecohydrology deals with the study of interplay between hydrology and biota it is an interdisciplinary approach that uses the specific tools of hydrology water physics chemistry and ecology which consequently paves the way for integrated water resource management it provides nature based low cost and potential tools for integrated river management through utilizing ecosystem functions of nature ecohydrological practices are the ecological tools that enhance sustainability of river ecosystem and human well being through managing water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience keywords constructed wetlands ecohydrology ecosystem services ganga river riparian buffer strips sustainable agriculture 1 introduction rivers have been paved the way for the development of human civilization sinha and khan 2001 they deliver a range of ecosystem functions and services that sustain biodiversity and human well being rivers underpin biodiversity and deliver various socio economic benefits to human hajkowicz 2006 aura et al 2017 india is endowed by nature with a rich network of rivers that have been sustaining humanity since time immemorial among the various important rivers of india the ganga river is most important river this river has a unique place in the history and civilization of the indian subcontinent and it has been given the status of a national river due to its historical socio cultural economic and geographic reasons moef 2009 das et al 2013 with a length of more than 2500 km the ganga river is the longest river of india the ganga river basin grb is the largest river basin of india the consistent water supply makes the grb a vital ground for sustainability of agricultural population of india anand et al 2018 unanimously the ganga river is the lifeline of india sharma et al 2016 that underpins the agriculture socio culture and biodiversity the perennial freshwater supply in this river delivers a range of ecosystem services that support ecology economy and socio cultural values in india the ganga is most sacred river of india in india people revered this holy river as goddess people believe that bathing in this river will remove all sins the ganga river is the center of various socio cultural activities in india world famous kumbh mela is organized at allahabad officially known as prayagraj and haridwar along the ganga the ganga river system forms one of the world s most fertile and extensive alluvial plains in the northern india indo ganga plain is among the largest alluvial plains of the world and it is one third cultivable land of india that underpins the food security of indian people srivastava et al 2015 the ganga basin is home of diverse flora and fauna river ganga supports various fishes that sustain aquatic ecosystem human livelihood and food security of local people it forms world s largest delta that supports rich biodiversity and delivers a range of ecosystem goods and services like many other large rivers in the world the ganga river is also under severe pressure of anthropogenic activities despite providing a spectrum of ecosystem functions and services the ganga river health is declining at an alarming rate overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are among the major drivers that threaten the sacred ganga through flow alteration overexploitation pollution climate change biological invasion and deforestation however the government of india has taken various initiatives to manage this largest river of country such as the ganga action plan gap constitution of national ganga river basin authority ngrba and namami gange most of the initiatives have failed with a very few achievements namami gange is a recent cleaning mission so its achievements and failures are yet to come few achievements include construction of sewage treatment plants in riparian cities declaration of the ganga as national river and declaration of the gangetic dolphin as the national aquatic animal importance of river ecology was ignored during conception and implementation of the ganga action plan tare et al 2003a non functioning of sewage pumps in the flooded seasons and during power failure and ignoring the involvement of people were among the major causes for the failure of the ganga action plan das 2011 lack of an integrated approach was also a main reason for the failure of the government s initiatives therefore in the current scenario of the ganga river integrated management is an urgent need ecohydrology has emerged as integrated approach to manage the water resources it is based on scientific understanding of the hydrology biota interplay zalewski 2010 it uses the understanding of relationships between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale to achieve water quality improvement biodiversity enhancement and sustainable development erce 2019 for example creating riparian buffer strips is an ecohydrological approach to manage the rivers because there is a dual regulation between riparian vegetation and hydrological regime of a river ecohydrology is an integrative problem solving and cost efficient tool for integrated water resource management zalewski 2014 it provides nature based tools for integrated management of the river basins the main objective of this review article is to present an approach for integrated management of the ganga river we advocated ecohydrological tools for integrated management of the ganga such as sustainable agricultural riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness significance and various threats of river ganga have also been highlighted authors critically analyzed the efforts of government of india taken for river ganga 2 the ganga river a lifeline of india the ganga rises from the gaumukh in the gangotri glacier of the himalayas located in uttarakhand state of india it rises under the name of bhagirathi river the bhagirathi river meets

river has high socio cultural significance for india it has been considered as the most holy and sacred river of the world for ages bhutiani et al 2016 though several rivers of south asia are worshiped but the ganga is a prominent icon of human devotion to nature drew 2013 the ganga water has an iconic status amongst the indian due to high religious and cultural importance maheswaran et al 2016 it is believed that bathing in the ganga removes all sins of humans haridwar prayagraj allahabad and varanasi are the major ancient and holy cities located along this river these holy cities are worldwide known for their socio religious activities and cultural tourism unusual ecological diversity beautiful scenery and cultural landscapes enhance recreational and tourism activities along the ganga river farooquee et al 2008 the ganga is revered as the mother goddess in india people call it maa ganga mother ganga people bathe in the ganga and perform various rituals during many occasions all over the year various rituals are performed by people along the ghats riverfronts of the ganga the ganga arti at dashashwamedh ghat of varanasi is world famous it is fire ceremony in which a group of priest performs ritual to worship the goddess ganga it is performed daily in the evening along the dashashwamedh ghat many festivals are held along the ganga bank but the kumbh mela kumbh festival is world famous it is recognized as the largest human gathering on planet earth during kumbh people take ritual bath in the holy river the kumbh mela is a religious mass gathering held every three years in one of four cities of allahabad nashik ujjain and haridwar by rotation david and roy 2016 it is held at the same city after 12 years kumbh mela of allahabad along the confluence of the ganga and the yamuna river is most prominent among all it was estimated that about 120 million devotees and pilgrims had visited the kumbh mela of allahhabd in 2013 which made it largest human gathering in the history cariappa et al 2015 it is believed that the nectar of mortality is present in the waters of river ganga during the kumbh and bathing during this time removes all sins maclean 2009 buzinde

tourism in india the ganga basin is a land of fertile soil that significantly contributes to the agricultural economies of india and bangladesh kumar 2017 the alluvial plain of this basin is known as bread basket of india culturable area of the ganga basin is about 58 0 m ha which is 29 5 of the total culturable area of india gfcc 2009 misra 2011 indo ganga plain is the land of about half of total food grains production of india that supports the food requirement of 40 of population pal et al 2009 dwivedi et al 2018 various industrial activities utilize the freshwater of the ganga and its tributaries in india several dams are established along the ganga river system to generate hydropower the ganga river is an important source of freshwater fishes that provide food to local people it sustains the livelihood of a large number of fishermen living along its bank vass et al 2010a delta formed by the ganga river supports the growth of sunderban mangrove forest in india and bangladesh it is a home of more than 4 5 million people that directly and indirectly depend on the sunderban ecosystem services wwf 2019 this biodiversity rich ecosystem underpins the sustainable livelihoods of millions of people by providing a range of products like wood honey leaf litter and fodder unesco 2019 the sunderban sustains about 90 of the total natural honey production in india unesco 2019 raw materials of this forest ecosystem sustain the economy of various wood based industries like newsprint mill match factory hardboard factory handicraft industry boat factory and furniture industry

such as haridwar allahabad and varanasi haridwar is a prominent pilgrimage site in the foothills of the shiwalik himalayas every year thousands of devotees go there for various rituals including ganga snan bathing in the ganga that provide livelihood to the local people through tourism the kumbh mela at allahabad provides the income source for local people through religious and cultural tourism the prominent riverfronts along the ganga in varanasi attract tourists from all over the world that generate revenue to the government and livelihood to local people 3 threats to the ganga river we have entered the anthropocene a new geological epoch in which human is a dominant factor and altering the natural environment of the earth elosegi et al 2017 fagan 2019 anthropocene refers to the geology of mankind and it describes a shift from the holocene to a time where humans have become a geological force crutzen 2002 heikkurinen et al 2019 worldwide many scientists advocate the onset or acceleration of industrial revolution as the starting point of the anthropocene butler 2018 despite providing a spectrum of benefits the ganga river is unhealthy during the anthropocene it has experienced drastic degradation in water quality and biodiversity the grb was relatively free from anthropogenic activities until the 1940s but it converted into a disposal site for agricultural industrial and sewerage wastes after independence of india in 1947 sinha and khan 2001 increasing population coupled with ill planned urban growth inadequate urban and industrial waste management intensive use of chemical fertilizers deforestation dams and bridge construction fossil fuel consumption floods storms and mass bathing cause severe stress to the ganga river ecosystem singh and singh 2007 sarkar et al 2003 we argue that overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the major drivers that threaten the ganga river ecosystem through flow alteration overexploitation pollution biological invasion climate change and deforestation fig 2 various threats negatively affect the ganga river ecosystem structure functions and services negative impacts on ecosystem structure functions and services not only degrade river health but also reduce human well being 3 1 drivers of threats to the ganga river overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the foremost drivers to various threats of the ganga river fig 3 3 1 1 overpopulation the grb is among the most populated river basins in the world fertile soil availability of freshwater low relief landscape and suitable climate make the ganga plain one of the most densely populated regions of the world singh and awasthi 2011 saxena and singh 2017 the ganga basin is home of about 500 million people which is expected to double by 2030 birol and das 2010 it has a population density of about 600 km2 which is more than india s national population density of 382 km2 census 2011a sawi 2014 tare et al 2017 urbanization and industrialization are paving the way for increasing population in the grb goloub et al 2001 tripathi et al 2005 and in turn increasing population is among the major factors for urbanization industrialization agriculture expansion and pollution in the ganga basin the continuous population rise and consequent water resources development in terms of dams and irrigation canals has affected the river s flow regime which in turn has impacted the water availability water quality and thus the ganga river ecosystem anand et al 2018 the upper ganga canal system and teri dam are examples of big projects that were developed to fulfill the irrigation and energy demand of increasing population acreman et al 2017 densely populated regions dominate water pollution in the ganga basin not only because they contain many people but because their faeces are more efficiently entered to the river system milledge et al 2018 3 1 2 urbanization it is likely that population of india will reach the mark of 1 4 billion by 2025 out of which 42 5 will be urban kaur et al 2013 the ganga basin is most urbanized river basin of india pandey and yadav 2017 it is home of several big cities of india such as delhi ghaziabad faridabad jaipur agra meerut kanpur lucknow prayagraj varanasi patna and kolkata first urbanization of india was emerged in the indus plain during indus valley civilization second urbanization of india was occurred in the ganga plain pokharia et al 2017 urbanization increases the impervious surface cover in the river catchment the impervious surface cover heightens surface runoff and reduces infiltration of precipitation kaye et al 2006 urbanization is among the major causes of deforestation and increasing pollution in the ganga basin twenty nine class i cities population 1 million or above 23 class ii cities population 50 000 to 99 999 and about 50 towns are along the ganga that discharge industrial waste and domestic sewage into the ganga river ecosystem agrawal et al 2010 biswas et al 2015 paul 2017 not only the ganga river but its tributaries are also under huge stress of urbanization delhi located along the yamuna river a tributary of the ganga is second largest city of india with a population of more than 16 million it is one of the largest cities in the world delhi generates huge amount of sewage that through 22 drains enters the yamuna and pollutes it lucknow capital city of uttar pradesh is the eleventh largest urban agglomeration of india with a population of 2902 920 census 2011b it is located at the bank of gomti river which is an important tributary of the ganga this city pollutes the gomti through discharging 450 mld untreated domestic sewage gaur et al 2005 singh et al 2005 agarwal et al 2007 3 1 3 intensive agriculture intensive agriculture has resulted not only deforestation but also river pollution in the grb favorable climatic conditions of the ganga plain harbored rich flora and fauna but deforestation and hunting caused their degradation singh 2004 pokharia et al 2017 intensive agriculture characterized by unsustainable practices is one of the main reasons of deforestation in this fertile plain the ganga alluvial plain is a region of intensive agriculture tyagi et al 2009 bickle et al 2018 the ganga basin has a large network of canals and irrigation channels that play a great role in intensive agricultural production upper ganga canal and lower ganga canal are pivotal for food production in uttar pradesh state most of the farmlands in the ganga basin are intensively cultivated with large scale application of fertilizers pandey and yadav 2017 the agricultural activities in this basin are quite advanced and fertilizer and pesticide consumption is very high trivedi 2010 the grb is under the influence of intensive use of fertilizers and about 115 000 tonnes of fertilizers are washed away through agricultural runoff and enter into the ganga river das 1991 jain 2002 the green revolution in the ganga basin made country independent in terms of food production it enhanced food production through the use of high yielding varieties hyvs chemical fertilizers irrigation and mechanization sapkota et al 2015 after the green revolution people in india in general and the ganga basin in particular adopted modern agricultural practices and switched to monoculture crop production the ongoing agricultural practices in the northwest indo ganga plain nwigp including punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh are not sustainable under current scenario of environmental and agricultural change ladha et al 2009 bhatt et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 rice wheat cropping system rwcs of indo ganga plain igp covers an area of 13 5 million hectares and feeds about 20 of world population saharawat et al 2010 samal et al 2017 rwcs of the igp is not sustainable as it is highly money water and energy intensive samal et al 2017 3 1 4 industrialization the ganga river basin is under huge pressure from industrialization industrial activities are among the major drivers of increasing pollution in river ganga industries discharge untreated effluent into the ganga that deteriorates water quality and thereby negatively affects river biota and human well being leather industries of kanpur significantly contribute to the ganga river pollution kanpur has been a major center of india s tannery industry for more than 100 years do et al 2018 kanpur unnao region is among the largest industrial hubs of the ganga basin where various industries such as tanning and leather industries fertilizers factories textile mills arm factories chemical factories paint factories plastic industries produce a large amount of industrial waste ansari et al 2000 sinha et al 2006 gowd et al 2010 kanpur has 151 tanneries along bank of the ganga that discharge of 5 8 to 8 8 mld wastewater dwivedi et al 2018 mushrooming growth of tannery industries in north india has made this holy river a dumping ground beg and ali 2008 tannery effluent contains toxic heavy metals such as cr zn mn cu and pb deepali and gangwar 2010 dixit et al 2015 dwivedi et al 2018 varanasi has about 5000 registered industries of textile and fabric carpet diesel locomotive works dlw wood leather metal paper products food processing plastic rubber and glass industries dip varanasi dip 2014 pandey et al 2015 due to lack of effluent treatment plants most of these industries discharge their effluents into the drains that open into the ganga industrial centers along the yamuna river also contribute in the pollution load of the ganga delhi ghaziabad noida and faridabad are among the major industrial centers along the yamuna river according to the central pollution control board cpcb about 359 industries directly or indirectly empty their effluents in yamuna mishra 2010 paul 2017 3 2 major threats to the ganga river flow alteration overexploitation pollution biological invasion climate change and deforestation are the major threats to the ganga river 3 2 1 flow alteration a change in flow regime is a major threat to the sustainability of river health and its ecosystem services increasing water extraction for agriculture urban and industrial use has severely altered the hydrology in major river basins of the world molle et al 2010 in the anthropocene the growing demands of food and energy have paved the way for dam construction across the globe gupta et al 2012 the grb is one of the most vulnerable river basins in the world due to the combined effects of climate change and development pressures in terms of dam constructions and urbanization mirza 1998 gain et al 2011 gain and giupponi 2014 alteration of flow regimes in the ganga basin due to large dams negatively affects endangered species such as ganga river dolphin platanista gangetica chaudhary et al 2012 diversion of water for irrigation through canals also reduces the flow of the ganga flow decline in river ganga during non monsoon period is a main problem more than 80 of the annual flow in this river occurs during monsoon that causes widespread flooding khan et al 2014 flow regime is a prime regulator of ecosystem structure functions and services delivered by the river flow reduction promotes for biological invasion for example flow reduction in the ganga river caused the dominance of exotic common carps cyprinus carpio vass et al 2010b gopal 2016 3 2 2 overexploitation freshwater ecosystems such as river ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic demand due to hydropower production recreation irrigation and domestic water supply and industrial use vogl and lopes 2009 sapounidis et al 2017 overexploitation of natural resources such as water fishes and sand from the ganga river is one of the major causes for its degradation high population growth coupled with increasing agricultural demands is creating stress on the water resources and ecosystem of the ganga basin tare et al 2017 over withdrawal of water for irrigation is a serious threat to this largest river of india wong et al 2007 overexploitation of the water for irrigation through various channels and canals alters flow regime the ganga basin is one of the largest multi aquifer groundwater reservoirs of india with depths of more than 2000 m maheswaran et al 2016 groundwater overexploitation mainly for irrigation is a major pressure on the aquifers of the ganga basin in the anthropocene the demand of sand has increased in india due to many factors such as increasing population economic development and urbanization the ganga river bed is a rich source of sand due to continuous erosion in fragile himalayas over extraction of sand from the river bed is among the major causes that change the ganga river health river sand mining not only changes the river morphology but also the state of river flows wang et al 2012 barman et al 2019 and negatively affects river biota riparian ecosystem aesthetics value heritage areas and sustainable livelihood activities like fishing and farming sreebha and padmalal 2011 the biological resources of river ganga such as fishes and riparian vegetation are also under huge pressure of overexploitation 3 2 3 pollution the ganga river is listed among the world s most polluted rivers the main sources of pollution in the ganga river are domestic sewage industrial effluents and agricultural activities dwivedi et al 2018 about 12 000 million liters per day mld of sewage is generated across the ganga basin out of which only 4000 mld can be treated sharmila and arockiarani 2016 pathak et al 2018 major urban regions that generate substantial volume of sewage are kanpur allahabad varanasi patna bhagalpur and kolkata cpcb 2013 besides these the ganga basin cities such as delhi ghaziabad faridabad jaipur meerut agra and lucknow also contribute in the ganga pollution tanning industries of jajmau area of kanpur discharge tons of hazardous untreated waste into the holy ganga dixit et al 2017 tannery effluents are characterized by high concentrations of organics dissolved and suspended solids organic nitrogen ammonia and chromium song et al 2004 vymazal 2014 pulp and paper sugar distilleries and other industries discharging wastewater to the ramganga and the kali rivers are among the major contributors to pollution in the ganga sharmila and arockiarani 2016 pathak et al 2018 about 153 mld of untreated domestic sewage and industrial effluent enter in the ganga at varanasi and degrade its water quality tripathi and tripathi 2011 pandey et al 2014 industrial effluents domestic sewage disposal of dead bodies and agricultural runoff are the major sources of pollution in the ganga corridor of varanasi sikandar 1986 tripathi et al 1991 tributaries of the ganga also contribute a significant role in the ganga river pollution tributaries drain their pollutant load including heavy metals into the already polluted ganga river paul 2017 the yamuna river is among the most polluted tributaries of the ganga river and it meets the ganga at prayagraj in uttar pradesh delhi stretch of the yamuna river is one of the most polluted river stretches in india this yamuna stretch is less than 2 of its total length but receives 71 of its total wastewater load mutiyar and mittal 2014 mutiyar et al 2018 according to a study of central pollution control board cpcb delhi generates 3800 mld of wastewater and out which only 1575 8 mld is treated and 2224 2 mld discharged into the yamuna the hindu 2015 industrial centers such delhi noida faridabad mathura and agra drain a considerable amount of untreated effluent in the yamuna the yamuna river contributes 16 of the total water to the ganga river paul 2017 and consequently the pollution levels of the ganga further increased samson et al 2019 3 2 4 biological invasion biological invasion is a global problem to the freshwater ecosystems it is arrival survival successful reproduction and dispersal of species in an ecosystem where the species did not occur previously carlton 1989 whitfield et al 2002 recently invasive alien species ias have been emerging as the second major threat to global biodiversity after habitat destruction sandilyan and klooster 2016 the biodiversity of the ganga river is severely threatened by invasion of alien species of plant and animals biological invasion of alien species in the ganga river declines not only river health but also the population of local fishes singh et al 2013 cyprinus carpio oreochromis niloticus aristichthys nobilis ctenopharyngodon idella hypophthalmichthys molitrix and clarias gariepinus are some notable alien fish species in the ganga river singh et al 2013 middle stretch of the ganga is highly threatened by the invasive fish species the reduced flow and depth particularly in the middle stretch provides an optimum habitat for the exotic fish species like c carpio and o niloticus das et al 2013 parthenium hysterophorus and eichhornia crassipes are among the most prominent and widespread distributed invasive plants in the ganga river ecosystem parthenium hysterophorus congress grass a weed of the family asteraceae was accidentally introduced in india during the transportation of cereal krishnaveni 2013 it has high fecundity and a single plant can produce 10 000 to 15 000 viable seeds which disperse and germinate to cover large areas patel 2011 parthenium hysterophorus negatively affects native flora in riparian zones of the ganga river eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth is the world s worst aquatic weed khaket et al 2012 it is a floating macrophyte native of the amazon river basin in tropical south america behera et al 2012 ebel et al 2007 it shows high tolerance to extremes of hydrological regimes nutrients availability temperature ph and toxic substances yi et al 2016 water hyacinth is characterized by rapid growth it not only harms native aquatic plants but also deteriorates water quality and consequently impacts public health in a study of shukla et al 1995 water hyacinth collected from the ganga river was found as an important reservoir of toxigenic vibrio cholera and aeromonas spp the occurrence of these pathogenic microorganisms in ganga river is a public health issue as they cause intestinal and extraitenstinal infections shukla et al 1995 this free floating aquatic macrophyte can interfere with the use of water resources through obstructing water flow reducing dissolved oxygen hindering the movement of boats hampering hydropower generation and restricting the discharge capacity of lowland rivers pieterse and murphy 1990 vereecken et al 2006 henry silva et al 2008 3 2 5 climate change climate change is now a global threat to river basins it is projected to cause increase in temperature and alterations to precipitation in most part of the globe and consequently change in the hydrological cycle including flow of rivers kundzewicz et al 2008 ipcc 2014 laize et al 2017 according to the ipcc report there is an estimate of about 1 4 to 6 4 c increase in global temperature by 2100 ipcc 2007 mishra et al 2013 the grb is among the most affected regions of the world by climate change the trends and projections of climate change in the ganga river basin are outlined in the table 1 glacial originated rivers are more threatened to the climate change because glaciers are sensitive to global warming mishra and lilhare 2016 rising global temperature is a major threat to the himalayan glaciers the main sources of the ganga river and its various tributaries are the himalayan glaciers and monsoon rainfall in recent years climate change severely affected these important sources of water the gangotri glacier the source of the ganga is an important glacier of the himalayas in uttarakhand state of india it is under the threat of retreat due to global warming scientific study mirrors that the retreat of the gangotri glacier has speeded since 1780 and from 1936 to 1996 it receded 1 147 km naithani et al 2001 drew 2013 this glacier is retreating about 28 m per year mall et al 2006 in the short term glacier retreat enhances river flow but in long term due to glacier disappearance river flow decline kundzewicz et al 2008 climate change is affecting both rainfall and runoff in the ganga basin in the current scenario of changing climate although numbers of rainy days are increasing in both upper and lower ganga basin but rainfall more than 10 mm day is decreasing shrestha et al 2015 further in total runoff of the ganga basin the share of melt water is decreasing and the share of rainfall runoff is increasing lutz and immerzeel 2013 changing climate is a major threat to the structure functions and services of the ganga river ecosystem and consequently challenging the well being of millions climate change derived extreme temperature and varied rainfall and flow conditions are affecting not only the aquatic biota but also various ecosystem services of the ganga river such as hydrological cycling water purification fishing nutrient cycling recreation and habitat provision tripathi et al 2017 singh and singh 2019 food production in the ganga basin is also under huge stress due to climate change mishra et al 2013 3 2 6 deforestation deforestation is a major threat to the biodiversity and ecosystem services forest loss has made the himalayan watershed more vulnerable to erosion and consequently loss of soil and nutrients siltation of rivers and increase in the frequency and severity of flooding rasul 2014 the grb has been the center of deforestation activities since antiquity the ganga basin is now a threatened ecosystem where 80 of original forest cover has been lost smakhtin et al 2006 sunil et al 2010 the increasing population urbanization agricultural expansion and industrialization have been paved the way for forest loss in the ganga river valley deforestation causes land use and land cover changes lulc in the river basin lulc in the riparian zone critically affects the capacity of rivers to deliver ecosystem functions and services it affects water quality and quantity in the river basins degradation of riparian forests enhances the catchment erosion increased rate of siltation in the downstream of the ganga due to deforestation and soil erosion in the upper ganga catchment have caused degradation of oxbow lakes backwaters and floodplain natarajan 1989 dudgeon 1992 4 government s initiatives for the ganga river management an analysis the government of india has taken several initiatives to rejuvenate and manage the ganga river ecosystem through various plans policies and missions in 1985 the government of india approved the ganga action plan gap the gap was approved with the objectives of reducing the pollution load in the ganga and of establishing sewage treatment systems in 25 class i cities along the river alley 1992 1994 in 1986 the government of india launched ganga action plan gap i to improve the water quality of the river ganga to clean the ganga river 261 schemes were sanctioned under gap phase i out of 261 schemes 88 schemes were related to sewage interception and diversion 35 to sewage treatment 43 to low cost toilets 35 to riverfront development 28 to electric crematoria and 32 to miscellaneous works nrcd 1999 tare et al 2003b later in 1993 the second phase of ganga action plan gap ii was launched with the aim to improve water quality of other polluted rivers and under this plan yamuna and gomati action plans were approved in 1995 it was later extended to the other regulated rivers under the new name of the national river conservation plan nrcp greenstone and hanna 2014 nrcp was aimed to prevent the pollution in major rivers of india including the ganga prime minister of india declared the ganga as the national river on november 4 2008 and decided to constitute the national ganga river basin authority ngrba toi 2009 the ngrba was constituted on february 20 2009 to act as a planning financing monitoring and coordinating body for the ganga river management main objectives of ngrba was to i ensure effective abatement of pollution and conservation of the river ganga by adopting a river basin approach to promote inter sectoral co ordination for comprehensive planning and management and b maintain environmental flows in the river ganga with the aim of ensuring water quality and environmentally sustainable development nmcg 2019b the decision to declare ganga river dolphin platanista gangetica as the national aquatic animal was taken in the first meeting of the national ganga river basin authority the ngrba launched mission clean ganga with proposal for a substantial investment of 15 000 crores of rupees for cleaning the ganga by year of 2020 das 2011 mission clean ganga was aimed to clean the ganga by wastewater management solid waste management reducing industrial pollution and river front development nmcg 2019b major policy initiatives taken under ngrba include city level monitoring committees dolphin conservation involvement of ngrba experts public outreach and awareness involvement of youth ganga knowledge centre water quality monitoring and the ganga river basin management plan grbmp nmcg 2019c namami gange is a recent programme of the government of india for the ganga river management it is a flagship programme launched in 2014 with a budget outlay of rupees 20 000 crore aiming to reduction of pollution conservation and rejuvenation of the ganga nmcg 2019d namami gange is characterized by eight important pillars i sewage treatment infrastructure ii river surface cleaning iii afforestation iv river front development v bio diversity vi public awareness vii industrial effluent monitoring and viii ganga gram a sum of rs 100 crores has been allocated for developments of ghats and beautification of riverfronts at kedarnath haridwar kanpur varanasi prayagraj patna and delhi despite a range of initiatives and efforts by the government of india pollution in the ganga river is increasing day by day dixit et al 2017 several initiates taken by the government of india proved to be failed in achieving their targets of the clean ganga the ganga action plans achieved partial success for example 4704 mld of sewage treatment capacity have been generated since the gap launched moef 2013 do et al 2018 one of the successes of gap is that it made the ganga river pollution a public issue of national importance declaration of the ganga as national river and gangetic dolphin as the national aquatic animal is also a success of the government s initiatives the gap failed due to several factors such as poor policy and planning lack of public support and religious beliefs dixit et al 2017 the aim of the gap was to find the technocratic solutions to enhance water quality and ignored the public participation das and tamminga 2012 according to tare et al 2003a the significance of river ecology has not been addressed copiously during conception and implementation of ganga action plan the government of india has failed to involve people in mission of clean ganga das 2011 moreover the staff involved in implementation of the gap was poor in visionary ideas and changed many times srivastava 2010 intermittent operation of sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment plants has been one of the major factors for gap failure the state governments in india have failed to provide adequate and continuous electricity to energized sewage pumping stations alley 2016 lack of coordination between implementing bodies was also a key reason in the failure of the ganga action plans the nrcp has been criticized for a variety of reasons imbalanced and inadequate funding of sites lack of cooperation among participating agencies and an inability to keep pace with the growth of sewage output in india s cities suresh et al 2007 greenstone and hanna 2014 abatement of non point source pollution to the ganga river was ignored under several schemes non point pollution is notoriously hard to prevent and there is currently no nationwide plan for prevention of such pollution in the river ganga tare et al 2003b although namami gange programme looks comparatively much integrated and diversified but it will be very early to analyse success and failure of this recent program of the ganga rejuvenation in the current scenario of economic development this recent programme faces many challenges to achieve its targets in contradictory and troubling ways ganga s rejuvenation lies alongside the growth agenda promoted by the country s top leaders so the goals for increasing energy generation irrigation and manufacturing and for developing the river as an inland waterway compete with ganga cleanup alley 2016 5 integrated ganga river management through ecohydrological approach integrated water resource management iwrm is a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 iwrm is holistic in nature as it considers river basin as the unit for all planning activities integrates the knowledge from various disciplines and considers the dialogue between stakeholders and decision makers zalewski 2015 ecohydrology is a fundamental component of integrated water management harper et al 2016 it is based on the scientific understanding of hydrology biota interplay and provides a low cost problem solving and systematic framework to utilize ecosystem services of nature as new tool for iwrm zalewski 2010 2015 sohel et al 2015 janauer 2016 it has proved that integrating ecohydrology with new engineering technologies enhances the efficiency of environmental management and reduces the cost of investments in infrastructure wagner and zalewski 2009 establishing riparian buffer zone is a very good example of ecohydrological approach and it improves river water quality through filtering and retaining sediments and pollutants from upland catchment area izydorczyk et al 2013 zalewski 2015 janauer 2016 ecohydrology is a sub discipline of hydrology that focuses on ecological processes occurring within the hydrological cycle and utilizes them to enhance environmental sustainability zalewski 2010 ecohydrological practices are the ecological tools that increase sustainability of river ecosystems and human well being through managing water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience wbsr zalewski 2015 msuya and lalika 2017 ecohydrology is a process oriented approach that aims to regulate water biota interplay for the enhancement of ecosystem potential and its harmonisation with society needs zalewski 2013 it comprises three key principles i hydrological principle ii ecological principle and iii ecological engineering principle zalewski 2015 the hydrological principle implies quantification of hydrological processes at the basin scale and the entire hydrological cycle as a template for quantification of ecological processes ecological principle implies the need for understanding of the evolutionary established water biota interplay and thus quantification of nutrient flows and energy fluxes dynamics at the water cycle and catchment templates defined in the first step finally the ecological engineering principle defines ecosystem properties identified in the framework of the first and the second principles as management tools integration of ecohydrology with iwrm paves the way for coordinated sustainable and holistic management of river basins land and other resources and socio economic development through steady supply of ecosystem services msuya and lalika 2017 for integrated management of the rivers the ecohydrological tools have emerged as the low cost and nature based solution using the multiple dimensions of hydrology ecology and society zalewski 2015 listed several ecohydrological and hydrotechnical measures for conservation and restoration of river basins including shelter belts at agricultural landscape buffer strips biosphere reserve constructed wetlands by pass for fish migration and urban storm water purification worldwide ecohydrological approaches have been used for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes and ponds ecohydrology was used for various issues of danube river basin such as refining of the danube delta monograph wetland restoration navigational improvements flood prevention and habitat improvements jelev and jelev 2012 el sadek et al 2008 advocated ecohydrology as an approach of iwrm in the nile basin they advocated natural ecohydrological process as management tool including riparian buffer wetlands and floodplains el sadek et al 2008 also promoted the inclusion of local people in the water quality management a range of ecohydrological tools were applied in the gumera river basin of ethiopia such as biodegradable geofibres shelterbelts sequential biofiltration system ecotone buffer zones and optimization of fish based aquaculture negussie et al 2011 pacini et al 2018 promoted the protection and restoration of papyrus cyperus papyrus as an ecohydrological tool for restoring ecosystem services in afro tropical wetlands sohel et al 2015 proposed various ecohydrological approaches for ecosystem service provision and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in bangladesh such as creation of vegetated buffer zones implementation of denitrification wall constructed wetlands water management through strip plantation sprinkler and drip irrigation and organic matter application and rice intensification through soil moisture maintenance ecohydrological tools like ecotone zones were successfully used to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in european countries ekorob 2011 izydorczyk et al 2013 zalewski 2015 for example plant buffering zones and biogeochemical and denitrification barriers effectively reduced the phosphorus pollution in zarzęcin poland zalewski 2015 in another project plant buffering zones enhanced with denitrification walls decreased agriculture borne nitrogen pollution in barkowice poland zalewski 2015 the ganga river management is a complex issue of india despite a series of efforts by the government of india this important river is still unhealthy among most of the initiatives the integrity of ganga river ecohydrological issues and socio ecological aspects have been ignored in the current scenario there is a need of integrated approach to manage the ganga river this integrated management will sustain not only the river health but also the well being of people depending on the river ecosystem services integrated management of the ganga river needs an ecohydrological approach that includes multiple dimensions of river basins such as ecology hydrology and people sustainable agriculture riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness are ecohydrological tools that are required for integrated management of the ganga river 5 1 sustainable agriculture intensification of agriculture increases pressures on rivers bączyk et al 2018 the productive ganga plain is under huge pressure of modern and intensive agricultural practices characterized by monocropping and excessive utilization of fertilizers pesticides machinery and water resources in the ganga basin adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is a pressing need to manage river ecosystem sustainable agriculture is based on the economic environmental and social sustainability of the food system heidelberger et al 2017 it is environmentally non degrading technically appropriate economically viable and socially acceptable and conserves natural resources fao 1989 pigford et al 2018 sustainable agriculture conserves land water and plant and animal genetic resources fao 1989 sustainable agriculture practices include a variety of practices such as composting agroforestry cover cropping crop rotation intercropping residue retention drip irrigation no tillage and growing less water crops the switching from water intensive rice crops to water saving maize crop under conservation agriculture based management tillage crop establishment and residue management practices is required for sustainable intensification in the indo ganga plain jat et al 2018 in the ganga basin most of the farmers use flood irrigation that causes a huge loss of precious freshwater adoption of localized irrigation would not only save the water resources of the ganga basin but also improve the health of the ganga localized irrigation systems such as trickle or drip irrigation and micro sprayers irrigate individual plants using plastic pipes that are generally laid on the ground surface chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 drip irrigation is water saving irrigation practice molle and tanouti 2017 that transports water directly to the root zone of plant and enhances water use efficiency and consequently ecological sustainability of food production ward 2014 khor and feike 2017 ertek and yilmaz 2014 recommend the use of purified wastewater in place of freshwater for irrigation and sustainable management of water rainwater harvesting also promotes to sustainable agriculture adenle et al 2019 collecting and utilizing rainwater for irrigation is applied as technology to promote sustainable agriculture in many african countries like burkina faso ethiopia ghana kenya south africa tanzania botswana malawi mali and zimbabwe adenle et al 2019 surface retention of crop residue saves irrigation water through conserving soil water moderating the thermal regime suppressing weeds and enhancing soil health jalota et al 2018 crop residue covers the soil surface and thus reduces soil water evaporation crop rotation refers to the practice of growing a sequence of plant species on the same land yates 1954 bullock 1992 crop rotations with leguminous crops enhance the level of nitrogen in the soil through the process of biological nitrogen fixation giller 2001 thierfelder et al 2012 it enhances soil fertility and thus would reduce the dependence on inorganic fertilizers which are among the major causes of the ganga pollution no tillage nt refers to cultivation with little or no soil surface disturbance the only disturbance being during planting busari et al 2015 nt reduces evaporative loss from upper soil layers maximizes rain infiltration increases soil c and n stocks reduces runoff and minimizes soil loss in runoff bayer et al 2000 hobbs et al 2007 kassam and friedrich 2011 during 2004 2005 the extent of no tillage in the indo gangetic plain was only 1 90 mha while it was 25 30 mha in usa derpsch 2005 hobbs et al 2007 there is need to increase the nt practices to save the not only water but also soil nutrients and soil biodiversity in erosion prone ganga plain intercropping and agroforestry potentially minimize the pressure on water and land resources through enhancing crop yields and resources use efficiency hong et al 2017 intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of more than one crop species in the same field intercropping of legumes with cereals is sustainable practice for nutrient management legume intercropping enhances the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous and thus reduces the external input of inorganic fertilizers singh and singh 2017 inorganic fertilizers are not only the major pollutants of the ganga river but also the source of n2o a greenhouse gas legume intercropping would minimize the inputs of inorganic fertilizers in the ganga plain and consequently reduction in their load in agricultural runoff agroforestry is a land use system in which trees or shrubs are grown in association with agricultural crops pastures or livestock bhattarai et al 2016 agroforestry not only sustains farmers livelihood but also increases agricultural sustainability through enhancing productivity soil organic matter carbon sequestration water retention and biodiversity zomer et al 2016 bhattarai et al 2016 paul et al 2017 singh and singh 2017 this agricultural practice is important for reducing soil erosion river bank erosion and surface runoff bhattarai et al 2016 agroforestry along the river bank reduces the agricultural runoff and thereby sustains the river water quality deforestation of riparian flora in the ganga basin is a major issue in the changing environment in the ganga basin agro ecosystems with forest component are required to enhance farmers livelihood food productivity soil quality and river health 5 2 riparian buffer strips agricultural runoff is one of the major causes of the ganga river pollution riparian buffer strips rbss can mitigate the agricultural pollution through trapping sediments and pollutants riparian buffers strips are the belt of vegetation along the river these are the transitional zone between aquatic system and upland terrestrial system it is widely acknowledged that rbss play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity habitats and water bodies richit et al 2017 riparian buffer strips act as the ecological engineers and regulate river water quality and quantity through a range of ecosystem functions fig 4 rbss provide various ecosystem functions and services through an interaction of water soils and biota vegetation buffer strips deliver a range of ecosystem functions and services such as filtration of sediments and pollutants carbon sequestration temperature regulation nutrient dynamics river bank stabilization habitat for wildlife groundwater recharge flood mitigation recreation and aesthetic value kenwick et al 2009 ramilan et al 2010 choi et al 2012 mcvittie et al 2015 richit et al 2017 establishing rbss is an ecohydrological approach to sustain river health rbss are the best management practices bmps for surface water protection hénault ethier et al 2017 tree planting in riparian area is widely recognized as a way to improve water quality and stream habitat parkyn et al 2005 development and management of riparian buffers is recognized as a sustainable way to control agricultural non point source pollution of stream water and resultant water quality degradation anbumozhi et al 2005 riparian buffer strips have become an integral part of watershed management in american and european landscapes decker 2003 sweeney and blaine 2007 enanga et al 2011 riparian buffer strips are effective in mitigating the nitrate pollution generated by agricultural field hefting and de klein 1998 hefting and de klein 1998 assessed the nitrogen removal potential in riparian buffer strips along the hazelbeek stream of netherlands they found that nitrate concentrations in ground water were higher at the boundary of maize field and riparian forest 40 mg n l and lower close to the stream 0 1 2 mg n l this study estimated that nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased by 95 when it streamed through the riparian buffers creation of rbss the along the ganga river would enhance the water quality and quantity of the river through ecohydrological approach it will provide a cost effective nature based and sustainable solution after creation of riparian buffer along the ganga river little maintenance will be required to assess the effectiveness of rbss to mitigate the nutrient pollution we can compare the properties of soils within riparian buffer strips along different land use types and to reference condition soils in a natural landscape enanga et al 2011 5 3 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws are engineered wastewater treatment systems that treat water through physical chemical and biological processes in the same way that occur in natural wetlands rai et al 2013 construction of wetland is an ecohydrological and sustainable tool that not only traps nutrients and pollutants but also converts nutrients to plant biomass which can sustain bio energy and livelihoods for society wolanski et al 2004 they are engineered wetlands that utilize natural processes associated with natural functions of vegetation sediments organisms and associated microbial communities to treat wastewater through mimicking the natural wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 wang et al 2017 irwin et al 2018 xu and mills 2018 cws are characterized by low cost low energy consumption easy operation and maintenance and high nitrogen n removal efficiency park et al 2018 yan et al 2018 constructed wetland is an eco technological tool which acts as bio filter and can remove high loads of nutrients and heavy metals form the ganga river rai et al 2013 rai et al 2015 in their study along the ganga river at haridwar developed horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetland hssf for trace elements and nutrient removal form urban waste to conserve the ganga river quality they used three aquatic macrophytes such as typha latifolia phragmites australis and colocasia esculenta to study their nutrient and trace element removal potential the trace element removal efficacy of plants was found to be greater in summer as compared to winter it was in order of pb 86 cu 84 01 zn 83 48 as 82 23 cr 81 63 co 76 86 ni 68 14 mn 62 22 during summer on the other hand in winter it was in the order of pb 78 59 cu 72 50 zn 68 40 co 65 12 cr 64 5 as 63 18 mn 53 34 ni 51 39 this study demonstrates that constructed wetland is a sustainable eco technology for treating waste water and consequently improving water quality of the ganga river rai et al 2015 as conventional wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive and need high cost for operation and maintenance cws can be good alternative for wastewater treatment to enhance ganga river water quality 5 4 catchment ponds construction of ponds in the catchment of a river provides an ecohydrological approach to manage river ecosystem small ecosystems such as ponds ditches and wetlands in the landscape are crucial for overall health of larger ecosystem jørgensen 2016 such as river ecosystem ponds are the natural or man made water bodies between 1m2 and 2 ha area which may be temporary or permanent biggs et al 2005 sun et al 2018 water retention is among the most important ecosystem services of ponds fu et al 2018 in human dominated landscapes the capacity of watersheds to regulate floods depends on natural biophysical configuration land cover and topography and technological features e g flood control dams wet and dry ponds mogollón et al 2016 besides regulating floods in the catchment ponds also provide water to rivers during low flow ponds not only create links between existing aquatic habitats but also deliver a range of ecosystem services such as hydrological regulation water supply nutrient retention wildlife protection and research oertli et al 2005 olmo et al 2012 urban ponds perform various ecological functions such as landscape water retention and local climate regulation through mitigating urban heat islands kuprys lipinska et al 2009 wibig 2016 jurczak et al 2018 besides controlling floods in the grb catchment ponds would provide a number of ecosystem services such as fish provision water supply recreation and habitat for aquatic flora and fauna construction of catchment ponds in the ganga basin will manage the ganga river ecosystem through regulating ecology and hydrology 5 5 payment for ecosystem services in payment for ecosystem services pes schemes ecosystem service user or beneficiary offers monetary incentives to the ecosystem service provider sangha et al 2018 for example farmers can be encouraged to use sustainable agricultural practices in riparian field on the offer of economic incentives this approach is important not only for river health but also for strengthening the livelihoods of farmers a pilot project in lake naivasha basin of kenya encouraged 974 farmers to undertake various land management changes for improving downstream water quality and quantity and in turn were rewarded usd 20 000 chiramba et al 2011 wanjala et al 2018 in this project farmers were urged to rehabilitate and maintain riparian zones establish grass strips or terraces on their farms reduce use of fertilizers and pesticides through integrated crop pest management use of new or improved crop varieties practice agroforestry and grow cover crops chiramba et al 2011 wanjala et al 2018 this project was proved a successful attempt in the lake navisha basin as it improved water quality increased livelihoods enhanced soil fertility reduced soil erosion and surface runoff increased forest cover and received massive support from lake naivasha water resources users association chiramba et al 2011 payment for restoring or maintaining ecosystem services creates new opportunities for economic development of watersheds through job creation green economy and new education possibilities tundisi and tundisi 2016 taking lessons from the lake navisha basin project farmers in the ganga river basin can be encouraged to adopt sustainable agricultural practices and to create riparian buffers along their fields on the reward of economic incentives adopting pes approach in the ganga basin will be advantageous for river health farmers and service users 5 6 willingness to pay knowledge about the value that people give to ecosystem services is pivotal for effective management and economic decisions lalika et al 2015 2017 the contingent valuation method cvm is a stated preference survey method which estimates value of an ecosystem by asking people s willingness to pay wtp in a hypothetical scenario to restore or maintain specific ecosystem services nicosia et al 2014 the cvm has been widely used for estimating wtp for various aspects of river ecosystem such river water quality recreation benefits river flow enhancement and river restoration and management halkos and matsiori 2014 va squez and rezende 2018 nallathiga and paravasthu 2010 assessed the economic value of conserving water quality in the river yamuna the largest tributary of the ganga river through applying contingent valuation survey they found that people s wtp for the conservation of river water quality was about 14 93 higher for water quality restoration than that for maintenance of current water quality in the yamuna river nallathiga and paravasthu 2010 alam 2013 alam 2013 used cvm to elicit the people s willingness to contribute wtc both monetarily and with time to the restoration of buriganga river ecosystem in bangladesh information about wtc in terms of time and money is crucial in allocation of public resources planning management and decision making alam 2013 cvm should be utilized to find out the people s wtc in terms of money and time for the ganga river management through a survey in the basin states the ganga basin covers eleven states of india viz uttarakhand himachal pradesh haryana uttar pradesh delhi rajasthan madhya pradesh chhattisgarh jharkhand bihar and west bengal further in these basin states riparian cities and villages can be chosen as sites for designing and implementing a survey to elicit people s wtp 5 7 stakeholder s involvement stakeholder participation plays a crucial role in sustainable watershed and river basin management plans marshall and duram 2017 the european union water framework directive wfd focuses on active public participation in decision making processes for sustainable river basin management euler and heldt 2018 stakeholders perceive their environment differently and have different views of problems and solutions which can support monitoring policy and planning for ecosystem management de groot et al 2014 verbrugge et al 2017 participatory monitoring is important for river management which includes active involvement of local stakeholders for systematic collection of information villasenor et al 2016 verbrugge et al 2017 public participation is a key pillar of the iwrm adequate stakeholders involvement and interactions are increasingly advocated as crucial components for iwrm lennox et al 2011 barbosa et al 2017 public participation has multiple benefits as it resolves the user conflicts builds trust and educates the public about the environment kessler 2004 ker rault and jeffrey 2008 the iwrm comprises four fundamental principles gwp 2000 and among these principles 2 and 3 advocate the stakeholder s involvement in water resource management principle 2 water development and management should be based on a participatory approach involving users planners and policymakers at all levels principle 3 women play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water lack of stakeholder s involvement was one of the major reasons for failure of various schemes and plans of the ganga river for integrated management of the ganga river the active and adequate involvement of stakeholders in the policy planning and management activities is an essential need 5 8 policy and planning policy and planning is the foundation of river management activities ecohydrology plays a critical role in policy and planning of river management comprehensive understanding of ecohydrological principles is a prerequisite for the planning process and the success of projects depends on understanding the linkages between hydrology and ecology hermoso et al 2011 and 2012 dubowy 2013 the connected nature of rivers must be part of freshwater conservation planning ward et al 2002 hermoso et al 2011 hydrological connectivity that is the exchange of matter energy and biota via the aqueous medium sustains riverine landscape diversity ward et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 in a study of ecohydrology of the yellow river delta yrd wetland suggested that ecologists hydrologists social scientists and policymakers should work together to develop a holistic plan maintaining not only the ecological integrity but also the livelihoods of people national water policy of india 2012 advocated several approaches for water management like consideration of river basin as management unit integrated water resource management conservation of river corridors and community participation mjs 2019a the currently ongoing namami gange programme for rejuvenating the ganga considers the grb as a management unit in this programme an attention is given to integrate river ecology and hydrology through afforestation and biodiversity conservation despite these efforts the policy and planning for the ganga river is still facing several challenges like lack of consultation with different stakeholders and absence of integrated approach the ganga river management needs an integrated plan considering not only multiple policies pertaining pollution population urbanization agriculture and industrialization but also the efforts of ecologists hydrologist local people social scientist and policymakers 5 9 public awareness public awareness is an important pillar of the integrated river management upadhyay et al 2011 advocate the awareness for improving water quality in the yamuna river through various activities like information education and communication alam 2013 advocates public awareness and educational programs for sustainability restoration and management of river ecosystem health ignorance is among the major causes of environmental problems noorhosseini et al 2017 the public should be aware of the ongoing problems related to the ganga river ecosystem there are many ways to increase people s awareness of the various issues related to the ganga river such as print media social media cultural activities and campaigns and marches social media platforms books newspaper television and radio play important role to aware people about nature conservation wu et al 2018 many environmental problems are hardly perceived by human senses but media play a vital role in activating perception process arlt et al 2011 media is important to broadcasting the environmental information with accurate knowledge to the general public mikami et al 1995 thus it is important in setting agenda on environmental issues and promoting environmental policies mikami et al 1995 social media is a prominent platform where people can share knowledge views and opinions to manage the ganga river schools are ideal locations to sow the seeds of sustainable behavior in young minds to conserve and manage environment schelly et al 2012 school children can contribute significantly if they are made aware of the issues facing the ganga river promoting awareness and knowledge about various issues of the ganga among students will help in setting the sustainable behavior organization of various events and programmes in schools about river ganga would spread awareness in young minds the government of india is increasing public awareness about the ganga river management by multiple ways like cultural events seminars campaigns exhibitions cleanliness drives competitions and social media nmcg 2019d for example in 2017 the central government organized several awareness activities like painting competition unipole hoardings street plays and mobile vans during char dham yatra of uttarakhand a journey of four pilgrimage sites mjs 2019b in another effort the central government launched ganga tarini a floating museum in varanasi during february 2019 ht 2019 this museum was built on a boat and displayed a film on the various aspects of the ganga river further a cleanliness drive cleanathon was organized by the ministry of jal shakti on 28th june 2019 at eight locations along the yamuna river a tributary of the ganga in delhi jal charcha 2019 the central government also aired a travelogue show rag rag mein ganga aiming to aware people about ecological spiritual and socio economic facets of the river ganga et 2019 although the central government is taking serious steps to raise public awareness but more extensive diverse and creative activities are required to make river ganga cleaning a people s movement 6 conclusions and recommendations the ganga river is the national river of india it is the lifeline of india that sustains more than 500 million people through its various ecosystem services it has been the center of historical cultural ecological and economic activities in india the ganga has high socio cultural economic and ecological significance this most sacred river of india has been the cradle of culture and civilization the ganga is the perennial source of freshwater the ganga plain is the breadbasket of india that underpins agricultural production of country this largest river of india provides habitat for diverse flora and fauna including the endangered ganga dolphin and gharial despite its pivotal significance to the country the ganga river is under severe threat of degradation overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the major drivers of the ganga river threats major threats to this river include flow alteration overexploitation pollution climate change biological invasion and deforestation these threats not only degrade the ganga river health but also the human well being that depends upon the bounties of the ganga river ecosystem services although various initiatives have taken by the government of india but these did not achieve their targets of cleaning the ganga besides the ongoing plans to clean the ganga we need problem solving low cost and nature based solutions in the current scenario of environmental changes an integrated approach is required for the ganga river management in recent years ecohydroloy has emerged as an integrated approach for river management it is an interdisciplinary eco friendly nature based low cost and problem solving science that uses the interactions of hydrology and biota for integrated management of water bodies such as rivers ponds lakes and estuaries it is a science that studies the water biota interplay ecohydrology promotes the integrated water resource management iwrm and utilizes ecological engineering methods for river management establishing riparian buffer strips along the river is a prominent example of ecohydrological approach to sustain river health ecohydrology utilizes ecosystem functions and services of nature to solve the problems of river ecosystems social dimension also plays an important role in the ecohydrological approach authors suggest an integrated approach for managing the mighty ganga integrated ganga river management needs various ecohydrological tools such as sustainable agriculture riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness these ecohydrological tools would not only improve the ganga river health but also the sustainability of ecosystem services and human well being through low cost and nature based solutions a robust policy and planning through active involvement of various stakeholders and public awareness are important pillars for integrated and sustainable management of the ganga river in the current situation of increasing population and economic development in india the ganga river management is a herculean task managing the ganga river is a social religious cultural economic ecological and political issue in india the government s efforts coupled with people s involvement would be a sustainable way for integrated management the following recommendations are proposed for integrated management of the ganga river 1 adoption of the concept of ecohydrology and integrated water resource management iwrm for managing the ganga river ecosystem is a pressing need 2 there is an urgent need to make active cooperation between different stakeholders such as policymakers scientists local people and religious leaders at various levels such as policy making implementation and monitoring of management programme 3 preservation conservation and management of the ganga need an integrated assessment of its ecosystem services at different spatial temporal scales to find their scenario and trend 4 ecohydrology should be part of the flood disaster management to make preparedness strategy and reduce the impacts on people and environment 5 assessment of the impacts of climate change on the ganga river including its hydrology and biodiversity is required for effective and integrated management 6 implementation of the government plans and projects needs coordination not only between the state governments and the central government but also between various ministries departments and implementing bodies 7 integrated management plans for the tributaries of the ganga river are also urgently required 8 integrated management of this important river requires an understanding of the environmental history of the ganga basin 9 the ganga river management plans should consider different dimensions such as geography history ecology policy geology anthropology society culture and economy in the different regions of the ganga basin 10 regular spatial temporal monitoring of river health is necessary for effective implementation of various plans and schemes

1068,the ganga river is the national river of india due to its very high socio cultural economic and ecological significance it forms the largest river basin of india that supports more than 500 million people it has been the cradle of civilization in india since antiquity the northern plain formed by the ganga river system underpins food production in india the ganga basin is the home of rich flora and fauna in the changing environment the ganga river is under the trends of declining health primarily due to anthropogenic activities despite various initiatives by the government of india to rejuvenate and manage this most sacred river of the country the health of the ganga is declining at an alarming rate the absence of stakeholder s involvement and focused on technical solutions have been among the major factors for failure of various initiatives in the current scenario of environmental problems an integrated management of the ganga river is an urgent need we advocate for an ecohydrological approach for integrated management of the ganga river ecohydrology deals with the study of interplay between hydrology and biota it is an interdisciplinary approach that uses the specific tools of hydrology water physics chemistry and ecology which consequently paves the way for integrated water resource management it provides nature based low cost and potential tools for integrated river management through utilizing ecosystem functions of nature ecohydrological practices are the ecological tools that enhance sustainability of river ecosystem and human well being through managing water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience keywords constructed wetlands ecohydrology ecosystem services ganga river riparian buffer strips sustainable agriculture 1 introduction rivers have been paved the way for the development of human civilization sinha and khan 2001 they deliver a range of ecosystem functions and services that sustain biodiversity and human well being rivers underpin biodiversity and deliver various socio economic benefits to human hajkowicz 2006 aura et al 2017 india is endowed by nature with a rich network of rivers that have been sustaining humanity since time immemorial among the various important rivers of india the ganga river is most important river this river has a unique place in the history and civilization of the indian subcontinent and it has been given the status of a national river due to its historical socio cultural economic and geographic reasons moef 2009 das et al 2013 with a length of more than 2500 km the ganga river is the longest river of india the ganga river basin grb is the largest river basin of india the consistent water supply makes the grb a vital ground for sustainability of agricultural population of india anand et al 2018 unanimously the ganga river is the lifeline of india sharma et al 2016 that underpins the agriculture socio culture and biodiversity the perennial freshwater supply in this river delivers a range of ecosystem services that support ecology economy and socio cultural values in india the ganga is most sacred river of india in india people revered this holy river as goddess people believe that bathing in this river will remove all sins the ganga river is the center of various socio cultural activities in india world famous kumbh mela is organized at allahabad officially known as prayagraj and haridwar along the ganga the ganga river system forms one of the world s most fertile and extensive alluvial plains in the northern india indo ganga plain is among the largest alluvial plains of the world and it is one third cultivable land of india that underpins the food security of indian people srivastava et al 2015 the ganga basin is home of diverse flora and fauna river ganga supports various fishes that sustain aquatic ecosystem human livelihood and food security of local people it forms world s largest delta that supports rich biodiversity and delivers a range of ecosystem goods and services like many other large rivers in the world the ganga river is also under severe pressure of anthropogenic activities despite providing a spectrum of ecosystem functions and services the ganga river health is declining at an alarming rate overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are among the major drivers that threaten the sacred ganga through flow alteration overexploitation pollution climate change biological invasion and deforestation however the government of india has taken various initiatives to manage this largest river of country such as the ganga action plan gap constitution of national ganga river basin authority ngrba and namami gange most of the initiatives have failed with a very few achievements namami gange is a recent cleaning mission so its achievements and failures are yet to come few achievements include construction of sewage treatment plants in riparian cities declaration of the ganga as national river and declaration of the gangetic dolphin as the national aquatic animal importance of river ecology was ignored during conception and implementation of the ganga action plan tare et al 2003a non functioning of sewage pumps in the flooded seasons and during power failure and ignoring the involvement of people were among the major causes for the failure of the ganga action plan das 2011 lack of an integrated approach was also a main reason for the failure of the government s initiatives therefore in the current scenario of the ganga river integrated management is an urgent need ecohydrology has emerged as integrated approach to manage the water resources it is based on scientific understanding of the hydrology biota interplay zalewski 2010 it uses the understanding of relationships between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale to achieve water quality improvement biodiversity enhancement and sustainable development erce 2019 for example creating riparian buffer strips is an ecohydrological approach to manage the rivers because there is a dual regulation between riparian vegetation and hydrological regime of a river ecohydrology is an integrative problem solving and cost efficient tool for integrated water resource management zalewski 2014 it provides nature based tools for integrated management of the river basins the main objective of this review article is to present an approach for integrated management of the ganga river we advocated ecohydrological tools for integrated management of the ganga such as sustainable agricultural riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness significance and various threats of river ganga have also been highlighted authors critically analyzed the efforts of government of india taken for river ganga 2 the ganga river a lifeline of india the ganga rises from the gaumukh in the gangotri glacier of the himalayas located in uttarakhand state of india it rises under the name of bhagirathi river the bhagirathi river meets the alaknanda river at dev prayag of uttarakhand and from here the combined flow is known as the ganga river ganga covers a distance of about 2510 km from its source gaumukh to mouth ganga sagar draining eleven states of india nmcg 2019a the mighty ganga along with its tributaries forms largest river basin of india the ganga river basin is extended over four countries namely india china nepal

years in one of four cities of allahabad nashik ujjain and haridwar by rotation david and roy 2016 it is held at the same city after 12 years kumbh mela of allahabad along the confluence of the ganga and the yamuna river is most prominent among all it was estimated that about 120 million devotees and pilgrims had visited the kumbh mela of allahhabd in 2013 which made it largest human gathering in the history cariappa et al 2015 it is believed that the nectar of mortality is present in the waters of river ganga during the kumbh and bathing during this time removes all sins maclean 2009 buzinde et al 2014 2 3 economic significance the economy of india critically depends on the bounties of the sacred ganga this river provides freshwater which sustains agriculture fisheries industries and tourism in india the ganga basin is a land of fertile soil that significantly contributes to the agricultural economies of india and bangladesh kumar 2017 the alluvial plain of this basin is known as bread basket of india culturable area of the ganga basin is about 58 0 m ha which is 29 5 of the total culturable area of india gfcc 2009 misra 2011 indo ganga plain is the land of about half of total food grains production of india that supports the food requirement of 40 of population pal et al 2009 dwivedi et al 2018 various industrial activities utilize the freshwater of the ganga and its tributaries in india several dams are established along the ganga river system to generate hydropower the ganga river is an important source of freshwater fishes that provide food to local people it sustains the livelihood of a large number of fishermen living along its bank vass et al 2010a delta formed by the ganga river supports the growth of sunderban mangrove forest in india and bangladesh it is a home of more than 4 5 million people that directly and indirectly depend on the sunderban ecosystem services wwf 2019 this biodiversity rich ecosystem underpins the sustainable livelihoods of millions of people by providing a range of products like wood honey leaf litter and fodder unesco 2019 the sunderban sustains about 90 of the total natural honey production in india unesco 2019 raw materials of this forest ecosystem sustain the economy of various wood based industries like newsprint mill match factory hardboard factory handicraft industry boat factory and furniture industry datta et al 2011 kumar 2017 fish harvesting in the sunderban underpins the food security and livelihood of fishermen datta et al 2011 the ganga is the backbone of the tourism in the cultural cities such as haridwar allahabad and varanasi haridwar is a prominent pilgrimage site in the foothills of the shiwalik himalayas every year thousands of devotees go there for various rituals including ganga snan bathing in the ganga that provide livelihood to the local people through tourism the kumbh mela at allahabad provides the income source for local people through religious and cultural tourism the prominent riverfronts along the ganga in varanasi attract tourists from all over the world that generate revenue to the government and livelihood to local people 3 threats to the ganga river we have entered the anthropocene a new geological epoch in which human is a dominant factor and altering the natural environment of the earth elosegi et al 2017 fagan 2019 anthropocene refers to the geology of mankind and it describes a shift from the holocene to a time where humans have become a geological force crutzen 2002 heikkurinen et al 2019 worldwide many scientists advocate the onset or acceleration of industrial revolution as the starting point of the anthropocene butler 2018 despite providing a spectrum of benefits the ganga river is unhealthy during the anthropocene it has experienced drastic degradation in water quality and biodiversity the grb was relatively free from anthropogenic activities until the 1940s but it converted into a disposal site for agricultural industrial and sewerage wastes after independence of india in 1947 sinha and khan 2001 increasing population coupled with ill planned urban growth inadequate urban and industrial waste management intensive use of chemical fertilizers deforestation dams and bridge construction fossil fuel consumption floods storms and mass bathing cause severe stress to the ganga river ecosystem singh and singh 2007 sarkar et al 2003 we argue that overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the major drivers that threaten the ganga river ecosystem through flow alteration overexploitation pollution biological invasion climate change and deforestation fig 2 various threats negatively affect the ganga river ecosystem structure functions and services negative impacts on ecosystem structure functions and services not only degrade river health but also reduce human well being 3 1 drivers of threats to the ganga river overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the foremost drivers to various threats of the ganga river fig 3 3 1 1 overpopulation the grb is among the most populated river basins in the world fertile soil availability of freshwater low relief landscape and suitable climate make the ganga plain one of the most densely populated regions of the world singh and awasthi 2011 saxena and singh 2017 the ganga basin is home of about 500 million people which is expected to double by 2030 birol and das 2010 it has a population density of about 600 km2 which is more than india s national population density of 382 km2 census 2011a sawi 2014 tare et al 2017 urbanization and industrialization are paving the way for increasing population in the grb goloub et al 2001 tripathi et al 2005 and in turn increasing population is among the major factors for urbanization industrialization agriculture expansion and pollution in the ganga basin the continuous population rise and consequent water resources development in terms of dams and irrigation canals has affected the river s flow regime which in turn has impacted the water availability water quality and thus the ganga river ecosystem anand et al 2018 the upper ganga canal system and teri dam are examples of big projects that were developed to fulfill the irrigation and energy demand of increasing population acreman et al 2017 densely populated regions dominate water pollution in the ganga basin not only because they contain many people but because their faeces are more efficiently entered to the river system milledge et al 2018 3 1 2 urbanization it is likely that population of india will reach the mark of 1 4 billion by 2025 out of which 42 5 will be urban kaur et al 2013 the ganga basin is most urbanized river basin of india pandey and yadav 2017 it is home of several big cities of india such as delhi ghaziabad faridabad jaipur agra meerut kanpur lucknow prayagraj varanasi patna and kolkata first urbanization of india was emerged in the indus plain during indus valley civilization second urbanization of india was occurred in the ganga plain pokharia et al 2017 urbanization increases the impervious surface cover in the river catchment the impervious surface cover heightens surface runoff and reduces infiltration of precipitation kaye et al 2006 urbanization is among the major causes of deforestation and increasing pollution in the ganga basin twenty nine class i cities population 1 million or above 23 class ii cities population 50 000 to 99 999 and about 50 towns are along the ganga that discharge industrial waste and domestic sewage into the ganga river ecosystem agrawal et al 2010 biswas et al 2015 paul 2017 not only the ganga river but its tributaries are also under huge stress of urbanization delhi located along the yamuna river a tributary of the ganga is second largest city of india with a population of more than 16 million it is one of the largest cities in the world delhi generates huge amount of sewage that through 22 drains enters the yamuna and pollutes it lucknow capital city of uttar pradesh is the eleventh largest urban agglomeration of india with a population of 2902 920 census 2011b it is located at the bank of gomti river which is an important tributary of the ganga this city pollutes the gomti through discharging 450 mld untreated domestic sewage gaur et al 2005 singh et al 2005 agarwal et al 2007 3 1 3 intensive agriculture intensive agriculture has resulted not only deforestation but also river pollution in the grb favorable climatic conditions of the ganga plain harbored rich flora and fauna but deforestation and hunting caused their degradation singh 2004 pokharia et al 2017 intensive agriculture characterized by unsustainable practices is one of the main reasons of deforestation in this fertile plain the ganga alluvial plain is a region of intensive agriculture tyagi et al 2009 bickle et al 2018 the ganga basin has a large network of canals and irrigation channels that play a great role in intensive agricultural production upper ganga canal and lower ganga canal are pivotal for food production in uttar pradesh state most of the farmlands in the ganga basin are intensively cultivated with large scale application of fertilizers pandey and yadav 2017 the agricultural activities in this basin are quite advanced and fertilizer and pesticide consumption is very high trivedi 2010 the grb is under the influence of intensive use of fertilizers and about 115 000 tonnes of fertilizers are washed away through agricultural runoff and enter into the ganga river das 1991 jain 2002 the green revolution in the ganga basin made country independent in terms of food production it enhanced food production through the use of high yielding varieties hyvs chemical fertilizers irrigation and mechanization sapkota et al 2015 after the green revolution people in india in general and the ganga basin in particular adopted modern agricultural practices and switched to monoculture crop production the ongoing agricultural practices in the northwest indo ganga plain nwigp including punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh are not sustainable under current scenario of environmental and agricultural change ladha et al 2009 bhatt et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 rice wheat cropping system rwcs of indo ganga plain igp covers an area of 13 5 million hectares and feeds about 20 of world population saharawat et al 2010 samal et al 2017 rwcs of the igp is not sustainable as it is highly money water and energy intensive samal et al 2017 3 1 4 industrialization the ganga river basin is under huge pressure from industrialization industrial activities are among the major drivers of increasing pollution in river ganga industries discharge untreated effluent into the ganga that deteriorates water quality and thereby negatively affects river biota and human well being leather industries of kanpur significantly contribute to the ganga river pollution kanpur has been a major center of india s tannery industry for more than 100 years do et al 2018 kanpur unnao region is among the largest industrial hubs of the ganga basin where various industries such as tanning and leather industries fertilizers factories textile mills arm factories chemical factories paint factories plastic industries produce a large amount of industrial waste ansari et al 2000 sinha et al 2006 gowd et al 2010 kanpur has 151 tanneries along bank of the ganga that discharge of 5 8 to 8 8 mld wastewater dwivedi et al 2018 mushrooming growth of tannery industries in north india has made this holy river a dumping ground beg and ali 2008 tannery effluent contains toxic heavy metals such as cr zn mn cu and pb deepali and gangwar 2010 dixit et al 2015 dwivedi et al 2018 varanasi has about 5000 registered industries of textile and fabric carpet diesel locomotive works dlw wood leather metal paper products food processing plastic rubber and glass industries dip varanasi dip 2014 pandey et al 2015 due to lack of effluent treatment plants most of these industries discharge their effluents into the drains that open into the ganga industrial centers along the yamuna river also contribute in the pollution load of the ganga delhi ghaziabad noida and faridabad are among the major industrial centers along the yamuna river according to the central pollution control board cpcb about 359 industries directly or indirectly empty their effluents in yamuna mishra 2010 paul 2017 3 2 major threats to the ganga river flow alteration overexploitation pollution biological invasion climate change and deforestation are the major threats to the ganga river 3 2 1 flow alteration a change in flow regime is a major threat to the sustainability of river health and its ecosystem services increasing water extraction for agriculture urban and industrial use has severely altered the hydrology in major river basins of the world molle et al 2010 in the anthropocene the growing demands of food and energy have paved the way for dam construction across the globe gupta et al 2012 the grb is one of the most vulnerable river basins in the world due to the combined effects of climate change and development pressures in terms of dam constructions and urbanization mirza 1998 gain et al 2011 gain and giupponi 2014 alteration of flow regimes in the ganga basin due to large dams negatively affects endangered species such as ganga river dolphin platanista gangetica chaudhary et al 2012 diversion of water for irrigation through canals also reduces the flow of the ganga flow decline in river ganga during non monsoon period is a main problem more than 80 of the annual flow in this river occurs during monsoon that causes widespread flooding khan et al 2014 flow regime is a prime regulator of ecosystem structure functions and services delivered by the river flow reduction promotes for biological invasion for example flow reduction in the ganga river caused the dominance of exotic common carps cyprinus carpio vass et al 2010b gopal 2016 3 2 2 overexploitation freshwater ecosystems such as river ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic demand due to hydropower production recreation irrigation and domestic water supply and industrial use vogl and lopes 2009 sapounidis et al 2017 overexploitation of natural resources such as water fishes and sand from the ganga river is one of the major causes for its degradation high population growth coupled with increasing agricultural demands is creating stress on the water resources and ecosystem of the ganga basin tare et al 2017 over withdrawal of water for irrigation is a serious threat to this largest river of india wong et al 2007 overexploitation of the water for irrigation through various channels and canals alters flow regime the ganga basin is one of the largest multi aquifer groundwater reservoirs of india with depths of more than 2000 m maheswaran et al 2016 groundwater overexploitation mainly for irrigation is a major pressure on the aquifers of the ganga basin in the anthropocene the demand of sand has increased in india due to many factors such as increasing population economic development and urbanization the ganga river bed is a rich source of sand due to continuous erosion in fragile himalayas over extraction of sand from the river bed is among the major causes that change the ganga river health river sand mining not only changes the river morphology but also the state of river flows wang et al 2012 barman et al 2019 and negatively affects river biota riparian ecosystem aesthetics value heritage areas and sustainable livelihood activities like fishing and farming sreebha and padmalal 2011 the biological resources of river ganga such as fishes and riparian vegetation are also under huge pressure of overexploitation 3 2 3 pollution the ganga river is listed among the world s most polluted rivers the main sources of pollution in the ganga river are domestic sewage industrial effluents and agricultural activities dwivedi et al 2018 about 12 000 million liters per day mld of sewage is generated across the ganga basin out of which only 4000 mld can be treated sharmila and arockiarani 2016 pathak et al 2018 major urban regions that generate substantial volume of sewage are kanpur allahabad varanasi patna bhagalpur and kolkata cpcb 2013 besides these the ganga basin cities such as delhi ghaziabad faridabad jaipur meerut agra and lucknow also contribute in the ganga pollution tanning industries of jajmau area of kanpur discharge tons of hazardous untreated waste into the holy ganga dixit et al 2017 tannery effluents are characterized by high concentrations of organics dissolved and suspended solids organic nitrogen ammonia and chromium song et al 2004 vymazal 2014 pulp and paper sugar distilleries and other industries discharging wastewater to the ramganga and the kali rivers are among the major contributors to pollution in the ganga sharmila and arockiarani 2016 pathak et al 2018 about 153 mld of untreated domestic sewage and industrial effluent enter in the ganga at varanasi and degrade its water quality tripathi and tripathi 2011 pandey et al 2014 industrial effluents domestic sewage disposal of dead bodies and agricultural runoff are the major sources of pollution in the ganga corridor of varanasi sikandar 1986 tripathi et al 1991 tributaries of the ganga also contribute a significant role in the ganga river pollution tributaries drain their pollutant load including heavy metals into the already polluted ganga river paul 2017 the yamuna river is among the most polluted tributaries of the ganga river and it meets the ganga at prayagraj in uttar pradesh delhi stretch of the yamuna river is one of the most polluted river stretches in india this yamuna stretch is less than 2 of its total length but receives 71 of its total wastewater load mutiyar and mittal 2014 mutiyar et al 2018 according to a study of central pollution control board cpcb delhi generates 3800 mld of wastewater and out which only 1575 8 mld is treated and 2224 2 mld discharged into the yamuna the hindu 2015 industrial centers such delhi noida faridabad mathura and agra drain a considerable amount of untreated effluent in the yamuna the yamuna river contributes 16 of the total water to the ganga river paul 2017 and consequently the pollution levels of the ganga further increased samson et al 2019 3 2 4 biological invasion biological invasion is a global problem to the freshwater ecosystems it is arrival survival successful reproduction and dispersal of species in an ecosystem where the species did not occur previously carlton 1989 whitfield et al 2002 recently invasive alien species ias have been emerging as the second major threat to global biodiversity after habitat destruction sandilyan and klooster 2016 the biodiversity of the ganga river is severely threatened by invasion of alien species of plant and animals biological invasion of alien species in the ganga river declines not only river health but also the population of local fishes singh et al 2013 cyprinus carpio oreochromis niloticus aristichthys nobilis ctenopharyngodon idella hypophthalmichthys molitrix and clarias gariepinus are some notable alien fish species in the ganga river singh et al 2013 middle stretch of the ganga is highly threatened by the invasive fish species the reduced flow and depth particularly in the middle stretch provides an optimum habitat for the exotic fish species like c carpio and o niloticus das et al 2013 parthenium hysterophorus and eichhornia crassipes are among the most prominent and widespread distributed invasive plants in the ganga river ecosystem parthenium hysterophorus congress grass a weed of the family asteraceae was accidentally introduced in india during the transportation of cereal krishnaveni 2013 it has high fecundity and a single plant can produce 10 000 to 15 000 viable seeds which disperse and germinate to cover large areas patel 2011 parthenium hysterophorus negatively affects native flora in riparian zones of the ganga river eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth is the world s worst aquatic weed khaket et al 2012 it is a floating macrophyte native of the amazon river basin in tropical south america behera et al 2012 ebel et al 2007 it shows high tolerance to extremes of hydrological regimes nutrients availability temperature ph and toxic substances yi et al 2016 water hyacinth is characterized by rapid growth it not only harms native aquatic plants but also deteriorates water quality and consequently impacts public health in a study of shukla et al 1995 water hyacinth collected from the ganga river was found as an important reservoir of toxigenic vibrio cholera and aeromonas spp the occurrence of these pathogenic microorganisms in ganga river is a public health issue as they cause intestinal and extraitenstinal infections shukla et al 1995 this free floating aquatic macrophyte can interfere with the use of water resources through obstructing water flow reducing dissolved oxygen hindering the movement of boats hampering hydropower generation and restricting the discharge capacity of lowland rivers pieterse and murphy 1990 vereecken et al 2006 henry silva et al 2008 3 2 5 climate change climate change is now a global threat to river basins it is projected to cause increase in temperature and alterations to precipitation in most part of the globe and consequently change in the hydrological cycle including flow of rivers kundzewicz et al 2008 ipcc 2014 laize et al 2017 according to the ipcc report there is an estimate of about 1 4 to 6 4 c increase in global temperature by 2100 ipcc 2007 mishra et al 2013 the grb is among the most affected regions of the world by climate change the trends and projections of climate change in the ganga river basin are outlined in the table 1 glacial originated rivers are more threatened to the climate change because glaciers are sensitive to global warming mishra and lilhare 2016 rising global temperature is a major threat to the himalayan glaciers the main sources of the ganga river and its various tributaries are the himalayan glaciers and monsoon rainfall in recent years climate change severely affected these important sources of water the gangotri glacier the source of the ganga is an important glacier of the himalayas in uttarakhand state of india it is under the threat of retreat due to global warming scientific study mirrors that the retreat of the gangotri glacier has speeded since 1780 and from 1936 to 1996 it receded 1 147 km naithani et al 2001 drew 2013 this glacier is retreating about 28 m per year mall et al 2006 in the short term glacier retreat enhances river flow but in long term due to glacier disappearance river flow decline kundzewicz et al 2008 climate change is affecting both rainfall and runoff in the ganga basin in the current scenario of changing climate although numbers of rainy days are increasing in both upper and lower ganga basin but rainfall more than 10 mm day is decreasing shrestha et al 2015 further in total runoff of the ganga basin the share of melt water is decreasing and the share of rainfall runoff is increasing lutz and immerzeel 2013 changing climate is a major threat to the structure functions and services of the ganga river ecosystem and consequently challenging the well being of millions climate change derived extreme temperature and varied rainfall and flow conditions are affecting not only the aquatic biota but also various ecosystem services of the ganga river such as hydrological cycling water purification fishing nutrient cycling recreation and habitat provision tripathi et al 2017 singh and singh 2019 food production in the ganga basin is also under huge stress due to climate change mishra et al 2013 3 2 6 deforestation deforestation is a major threat to the biodiversity and ecosystem services forest loss has made the himalayan watershed more vulnerable to erosion and consequently loss of soil and nutrients siltation of rivers and increase in the frequency and severity of flooding rasul 2014 the grb has been the center of deforestation activities since antiquity the ganga basin is now a threatened ecosystem where 80 of original forest cover has been lost smakhtin et al 2006 sunil et al 2010 the increasing population urbanization agricultural expansion and industrialization have been paved the way for forest loss in the ganga river valley deforestation causes land use and land cover changes lulc in the river basin lulc in the riparian zone critically affects the capacity of rivers to deliver ecosystem functions and services it affects water quality and quantity in the river basins degradation of riparian forests enhances the catchment erosion increased rate of siltation in the downstream of the ganga due to deforestation and soil erosion in the upper ganga catchment have caused degradation of oxbow lakes backwaters and floodplain natarajan 1989 dudgeon 1992 4 government s initiatives for the ganga river management an analysis the government of india has taken several initiatives to rejuvenate and manage the ganga river ecosystem through various plans policies and missions in 1985 the government of india approved the ganga action plan gap the gap was approved with the objectives of reducing the pollution load in the ganga and of establishing sewage treatment systems in 25 class i cities along the river alley 1992 1994 in 1986 the government of india launched ganga action plan gap i to improve the water quality of the river ganga to clean the ganga river 261 schemes were sanctioned under gap phase i out of 261 schemes 88 schemes were related to sewage interception and diversion 35 to sewage treatment 43 to low cost toilets 35 to riverfront development 28 to electric crematoria and 32 to miscellaneous works nrcd 1999 tare et al 2003b later in 1993 the second phase of ganga action plan gap ii was launched with the aim to improve water quality of other polluted rivers and under this plan yamuna and gomati action plans were approved in 1995 it was later extended to the other regulated rivers under the new name of the national river conservation plan nrcp greenstone and hanna 2014 nrcp was aimed to prevent the pollution in major rivers of india including the ganga prime minister of india declared the ganga as the national river on november 4 2008 and decided to constitute the national ganga river basin authority ngrba toi 2009 the ngrba was constituted on february 20 2009 to act as a planning financing monitoring and coordinating body for the ganga river management main objectives of ngrba was to i ensure effective abatement of pollution and conservation of the river ganga by adopting a river basin approach to promote inter sectoral co ordination for comprehensive planning and management and b maintain environmental flows in the river ganga with the aim of ensuring water quality and environmentally sustainable development nmcg 2019b the decision to declare ganga river dolphin platanista gangetica as the national aquatic animal was taken in the first meeting of the national ganga river basin authority the ngrba launched mission clean ganga with proposal for a substantial investment of 15 000 crores of rupees for cleaning the ganga by year of 2020 das 2011 mission clean ganga was aimed to clean the ganga by wastewater management solid waste management reducing industrial pollution and river front development nmcg 2019b major policy initiatives taken under ngrba include city level monitoring committees dolphin conservation involvement of ngrba experts public outreach and awareness involvement of youth ganga knowledge centre water quality monitoring and the ganga river basin management plan grbmp nmcg 2019c namami gange is a recent programme of the government of india for the ganga river management it is a flagship programme launched in 2014 with a budget outlay of rupees 20 000 crore aiming to reduction of pollution conservation and rejuvenation of the ganga nmcg 2019d namami gange is characterized by eight important pillars i sewage treatment infrastructure ii river surface cleaning iii afforestation iv river front development v bio diversity vi public awareness vii industrial effluent monitoring and viii ganga gram a sum of rs 100 crores has been allocated for developments of ghats and beautification of riverfronts at kedarnath haridwar kanpur varanasi prayagraj patna and delhi despite a range of initiatives and efforts by the government of india pollution in the ganga river is increasing day by day dixit et al 2017 several initiates taken by the government of india proved to be failed in achieving their targets of the clean ganga the ganga action plans achieved partial success for example 4704 mld of sewage treatment capacity have been generated since the gap launched moef 2013 do et al 2018 one of the successes of gap is that it made the ganga river pollution a public issue of national importance declaration of the ganga as national river and gangetic dolphin as the national aquatic animal is also a success of the government s initiatives the gap failed due to several factors such as poor policy and planning lack of public support and religious beliefs dixit et al 2017 the aim of the gap was to find the technocratic solutions to enhance water quality and ignored the public participation das and tamminga 2012 according to tare et al 2003a the significance of river ecology has not been addressed copiously during conception and implementation of ganga action plan the government of india has failed to involve people in mission of clean ganga das 2011 moreover the staff involved in implementation of the gap was poor in visionary ideas and changed many times srivastava 2010 intermittent operation of sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment plants has been one of the major factors for gap failure the state governments in india have failed to provide adequate and continuous electricity to energized sewage pumping stations alley 2016 lack of coordination between implementing bodies was also a key reason in the failure of the ganga action plans the nrcp has been criticized for a variety of reasons imbalanced and inadequate funding of sites lack of cooperation among participating agencies and an inability to keep pace with the growth of sewage output in india s cities suresh et al 2007 greenstone and hanna 2014 abatement of non point source pollution to the ganga river was ignored under several schemes non point pollution is notoriously hard to prevent and there is currently no nationwide plan for prevention of such pollution in the river ganga tare et al 2003b although namami gange programme looks comparatively much integrated and diversified but it will be very early to analyse success and failure of this recent program of the ganga rejuvenation in the current scenario of economic development this recent programme faces many challenges to achieve its targets in contradictory and troubling ways ganga s rejuvenation lies alongside the growth agenda promoted by the country s top leaders so the goals for increasing energy generation irrigation and manufacturing and for developing the river as an inland waterway compete with ganga cleanup alley 2016 5 integrated ganga river management through ecohydrological approach integrated water resource management iwrm is a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 iwrm is holistic in nature as it considers river basin as the unit for all planning activities integrates the knowledge from various disciplines and considers the dialogue between stakeholders and decision makers zalewski 2015 ecohydrology is a fundamental component of integrated water management harper et al 2016 it is based on the scientific understanding of hydrology biota interplay and provides a low cost problem solving and systematic framework to utilize ecosystem services of nature as new tool for iwrm zalewski 2010 2015 sohel et al 2015 janauer 2016 it has proved that integrating ecohydrology with new engineering technologies enhances the efficiency of environmental management and reduces the cost of investments in infrastructure wagner and zalewski 2009 establishing riparian buffer zone is a very good example of ecohydrological approach and it improves river water quality through filtering and retaining sediments and pollutants from upland catchment area izydorczyk et al 2013 zalewski 2015 janauer 2016 ecohydrology is a sub discipline of hydrology that focuses on ecological processes occurring within the hydrological cycle and utilizes them to enhance environmental sustainability zalewski 2010 ecohydrological practices are the ecological tools that increase sustainability of river ecosystems and human well being through managing water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience wbsr zalewski 2015 msuya and lalika 2017 ecohydrology is a process oriented approach that aims to regulate water biota interplay for the enhancement of ecosystem potential and its harmonisation with society needs zalewski 2013 it comprises three key principles i hydrological principle ii ecological principle and iii ecological engineering principle zalewski 2015 the hydrological principle implies quantification of hydrological processes at the basin scale and the entire hydrological cycle as a template for quantification of ecological processes ecological principle implies the need for understanding of the evolutionary established water biota interplay and thus quantification of nutrient flows and energy fluxes dynamics at the water cycle and catchment templates defined in the first step finally the ecological engineering principle defines ecosystem properties identified in the framework of the first and the second principles as management tools integration of ecohydrology with iwrm paves the way for coordinated sustainable and holistic management of river basins land and other resources and socio economic development through steady supply of ecosystem services msuya and lalika 2017 for integrated management of the rivers the ecohydrological tools have emerged as the low cost and nature based solution using the multiple dimensions of hydrology ecology and society zalewski 2015 listed several ecohydrological and hydrotechnical measures for conservation and restoration of river basins including shelter belts at agricultural landscape buffer strips biosphere reserve constructed wetlands by pass for fish migration and urban storm water purification worldwide ecohydrological approaches have been used for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes and ponds ecohydrology was used for various issues of danube river basin such as refining of the danube delta monograph wetland restoration navigational improvements flood prevention and habitat improvements jelev and jelev 2012 el sadek et al 2008 advocated ecohydrology as an approach of iwrm in the nile basin they advocated natural ecohydrological process as management tool including riparian buffer wetlands and floodplains el sadek et al 2008 also promoted the inclusion of local people in the water quality management a range of ecohydrological tools were applied in the gumera river basin of ethiopia such as biodegradable geofibres shelterbelts sequential biofiltration system ecotone buffer zones and optimization of fish based aquaculture negussie et al 2011 pacini et al 2018 promoted the protection and restoration of papyrus cyperus papyrus as an ecohydrological tool for restoring ecosystem services in afro tropical wetlands sohel et al 2015 proposed various ecohydrological approaches for ecosystem service provision and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in bangladesh such as creation of vegetated buffer zones implementation of denitrification wall constructed wetlands water management through strip plantation sprinkler and drip irrigation and organic matter application and rice intensification through soil moisture maintenance ecohydrological tools like ecotone zones were successfully used to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in european countries ekorob 2011 izydorczyk et al 2013 zalewski 2015 for example plant buffering zones and biogeochemical and denitrification barriers effectively reduced the phosphorus pollution in zarzęcin poland zalewski 2015 in another project plant buffering zones enhanced with denitrification walls decreased agriculture borne nitrogen pollution in barkowice poland zalewski 2015 the ganga river management is a complex issue of india despite a series of efforts by the government of india this important river is still unhealthy among most of the initiatives the integrity of ganga river ecohydrological issues and socio ecological aspects have been ignored in the current scenario there is a need of integrated approach to manage the ganga river this integrated management will sustain not only the river health but also the well being of people depending on the river ecosystem services integrated management of the ganga river needs an ecohydrological approach that includes multiple dimensions of river basins such as ecology hydrology and people sustainable agriculture riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness are ecohydrological tools that are required for integrated management of the ganga river 5 1 sustainable agriculture intensification of agriculture increases pressures on rivers bączyk et al 2018 the productive ganga plain is under huge pressure of modern and intensive agricultural practices characterized by monocropping and excessive utilization of fertilizers pesticides machinery and water resources in the ganga basin adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is a pressing need to manage river ecosystem sustainable agriculture is based on the economic environmental and social sustainability of the food system heidelberger et al 2017 it is environmentally non degrading technically appropriate economically viable and socially acceptable and conserves natural resources fao 1989 pigford et al 2018 sustainable agriculture conserves land water and plant and animal genetic resources fao 1989 sustainable agriculture practices include a variety of practices such as composting agroforestry cover cropping crop rotation intercropping residue retention drip irrigation no tillage and growing less water crops the switching from water intensive rice crops to water saving maize crop under conservation agriculture based management tillage crop establishment and residue management practices is required for sustainable intensification in the indo ganga plain jat et al 2018 in the ganga basin most of the farmers use flood irrigation that causes a huge loss of precious freshwater adoption of localized irrigation would not only save the water resources of the ganga basin but also improve the health of the ganga localized irrigation systems such as trickle or drip irrigation and micro sprayers irrigate individual plants using plastic pipes that are generally laid on the ground surface chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 drip irrigation is water saving irrigation practice molle and tanouti 2017 that transports water directly to the root zone of plant and enhances water use efficiency and consequently ecological sustainability of food production ward 2014 khor and feike 2017 ertek and yilmaz 2014 recommend the use of purified wastewater in place of freshwater for irrigation and sustainable management of water rainwater harvesting also promotes to sustainable agriculture adenle et al 2019 collecting and utilizing rainwater for irrigation is applied as technology to promote sustainable agriculture in many african countries like burkina faso ethiopia ghana kenya south africa tanzania botswana malawi mali and zimbabwe adenle et al 2019 surface retention of crop residue saves irrigation water through conserving soil water moderating the thermal regime suppressing weeds and enhancing soil health jalota et al 2018 crop residue covers the soil surface and thus reduces soil water evaporation crop rotation refers to the practice of growing a sequence of plant species on the same land yates 1954 bullock 1992 crop rotations with leguminous crops enhance the level of nitrogen in the soil through the process of biological nitrogen fixation giller 2001 thierfelder et al 2012 it enhances soil fertility and thus would reduce the dependence on inorganic fertilizers which are among the major causes of the ganga pollution no tillage nt refers to cultivation with little or no soil surface disturbance the only disturbance being during planting busari et al 2015 nt reduces evaporative loss from upper soil layers maximizes rain infiltration increases soil c and n stocks reduces runoff and minimizes soil loss in runoff bayer et al 2000 hobbs et al 2007 kassam and friedrich 2011 during 2004 2005 the extent of no tillage in the indo gangetic plain was only 1 90 mha while it was 25 30 mha in usa derpsch 2005 hobbs et al 2007 there is need to increase the nt practices to save the not only water but also soil nutrients and soil biodiversity in erosion prone ganga plain intercropping and agroforestry potentially minimize the pressure on water and land resources through enhancing crop yields and resources use efficiency hong et al 2017 intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of more than one crop species in the same field intercropping of legumes with cereals is sustainable practice for nutrient management legume intercropping enhances the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous and thus reduces the external input of inorganic fertilizers singh and singh 2017 inorganic fertilizers are not only the major pollutants of the ganga river but also the source of n2o a greenhouse gas legume intercropping would minimize the inputs of inorganic fertilizers in the ganga plain and consequently reduction in their load in agricultural runoff agroforestry is a land use system in which trees or shrubs are grown in association with agricultural crops pastures or livestock bhattarai et al 2016 agroforestry not only sustains farmers livelihood but also increases agricultural sustainability through enhancing productivity soil organic matter carbon sequestration water retention and biodiversity zomer et al 2016 bhattarai et al 2016 paul et al 2017 singh and singh 2017 this agricultural practice is important for reducing soil erosion river bank erosion and surface runoff bhattarai et al 2016 agroforestry along the river bank reduces the agricultural runoff and thereby sustains the river water quality deforestation of riparian flora in the ganga basin is a major issue in the changing environment in the ganga basin agro ecosystems with forest component are required to enhance farmers livelihood food productivity soil quality and river health 5 2 riparian buffer strips agricultural runoff is one of the major causes of the ganga river pollution riparian buffer strips rbss can mitigate the agricultural pollution through trapping sediments and pollutants riparian buffers strips are the belt of vegetation along the river these are the transitional zone between aquatic system and upland terrestrial system it is widely acknowledged that rbss play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity habitats and water bodies richit et al 2017 riparian buffer strips act as the ecological engineers and regulate river water quality and quantity through a range of ecosystem functions fig 4 rbss provide various ecosystem functions and services through an interaction of water soils and biota vegetation buffer strips deliver a range of ecosystem functions and services such as filtration of sediments and pollutants carbon sequestration temperature regulation nutrient dynamics river bank stabilization habitat for wildlife groundwater recharge flood mitigation recreation and aesthetic value kenwick et al 2009 ramilan et al 2010 choi et al 2012 mcvittie et al 2015 richit et al 2017 establishing rbss is an ecohydrological approach to sustain river health rbss are the best management practices bmps for surface water protection hénault ethier et al 2017 tree planting in riparian area is widely recognized as a way to improve water quality and stream habitat parkyn et al 2005 development and management of riparian buffers is recognized as a sustainable way to control agricultural non point source pollution of stream water and resultant water quality degradation anbumozhi et al 2005 riparian buffer strips have become an integral part of watershed management in american and european landscapes decker 2003 sweeney and blaine 2007 enanga et al 2011 riparian buffer strips are effective in mitigating the nitrate pollution generated by agricultural field hefting and de klein 1998 hefting and de klein 1998 assessed the nitrogen removal potential in riparian buffer strips along the hazelbeek stream of netherlands they found that nitrate concentrations in ground water were higher at the boundary of maize field and riparian forest 40 mg n l and lower close to the stream 0 1 2 mg n l this study estimated that nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased by 95 when it streamed through the riparian buffers creation of rbss the along the ganga river would enhance the water quality and quantity of the river through ecohydrological approach it will provide a cost effective nature based and sustainable solution after creation of riparian buffer along the ganga river little maintenance will be required to assess the effectiveness of rbss to mitigate the nutrient pollution we can compare the properties of soils within riparian buffer strips along different land use types and to reference condition soils in a natural landscape enanga et al 2011 5 3 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws are engineered wastewater treatment systems that treat water through physical chemical and biological processes in the same way that occur in natural wetlands rai et al 2013 construction of wetland is an ecohydrological and sustainable tool that not only traps nutrients and pollutants but also converts nutrients to plant biomass which can sustain bio energy and livelihoods for society wolanski et al 2004 they are engineered wetlands that utilize natural processes associated with natural functions of vegetation sediments organisms and associated microbial communities to treat wastewater through mimicking the natural wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 wang et al 2017 irwin et al 2018 xu and mills 2018 cws are characterized by low cost low energy consumption easy operation and maintenance and high nitrogen n removal efficiency park et al 2018 yan et al 2018 constructed wetland is an eco technological tool which acts as bio filter and can remove high loads of nutrients and heavy metals form the ganga river rai et al 2013 rai et al 2015 in their study along the ganga river at haridwar developed horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetland hssf for trace elements and nutrient removal form urban waste to conserve the ganga river quality they used three aquatic macrophytes such as typha latifolia phragmites australis and colocasia esculenta to study their nutrient and trace element removal potential the trace element removal efficacy of plants was found to be greater in summer as compared to winter it was in order of pb 86 cu 84 01 zn 83 48 as 82 23 cr 81 63 co 76 86 ni 68 14 mn 62 22 during summer on the other hand in winter it was in the order of pb 78 59 cu 72 50 zn 68 40 co 65 12 cr 64 5 as 63 18 mn 53 34 ni 51 39 this study demonstrates that constructed wetland is a sustainable eco technology for treating waste water and consequently improving water quality of the ganga river rai et al 2015 as conventional wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive and need high cost for operation and maintenance cws can be good alternative for wastewater treatment to enhance ganga river water quality 5 4 catchment ponds construction of ponds in the catchment of a river provides an ecohydrological approach to manage river ecosystem small ecosystems such as ponds ditches and wetlands in the landscape are crucial for overall health of larger ecosystem jørgensen 2016 such as river ecosystem ponds are the natural or man made water bodies between 1m2 and 2 ha area which may be temporary or permanent biggs et al 2005 sun et al 2018 water retention is among the most important ecosystem services of ponds fu et al 2018 in human dominated landscapes the capacity of watersheds to regulate floods depends on natural biophysical configuration land cover and topography and technological features e g flood control dams wet and dry ponds mogollón et al 2016 besides regulating floods in the catchment ponds also provide water to rivers during low flow ponds not only create links between existing aquatic habitats but also deliver a range of ecosystem services such as hydrological regulation water supply nutrient retention wildlife protection and research oertli et al 2005 olmo et al 2012 urban ponds perform various ecological functions such as landscape water retention and local climate regulation through mitigating urban heat islands kuprys lipinska et al 2009 wibig 2016 jurczak et al 2018 besides controlling floods in the grb catchment ponds would provide a number of ecosystem services such as fish provision water supply recreation and habitat for aquatic flora and fauna construction of catchment ponds in the ganga basin will manage the ganga river ecosystem through regulating ecology and hydrology 5 5 payment for ecosystem services in payment for ecosystem services pes schemes ecosystem service user or beneficiary offers monetary incentives to the ecosystem service provider sangha et al 2018 for example farmers can be encouraged to use sustainable agricultural practices in riparian field on the offer of economic incentives this approach is important not only for river health but also for strengthening the livelihoods of farmers a pilot project in lake naivasha basin of kenya encouraged 974 farmers to undertake various land management changes for improving downstream water quality and quantity and in turn were rewarded usd 20 000 chiramba et al 2011 wanjala et al 2018 in this project farmers were urged to rehabilitate and maintain riparian zones establish grass strips or terraces on their farms reduce use of fertilizers and pesticides through integrated crop pest management use of new or improved crop varieties practice agroforestry and grow cover crops chiramba et al 2011 wanjala et al 2018 this project was proved a successful attempt in the lake navisha basin as it improved water quality increased livelihoods enhanced soil fertility reduced soil erosion and surface runoff increased forest cover and received massive support from lake naivasha water resources users association chiramba et al 2011 payment for restoring or maintaining ecosystem services creates new opportunities for economic development of watersheds through job creation green economy and new education possibilities tundisi and tundisi 2016 taking lessons from the lake navisha basin project farmers in the ganga river basin can be encouraged to adopt sustainable agricultural practices and to create riparian buffers along their fields on the reward of economic incentives adopting pes approach in the ganga basin will be advantageous for river health farmers and service users 5 6 willingness to pay knowledge about the value that people give to ecosystem services is pivotal for effective management and economic decisions lalika et al 2015 2017 the contingent valuation method cvm is a stated preference survey method which estimates value of an ecosystem by asking people s willingness to pay wtp in a hypothetical scenario to restore or maintain specific ecosystem services nicosia et al 2014 the cvm has been widely used for estimating wtp for various aspects of river ecosystem such river water quality recreation benefits river flow enhancement and river restoration and management halkos and matsiori 2014 va squez and rezende 2018 nallathiga and paravasthu 2010 assessed the economic value of conserving water quality in the river yamuna the largest tributary of the ganga river through applying contingent valuation survey they found that people s wtp for the conservation of river water quality was about 14 93 higher for water quality restoration than that for maintenance of current water quality in the yamuna river nallathiga and paravasthu 2010 alam 2013 alam 2013 used cvm to elicit the people s willingness to contribute wtc both monetarily and with time to the restoration of buriganga river ecosystem in bangladesh information about wtc in terms of time and money is crucial in allocation of public resources planning management and decision making alam 2013 cvm should be utilized to find out the people s wtc in terms of money and time for the ganga river management through a survey in the basin states the ganga basin covers eleven states of india viz uttarakhand himachal pradesh haryana uttar pradesh delhi rajasthan madhya pradesh chhattisgarh jharkhand bihar and west bengal further in these basin states riparian cities and villages can be chosen as sites for designing and implementing a survey to elicit people s wtp 5 7 stakeholder s involvement stakeholder participation plays a crucial role in sustainable watershed and river basin management plans marshall and duram 2017 the european union water framework directive wfd focuses on active public participation in decision making processes for sustainable river basin management euler and heldt 2018 stakeholders perceive their environment differently and have different views of problems and solutions which can support monitoring policy and planning for ecosystem management de groot et al 2014 verbrugge et al 2017 participatory monitoring is important for river management which includes active involvement of local stakeholders for systematic collection of information villasenor et al 2016 verbrugge et al 2017 public participation is a key pillar of the iwrm adequate stakeholders involvement and interactions are increasingly advocated as crucial components for iwrm lennox et al 2011 barbosa et al 2017 public participation has multiple benefits as it resolves the user conflicts builds trust and educates the public about the environment kessler 2004 ker rault and jeffrey 2008 the iwrm comprises four fundamental principles gwp 2000 and among these principles 2 and 3 advocate the stakeholder s involvement in water resource management principle 2 water development and management should be based on a participatory approach involving users planners and policymakers at all levels principle 3 women play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water lack of stakeholder s involvement was one of the major reasons for failure of various schemes and plans of the ganga river for integrated management of the ganga river the active and adequate involvement of stakeholders in the policy planning and management activities is an essential need 5 8 policy and planning policy and planning is the foundation of river management activities ecohydrology plays a critical role in policy and planning of river management comprehensive understanding of ecohydrological principles is a prerequisite for the planning process and the success of projects depends on understanding the linkages between hydrology and ecology hermoso et al 2011 and 2012 dubowy 2013 the connected nature of rivers must be part of freshwater conservation planning ward et al 2002 hermoso et al 2011 hydrological connectivity that is the exchange of matter energy and biota via the aqueous medium sustains riverine landscape diversity ward et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 in a study of ecohydrology of the yellow river delta yrd wetland suggested that ecologists hydrologists social scientists and policymakers should work together to develop a holistic plan maintaining not only the ecological integrity but also the livelihoods of people national water policy of india 2012 advocated several approaches for water management like consideration of river basin as management unit integrated water resource management conservation of river corridors and community participation mjs 2019a the currently ongoing namami gange programme for rejuvenating the ganga considers the grb as a management unit in this programme an attention is given to integrate river ecology and hydrology through afforestation and biodiversity conservation despite these efforts the policy and planning for the ganga river is still facing several challenges like lack of consultation with different stakeholders and absence of integrated approach the ganga river management needs an integrated plan considering not only multiple policies pertaining pollution population urbanization agriculture and industrialization but also the efforts of ecologists hydrologist local people social scientist and policymakers 5 9 public awareness public awareness is an important pillar of the integrated river management upadhyay et al 2011 advocate the awareness for improving water quality in the yamuna river through various activities like information education and communication alam 2013 advocates public awareness and educational programs for sustainability restoration and management of river ecosystem health ignorance is among the major causes of environmental problems noorhosseini et al 2017 the public should be aware of the ongoing problems related to the ganga river ecosystem there are many ways to increase people s awareness of the various issues related to the ganga river such as print media social media cultural activities and campaigns and marches social media platforms books newspaper television and radio play important role to aware people about nature conservation wu et al 2018 many environmental problems are hardly perceived by human senses but media play a vital role in activating perception process arlt et al 2011 media is important to broadcasting the environmental information with accurate knowledge to the general public mikami et al 1995 thus it is important in setting agenda on environmental issues and promoting environmental policies mikami et al 1995 social media is a prominent platform where people can share knowledge views and opinions to manage the ganga river schools are ideal locations to sow the seeds of sustainable behavior in young minds to conserve and manage environment schelly et al 2012 school children can contribute significantly if they are made aware of the issues facing the ganga river promoting awareness and knowledge about various issues of the ganga among students will help in setting the sustainable behavior organization of various events and programmes in schools about river ganga would spread awareness in young minds the government of india is increasing public awareness about the ganga river management by multiple ways like cultural events seminars campaigns exhibitions cleanliness drives competitions and social media nmcg 2019d for example in 2017 the central government organized several awareness activities like painting competition unipole hoardings street plays and mobile vans during char dham yatra of uttarakhand a journey of four pilgrimage sites mjs 2019b in another effort the central government launched ganga tarini a floating museum in varanasi during february 2019 ht 2019 this museum was built on a boat and displayed a film on the various aspects of the ganga river further a cleanliness drive cleanathon was organized by the ministry of jal shakti on 28th june 2019 at eight locations along the yamuna river a tributary of the ganga in delhi jal charcha 2019 the central government also aired a travelogue show rag rag mein ganga aiming to aware people about ecological spiritual and socio economic facets of the river ganga et 2019 although the central government is taking serious steps to raise public awareness but more extensive diverse and creative activities are required to make river ganga cleaning a people s movement 6 conclusions and recommendations the ganga river is the national river of india it is the lifeline of india that sustains more than 500 million people through its various ecosystem services it has been the center of historical cultural ecological and economic activities in india the ganga has high socio cultural economic and ecological significance this most sacred river of india has been the cradle of culture and civilization the ganga is the perennial source of freshwater the ganga plain is the breadbasket of india that underpins agricultural production of country this largest river of india provides habitat for diverse flora and fauna including the endangered ganga dolphin and gharial despite its pivotal significance to the country the ganga river is under severe threat of degradation overpopulation urbanization intensive agriculture and industrialization are the major drivers of the ganga river threats major threats to this river include flow alteration overexploitation pollution climate change biological invasion and deforestation these threats not only degrade the ganga river health but also the human well being that depends upon the bounties of the ganga river ecosystem services although various initiatives have taken by the government of india but these did not achieve their targets of cleaning the ganga besides the ongoing plans to clean the ganga we need problem solving low cost and nature based solutions in the current scenario of environmental changes an integrated approach is required for the ganga river management in recent years ecohydroloy has emerged as an integrated approach for river management it is an interdisciplinary eco friendly nature based low cost and problem solving science that uses the interactions of hydrology and biota for integrated management of water bodies such as rivers ponds lakes and estuaries it is a science that studies the water biota interplay ecohydrology promotes the integrated water resource management iwrm and utilizes ecological engineering methods for river management establishing riparian buffer strips along the river is a prominent example of ecohydrological approach to sustain river health ecohydrology utilizes ecosystem functions and services of nature to solve the problems of river ecosystems social dimension also plays an important role in the ecohydrological approach authors suggest an integrated approach for managing the mighty ganga integrated ganga river management needs various ecohydrological tools such as sustainable agriculture riparian buffer strips constructed wetlands catchment ponds payment for ecosystem services willingness to pay stakeholder s involvement policy and planning and public awareness these ecohydrological tools would not only improve the ganga river health but also the sustainability of ecosystem services and human well being through low cost and nature based solutions a robust policy and planning through active involvement of various stakeholders and public awareness are important pillars for integrated and sustainable management of the ganga river in the current situation of increasing population and economic development in india the ganga river management is a herculean task managing the ganga river is a social religious cultural economic ecological and political issue in india the government s efforts coupled with people s involvement would be a sustainable way for integrated management the following recommendations are proposed for integrated management of the ganga river 1 adoption of the concept of ecohydrology and integrated water resource management iwrm for managing the ganga river ecosystem is a pressing need 2 there is an urgent need to make active cooperation between different stakeholders such as policymakers scientists local people and religious leaders at various levels such as policy making implementation and monitoring of management programme 3 preservation conservation and management of the ganga need an integrated assessment of its ecosystem services at different spatial temporal scales to find their scenario and trend 4 ecohydrology should be part of the flood disaster management to make preparedness strategy and reduce the impacts on people and environment 5 assessment of the impacts of climate change on the ganga river including its hydrology and biodiversity is required for effective and integrated management 6 implementation of the government plans and projects needs coordination not only between the state governments and the central government but also between various ministries departments and implementing bodies 7 integrated management plans for the tributaries of the ganga river are also urgently required 8 integrated management of this important river requires an understanding of the environmental history of the ganga basin 9 the ganga river management plans should consider different dimensions such as geography history ecology policy geology anthropology society culture and economy in the different regions of the ganga basin 10 regular spatial temporal monitoring of river health is necessary for effective implementation of various plans and schemes

1069,a two year experimental study on saline groundwater dynamics in the paraguayan dry chaco is reported this study was designed to better understand dryland salinity as a natural phenomenon and a potential consequence of land use changes in order to avoid adverse economic and environmental impacts a total of 28 wells at two study sites located nearby loma plata were monitored approximately every two weeks for groundwater conductivity and water table level following transects from sown pasture to native forest and topographic gradients from bush or pasture to a nearby temporarily flooded lagoon results show a relation among topography land cover precipitation groundwater salinity and surface salinization under pasture groundwater was less saline in the average and the water table was slightly higher than under adjacent forest under forest infiltrating rainwater never reached groundwater level whereas under pasture rainwater diluted the groundwater at several occasions during the observation period along the topographic gradients there was a fringe prone to surface salinization along the borderline of the lagoon at higher topographic levels the saline ground water was low enough to not reach the surface by capillary ascension on the other hand high water table in the center of the lagoon fed by inflowing rainwaters which had a slightly higher altitude level than the water table under adjacent land covers displaced the saline groundwater vertically and horizontally these findings provide information for land use planning in the region which is prone to dryland salinity due to a generally high saline water table keywords dryland salinity saline groundwater dry chaco ecoregion 1 introduction water is vital to satisfy both human needs production and to maintain ecosystem functions despite this fundamental role there is a high probability that water resources are among the most limited during this century due among other factors to the continued growing world population and the increase in demand for fresh and potable water gottle and sène 1997 heathcote 2009 jewitt 2002 oki and kanae 2006 ostfeld et al 2012 water availability and quality are also threatened around the world not only because of their scarcity in some regions but also because of inadequate management high levels of pollution and degradation of ecosystems le polain de waroux et al 2018 ostfeld et al 2012 boer and radersma 2011 peters and meybeck 2000 rengasamy 2006 water pollution poses significant threat to marginal populations particularly in countries where water balance is negative or where dry conditions prevail marchesini et al 2017 nelson and chomitz 2006 vorbsmarty et al 2000 water quality not only depends on the management of its distribution and health in the cities but also on the management measures taken at their sources of origin in addition to measures which should accompany the development of cities at the urban level it is necessary to consider that what happens at the rural level and in the catchments as well as the rainfall pattern and water infiltration do have a great influence on the availability and quality of this resource laino et al 2016 from this perspective the practices of adequate soil management and conservation are closely related to the improvement of the water supply both in its quality and in its quantity and justify the approach of the human activities being integrated with ecosystems and abiotic factors particularly in the areas of water catchment runoff infiltration and groundwater recharge cotler ávalos 2004 dourojeanni and nelson 1987 heathcote 2009 the hydrological cycle is the movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back again most salts are highly soluble so water is key to the movement of salts in the landscape podmore 2009 even though soluble salts are inherent in all soils there are many processes that can contribute to the build up of salts in a given soil layer boer and radersma 2011 soil salinization defined as the accumulation above a certain level of water soluble salts within soil layers can lead to undesirable effects on the ground surface limiting production and altering ecosystems functionality williams 1999 soil salinity is described and characterized in terms of the concentration and composition of soluble salts evaporation agricultural activities historical depositions fresh water extraction soil mineral weathering and pollution can lead to salinization of soil and groundwater boer and radersma 2011 these factors combined with climatic hydrological geological as well as groundwater depth and salinity vegetation cover and human influences determine where salinization occurs williams 1999 salinization commonly causes damages when saline groundwater reaches the soil surface by capillary ascension podmore 2009 dryland salinity is strongly dependent on saline groundwater dynamics along landscape profiles williams and chartres 1991 and land use cover has shown to have a direct impact although not necessarily the predominant one on the depth of the water table peck and williamso 1987 smerdon et al 2009 thus land use change could eventually modify vulnerability to salinization all soil types can be affected by salinization marchesini et al 2017 rengasamy 2006 salinization is a phenomenon that can have an important impact on ecology and productivity williams 1999 ecohydrological transformation in the dry chaco and the risk of dryland salinity has been studied and warned of by few studies marchesini et al 2017 magliano et al 2016 however these studies focus on the argentinean dry chaco and not the paraguayan while much attention has been paid to coastal areas cardona et al 2004 carol et al 2009 giménez and morell 1997 and to some of the world s most populated areas prone to salinization such as in some regions of australia gordon et al 2003 ruprecht and schofield 1991 and china wang et al 2008 wu et al 2014 the semi arid chaco especially in its paraguayan portion still remains understudied or studied but unpublished even though some studies have focused on the benefits of land use planning to maintain connectivity torrella et al 2018 or others have analysed bird conservation macchi et al 2016 in agricultural landscapes in the dry chaco few have focused on studying salinization as a land use planning tool understanding saline groundwater and salinization dynamics and the effects of land use and land cover is crucial to prevent damage and decide on proper agricultural and livestock activities allowing for sustainable production the challenge to find grazing systems that are sustainable is shown to lie in recognizing that ecosystems must be studied in an integrated way not focusing only on short term animal productivity without considering all other ecosystem essential components williams and chartres 1991 this study aims to provide insights of the relation among water fluxes soil cover and salinization in areas dedicated to livestock production in the paraguayan dry chaco 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area is located in a 900 mm rainfall region considered part of the semi arid or dry paraguayan chaco it is located within a belt of some 500 km length and some 50 to 75 km width extending from northeast to southwest right across the paraguayan chaco from general diaz to bahia negra which is particularly prone to dryland salinity due to a high saline groundwater table vogt 2016 the gran chaco is a semiarid to subhumid mostly plain ecoregion extending from north argentina over the western part of paraguay to south east bolivia alluvial sediments from the andes mountains are the parent materials of the soils with increasing distance from the andes soil texture gets finer typical soil types are luvisols solonetz regosols and gleysols there is only a tiny gradient in altitude from northeast to southwest over hundreds of kilometers and therefore little aboveground or belowground external drainage salts derived from soil weathering accumulate in the saline groundwater which can reach extremely high salinity conductivity levels up to 60 ds m the climate is a subtropical with summer dominant rainfall with an annual precipitation range from 400 northwest to 1100 southeast mm magliano et al 2015 and a potential evaporation of 1300 1500 mm year le polain de waroux et al 2018 the paraguayan chaco is limited by the rivers paraguay and pilcomayo to the east and southwest and by sand dunes fixed by vegetation in the northwest two study sites campo maria and campo bello located east of the city of loma plata in the presidente hayes department were selected fig 1 2 2 land cover we identified types of land cover for both study sites 1 forest 2 pasture 3 fringe and 4 lagoon for campo maria and 1 forest and 2 pasture for campo bello the forest is native and contains acacia praecox cercidium praecox bulnesia sarmientoi ziziphus mistol prosopis alba prosopis nigra ruprechtia triflora capparis tweediana tabebuia nodosa ceiba insignis aspidosperma quebracho blanco capparis salicifolia capparis retusa selenicereus grandiflorus and prosopis kuntzei the pasture was planted and sown with pangola digitaria eriantha and panicum maximum cv gatton after deforestation one year before the experiment the saline fringe about 10 15 m wide along the edge of the lagoon represents the transition landscape between the unplanted and temporarily flooded lagoon area and the adjacent vegetation native forest or planted pasture at higher topographic levels salt tolerant vegetation such as salincornia sp lycium sp maytenus sp opuntia sp sporobolus pyramidatus and prosopis ruscifolia is found in the saline fringe area the lagoon is covered by native grasses tolerant of waterlogging such as leersia hexandra hemarthria altissima eriochloa montevidensis the lagoon is temporarily covered by stagnant water an overview of the area with the observational wells spread over the line crossing different land covers in campo maria and campo bello is available in fig 2 2 3 observational wells in campo maria 21 observational wells were spread every 10 cm difference in surface level along the topographic gradients from the lagoon to the forest or sown pasture or on the same topographic level contour line concerning the transect line pasture to forest wells 8 15 along transects with a total length of some 250 m covering or crossing forest pasture saline fringe and lagoon fig 2 left in campo bello located 20 km away from the first study site 7 similar tubes were placed in a forest and pasture land cover 10 m apart from each other fig 2 right tubes used for the experiment were made of pvc material with a 75 mm diameter fig 3 they were placed between 2 and 4 m deep up to about 1 m deeper than the water table during the dry season these tubes were perforated to allow lateral exchange of groundwater at any level except for the first 40 cm under the surface to prevent entrance of direct rainfall the tubes were equipped with a geotextile layer to let groundwater in and keep sediments out 3 data analysis data was collected from july 2002 until november 2004 75 of the measurements were made in campo maria 21 wells and 25 in campo bello 7 wells the measurements were made under similar conditions in both locations except from the sand fraction in both soils the higher sand concentration makes infiltration a little easier in campo bello measurements of precipitation water table and electric conductivity as an indirect measure of total dissolved salts were collected every two weeks accumulated rainfall was expressed in mm water table in m amsl meters above mean sea level and electric conductivity in ds m deci siemens per meter comparison tests tukey with a 95 probability were carried out with infostat statistical package di rienzo et al 2013 4 results and discussion the highest groundwater conductivity values were found under forest land cover followed by pasture fringe and lagoon in campo maria fig 4 left above in the same way in campo bello the conductivity under forest was higher than under pasture fig 4 left below according to the classification of martens and wichmann 2007 only groundwater under the lagoon is considered brackish while the rest is considered saline in both campo maria and campo bello the groundwater conductivity descends during rainy season october to march and ascends during dry season april to september however this variation of conductivity depends very much on the land cover under forest land cover conductivity is far more stable and usually highest under forest rainwater rarely campo maria or never campo bello reached and diluted the groundwater in any significant extent therefore groundwater was almost consistently kept at relatively high salinity levels all over the year these results are congruent with a study carried out in the argentinian arid chaco magliano et al 2016 where the groundwater 0 75 2 m depth under forest presented more chlorides than the groundwater under the pasture these values were expected because the forest presents higher rainwater canopy interception lower runoff and higher foliar transpiration rates hence the replacement vegetation e g pasture usually uses less water than forest and therefore more water percolates through the profile past the root zone williams and chartres 1991 according to magliano et al 2016 the forest uses 20 more rainwater for transpiration than the pastures for this reason rainwater under forest rarely infiltrates to the groundwater and the salt content does not dilute there trees deep rooted perennials and native vegetation use most of the water that enters the soil resulting in reduced leakage past the plant root zone podmore 2009 under pasture and the fringe after significant precipitation events rainwater infiltrated up to the groundwater and diluted considerably its salt content fig 4 right raising at the same time the water table at such events surface water runoff with very low conductivity levels gathers in the lagoon on the other hand conductivity under forest land cover is generally the highest and is far more stable during the year due to very little rainwater infiltration than under the other cover types water table acts like a more or less regular underground pool which means that all groundwater is connected on a bigger scale fig 5 shows the mean water table the minimum and maximum values measured during the study period in each well in campo maria left and campo bello right due to its low topographic position in the landscape the lagoon allows runoff rainwater to accumulate temporarily diluting the groundwater there and keeping it at a higher mean altitude than under adjacent land cover types this creates a gradient of groundwater altitude and potential groundwater flow from the lagoon the lowest point at the surface to the forest and or pasture highest points at the surface as shown in fig 5 left the occurrence of the saline fringe around the lagoon could be explained by capillary ascension of salt up to the surface indicating and ideal mean depth of saline groundwater for this phenomenon to take place in both campo maria and campo bello saline groundwater was diluted under pasture after abundant precipitations due to rainwater infiltration this did not occur under forest fig 4 right however although no rainwater infiltrated up to the groundwater the water table under forest also was lifted when rainwater reached and diluted the groundwater under the adjacent pasture along the same contour line as shown in fig 6 right this can be explained by the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the additional water that had reached the water table under pasture therefore there was only a small however insignificant difference in water table in both study sites between pasture and forest fig 6 left there is no significant difference in average water table between pasture and fringe in campo maria which can be explained by the hydrostatic pressure balance sought by the interconnected groundwater pool average water table is the highest in the lagoon in campo maria fig 6 left even though there is only 30 cm difference between the lowest forest and the highest lagoon water table this difference is statistically significant fig 6 left as a consequence accumulated rainwater in the lagoon might displace somewhat adjacent groundwater vertically and horizontally exerting a hydrostatic pressure due to its higher altitude for the same reason if there was any groundwater flow it cannot occur from adjacent areas forest pasture towards the lagoon but rather the opposite direction this research represents the first attempt to understand the groundwater dynamics soil cover and salinization in the paraguayan dry chaco however overall salinization studies marchesini et al 2017 magliano et al 2016 tend to have longer periods of measurements and can involve more observational wells compared to this study this highlights the need to invest more effort in continuous measurements and for longer periods of time in addition campo maria and campo bello represent only a small portion of a bigger region considered prone to salinization in the dry chaco due to a relatively high saline water table the belt spreading across the paraguayan chaco from general diaz to bahia negra is approximatively 50 to 75 km wide and 500 km long vogt 2016 another point to keep in mind is that in this study we considered the type of land cover not the level of grazing several years ago jackson et al 1956 found in south australia that different salt concentrations in the soil surface resulted from varying groundwater depths and its different salinities and they also suggested that soil surface salinization is likely to occur in some temporarily waterlogged soils under heavy grazing in the same way lavado and taboada 1987 observed that salinity was less in the soil of the ungrazed areas than in that of the grazed areas in the flooded pampa of argentina which could be related to different degrees of soil compaction we expect that this paper will be the basis of further research vetting our conclusions using longer sampling periods and larger experimental areas 5 conclusions this study shows considerable interdependencies among topography land cover precipitation groundwater depth and salinity and surface salinization groundwater under native forest showed consistently the highest levels of conductivity followed by pasture fringe and lagoon this indicates that forest plays an important role in reducing rainfall infiltration and in keeping the saline water table at a safe distance thus reducing vulnerability to surface salinization this study confirms the need to preserve forest curtains around lagoons these will help to keep saline groundwater at a lower level and reduce the risk of capillary ascension of groundwater and therefore of dryland salinity beyond the natural saline fringe this good practice is considered an important effective and meanwhile widely accepted land use planning tool for the chaco of paraguay in order to reduce salinization vulnerability conflict of interest authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in

1069,a two year experimental study on saline groundwater dynamics in the paraguayan dry chaco is reported this study was designed to better understand dryland salinity as a natural phenomenon and a potential consequence of land use changes in order to avoid adverse economic and environmental impacts a total of 28 wells at two study sites located nearby loma plata were monitored approximately every two weeks for groundwater conductivity and water table level following transects from sown pasture to native forest and topographic gradients from bush or pasture to a nearby temporarily flooded lagoon results show a relation among topography land cover precipitation groundwater salinity and surface salinization under pasture groundwater was less saline in the average and the water table was slightly higher than under adjacent forest under forest infiltrating rainwater never reached groundwater level whereas under pasture rainwater diluted the groundwater at several occasions during the observation period along the topographic gradients there was a fringe prone to surface salinization along the borderline of the lagoon at higher topographic levels the saline ground water was low enough to not reach the surface by capillary ascension on the other hand high water table in the center of the lagoon fed by inflowing rainwaters which had a slightly higher altitude level than the water table under adjacent land covers displaced the saline groundwater vertically and horizontally these findings provide information for land use planning in the region which is prone to dryland salinity due to a generally high saline water table keywords dryland salinity saline groundwater dry chaco ecoregion 1 introduction water is vital to satisfy both human needs production and to maintain ecosystem functions despite this fundamental role there is a high probability that water resources are among the most limited during this century due among other factors to the continued growing world population and the increase in demand for fresh and potable water gottle and sène 1997 heathcote 2009 jewitt 2002 oki and kanae 2006 ostfeld et al 2012 water availability and quality are also threatened around the world not only because of their scarcity in some regions but also because of inadequate management high levels of pollution and degradation of ecosystems le polain de waroux et al 2018 ostfeld et al 2012 boer and radersma 2011 peters and meybeck 2000 rengasamy 2006 water pollution poses significant threat to marginal populations particularly in countries where water balance is negative or where dry conditions prevail marchesini et al 2017 nelson and chomitz 2006 vorbsmarty et al 2000 water quality not only depends on the management of its distribution and health in the cities but also on the management measures taken at their sources of origin in addition to measures which should accompany the development of cities at the urban level it is necessary to consider that what happens at the rural level and in the catchments as well as the rainfall pattern and water infiltration do have a great influence on the availability and quality of this resource laino et al 2016 from this perspective the practices of adequate soil management and conservation are closely related to the improvement of the water supply both in its quality and in its quantity and justify the approach of the human activities being integrated with ecosystems and abiotic factors particularly in the areas of water catchment runoff infiltration and groundwater recharge cotler ávalos 2004 dourojeanni and nelson 1987 heathcote 2009 the hydrological cycle is the movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back again most salts are highly soluble so water is key to the movement of salts in the landscape podmore 2009 even though soluble salts are inherent in all soils there are many processes that can contribute to the build up of salts in a given soil layer boer and radersma 2011 soil salinization defined as the accumulation above a certain level of water soluble salts within soil layers can lead to undesirable effects on the ground surface limiting production and altering ecosystems functionality williams 1999 soil salinity is described and characterized in terms of the concentration and composition of soluble salts evaporation agricultural activities historical depositions fresh water extraction soil mineral weathering and pollution can lead to salinization of soil and groundwater boer and radersma 2011 these factors combined with climatic hydrological geological as well as groundwater depth and salinity vegetation cover and human influences determine where salinization occurs williams 1999 salinization commonly causes damages when saline groundwater reaches the soil surface by capillary ascension podmore 2009 dryland salinity is strongly dependent on saline groundwater dynamics along landscape profiles williams and chartres 1991 and land use cover has shown to have a direct impact although not necessarily the predominant one on the depth of the water table peck and williamso 1987 smerdon et al 2009 thus land use change could eventually modify vulnerability to salinization all soil types can be affected by salinization marchesini et al 2017 rengasamy 2006 salinization is a phenomenon that can have an important impact on ecology and productivity williams 1999 ecohydrological transformation in the dry chaco and the risk of dryland salinity has been studied and warned of by few studies marchesini et al 2017 magliano et al 2016 however these studies focus on the argentinean dry chaco and not the paraguayan while much attention has been paid to coastal areas cardona et al 2004 carol et al 2009 giménez and morell 1997 and to some of the world s most populated areas prone to salinization such as in some regions of australia gordon et al 2003 ruprecht and schofield 1991 and china wang et al 2008 wu et al 2014 the semi arid chaco especially in its paraguayan portion still remains understudied or studied but unpublished even though some studies have focused on the benefits of land use planning to maintain connectivity torrella et al 2018 or others have analysed bird conservation macchi et al 2016 in agricultural landscapes in the dry chaco few have focused on studying salinization as a land use planning tool understanding saline groundwater and salinization dynamics and the effects of land use and land cover is crucial to prevent damage and decide on proper agricultural and livestock activities allowing for sustainable production the challenge to find grazing systems that are sustainable is shown to lie in recognizing that ecosystems must be studied in an integrated way not focusing only on short term animal productivity without considering all other ecosystem essential components williams and chartres 1991 this study aims to provide insights of the relation among water fluxes soil cover and salinization in areas dedicated to livestock production in the paraguayan dry chaco 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area is located in a 900 mm rainfall region considered part of the semi arid or dry paraguayan chaco it is located within a belt of some 500 km length and some 50 to 75 km width extending from northeast to southwest right across the paraguayan chaco from general diaz to bahia negra which is particularly prone to dryland salinity due to a high saline groundwater table vogt 2016 the gran chaco is a semiarid to subhumid mostly plain ecoregion extending from north argentina over the western part of paraguay to south east bolivia alluvial sediments from the andes mountains are the parent materials of the soils with increasing distance from the andes soil texture gets finer typical soil types are luvisols solonetz regosols and gleysols there is only a tiny gradient in altitude from northeast to southwest over hundreds of kilometers and therefore little aboveground or belowground external drainage salts derived from soil weathering accumulate in the saline groundwater which can reach extremely high salinity conductivity levels up to 60 ds m the climate is a subtropical with summer dominant rainfall with an annual precipitation range from 400 northwest to 1100 southeast mm magliano et al 2015 and a potential evaporation of 1300 1500 mm year le polain de waroux et al 2018 the paraguayan chaco is limited by the rivers paraguay and pilcomayo to the east and southwest and by sand dunes fixed by vegetation in the northwest two study sites campo maria and campo bello located east of the city of loma plata in the presidente hayes department were selected fig 1 2 2 land cover we identified types of land cover for both study sites 1 forest 2 pasture 3 fringe and 4 lagoon for campo maria and 1 forest and 2 pasture for campo bello the forest is native and contains acacia praecox cercidium praecox bulnesia sarmientoi ziziphus mistol prosopis alba prosopis nigra ruprechtia triflora capparis tweediana tabebuia nodosa ceiba insignis aspidosperma quebracho blanco capparis salicifolia capparis retusa selenicereus grandiflorus and prosopis kuntzei the pasture was planted and sown with pangola digitaria eriantha and panicum maximum cv gatton after deforestation one year before the experiment the saline fringe about 10 15 m wide along the edge of the lagoon represents the transition landscape between the unplanted and temporarily flooded lagoon area and the adjacent vegetation native forest or planted pasture at higher topographic levels salt tolerant vegetation such as salincornia sp lycium sp maytenus sp opuntia sp sporobolus pyramidatus and prosopis ruscifolia is found in the saline fringe area the lagoon is covered by native grasses tolerant of waterlogging such as leersia hexandra hemarthria altissima eriochloa montevidensis the lagoon is temporarily covered by stagnant water an overview
