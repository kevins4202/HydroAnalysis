19105,the uv peracetic acid uv paa process as a novel advanced oxidation process has been reported to produce carbon centered radicals rc for naproxen nap degradation which is a representative of naphthyl structure substances real water matrices such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions co3 2 hco3 humic acid ha and chloride ion cl may react with these reactive radicals and change their contributions to nap degradation the results showed that rc contributed 60 8 and oh contributed 39 2 to nap degradation in pure water by a competition method co3 2 hco3 0 20 mm showed minimal effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process meanwhile it has observable inhibition effect on nap degradation in the uv h2o2 process mainly of oh and minimal effect in the uv paa process with tert butanol tba mainly of rc results suggested that co3 2 hco3 could react with oh yielding co3 with low reactivity to nap co3 could further react with paa to produce rc this speculation was confirmed by the increased contribution of rc to nap degradation with the increase of co3 2 hco3 concentration through the competition method ha 0 5 mg l had a higher scavenging capacity for rc than oh because ha with naphthyl structure was likely to be attacked by rc cl 0 200 mm had little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa and uv h2o2 processes while exerted an observable inhibition on nap degradation in the uv paa process with tba this finding suggested that cl could react with rc to produce cl which could further convert into hocl and then excess oh was formed the new knowledge on the conversion of reactive radicals obtained in this study provides an important basis for facilitating further research on the uv paa advanced oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv peracetic acid process

combined with paa i e uv paa because many types of reactive radicals are produced in this advanced oxidation process aop caretti et al 2003 koivunen et al 2005 lubello et al 2002 rokhina et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 eqs 1 7 paa exhibits high quantum yields namely φ254nm 1 20 and 2 09 mol e 1 for neutral paa0 and anionic paa species respectively cai et al 2017 compared with the uv h2o2 process that mainly produces oh uv paa process can also generate carbon centered radicals rc which has been demonstrated structural selectivity to certain naphthyl compounds such as naproxen nap and 2 naphthoxyacetic acid 2 napp cai et al 2017 therefore uv paa can be used to degrade certain naphthyl compounds selectively previous studies have revealed the contributions of different reactive

co3 with several typical organic compounds are slower than so4 and oh luo et al 2015 ha can inhibit the degradation of micro pollutants in two ways the first one is that ha has large absorbance thus it exerts an inner filter effect on oxidant photolysis the second one is that ha acts as the scavenger of radicals luo et al 2015 shi et al 2017 cl has negative effects on uv hso5 and uv s2o8 2

of water matrices on rc in the uv paa process have received little attention in this study nap was selected to be the target compound for two reasons first nap has a naphthyl structure and thus can be selectively degraded by rc in the uv paa process cai et al 2017 second nap is frequently detected in aquatic environments madikizela et al 2016 and presents a growing concern over its adverse ecological and health effects du et al 2018 the objectives of the current study were i to re evaluate the contributions of reactive species in pure water by a competition method ii to investigate the effects of water matrices co3 2 hco3 ha and cl on nap degradation and the conversion of reactive radicals in the uv paa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials h2o2 30 w w solution

japan ha was purchased from the international humic substances society suwannee river humic acid standard iii termed as ha was dissolved in naoh solution filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c the ha concentration was determined by toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytic jena germany and then calibrated to the required concentration 0 5 g l all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water upw from a water purification system cascada tm ls 2 2 preparation and determination of paa paa was generated by the reaction between h2o2 30 w w and ch3co2h 97 w w eq 8 8 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 2 h c h 3 c o 3 h h 2 o the obtained paa solution was stored at 4 c and titration method was applied to achieve regular calibration first the sum of paa and h2o2 concentrations was measured by iodometric titration method ammonium molybdate was used as a catalyst and potassium iodide was added to produce liberated iodine second the liberated iodine was titrated by sodium thiosulfate then the concentration of h2o2 in the paa solution was measured by potassium permanganate titration method take the same volume of stock solution as the previous paragraph and 2 mol l h2so4 was added to endow the solution with acidic ph by using mnso4 as a catalyst finally h2o2 concentration was subtracted from the sum of paa and h2o2 concentrations and the result was the paa concentration in the stock solution zhang et al 2017 the paa solution was diluted to the required concentration before the degradation experiments 2 3 uv instrument degradation experiments were conducted in a cylindrical quartz reactor about 100 ml under magnetic stirring uv irradiation was supplied by four uv lamps at 254 nm from the top of the reactor heraeus gph 212t5l 4 10 w in a photo chamber at room temperature 25 c before the experiments the lamp was preheated for at least 30 min to keep the light stable the effective light path length l was measured to be 4 cm the incident light intensity i0 was obtained as 9 04 10 8 e l s through the potassium ferrioxalate actinometry method harris et al 1987 2 4 degradation experiments the specific steps of the degradation experiments were as follows firstly the reaction solution was placed in the quartz reactor with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 to initiate the reaction 20 mg l of the paa solution or 14 mg l of the h2o2 solution was added to the reactor the molar concentration of the h2o2 solution was equal to the sum of the molar concentration of paa and h2o2 in the paa solution then 4 μm nap acted as a target degradation compound was added to the reactor the reactor was placed in the photo chamber under magnetic stirring every 2 min 1 5 ml of the sample was taken out and placed in brown vials excess ascorbic acid c 6 h 8 o 6 paa 0 5 was added to quench the oxidants and terminate the reaction all experiments were performed in triplicate the effects of water matrices on nap degradation were conducted in the uv paa process in this process rc and oh both play important roles to nap degradation cai et al 2017 in order to investigate the effects of water matrices on oh uv h2o2 process was also conducted to degrade nap 10 mm tba was added to uv paa process to separate rc from oh so the effects of water matrices on rc was obtained in some experiments 4 μm pcba was added to uv paa process to acquire the effects of water matrices on the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation by the competition method details see section 3 1 the effect of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation was evaluated at various co3 2 hco3 concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mm the effect of ha on nap degradation was evaluated at different ha concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mg l the effect of cl at 0 200 mm on nap degradation was determined 2 5 analysis of nap and pcba concentrations the concentrations of nap and pcba were determined with an agilent 1100 series hplc outfitted with a poroshell 120 ec c18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm agilent usa column temperature was maintained at 25 c when the two substances were measured the mobile phase used in the analysis of nap concentration composited with 40 methanol 5 acetonitrile and 55 acetic acid 0 002 vol the column flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 231 nm cai et al 2017 the mobile phase for pcba concentration analysis composited with 25 methanol 20 acetonitrile and 55 acetic acid 0 002 vol the column flow rate was set to 0 5 ml min and the detection wavelength was 250 nm liu et al 2015 the injection volume was 20 μl at each time 3 results and discussion 3 1 contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process as shown in fig 1 a individual uv and paa could hardly degrade nap suggesting that contributions of direct photolysis and paa oxidation to nap degradation could be ignored however nap was degraded rapidly in the uv paa process and nap degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with k obs of 0 110 min 1 eq 9 this was ascribed to the formation of rc and oh during uv photolysis of paa cai et al 2017 to explored the contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process two methods were applied in this study 1 tba with an excess dosage can scavenge oh but has no effect on rc oxidation cai et al 2017 excess tba was added in the uv paa process to separate rc and oh and this method is called scavenging assay in the presence of 10 mm tba the observed rate constant k obs c of nap degradation via rc oxidation was determined be 0 047 min 1 then the apparent rate k obs oh of nap degradation via oh oxidation could be obtained by eq 10 i e 0 110 0 047 0 063 min 1 therefore the contribution of rc and oh was calculated by k obs c k obs and k obs oh k obs be 42 and 58 respectively fig 1 2 comparatively a new competitive method was used to re evaluate the contributions of reactive radicals generally pcba usually acts as a oh probe compound in aops liu et al 2015 however 4 μm of pcba was hardly degraded in 30 min during the uv paa process in the presence of tba suggesting that pcba could not be oxidized by rc using this oh probe the steady state concentration of oh oh ss in the uv paa process was obtained through the competitive degradation of pcba eq 11 contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process could be calculated by eqs 9 12 9 k o b s ln n a p n a p 0 t 10 k o b s k o b s o h k o b s c 11 ln p c b a p c b a 0 k 1 o h s s d t 12 ln n a p n a p 0 k 2 o h s s d t k 3 c s s d t where k 1 and k 2 are the second order rate constants for reactions of oh with pcba and nap k 1 5 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 k 2 8 99 109 m 1s 1 huber et al 2005 and k 3 is the second order rate constant for the reaction of rc with nap k obs k obs oh k obs c are the observed rate constants of nap degradation by uv paa process oh oxidation and r c oxidation respectively k obs oh can be calculated by eqs 11 and 12 then k obs c can be calculated as k obs k obs oh competitive degradations of pcba and nap in the uv paa process were shown in fig 1 b the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation as calculated by the competition method were shown in fig 1 rc contributed 60 8 to nap degradation and the value is relatively higher than that obtained by the scavenging assay 60 8 vs 42 this result may be ascribed to the fact that the contribution of the reaction of paa and oh to form rc eq 4 termed as propagation reaction was neglected when excess tba completely scavenged oh in the scavenge assay liu et al 2015 the second order rate constants for reactions of oh with paa0 and paa are large at about 9 33 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 9 97 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively cai et al 2017 thus disregarding this reaction might lead to the underestimation of the contribution of rc in this situation the competitive method which does not interrupt the propagation reaction was suggested to be utilized to reflect the actual situation 3 2 effects of different water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process 3 2 1 effects of co3 2 hco3 the effects of different concentrations of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation in the uv paa process were examined and the results are given in fig 2 a and d co3 2 hco3 0 20 mm had minimal effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process the effects of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation by oh in the uv h2o2 process are shown in fig 2 b and d it can be found that the k obs of nap degradation decreased from 0 127 min 1 to 0 071 min 1 with increasing co3 2 hco3 concentration from 0 mm to 20 mm detailed data of k obs were given in si table s2 it was well known that co3 2 hco3 could scavenge oh thus yielding co3 eqs 13 and 14 k oh hco3 is 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and k oh co32 is 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2015 buxton et al 1988 these reactions and the decreased k obs of nap degradation suggested that the reactivity of co3 to nap is lower than that of oh to examine the effect of co3 2 hco3 on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to uv paa process to quench oh as shown in fig 2 c and d the k obs of nap degradation maintained 0 515 min 1 at 0 20 mm of co3 2 hco3 this result suggested that co3 2 hco3 could not scavenge rc it was interesting to note that the inhibition effect of co3 2 hco3 on oh oxidation was also not observed in the uv paa process including both rc and oh oxidation this result implied that co3 with low reactivity to nap might further react with paa to produce some reactive radicals which were effective for nap degradation rc with high reactivity to nap was inferred to be the formed radical eq 15 so the generated rc reacting with nap complemented the decreased rate of nap degradation due to consumption of oh thus it can be estimated that the second order rate of rc with nap is similar to oh 9 0 109 m 1s 1 and the second order rate constant of co3 and paa was estimated to be 8 50 106 m 1s 1 the calculation equations were given in si text s1 in other words oh was transformed into rc via sequence reactions in the uv paa process when co3 2 hco3 existed eqs 13 15 13 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 14 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 15 c o 3 c h 3 c o 3 h c h 3 c o 3 h c o 3 the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation at different co3 2 hco3 concentrations in the uv paa process were calculated by the competitive method to further verify the speculation as shown in fig 3 a the k obs of pcba degradation decreased from 0 03 min 1 to 0 02 min 1 with increasing co3 2 hco3 concentration from 0 mm to 20 mm in the uv paa process the k obs of nap degradation maintained at 0 12 min 1 it could be calculated that the contribution of oh decreased from 44 58 to 29 62 and the contribution of rc increased from 55 42 to 70 38 eqs 9 12 fig 3 b the increased contribution of rc confirmed the views of oh transformed to rc 3 2 2 effects of ha the effects of different concentrations of ha on nap degradation in uv paa and uv h2o2 processes were examined and the results were presented in fig 4 a ha 0 5 mg l showed similar inhibiting effect on nap degradation in the uv paa and uv h2o2 processes ha may lead to the decrease of micro pollutant degradation in uv based aops because of two factors first ha can compete with oxidants for photon absorption and affects oxidant photolysis the molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm of ha εha 0 3 l mg 1 cm 1 obtained in this work second ha can scavenge radicals and reduce the steady state concentration of radicals in the system luo et al 2015 shi et al 2017 it has been reported that ha can scavenge oh with a second order rate constant of 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 to examine the effect of ha on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to the uv paa process to quench oh as shown in fig 4 b 1 mg l of ha could almost inhibit nap degradation suggesting that ha at this concentration could almost scavenge rc to further explore the scavenging capability of ha to rc the ha concentration was reduced to 0 1 mg l and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b it was found that k obs of nap degradation decreased from 0 041 min 1 to 0 006 min 1 in the uv paa tba process i e rc oxidation system detailed data of k obs were given in si table s2 on the basis of the steady state assumption the formation rate of rc eq 16 is equal to the consumption rate of rc eq 19 thus the steady state concentration of rc can be obtained by eq 20 fig 5 a indicates that the nap oxidized by rc followed pseudo first order kinetics in the uv paa tba process so k obs c can thus be described as eq 21 which can be further expressed as eq 22 by using eq 20 16 r c ϕ p a a 0 f p a a 0 ϕ p a a f p a a i 0 1 e a 17 f p a a 0 ε p a a 0 p a a 0 0 ε n a p n a p 0 ε p a a 0 p a a 0 0 ε p a a p a a 0 ε h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 0 ε h a h a 0 18 f p a a ε p

quantum yields of paa0 and paa photolysis at 254 nm a represents the solution absorbance at 254 nm ε p a a 0 ε p a a ε h 2 o 2 and ε n a p are the molar absorption coefficients of paa0 paa h2o2 nap at 254 nm m 1 cm 1 respectively i0 is the incident light intensity 9 04 10 8 e l s k c ha and k c nap are the second order rate constants for the reactions of rc with ha and nap nap 0 is the initial concentration of nap 4 μm and ha 0 is the initial concentration of ha finally k c ha was obtained to be 5 76 104 l mg 1 s 1 which represents the scavenging capacity of rc by ha and it is higher than the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh with ha i e 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 this suggest ha showed higher scavenging rate to rc than oh and it could be ascribed to the fact that ha with naphthyl structure is likely to be attacked by rc furthermore the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation at different ha concentrations 0 1 mg l in the uv paa process were calculated using the competitive method as shown in fig 6 a the k obs of pcba degradation decreased from 0 0256 min 1 to 0 0192 min 1 and the k obs of nap degradation declined from 0 1193 min 1 to 0 0512 min 1 with increasing ha concentration from 0 mg l to 1 mg l in the uv paa process fig 6 b shows that the calculated contribution of oh increased from 38 58 to 67 43 and the contribution of rc decreased from 61 42 to 32 58 when ha was 1 mg l rc still contributed 30 to nap degradation but in the scavenging assay 1 mg l ha could almost scavenge rc similarly this difference was also ascribed to the fact that the contribution of the reaction of paa and oh to form rc eq 4 was disregarded in the experiment of excess tba scavenging oh liu et al 2015 cai et al 2017 thus the contribution of rc was overlooked in the scavenging assay when the ha concentration was 1 mg l 3 2 3 effects of cl the effects of different concentrations of cl on nap degradation in the uv paa process were examined and the results are given in fig 7 a and d cl 0 200 mm had little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process the effects of cl on nap degradation in the uv h2o2 process are shown in fig 7 b and d it was found that cl has little effect on nap degradation in the uv h2o2 process because the reaction of oh and cl to form hocl is reversible eq 25 luo et al 2015 to examine the effect of cl on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to the uv paa process to quench oh the results in fig 7 c and d show that k obs decreased from 0 05 min 1 to 0 0185 min 1 with increasing cl concentration from 0 mm to 200 mm in the uv paa tba process detailed data of k obs were given in si table s3 this finding suggests that cl could scavenge rc yielding cl with low reactivity to nap eq 23 however the inhibition effect of cl on rc was not observed in the uv paa process which implied cl transformed to other radicals with high reactivity to nap in the uv paa process as described in eq 24 in neutral solution ph 7 0 the rate constant of cl consumption reaction 2 5 1012 s 1 is much higher than the reverse reaction 2 1 103 s 1 thereby making cl preferring to turn into hocl in eq 25 the rate constant of hocl dissociation reaction is higher than the reverse so hocl preferring to dissociate to form oh according to eqs 23 25 cl formed via the reaction of rc with cl was further converted into hocl then hocl dissociated and more oh was formed in other words rc was converted to oh in the uv paa process when cl existed 23 c h 3 c o 3 c l h c l c h 3 c o 3 h 24 c l h 2 o h o c l h 25 h o c l o h c l furthermore the contributions of oh and rc at different cl concentrations to nap degradation in the uv paa process were calculated using the competitive method as shown in fig 8 b oh contributed 31 42 and rc contributed 58 69 to nap degradation with increasing cl concentration from 0 mm to 200 mm in the uv paa process oh contribution had no obvious increased trend as inferred in the previous paragraph the reason could be described as follows when rc was converted into oh via reactions 23 25 the concentration of oh increased and more oh was scavenged by paa to form rc to sum up a series of cyclic reactions formed between oh and rc in the uv paa process when cl existed 3 3 proposed influencing mechanism of water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process overall the influencing mechanism of water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process could be proposed in fig 9 when co3 2 hco3 existed in the water co3 2 hco3 could scavenge oh thus yielding co3 with low reactivity to nap which might further react with paa to produce rc in other words oh was transformed into rc when co3 2 hco3 existed in the uv paa process rc is effective for nap degradation with 2nd order rate constants about 9 00 109 m 1s 1 similar to the second order rate constants of oh with nap so co3 2 hco3 has little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process when ha existed in the water ha could scavenge oh and rc and its scavenging capacity for rc was higher than that for oh k c ha 6 23 104 and k oh ha 3 5 104 when cl existed in the water cl could react with rc yielding cl which was further converted into hocl then hocl dissociated and more oh was formed the increased oh was scavenged by paa to form rc in other words rc was transformed into oh when cl existed in the uv paa process so cl has little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process 4 conclusion in this study the contributions of different reactive radicals to nap degradation in pure water in the uv paa process was re evaluated by a competition method and the results showed that rc contributed 60 8 and oh contributed 39 2 the effects of water matrices co3 2 hco3 ha and cl on nap degradation in the uv paa process were investigated it was found that co3 2 hco3 and cl had minimal effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process because of the conversions of different reactive radicals through a series of cyclic reactions however ha exerted observable inhibition on nap degradation because the naphthyl structure of ha is likely to be attacked by rc declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

processes because it can react with radicals e g oh and so4 to form less reactive inorganic radicals e g cl2 cloh and cl luo et al 2015 klaning and wolff 1985 grigorev et al 1987 however the effects of water matrices on rc in the uv paa process have received little attention in this study nap was selected to be the target compound for two reasons first nap has a naphthyl structure and thus can be selectively degraded by rc in the uv paa process cai et al 2017 second nap is frequently detected in aquatic environments madikizela et al 2016 and presents a growing concern over its adverse ecological and health effects du et al 2018 the objectives of the current study were i to re evaluate the contributions of reactive species in pure water by a competition method ii to investigate the effects of water matrices co3 2 hco3 ha and cl on nap degradation and the conversion of reactive radicals in the uv paa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials h2o2 30 w w solution ch3cooh 97 w w nap 99 purity sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 were obtained from sigma aldrich para chlorobenzoic acid pcba 99 purity and tert butanol tba were obtained from fisher scientific hampton nh usa acetonitrile and methanol were of hplc grade j t baker inc usa sulfuric acid h2so4 manganese sulfate mnso4 and ammonium molybdate were purchased from nacalai tesque kyoto japan ha was purchased from the international humic substances society suwannee river humic acid standard iii termed as ha was dissolved in naoh solution filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c the ha concentration was determined by toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytic jena germany and then calibrated to the required concentration 0 5 g l all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water upw from a water purification system cascada tm ls 2 2 preparation and determination of paa paa was generated by the reaction between h2o2 30 w w and ch3co2h 97 w w eq 8 8 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 2 h c h 3 c o 3 h h 2 o the obtained paa solution was stored at 4 c and titration method was applied to achieve regular calibration first the sum of paa and h2o2 concentrations was measured by iodometric titration method ammonium molybdate was used as a catalyst and potassium iodide was added to produce liberated iodine second the liberated iodine was titrated by sodium thiosulfate then the concentration of h2o2 in the paa solution was measured by potassium permanganate titration method take the same volume of stock solution as the previous paragraph and 2 mol l h2so4 was added to endow the solution with acidic ph by using mnso4 as a catalyst finally h2o2 concentration was subtracted from the sum of paa and h2o2 concentrations and the result was the paa concentration in the stock solution zhang et al 2017 the paa solution was diluted to the required concentration before the degradation experiments 2 3 uv instrument degradation experiments were conducted in a cylindrical quartz reactor about 100 ml under magnetic stirring uv irradiation was supplied by four uv lamps at 254 nm from the top of the reactor heraeus gph 212t5l 4 10 w in a photo chamber at room temperature 25 c before the experiments the lamp was preheated for at least 30 min to keep the light stable the effective light path length l was measured to be 4 cm the incident light intensity i0 was obtained as 9 04 10 8 e l s through the potassium ferrioxalate actinometry method harris et al 1987 2 4 degradation experiments the specific steps of the degradation experiments were as follows firstly the reaction solution was placed in the quartz reactor with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 to initiate the reaction 20 mg l of the paa solution or 14 mg l of the h2o2 solution was added to the reactor the molar concentration of the h2o2 solution was equal to the sum of the molar concentration of paa and h2o2 in the paa solution then 4 μm nap acted as a target degradation compound was added to the reactor the reactor was placed in the photo chamber under magnetic stirring every 2 min 1 5 ml of the sample was taken out and placed in brown vials excess ascorbic acid c 6 h 8 o 6 paa 0 5 was added to quench the oxidants and terminate the reaction all experiments were performed in triplicate the effects of water matrices on nap degradation were conducted in the uv paa process in this process rc and oh both play important roles to nap degradation cai et al 2017 in order to investigate the effects of water matrices on oh uv h2o2 process was also conducted to degrade nap 10 mm tba was added to uv paa process to separate rc from oh so the effects of water matrices on rc was obtained in some experiments 4 μm pcba was added to uv paa process to acquire the effects of water matrices on the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation by the competition method details see section 3 1 the effect of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation was evaluated at various co3 2 hco3 concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mm the effect of ha on nap degradation was evaluated at different ha concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mg l the effect of cl at 0 200 mm on nap degradation was determined 2 5 analysis of nap and pcba concentrations the concentrations of nap and pcba were determined with an agilent 1100 series hplc outfitted with a poroshell 120 ec c18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm agilent usa column temperature was maintained at 25 c when the two substances were measured the mobile phase used in the analysis of nap concentration composited with 40 methanol 5 acetonitrile and 55 acetic acid 0 002 vol the column flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 231 nm cai et al 2017 the mobile phase for pcba concentration analysis composited with 25 methanol 20 acetonitrile and 55 acetic acid 0 002 vol the column flow rate was set to 0 5 ml min and the detection wavelength was 250 nm liu et al 2015 the injection volume was 20 μl at each time 3 results and discussion 3 1 contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process as shown in fig 1 a individual uv and paa could hardly degrade nap suggesting that contributions of direct photolysis and paa oxidation to nap degradation could be ignored however nap was degraded rapidly in the uv paa process and nap degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with k obs of 0 110 min 1 eq 9 this was ascribed to the formation of rc and oh during uv photolysis of paa cai et al 2017 to explored the contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process two methods were applied in this study 1 tba with an excess dosage can scavenge oh but has no effect on rc oxidation cai et al 2017 excess tba was added in the uv paa process to separate rc and oh and this method is called scavenging assay in the presence of 10 mm tba the observed rate constant k obs c of nap degradation via rc oxidation was determined be 0 047 min 1 then the apparent rate k obs oh of nap degradation via oh oxidation could be obtained by eq 10 i e 0 110 0 047 0 063 min 1 therefore the contribution of rc and oh was calculated by k obs c k obs and k obs oh k obs be 42 and 58 respectively fig 1 2 comparatively a new competitive method was used to re evaluate the contributions of reactive radicals generally pcba usually acts as a oh probe compound in aops liu et al 2015 however 4 μm of pcba was hardly degraded in 30 min during the uv paa process in the presence of tba suggesting that pcba could not be oxidized by rc using this oh probe the steady state concentration of oh oh ss in the uv paa process was obtained through the competitive degradation of pcba eq 11 contributions of reactive radicals to nap degradation in the uv paa process could be calculated by eqs 9 12 9 k o b s ln n a p n a p 0 t 10 k o b s k o b s o h k o b s c 11 ln p c b a p c b a 0 k 1 o h s s d t 12 ln n a p n a p 0 k 2 o h s s d t k 3 c s s d t where k 1 and k 2 are the second order rate constants for reactions of oh with pcba and nap k 1 5 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 k 2 8 99 109 m 1s 1 huber et al 2005 and k 3 is the second order rate constant for the reaction of rc with nap k obs k obs oh k obs c are the observed rate constants of nap degradation by uv paa process oh oxidation and r c oxidation respectively k obs oh can be calculated by eqs 11 and 12 then k obs c can be calculated as k obs k obs oh competitive degradations of pcba and nap in the uv paa process were shown in fig 1 b the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation as calculated by the competition method were shown in fig 1 rc contributed 60 8 to nap degradation and the value is relatively higher than that obtained by the scavenging assay 60 8 vs 42 this result may be ascribed to the fact that the contribution of the reaction of paa and oh to form rc eq 4 termed as propagation reaction was neglected when excess tba completely scavenged oh in the scavenge assay liu et al 2015 the second order rate constants for reactions of oh with paa0 and paa are large at about 9 33 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 9 97 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively cai et al 2017 thus disregarding this reaction might lead to the underestimation of the contribution of rc in this situation the competitive method which does not interrupt the propagation reaction was suggested to be utilized to reflect the actual situation 3 2 effects of different water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process 3 2 1 effects of co3 2 hco3 the effects of different concentrations of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation in the uv paa process were examined and the results are given in fig 2 a and d co3 2 hco3 0 20 mm had minimal effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process the effects of co3 2 hco3 on nap degradation by oh in the uv h2o2 process are shown in fig 2 b and d it can be found that the k obs of nap degradation decreased from 0 127 min 1 to 0 071 min 1 with increasing co3 2 hco3 concentration from 0 mm to 20 mm detailed data of k obs were given in si table s2 it was well known that co3 2 hco3 could scavenge oh thus yielding co3 eqs 13 and 14 k oh hco3 is 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and k oh co32 is 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2015 buxton et al 1988 these reactions and the decreased k obs of nap degradation suggested that the reactivity of co3 to nap is lower than that of oh to examine the effect of co3 2 hco3 on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to uv paa process to quench oh as shown in fig 2 c and d the k obs of nap degradation maintained 0 515 min 1 at 0 20 mm of co3 2 hco3 this result suggested that co3 2 hco3 could not scavenge rc it was interesting to note that the inhibition effect of co3 2 hco3 on oh oxidation was also not observed in the uv paa process including both rc and oh oxidation this result implied that co3 with low reactivity to nap might further react with paa to produce some reactive radicals which were effective for nap degradation rc with high reactivity to nap was inferred to be the formed radical eq 15 so the generated rc reacting with nap complemented the decreased rate of nap degradation due to consumption of oh thus it can be estimated that the second order rate of rc with nap is similar to oh 9 0 109 m 1s 1 and the second order rate constant of co3 and paa was estimated to be 8 50 106 m 1s 1 the calculation equations were given in si text s1 in other words oh was transformed into rc via sequence reactions in the uv paa process when co3 2 hco3 existed eqs 13 15 13 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 14 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 15 c o 3 c h 3 c o 3 h c h 3 c o 3 h c o 3 the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation at different co3 2 hco3 concentrations in the uv paa process were calculated by the competitive method to further verify the speculation as shown in fig 3 a the k obs of pcba degradation decreased from 0 03 min 1 to 0 02 min 1 with increasing co3 2 hco3 concentration from 0 mm to 20 mm in the uv paa process the k obs of nap degradation maintained at 0 12 min 1 it could be calculated that the contribution of oh decreased from 44 58 to 29 62 and the contribution of rc increased from 55 42 to 70 38 eqs 9 12 fig 3 b the increased contribution of rc confirmed the views of oh transformed to rc 3 2 2 effects of ha the effects of different concentrations of ha on nap degradation in uv paa and uv h2o2 processes were examined and the results were presented in fig 4 a ha 0 5 mg l showed similar inhibiting effect on nap degradation in the uv paa and uv h2o2 processes ha may lead to the decrease of micro pollutant degradation in uv based aops because of two factors first ha can compete with oxidants for photon absorption and affects oxidant photolysis the molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm of ha εha 0 3 l mg 1 cm 1 obtained in this work second ha can scavenge radicals and reduce the steady state concentration of radicals in the system luo et al 2015 shi et al 2017 it has been reported that ha can scavenge oh with a second order rate constant of 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 to examine the effect of ha on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to the uv paa process to quench oh as shown in fig 4 b 1 mg l of ha could almost inhibit nap degradation suggesting that ha at this concentration could almost scavenge rc to further explore the scavenging capability of ha to rc the ha concentration was reduced to 0 1 mg l and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b it was found that k obs of nap degradation decreased from 0 041 min 1 to 0 006 min 1 in the uv paa tba process i e rc oxidation system detailed data of k obs were given in si table s2 on the basis of the steady state assumption the formation rate of rc eq 16 is equal to the consumption rate of rc eq 19 thus the steady state concentration of rc can be obtained by eq 20 fig 5 a indicates that the nap oxidized by rc followed pseudo first order kinetics in the uv paa tba process so k obs c can thus be described as eq 21 which can be further expressed as eq 22 by using eq 20 16 r c ϕ p a a 0 f p a a 0 ϕ p a a f p a a i 0 1 e a 17 f p a a 0 ε p a a 0 p a a 0 0 ε n a p n a p 0 ε p a a 0 p a a 0 0 ε p a a p a a 0 ε h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 0 ε h a h a 0 18 f p a a ε p

quantum yields of paa0 and paa photolysis at 254 nm a represents the solution absorbance at 254 nm ε p a a 0 ε p a a ε h 2 o 2 and ε n a p are the molar absorption coefficients of paa0 paa h2o2 nap at 254 nm m 1 cm 1 respectively i0 is the incident light intensity 9 04 10 8 e l s k c ha and k c nap are the second order rate constants for the reactions of rc with ha and nap nap 0 is the initial concentration of nap 4 μm and ha 0 is the initial concentration of ha finally k c ha was obtained to be 5 76 104 l mg 1 s 1 which represents the scavenging capacity of rc by ha and it is higher than the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh with ha i e 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 this suggest ha showed higher scavenging rate to rc than oh and it could be ascribed to the fact that ha with naphthyl structure is likely to be attacked by rc furthermore the contributions of oh and rc to nap degradation at different ha concentrations 0 1 mg l in the uv paa process were calculated using the competitive method as shown in fig 6 a the k obs of pcba degradation decreased from 0 0256 min 1 to 0 0192 min 1 and the k obs of nap degradation declined from 0 1193 min 1 to 0 0512 min 1 with increasing ha concentration from 0 mg l to 1 mg l in the uv paa process fig 6 b shows that the calculated contribution of oh increased from 38 58 to 67 43 and the contribution of rc decreased from 61 42 to 32 58 when ha was 1 mg l rc still contributed 30 to nap degradation but in the scavenging assay 1 mg l ha could almost scavenge rc similarly this difference was also ascribed to the fact that the contribution of the reaction of paa and oh to form rc eq 4 was disregarded in the experiment of excess tba scavenging oh liu et al 2015 cai et al 2017 thus the contribution of rc was overlooked in the scavenging assay when the ha concentration was 1 mg l 3 2 3 effects of cl the effects of different concentrations of cl on nap degradation in the uv paa process were examined and the results are given in fig 7 a and d cl 0 200 mm had little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process the effects of cl on nap degradation in the uv h2o2 process are shown in fig 7 b and d it was found that cl has little effect on nap degradation in the uv h2o2 process because the reaction of oh and cl to form hocl is reversible eq 25 luo et al 2015 to examine the effect of cl on rc oxidation 10 mm tba was added to the uv paa process to quench oh the results in fig 7 c and d show that k obs decreased from 0 05 min 1 to 0 0185 min 1 with increasing cl concentration from 0 mm to 200 mm in the uv paa tba process detailed data of k obs were given in si table s3 this finding suggests that cl could scavenge rc yielding cl with low reactivity to nap eq 23 however the inhibition effect of cl on rc was not observed in the uv paa process which implied cl transformed to other radicals with high reactivity to nap in the uv paa process as described in eq 24 in neutral solution ph 7 0 the rate constant of cl consumption reaction 2 5 1012 s 1 is much higher than the reverse reaction 2 1 103 s 1 thereby making cl preferring to turn into hocl in eq 25 the rate constant of hocl dissociation reaction is higher than the reverse so hocl preferring to dissociate to form oh according to eqs 23 25 cl formed via the reaction of rc with cl was further converted into hocl then hocl dissociated and more oh was formed in other words rc was converted to oh in the uv paa process when cl existed 23 c h 3 c o 3 c l h c l c h 3 c o 3 h 24 c l h 2 o h o c l h 25 h o c l o h c l furthermore the contributions of oh and rc at different cl concentrations to nap degradation in the uv paa process were calculated using the competitive method as shown in fig 8 b oh contributed 31 42 and rc contributed 58 69 to nap degradation with increasing cl concentration from 0 mm to 200 mm in the uv paa process oh contribution had no obvious increased trend as inferred in the previous paragraph the reason could be described as follows when rc was converted into oh via reactions 23 25 the concentration of oh increased and more oh was scavenged by paa to form rc to sum up a series of cyclic reactions formed between oh and rc in the uv paa process when cl existed 3 3 proposed influencing mechanism of water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process overall the influencing mechanism of water matrices on nap degradation in the uv paa process could be proposed in fig 9 when co3 2 hco3 existed in the water co3 2 hco3 could scavenge oh thus yielding co3 with low reactivity to nap which might further react with paa to produce rc in other words oh was transformed into rc when co3 2 hco3 existed in the uv paa process rc is effective for nap degradation with 2nd order rate constants about 9 00 109 m 1s 1 similar to the second order rate constants of oh with nap so co3 2 hco3 has little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process when ha existed in the water ha could scavenge oh and rc and its scavenging capacity for rc was higher than that for oh k c ha 6 23 104 and k oh ha 3 5 104 when cl existed in the water cl could react with rc yielding cl which was further converted into hocl then hocl dissociated and more oh was formed the increased oh was scavenged by paa to form rc in other words rc was transformed into oh when cl existed in the uv paa process so cl has little effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process 4 conclusion in this study the contributions of different reactive radicals to nap degradation in pure water in the uv paa process was re evaluated by a competition method and the results showed that rc contributed 60 8 and oh contributed 39 2 the effects of water matrices co3 2 hco3 ha and cl on nap degradation in the uv paa process were investigated it was found that co3 2 hco3 and cl had minimal effect on nap degradation in the uv paa process because of the conversions of different reactive radicals through a series of cyclic reactions however ha exerted observable inhibition on nap degradation because the naphthyl structure of ha is likely to be attacked by rc declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

19106,sulfate reducing bacteria srb are a group of diverse anaerobic microorganisms omnipresent in natural habitats and engineered environments that use sulfur compounds as the electron acceptor for energy metabolism dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based techniques mediated by srb have been utilized in many sulfate containing wastewater treatment systems worldwide particularly for acid mine drainage groundwater sewage and industrial wastewater remediation however dsr processes are often operated suboptimally and disturbances are common in practical application to improve the efficiency and robustness of srb based processes it is necessary to study srb metabolism and operational conditions in this review the mechanisms of dsr processes are reviewed and discussed focusing on intracellular and extracellular electron transfer with different electron donors hydrogen organics methane and electrodes based on the understanding of the metabolism of srb responses of srb to environmental stress ph temperature and salinity related stress are summarized at the species and community levels application in these stressed conditions is discussed and future research is proposed the feasibility of recovering energy and resources such as biohydrogen hydrocarbons polyhydroxyalkanoates magnetite and metal sulfides through the use of srb were investigated but some long standing questions remain unanswered linking the existing scientific understanding and observations to practical application is the challenge as always for promotion of srb based techniques keywords dissimilatory sulfate reduction electron transfer stress responses industrial wastewater treatment energy and resources recovery 1 introduction sulfur the least common of the five macro elements in

sulfur in nature vet et al 2014 volcanic and thermal emissions release sulfur oxides sox and hydrogen sulfide h2s into the atmosphere this process along with chemical weathering transports geologically stored sulfur back into the biosphere resulting in a sulfate concentration of 28 mm in the marine environment fike et al 2015 sulfate present in the oceans and other water bodies can

used to refer to all bacteria and archaea ecologically dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr plays a major role in the global sulfur and carbon cycle crowe et al 2014 more than 50 of the organic carbon mineralization in marine sediments is related to dsr and about 97 megatons of sulfur compounds are removed annually from the biosphere by the sulfur cycle and deposited into the ocean volkov and rozanov 1983 beyond their ecological role srb also have an important economic impact on the modern society due to their biocorrosion of materials enning and garrelfs 2014 sulfate is commonly applied as the counterion for iron salts or aluminum used as coagulants in water treatment resulting in around 50 500 mg so4 2 l in sewage lens et al 1998 rubio rincón et al 2017 the sulfate is converted to

above 1000 ppmv nielsen et al 2008 gaseous sulfide causes concrete sewers to corrode at the crown after being oxidized to h2so4 the costs of rehabilitating and preventing sewer corrosion are estimated at billions of dollars annually pikaar et al 2014 in recent years sulfate laden brackish water resulting from seawater intrusion is also becoming a great concern for local water resource conservation given that nearly two thirds of the world s population live within 150 km of a coastline hinrichsen 1999 the average socioeconomic loss due to seawater intrusion is about 1 1 billion usd year in china alone xu et al 2009 moreover as a typical byproduct sulfate is produced in many industrial processes such as leather tanning kraft pulping petroleum refining and acid mine drainage amd lens et al 1998 across all industrial sectors the estimated costs of sulfur induced treatment range from 2 to 3 of the gross domestic product in developed countries koch et al 2002 kruger 2011 the adverse impacts of srb are obvious but in fact these organisms can also be used beneficially for example dissolved heavy metals can be captured via sulfide precipitation in many engineered and natural environments hao et al 2014 srb based technologies e g thioteq and sulfateq by paques have also been applied at an industrial scale for the treatment of amd which is considered as one of the most serious pollution threats to ecosystems worldwide huisman et al 2006 another state of the art srb based process known as the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process has recently undergone large scale trial for the treatment of saline municipal sewage in hong kong wu et al 2016 in hong kong seawater is used for toilet flushing the implementation of srb associated technologies provides extra benefits such as the production of metal sulfide nanoparticles and biohydrogen martins and pereira 2013 wang et al 2013 and even the synthesis of bioplastics hai et al 2004 via the mediation of srb however an imbalance in the ph temperature and salinity conditions will directly limit the performance of srb particularly in scaling up the process zhou et al 2011 for instance srb activity reduced by 30 50 when the ph was elevated from neutral ph 7 6 to 8 6 9 0 gutierrez et al 2009 at haloalkaline conditions 34 5 g nacl l only 72 mg l 1 h 1 of sulfate reduction rate was achieved which is tenfold less than that of the neutral conditions sousa et al 2015 a fundamental metabolic understanding and proper control strategies play a significant role in optimizing existing srb based techniques and developing new ones to date two prevalent types of metabolism are identified and accepted in srb growth electron transport phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation thauer et al 2007 proton gradient is created via redox reactions generating a proton motive force for production of adenosine triphosphate atp in electron transport phosphorylation in substrate level phosphorylation atp is formed during exergonic oxidation reactions of organic substrates recently a new type of srb metabolism was investigated involving extracellular electron transfer between sulfate reduction and methane oxidation mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme scheller et al 2016 electron carriers driving the extracellular electron transfer between microorganisms were the focus of that srb anme study while details of that metabolism are yet to be uncovered wegener et al 2015 mcglynn et al 2015 extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes which is considered as a new electron transfer pathway of srb has also been drawing recent interest this review paper investigates and analyzes the advances made in the field of dsr in the past decade with a focus on revealing the different types of metabolism discussing the limitations of industrial application particularly in extreme operational conditions and evaluating the feasibility of harvesting energy and resources as an additional benefit of using srb based technologies 2 metabolism of sulfate reduction srb at one time were believed to be capable of growing only on organic substrates e g acetate pyruvate lactate and propionate and energy was conserved mainly or exclusively via substrate level phosphorylation in 1978 badziong and thauer reported that desulfovibrio vulgaris proliferated with hydrogen h2 as the electron donor and sulfate as the electron acceptor demonstrating the electron transport phosphorylation in the metabolism of srb for the first time sulfate is commonly used as the electron acceptor but oxidized sulfur species e g s0 so3 2 and s2o3 2 sulfonates dimethylsulfoxide nitrate nitrite iron iii oxygen fumarate acrylate arsenate chromate and uranium are also competent electron acceptors and were well summarized by rabus et al 2013 2 1 dissimilatory sulfate reduction in dsr sulfate so4 2 is first reduced to sulfite so3 2 and the produced so3 2 is subsequently converted to sulfide s2 the so4 2 is initially activated with two molecules of atp during which the enzyme atp sulfurylase catalyzes the attachment of so4 2 to a phosphate of atp forming adenosine phosphosulfate aps as shown in fig 1 a thereafter the activated so4 2 in aps is reduced directly to so3 2 by aps reductase with the release of adenosine monophosphate amp and the consumption of two electrons reduction of so3 2 to s2 is presently treated as a black box and two mechanisms were proposed in one hypothesis so3 2 is reduced to hs in a single step by a single enzyme bisulfite reductase peck and legall 1982 and bisulfite reductase was found present in desulfovibrio the alternative pathway proposed by fitz and cypionka 1989 involves several enzymes i e sulfite reductase trithionate reductase and thiosulfate reductase and intermediates in the last step of sulfate reduction such that trithionate and thiosulfate are produced the trithionate pathway the trithionate pathway was confirmed by using in vitro assays of desulfovibrio vulgaris in the investigation of how dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrab reduces so3 2 santos et al 2015 in this pathway reduction of so3 2 to dsrc trisulfide is first performed by dsrab which is a widespread enzyme involved in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism anantharaman et al 2018 the produced dsrc trisulfide is then reduced to sulfide and dsrcr by the dsrmkjop complex as shown in fig 1b dsrc acts as a physiological partner of dsrab in the reduction of so3 2 venceslau et al 2014 when dsrc is absent i e only dsrab is present in vitro or in limited supply i e so3 2 is much more than reduced dsrc thiosulfate s2o3 2 may become dominant because of the reaction of so3 2 with s2 in vivo or the partial reduction of sulfate with dsrab in vitro leavitt et al 2015 despite remaining uncertainties about the pathway current findings offer overwhelming support for the argument that dsrc and dsrab are central and key proteins in the metabolism of srb dissimilating so3 2 to s2 with advances in analytical techniques intracellular sulfur metabolites and their isotopic compositions such as 34s and 33s have been examined recently to reveal the sulfur transfer pathway sim et al 2017 the detection accuracy however is limited due to the interference of abundant phosphate 2 2 electron transport phosphorylation substrate level phosphorylation is active in the presence of organics while atp can be produced via electron transport phosphorylation when h2 serves as the electron donor for dsr h2 is available from outside of the cell membrane in anaerobic conditions e g acidogenesis and acetogenesis and it can also be generated in the cytoplasm h2 is utilized in the periplasmic membrane when acting as the sole energy source for srb where it is oxidized by periplasmic hydrogenase hase1 generating electrons and hydrogen ion h as shown in fig 2 a the produced electrons attach themselves to electron carriers such as multiple hemec3 type cytochromes within the periplasm and are then transferred to the cytoplasm where dsr occurs through the inner membrane da silva et al 2013 the generated h is pumped across the cytoplasmic membrane with a proton motive pump pmp during electron transport viz a mitchell type of vectorial proton translocation forming an h gradient between the periplasm and the cytoplasm fitz and cypionka 1991 veshaguri et al 2016 the formed h gradient is subsequently used to drive the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate with membrane bound atp synthases as the catalyst fig 2 in an earlier study when srb desulfovibrio strain grew on lactate substrate level phosphorylation was believed to be the major atp source for sulfate activation even though h2 formation was also observed odom and peck 1981 a h2 cycling was proposed in that case h2 is produced through lactate oxidation by cytoplasmic hydrogenases hase2 and diffuses out of the cell to serve as an electron donor thereafter through electron transport phosphorylation h2 is thereupon oxidized by hase1 with the production of electrons and with h generating atp for dsr an extension of the h2 cycling was proposed based on the genome sequence of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough and the genes echabcdef and coomklxuhf were found to be responsible for the production of periplasmic and cytoplasmic hydrogenases which catalyze h2 production from lactate heidelberg et al 2004 however complete genome sequence of desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 illustrated that the annotated cytoplasmic hydrogenases which are essential for h2 cycling were absent and no evidence of energy conservation for h2 cycling based on their genetic examination was found hauser et al 2011 price et al 2014 a new alternative electron flow and energy conservation of desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 with h2 catabolism was proposed accordingly whereby sulfate accepts electrons directly from lactate and pyruvate oxidation in the presence of menaquinone mq keller et al 2014 a later study deduced that the transmembrane complex dsrmkjop could serve to carry electrons and pass the electrons directly through mq to dsr as a complementary pathway santos et al 2015 in addition to h2 formate can be oxidized by formate dehydrogenases fdhs in the periplasm of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough heidelberg et al 2004 electrons generated from the oxidation of formate can be conveyed by electron carriers such as the periplasmic tetraheme cytochrome network to the cytoplasmic membrane for sulfate activation and reduction and the produced h contributes to the pmp for atp synthesis through electron transport phosphorylation accumulation of formate during growth with lactate and sulfate was observed in desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 when a gene encoding cytochrome c3 an electron acceptor for the periplasmic fdhs was deleted li et al 2009 soluble periplasmic fdhs fdhab and fdhabc3 were found to play a formate oxidation role in mutant strains desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough cultivated with lactate and sulfate however formate cycling does not appear to be prevalent even among species that grow on formate the electron transfer pathways are species specific morais silva et al 2013 2014 2 3 substrate level phosphorylation srb fall into two broad categories in substrate level phosphorylation complete organic oxidizers which convert organics to carbon dioxide and incomplete organic oxidizers with acetate as an end product widdel et al 1983 to date over 120 srb species across more than 40 genera have been identified among which 70 are incomplete oxidizers for instance species of the genus desulfotomaculum generally consume acetate while those of the genus desulfovibrio do not other examples were summarized by hao et al 2014 acetate is quantitatively the most important physiological electron donor for complete oxidizers and up to 70 of sulfide comes from oxidation of acetate in sediments with sufficient sulfate liamleam and annachhatre 2007a b thauer 1982 complete oxidizers operate according to one of two metabolic pathways the citric acid cycle cac in desulfobacter and the oxidative carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ocmd pathway in organisms such as desulfotomaculum and desulfobacterium fed with acetate fig 2b thauer 1988 goevert and conrad 2008 acetate utilization via the ocmd pathway is the predominant metabolic route for most complete organic oxidizer this is probably because the omcd pathway has the advantage that all oxidation steps proceed at redox potentials are more negative than that of the aps hso3 couple 60 mv and that of the hso3 hs couple 116 mv while the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the cac pathway is an endergonic reaction 33 mv thauer et al 2007 pyruvate and lactate lactate is the classical electron donor for most srb and is oxidized by a d or l lactate dehydrogenase ildh to pyruvate the produced pyruvate will be oxidized to acetate ultimately ildh5 utilized in this route is mainly found in clostridial srb keller et al 2014 lactate oxidation at substrate level phosphorylation of srb yields two molecules of atp which are subsequently used for sulfate activation resulting in a net gain in atp of zero the atp thus should be supplied via an additional pathway for the completion of sulfate reduction this further supports the h2 cycling model electron transfer in the metabolism of srb feeding on lactate is still obscure weghoff et al 2015 with two hypothesized pathways 1 electrons react with h to form h2 for energy conservation 2 electrons are transferred through the cytoplasmic membrane and delivered to one of the periplasmic electron carrier cytochromes c3 ultimately crossing the membrane again to contribute to dsr sim et al 2013 propionate propionate serves as the electron donor and carbon source for several incomplete e g desulfobulbus desulforhopalus and desulfofaba and complete e g desulfococcus desulfonema and desulfosarcina oxidizers abildgaard et al 2004 el houari et al 2017 incomplete degradation of propionate was investigated with desulfobulbus propionicus and the methylmalonyl coa pathway as shown in fig 2d was proposed stams et al 1985 the methylmalonyl coa pathway appears to be more energetically favorable than oxidation of propionyl coa via acrylyl coa the redox potential of the acrylyl coa propionyl coa couple is 69 mv which is higher than that of a fumarate succinate couple 33 mv requiring a greater input energy before the reaction can proceed barton and hamilton 2007 the methylmalonyl coa pathway was also confirmed for complete oxidation of propionate with desulfococcus multivorans and desulfonema widdel et al 1983 syntrophic propionate oxidation has gained attention recently with a focus on electron carriers such as h2 and formate juste poinapen et al 2015 this propionate oxidation pathway however is regarded as the most thermodynamically unfavorable reaction for fatty acid degradation qiao et al 2016 li et al 2017 other organics other emerging organic contaminants including chlorinated organics monoaromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic substances and alkanes can also serve as electron donor for srb metabolism the biodegradation pathway of these substances by srb is different for example sulfamethoxazole degradation mainly involves the cleavage of the isoxazole ring jia et al 2017 while reductive dehalogenation is the key step for chlorophenols degradation under sulfidogenic conditions susarla et al 1998 srb are also capable of degrading diatrizoate via 3 5 diaminobenzoic acid pathway and coping with alkanes via subterminal carboxylation at the carbon 3 atom pathway redeker et al 2014 musat 2015 details on the degradation of emerging organics contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products under sulfidogenic condition can be referred to in ghattas et al 2017 and degradation of some toxic organics is often improved in comparison to methanogenic degradation díaz 2004 the electron donor or carbon source has a significant influence on the metabolic pathways of srb prior to the implementation of an srb mediated process the characteristics of both the substrate and the srb should be considered for instance propionate which produces intermediate h2 as the preferred reducing equivalent is recognized as a more effective electron donor for sulfate reduction than acetate huang et al 2012 ethanol was found to be an optimum electron donor for haloalkaliphilic sulfidogenic systems due to its special metabolic mechanism of rapid ethanol utilization zhou and xing 2015 in addition the ethanol utilization efficiency can be improved by using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor mbr in which acetate utilizing srb could be significantly enriched as a result the limiting step of acetate consumption in sulfidogenic conditions becomes inconspicuous sahinkaya et al 2018 benefitting from a high polysaccharide content algae and their metabolic byproducts could be an electron donor in driving the sulfate reduction for the bioremediation of amd ayala parra et al 2016 other complex sources used for srb based bioremediation were ranked in a descending order of effectiveness as follows silage compost molasses hay cattails and pulp mill biosolids schmidtova and baldwin 2011 2 4 extracellular electron transfer between anme and srb in addition to electron transfer phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation srb can obtain extracellular electrons from methane oxidation mediated by anme in a synergetic process of srb and methanogenesis ch4 so4 2 hco3 hs h2o boetius et al 2000 based on the latest investigation of thermodynamics and enzyme characteristics this process is believed to be an obligate syntrophic process the change in free energy δg available through this reaction is only 20 kj mol and the life supporting atp is estimated to be near thermodynamic equilibrium δg 0 kj mol thauer 2011 offre et al 2013 at such a low energy yield questions have been raised about the feasibility of this putative syntrophy srb were found that could gain a direct electron for sulfate reduction with anme forming a highly structured syntrophic consortium and two possible metabolic pathways of methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction were illustrated as shown in fig 3 milucka et al 2012 wegener et al 2015 mcglynn et al 2015 scheller et al 2016 wegener et al 2015 demonstrated that anme of clade 1 anme 1 could directly convey extracellular electrons via cytochrome c proteins to srb hotseep 1 with the assistance of pili structures fig 3a a similar phenomenon was also observed by using syntrophy of anme 2 and desulfobacteraceae lineage seep srb mcglynn et al 2015 in addition to direct extracellular electron transfer between anme and srb zero valent sulfur may also play a crucial role as an intermediate in this process milucka et al 2012 methane can be oxidized by anme 2 with a concomitant reduction of sulfate to zero valent sulfur s0 the produced s0 is expunged outside the cell where it reacts with sulfide forming disulfides which can be further disproportionately degraded by srb to sulfate and sulfide fig 3b disproportionation of s0 can only be performed by a minority of srb and has neither been observed in srb hotseep 1 nor seep srb wegener et al 2016 more investigations are needed to confirm the role of sulfur disproportionation 2 5 extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes electrodes are applied as the electron supplier for sulfate reduction in microbial electrolysis cell extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes is currently believed to involve three types of mechanism a short range electron transfer through soluble electron carriers such as c type cytochromes b long range electron transfer mediated by pili structures and c electrical coupling by conductive redox enzymes desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough can acquire electrons from carbon based electrodes when methyl viologen serves as an electron carrier tatsumi et al 1999 guiral brugna et al 2001 lojou et al 2002 however the poor electrochemical stability of methyl viologen creates a major obstacle to application at the field scale the c type cytochromes and pili structures were found to play a key role in the extracellular electron transfer process as demonstrated by the pure culture of desulfovibrio strain g11 in a microbial electrolysis cell with graphite electrodes croese et al 2011 moreover direct extracellular electron transfer between srb desulfovibrionales and desulfobacteraceae and a carbon based electrode could occur via mediation by conductive redox enzymes sharma et al 2013 nifese hydrogenase in desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough rüdiger et al 2010 gutiérrez sánchez et al 2011 marques et al 2017 and nife hydrogenase in desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio fructosovorans alonso lomillo et al 2007 baur et al 2011 perform effectively on gold electrode surfaces for h2 oxidation 3 application of srb in extreme conditions since the 1990s srb based technologies have been implemented for sulfur laden wastewaters treatment due to the production of massive amounts of sulfate containing industrial wastewater and the prevalence of sulfate in domestic sewage 50 500 mg l sulfate lens et al 1998 rubio rincón et al 2017 despite the ability of srb to grow in a wide range of environments e g 0 100 c low to high salinity and ph of 1 9 8 srb based techniques are mostly applied under physiologically suboptimal conditions hao et al 2014 kovaliova et al 2017 this does not imply that they cannot be applied to much more extreme conditions but the effects of such conditions or the consequences of seasonal change or anthropic interventions must be considered in scaling up the process to orchestrate the bioreactions and maximize the efficiency of microorganisms under extreme conditions proper operational strategies based on the responses of srb must be developed reactions of srb during application in wastewater treatment under extreme ph temperature and salinity conditions are therefore reviewed in this section 3 1 alkaline conditions elevated ph will not only lead to cytoplasm alkalinization but also damage proteins and the cell envelope of microorganisms microorganisms employ several adaptive strategies for alkaline ph homeostasis these strategies are i increasing acid production via fermentation ii increasing the activity of monovalent cation proton antiporters to capture protons and iii changing cell surface properties in favor of cytoplasmic proton retention the production of monovalent cation proton antiporters is the most common adaptive strategy for alkaline ph hemostasis padan et al 2005 response of desulfovibrio vulgaris a model species for studying the metabolism of srb to alkaline stress ph 10 was investigated by stolyar et al 2007 an increase in atp synthase and sodium ion hydrogen ion na h antiporter nhac 2 production was observed to attenuate alkalinization in the cytoplasm via increased proton import acidification of the cytoplasm through increasing metabolic acid production was also a part of this survival strategy the alkali tolerant srb desulfovibrio alkalitolerans sp nov was first recorded to grow under alkaline conditions by abildgaard et al 2006 but detail of its response to alkaline stress is still not clear an increasing number of alkali tolerant srb species have been investigated with advanced molecular based techniques and these genera or species and their metabolic characteristics were summarized by sousa 2017 and are updated with the latest findings in table 1 alkaline sulfate laden wastewaters are generated in food processing e g meat food and beverage processing as well as many other chemical and industrial operations for instance the ph of effluents from the textile industry generally ranges from 9 to 11 and the ph of alkali reduction wastewater from the artificial silk industry can even exceed 12 shen et al 2011 although some srb species were characterized as alkali tolerant it is difficult to isolate and enrich them for the purposes of alkaline wastewater treatment adaptation of prevalent srb species is a common means to seeding sulfate reducing reactors however it is inevitable that the reactor will perform at partial effectiveness for instance srb activity reduced by 30 50 when the ph was elevated from neutral ph 7 6 to 8 6 9 0 which could be ascribed to the inhibition of specific enzymatic reactions and disruption of cell homeostasis gutierrez et al 2009 feasibility of performing sulfate reduction under alkaline conditions ph 9 was demonstrated in a continuous bioreactor with an srb growth rate 18 mmol l 1 d 1 that was approximately tenfold less than that in neutral conditions sousa et al 2015 sulfate reducing granular sludge provides a potential solution to acclimatizing srb to alkaline environments through a defensive layered structure such a layered structure creates a better collective defense and a communal environment for synergy of microbial consortia and self protective capacity hao et al 2014 2016 srb granules have been investigated at a lab scale for the treatment of alkaline textile wastewater showing an efficient adaption to the new alkaline operational conditions ph 9 without prior acclimation with 90 azo dye removal zeng et al 2017 additionally the system ph gradually decreased from an initial 9 2 to 7 4 in the granular system which was probably due to the reactions of acidogenesis in the presence of with srb in the granular microbial consortia 3 2 acidic conditions aquatic acidic conditions are characterized by higher proton concentrations which subsequently create a diffusion pressure on the cell membrane of microorganisms carboxyl groups present mainly in the undissociated form at low ph conditions could diffuse into the cell and act as an uncoupler inhibiting the growth of organisms koschorreck 2008 under such conditions more energy is required to maintain a higher circumneutral internal ph by pumping protons out of the membrane through proton motive force so that less energy is available for growth sánchez andrea et al 2014 in sulfidogenic systems hydrogen sulfide h2s is an inhibitor in low ph conditions as it combines with iron in ferredoxin cytochrome and other essential iron containing compounds of the cell ceasing the electron transport systems koschorreck 2008 the ph associated inhibition of organic acids in srb can also be severe for example a 50 growth inhibition was observed in a mixed srb culture at 0 9 mm of undissociated acetic acid ph 6 2 sánchez andrea et al 2013 as for desulfosporosinus spp an acidotolerant srb the na h antiporter potassium ion atpase k atpase and amino acid decarboxylases participate in enabling growth at a low ph of 1 0 6 5 karnachuk et al 2017 moreover in desulfovibrio magneticus the k transporting atpase involved in the generation of positive internal membrane potential with an influx of k can inhibit the flux of protons kovaliova et al 2017 although desulfurella amilsii is able to grow at ph as low as 3 its metabolism is still deficient florentino et al 2017 the existence and activity of acidotolerant and acidophilic srb e g desulfosporosinus acidiphilus and desulfosporosinus acididurans are further summarized in table 2 amd is a typical acidic wastewater and is considered as one of the most serious sources of pollution in natural environments as it contaminates ground and surface watercourses huisman et al 2006 nordstrom et al 2015 although bioremediation of amd using srb has been successfully demonstrated in pilot scale and full scale operations the sensitivity of srb to acidity limits their efficiency in amd remediation using acidophilic and acid tolerant sulfidogenic microorganisms in amd treatment is likely to extend the range of srb applications however attempts to isolate acidophilic or acid tolerant strains of srb asrb have mostly been unsuccessful the main reason for failing to isolate asrb is the use of organic acids such as lactate which is toxic to many acidophiles in acidic conditions these compounds exist predominantly as non dissociated lipophilic molecules and as such can traverse bacterial membranes where they dissociate in the circumneutral internal cell cytoplasm causing a disequilibrium and acidification of the cytosol ňancucheo et al 2017 enrichment of asrb with non acidic organic substrates such as glycerol h2 and alcohols was proven effective ňancucheo et al 2016 when glycerol was used as the carbon source for an acidophilic sulfidogenic bioreactor in amd treatment with a ph of 2 1 5 0 the system showed both robust and adaptable performance santos and johnson 2017 colipai et al 2018 also demonstrated that asrb desulfosporosinus acididurans were enriched with glycerol as the electron donor with a ph of 4 5 however acetic acid is one undesirable byproduct of the process indicating that glycerol is only partially utilized and aerobic downstream processing would be needed to remove the residual organics before final discharge the importance of organic carbon as a selective driver of asrb demands further investigation sulfate reduction based technologies applied in amd treatment and reported in the past five years are summarized in table 3 srb have relatively high tolerance towards sulfide for instance only 50 activity of srb was inhibited with a free hydrogen sulfide concentration of 1000 mg l isa et al 1986 however formation of metal sulfide precipitates could also affect srb by forming a coating layer that blocks the transport of substrates and eventually inhibits microbial activity for example accumulation of around 10 mg l zns and 5 mg l cus could cease sulfate reduction in amd treatment utgikar et al 2002 in addition disposal of the metal rich biomass of amd treatment normally entails solidification disposal at landfills and long term management currently the in situ separation of metal sulfides from the biomass is a preferred preprocessing approach the sulfidogenic inverse fluidized bed reactor ifbr is designed to separate metal sulfides produced from the biomass in amd treatment celis garcía et al 2007 metal sulfides accumulate at the bottom of the ifbr and the biomass bed is fixed between the middle to top portion of the reactor around 80 of metal sulfides were recovered in an ifbr and no inhibition of srb was observed with an influent ph of 5 gallegos garcia et al 2009 however the performance of sulfate reduction in the ifbr was significantly affected when the ph was less than 5 and the chemical oxygen demand cod lower than 30 and sulfate removal efficiency lower than 20 decreased with a drop of the ph villa gomez et al 2015a b application of the ifbr offers an opportunity for the treatment of amd or other metal containing industrial wastewaters with simultaneous recovery of metals 3 3 high temperature conditions membrane permeability increases and membrane lipid proteins of microorganisms become increasingly disorganized with rising temperature guyot et al 2015 extensive production of heat shock proteins hsps and atp dependent proteases that degrade misfolded proteins is the ubiquitous response to temperature stress of microorganisms haslbeck and vierling 2015 in addition microorganisms up regulate and down regulate cell processes and genes to cope with the temperature change for instance in desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough protein turnover and chaperones are up regulated at 50 c while energy production nucleotide transport ribosomal structure and biogenesis are down regulated to deal with temperature rises chhabra et al 2006 the majority of thermophilic srb reported in the literature are isolated from geothermal habitats such as oil field water petroleum reservoirs and hot springs and their specific physiological properties facilitate their growth in high temperature conditions the carboxylesterase af est2 from the hyperthermophilic srb archaeoglobus fulgidus was found to be highly thermostable and stable in extreme environments sayer et al 2016 response of archaeoglobus fulgidus to heat shock has been investigated by a whole genome study showing that af1298 is auto regulated rohlin et al 2005 in addition to archaeoglobus fulgidus a considerable variety of thermophilic srb such as desulfotomaculum thermodesulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium have been isolated enriched or examined during the last two decades from diverse terrestrial and marine environments these thermophilic srb and their growth conditions are summarized in table 4 the temperature of industrial wastewaters can be far from the physiological optima of microorganisms thermophilic systems are preferred over conventional mesophilic systems operated between 20 and 35 c in some industrial wastewater treatment systems to reduce energy consumption by mitigating the need for cooling rintala and lettinga 1992 visser et al 1992 thermophilic srb have attracted interest for various biotechnological applications such as treatment of paper mill wastewater rintala et al 1991 sipma et al 1999 parshina et al 2005 and desulfurization of flue gases both at around 55 c van houten et al 1997 parshina et al 2005 qian et al 2015 table 5 summarizes the sulfate reduction rates hydraulic retention times hrts benefits drawbacks among other parameters of using different electron donors in the application of sulfate reduction processes under elevated temperature conditions h2 is a less efficient electron donor under thermophilic conditions due to the formation of methane as a by product from h2 and carbon dioxide co2 moreover the solubility of h2 declines with increasing temperature thermophilic h2 utilizing microorganisms circumvent this challenge by increasing affinity and lowering the threshold concentration for h2 under thermophilic conditions 55 c sulfate conversion rates of up to 312 mg l 1 h 1 have been achieved with h2 which is considerably lower than mesophilic conditions van houten et al 1997 lu et al 2017 methanol is proved to be the most efficient electron donor under thermophilic conditions for srb owing to a higher substrate affinity weijma et al 2000a 2000b vallero et al 2004a b when the thermophilic srb desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii was employed for methanol degradation at 60 c two methanol degradation pathways i e cobalt dependent methanol methyltransferase and cobalt independent methanol dehydrogenase could assist srb in outcompeting methanogens sousa et al 2018 3 4 low temperature conditions in contrast to heat shock the membrane fluidity and stabilization of protein structures will decrease upon temperature drops causing a reduced efficiency of rna transcription and translation phadtare 2004 for srb rates of both growth and decay are sensitive to low temperature van den brand et al 2014 reported that utilization rates of both acetate and propionate by srb were 1 9 times lower at 10 c than that at 20 c psychrotolerant srb can apply several strategies at the molecular level in response to transitions between low and intermediate temperatures desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain hrm2 regarded as a model organism of psychrotolerant srb can grow at temperatures as low as 0 c rabus et al 2002 at low temperatures membrane fluidity would be enhanced in desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain hrm2 by increasing the proportion of cellular unsaturated fatty acids and short chain fatty acids while the overall protein patterns from 0 to 31 c would remain very similar additionally psychrotolerant srb would often reduce their metabolic activity instead of resynthesizing adapted enzymes a summary of 15 psychrotolerant sulfate reducer species and their growth conditions is provided in table 6 these species were typically isolated from sediments and lakes featuring cold ambient conditions most psychrotolerant srb can use different electron donors such as formate pyruvate and lactate with so4 2 so3 2 s2o3 2 or s0 as the electron acceptor special membrane compositions in psychrotolerant srb more fatty acids than membranes of mesophiles might lead to a more efficient solute uptake at low temperatures moreover different enzymes or enzyme activity could be another explanation for the comparable sulfate reduction rates of psychrophiles and mesophiles at different temperatures amd generation undergoes seasonal dynamics and the greatest releases have been recorded during spring snowmelt in spring and winter 10 c psychrotolerant srb should preferably be applied for amd treatment long term operation of a pilot scale bioreactor at a low temperature 9 c with formate as the carbon source successfully demonstrated enrichment of formate utilizing psychrotolerant mesophilic srb desulfomicrobium with a sulfate reduction rate of 32 mg l 1 h 1 and a metal removal rate of over 95 fe mn ni zn cu and cr auvinen et al 2009 in addition application of anaerobic mbr for domestic wastewater dww treatment in cold regions is drawing more attention smith et al 2012 however interference of srb in the anaerobic mbr system cannot be avoided as srb will compete with methanogens for organics and cause sulfide corrosion problems during dww treatment although a pilot scale anaerobic mbr for dww treatment demonstrated a nearly 50 decrease of sulfate reduction with temperature drop from 25 30 c to 9 11 c shin et al 2014 allowing a higher conversion of organics to methane the sulfur associated issues such as fouling induced by sulfide precipitates and poly sulfur s0 remain a challenge in anaerobic mbr systems it is suggested that anaerobic mbr is more appropriate for treating dww with a sufficiently high cod so4 2 ratio 10 or in the absence of sulfate lei et al 2018 shin and bae 2018 as shown in table 7 sulfate reduction rates dropped to 0 25 mg l 1 h 1 at 9 c when silage served as the carbon source for the treatment of metal containing wastewater and only one srb species similar to the psychrotolerant srb desulfovibrio arcticus was enriched wakeman et al 2010 the sulfate reduction rate was not enhanced with readily available biodegradable organics at the low temperature for instance only 11 mg l 1 h 1 of sulfate reduction was reached at 8 c when ethanol feed was used which is 17 times lower than the normal or mesothermal 33 35 c conditions sahinkaya et al 2007 the butyrate degradation rate decreased by 32 at 11 c in the presence of sulfate 798 mg l while a 35 increase in the propionate conversion rate was observed under the same conditions rebac et al 1996 hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction requires less energy under psychrophilic conditions lettinga et al 2001 the feasibility of low temperature sulfate reduction with hydrogen as the electron donor was investigated with a bench scale gas lift bioreactor operated at 9 c by nevatalo et al 2010 their work demonstrated a sulfate reduction rate of 25 mg l 1 h 1 by using psychrotolerant sulfate reducing mesophiles while nielsen et al 2018 demonstrated that molasses is a more suitable electron donor for cultivating a more diverse community of microorganisms as defense against the low temperature conditions 3 5 salt stress ionic stress and osmotic stress are two major constraints for microorganisms under salt stress more ions e g na and k can be transferred into the cytoplasm causing an increase in the ion concentration and subsequently damaging the membrane systems and deactivating key enzymes under ionic stress conditions he et al 2010 accumulating certain solutes such as k glutamate trehalose proline and glycinebetaine to balance the osmolarity of the medium is the primary response of bacteria csonka 1989 wood 2015 desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough was found to rely on osmoprotectants such as glycine betaine and ectoine to increase the internal osmotic pressure without interfering with vital cellular protein functions several efflux systems of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough were also highly up regulated at the transcript level to cope with the high salinity mukhopadhyay et al 2006 as for halophilic srb desulfonatronospira thiodismutans growing in a na medium of concentration 3m glycine betaine was accumulated to a level of up to 16 w w to alleviate the salinity stress an unexpected property of this organism is its ability to grow chemolithoautotrophically in saturated soda brines employing the very low energy reaction of thiosulfate dismutation s2o3 2 h2o so4 2 s2 2h δgo at ph 10 22 kj oren 2011 other halophilic srb which grow in environments with a concentration of up to 5m na are shown in table 8 under high salinity conditions sulfidogenesis could be stimulated by adding electron donors of which formate was the most efficient hydrogen did not lead to increased sulfide production with any of the inorganic sulfur acceptors while acetate typically stimulated sulfur reduction strongly saline wastewaters 2 w v sodium chloride nacl are discharged from a range of industrial processes for instance seafood processing textile dyeing oil and gas production leather tanning and drinking water treatment processes xiao and roberts 2010 srb based processes for addressing high salinity 50 g nacl l wastewaters were investigated in a mesophilic up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor with an hrt of 7 8 h showing that propionate and ethanol were suitable electron donors for srb while h2 and methanol were ineffective vallero et al 2004a b it was shown in another study that the optimum hrt was 18 h with a sulfate reduction rate of 260 mg l 1 h 1 for a haloalkaliphilic bioreactor treating wastewater from the adsorption fluid of flue gas 6 g nacl l zhou et al 2014 it was also found that ethanol was a more appropriate electron donor haloalkaliphilic srb could utilize ethanol efficiently owing to their special metabolic mechanisms zhou and xing 2015 but the details are still not clear sousa et al 2015 operated a h2 fed sulfidogenic gas lift bioreactor at haloalkaline conditions 34 5 g nacl l and the sulfate reduction rate 72 mg l 1 h 1 is approximately tenfold less than reported for a full scale h2 fed sulfate reducing reactor at neutral conditions with the salt tolerant srb desulfobacter halotolerant as the sole inoculum a submerged anaerobic mbr was built for the treatment of brines with 50 g nacl l vallero et al 2005 acetate and ethanol were applied as the carbon source achieving a sulfate removal rate of 275 mg l 1 h 1 however frequent fouling of the membrane due to the high salinity limits the practical application of this process as frequent back flushing for 1 min every 10 min is required usage of seawater as an alternative non potable water resource in coastal cities leads to domestic wastewater with a high salinity 0 7 1 0 the sani process was developed for the treatment of such sewage wang et al 2009 the sani process has recently realized the engineering application of srb from lab to full 1000 m3 d scale wu et al 2016 it efficiently removes organics and nitrogen with minimal sludge in moderate salinity conditions van loosdrecht et al 2012 the besi process also based on sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification was recently applied for the treatment of saline petrochemical wastewater at a lab scale wei et al 2018 its practical application needs further investigation 3 6 common inhibitors for srb apart from aforementioned extreme conditions srb are also sensitive to the presence of some oxidative substances i e oxygen nitrite nitrate toxic substances i e heavy metals sulfide and transition metals i e molybdate and selenium the inhibitory effect depends on the concentration of inhibitors no pure srb culture could carry out dsr with the oxygen concentration exceeding 1 μm kjeldsen et al 2004 over 70 mm nitrate concentration could inhibit growth of the model srb species desulfovibrio vulgaris by nearly 40 and nitrite with a concentration over 5 mm completely ceased the growth of desulfovibrio vulgaris he et al 2006 2010 although srb have been extensively applied for metal containing wastewater treatment the process metabolism of srb will cease once srb are exposed to toxic concentrations of heavy metals e g at ph of 7 5 mg l pb for mixed culture 20 mg l zn for mixed culture and 10 mg l ni for desulfovibrio desulfuricans utgikar et al 2003 molybdate as a competitive inhibitor of srb can completely inhibit dsr of desulfovibrio vulgaris desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio desulfuricans with a concentration above 2 mm by depleting the atp pool in srb biswas et al 2009 careful design of bioreactor configuration is of great significance to relieve the microbial inhibition by creating discrete or separate operational conditions such as in the ifbr for amd treatment 4 opportunities for resource recovery through the use of srb and associated challenges diverse metabolic properties and a wide range of habitats have enabled srb to be implemented in different wastewater treatment processes in recent decades characterized by a high treatment efficiency and low operation costs moving from passive treatment to carbon neutral treatment with concomitant resource recovery is a long held goal biogas collection through anaerobic digestion has been practiced for over a century while energy saving and resource recovering in srb dominated processes or bioreactors should be considered with the rapid expansion of biological sulfur conversion technologies 4 1 biohydrogen a high hydrogenase activity is often observed in the srb systems while the main catabolic product is sulfide rather than hydrogen h2 h2 production during the breakdown of lactate from the srb species desulfovibrio vulgaris was first observed by tsuji and yagi 1980 with formate as the sole electron donor the highest h2 production rate of 0 6 mmol lmedium 1 h 1 was recorded with mediation of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough martins and pereira 2013 this production rate could be significantly enhanced to 5 mmol lmedium 1 h 1 by using a sparging reactor to maintain a low h2 partial pressure ph2 which would facilitate the thermodynamics of the reaction martins et al 2015 however whether the energy recovered from the h2 production is equivalent to the production and supply of the gas needed for sparging requires further investigation the electron transfer pathways of formate driven h2 production in desulfovibrio were proposed by martins et al 2016 a direct electron transfer involving periplasmic enzymes nifese hase and transmembrane electron transfer allows energy metabolism however the relative weights of these two pathways are not known conversely h2 production in desulfovibrio gigas occurs exclusively via the direct periplasmic enzyme route and transmembrane electron transfer is not involved at all desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio vulgaris are quite distinct in terms of number type and localization of hydrogenase resulting in variations in their h2 production performance 0 26 mmol l 1h 1 in desulfovibrio vulgaris 0 11 mmol l 1h 1 in desulfovibrio gigas compared with desulfovibrio vulgaris which contains a large number of hydrogenases only two nife hases are present in desulfovibrio gigas the energy conserving hydrogenase ech and the periplasmic hynab 1 morais silva et al 2013 2014 this probably explains the limited h2 production efficiency of desulfovibrio gigas srb were also found to catalyze h2 production at the cathode of bioelectrochemical systems a pure culture of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough immobilized onto a carbon electrode could catalyze h2 production with methyl viologen as a redox mediator tatsumi et al 1999 lojou et al 2002 while a mediatorless microbial biocathode is more desirable for the stable operation of electrolysis systems a desulfitobacterium enriched culture without mediators at the cathode was proposed accordingly achieving four times higher h2 production rate than that of the abiotic controls villano et al 2011 furthermore the ability of desulfovibrio caledoniensis and desulfovibrio paquesii to accept electrons directly from a graphite cathode for catalyzing h2 production was demonstrated yu et al 2011 additional efforts are required for applying srb on h2 production microbial metabolic pathways for h2 production should also be investigated 4 2 hydrocarbons in addition to h2 hydrocarbons can be acquired by some incomplete oxidizer srb species production of aliphatic hydrocarbons of c10 c25 by desulfovibrio with organic or fatty acids supplementing seawater containing media was first observed by jankowski and zobell in 1944 n c25 c35 alkanes could be the major product up to 80 of the total hydrocarbons of hydrocarbon synthesized by desulfovibrio desulfuricans and acetate and formate are simultaneously formed with fixation of co2 bagaeva 1998 it has been hypothesized that during the metabolism of desulfovibrio desulfuricans acetate and formate generated from co2 are reduced to aldehydes which further undergo aldol condensation elongating the carbon chain to produce hydrocarbons synthesis of hydrocarbons by desulfovibrio desulfuricans depended significantly on the medium composition and the ratio of h2 to co2 the optimum is 9 1 in a gaseous phase bagaeva 2000 h2 could create a nutrient medium with a low potential which favors the growth of bacteria and their synthesis of reduced products including hydrocarbons the intracellular hydrocarbon synthesis potential of desulfovibrio desulfuricans ranges from 0 8 to 2 25 dry weight which is much greater than those of cyanobacteria 0 05 0 12 anaerobic phototrophic bacteria 0 005 0 006 and fungi 0 004 0 12 ladygina et al 2006 apart from desulfovibrio desulfuricans desulfovibrio desulfuricans g20 has also been reported to extracellularly synthesize alkanes friedman and rude 2012 overall many substantial obstacles remain to be addressed before srb could be used as an economically viable biocatalyst for the industrial manufacture of drop in biofuels 4 3 polyhydroxyalkanoates polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are biodegradable thermoplastics or elastomers used in industrial processes covering medicine fine chemicals implant biomaterials and biofuels anderson and dawes 1990 moita et al 2014 li and loh 2015 the first observation of stored phas in srb was in desulfonema magnum through microscopic inspection widdel et al 1983 several srb strains desulfonema magnum desulfosarcina variabilis desulfobotulus sapovorans desulfobacterium autotrophicum desulfovibrio vulgaris desulfotalea psychrophila and desulfococcus multivorans have been investigated for their pha synthesis ability in different saltwater media 1 7 and 20 nacl g l benzoate grown desulfonema magnum demonstrated the highest pha content of 88 wt wt of cell dry matter which is comparable to some of the best commercially applied organisms hai et al 2004 the pha contents in desulfobacterium autotrophicum desulfococcus multivorans desulfosarcina variabilis and desulfobotulus sapovorans were 11 27 22 and 43 wt wt of the cell dry matter respectively hai et al 2004 pha biosynthesis is governed by pha synthases which catalyze the polymerization of hydroxyalkanoic acids has into phas with concomitant release of coa rehm and steinbüchel 1999 the production cost of phas in fed batch mode using waste materials could reach up to 3 5 usd kg phas roland holst et al 2013 whereas that of oil based plastics is around 1 usd kg salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 most of the cost associated with the biosynthesis of phas is related to feedstock aeration if required sterilization maintaining pure culture and extraction of the phas optimistically sharing the costs between wastewater treatment and pha production would be an option when applying srb for instance 4 4 magnetite many organisms have been known since the early 1970s to sense the earth s magnetic field magnetite produced by microorganisms could be a potential physical indicator of biological activity in geological settings especially with an increased understanding of the conditions under which bacterial magnetite is formed schüler and frankel 1999 byrne et al 2015 the extracellular iron oxide magnetite was first regarded as a product of srb strain rs 1 by sakaguchi et al 1993 this bacterium synthesized bullet shaped magnetite with distinct crystallographic characteristics implying the existence of a unique biological regulatory system for crystal morphology chariaou et al 2015 the bacterium was identified as desulfovibrio magneticus using 16s rdna analysis sakaguchi et al 2002 the unique characteristics of desulfovibrio magneticus strain rs 1 were further revealed at the genic level nakazawa et al 2009 some of the genes which are responsible for magnetosome formation are missing in the rs 1 genome for example mami and maml encoded for controlling the synthesis of the magnetosome membrane are absent from the rs 1 genome murat et al 2010 furthermore mamgfdc and mms6 known to be involved in the regulation of crystal size and shape are also missing from rs 1 scheffel et al 2008 the mechanism of magnetite formation in strain rs 1 is still unknown lefèvre et al 2011 claimed that another srb strain bw 1 which belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class was capable of producing magnetite and greigite magnetite crystals produced by strain bw 1 were also bullet shaped but greigite crystals had irregular outlines and lacked a well defined crystal structure two magnetosome genes in the genome of strain bw 1 were identified one of the gene clusters encoding magnetosome proteins are close to those of the magnetite producer strain rs 1 and the second gene cluster encoding proteins are close to those of the greigite producer candidatus magnetoglobus multicellularis in addition to srb magnetite can be produced by other microorganisms such as geobacter and shewanella the maximum magnetite production rate reached 5 6 mg l 1 d 1 when magnetovibrio blakemorei strain mv 1 was cultivated silva et al 2013 moreover byrne et al 2015 successfully scaled up a laboratory scale magnetite production process to a pilot scale using geobacter sulfurreducens with a production rate of 2400 mg l 1 d 1 although the magnetite production of srb strains is currently limited capabilities for recovering magnetite have been well demonstrated and await further investigation and optimization 4 5 metal sulfides metal sulfides are extensively applied in industrial processes owing to their unique characteristics such as hydrocracking in fuel refineries hydroprocessing and oxygen reduction in fuel cells cui et al 2011 lai et al 2012 da costa et al 2016 at the nanoscale 1 100 nm metal sulfides can be further applied in cancer therapy photocatalysis optoelectronics and as anti microbial agents in textile modification technologies yang et al 2015 hong et al 2014 those metal sulfides that are commercially available are generally synthesized through methods including high gravity chemical baths γ radiation pyrolysis and thermolysis of metal complexes da costa et al 2016 high temperature and high pressure are essential in those processes and the use of hazardous chemicals surface stabilizer trioctylphosphine oxide cannot be avoided in contrast the biological production of metal sulfides is a safe cost effective and environmentally friendly synthesis method for instance cadmium sulfide cds nanoparticles of 8 nm were intracellularly synthesized by photosynthetic bacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris and e coli also are capable of producing intracellular cds nanocrystals of 2 5 nm bai and zhang 2009 sweeney et al 2004 sulfide is the product of sulfate reduction mediated by srb which can extracellularly bind to or precipitate with metal ions in solution valuable metal sulfides produced via srb metabolism are summarized in table 9 two strategies are executed when srb are applied in metal sulfide production the metal directly reacts with the sulfide in the sulfidogenic system in line system or sulfide is produced and separated as a metal precipitant agent off line system peltier et al 2011 showed that the zinc sulfide zns precipitates formed in the system of desulfovibrio sulfuricans are more stable than the abiotic zns precipitates the biogenic ni3s2 in a mixed culture of srb exhibits a better crystallinity than the corresponding abiotic samples gramp et al 2007 aggregation induced by metal binding polypeptides and proteins of organisms in the in line system limited the dispersal of metal sulfide particles in the solution reducing the potential to harvest those particles moreau et al 2007 in addition the adsorptive extracellular polymeric substances such as carboxyl thiol phosphate and amino hydroxyl of srb would obstruct the formation of metal sulfides yue et al 2015 therefore harvesting biogenic metal sulfides from sulfidogenic off line systems could be a better option particularly in the treatment of metal containing wastewater thioteq paques and biosulfide bioteq are two state of the art off line systems for metal sulfide recovery in amd treatment a modular bioreactor for selective metal recovery from amd using an off line sulfidogenic system was proposed by hedrich and johnson 2014 in which ph control is crucial for metal sulfides formation for instance with a ph value 3 cu can be selectively precipitated by sulfide while other metals fe and zn are present in significant concentrations in the leach liquors falagán et al 2017 furthermore binding characteristics of metals are also sensitive to changes in ph for example the nature surface and settling characteristics of the copper sulfide cus and zns are strongly influenced by the bulk ph lewis 2010 mokone et al 2010 when precipitation was conducted with excess sulfide at operational ph values 6 the zeta potential would reduce and the settling and dewatering properties of the zns precipitates would improve crystallinity of the metal sulfides is of utmost importance particularly when they are used in high tech industrial processes such as solar panel construction as the spatial separation of charges is crucial in the design of efficient donor acceptor heterojunctions bansal et al 2013 factors determining crystallinity in sulfidogenic systems are not clear yet although a better crystallinity of zns was obtained with desulfovibrio desulfuricans than in the abiogenic tests xu et al 2016 mineral crystallinity deserves systematic investigations to achieve metal sulfides biological production in off line sulfidogenic systems and to realize the recovery of valuable resources from waste streams 5 conclusions this paper systematically reviews the sulfate reduction process and summarizes the different types of metabolism of srb in terms of the energy sources metabolic pathways including electron transport phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation and the demonstrations of extracellular electron transfer mediated by anme and electrodes are discussed different electron donors not only influence the sulfate reduction rate via triggering various metabolic pathways but also determine the treatment efficiency of targeted pollutants to some extent accordingly the characteristics of the substrate should be considered before implementing a srb mediated process to ensure effective performance extracellular electron transfer associated with srb should be further investigated for practical application the ability of srb to survive and perform in extreme ph temperature and salinity conditions allows srb based technologies to be applied for the treatment of wastewaters from various industrial processes in addition because of their unique characteristics srb offer an excellent opportunity for sustainable and environmentally friendly resources recovery from waste streams of the resources that could potentially be recovered metal sulfides that are extracellularly synthesized appear to be the most feasible but more detailed study and exploration are required for specific cases declaration of interest statement there are no conflicts of interest to declare

19106,sulfate reducing bacteria srb are a group of diverse anaerobic microorganisms omnipresent in natural habitats and engineered environments that use sulfur compounds as the electron acceptor for energy metabolism dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr based techniques mediated by srb have been utilized in many sulfate containing wastewater treatment systems worldwide particularly for acid mine drainage groundwater sewage and industrial wastewater remediation however dsr processes are often operated suboptimally and disturbances are common in practical application to improve the efficiency and robustness of srb based processes it is necessary to study srb metabolism and operational conditions in this review the mechanisms of dsr processes are reviewed and discussed focusing on intracellular and extracellular electron transfer with different electron donors hydrogen organics methane and electrodes based on the understanding of the metabolism of srb responses of srb to environmental stress ph temperature and salinity related stress are summarized at the species and community levels application in these stressed conditions is discussed and future research is proposed the feasibility of recovering energy and resources such as biohydrogen hydrocarbons polyhydroxyalkanoates magnetite and metal sulfides through the use of srb were investigated but some long standing questions remain unanswered linking the existing scientific understanding and observations to practical application is the challenge as always for promotion of srb based techniques keywords dissimilatory sulfate reduction electron transfer stress responses industrial wastewater treatment energy and resources recovery 1 introduction sulfur the least common of the five macro elements in the biosphere is widely transformed and translocated via biological and chemical reactions gypsum caso4 metal sulfides fes2 and elemental sulfur s0 in rocks and sediments are the major sources of sulfur in nature vet et al 2014 volcanic and thermal emissions release sulfur oxides sox and hydrogen sulfide h2s into the atmosphere this process along with chemical weathering transports geologically stored sulfur back into the biosphere resulting in a sulfate concentration of 28 mm in the marine environment fike et al 2015 sulfate present in the oceans and other water bodies can undergo rapid chemical conversions initiated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb srb are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments they use an oxidized form of sulfur e g s0 s2o3 and so4 2 as the electron acceptor and sulfide as the endproduct muyzer and stams 2008 most srb can be classified into four phylogenetic lineages including the gram positive bacteria e g desulfotomaculum the mesophilic proteobacteria e g desulfovibrio the thermophilic gram negative bacteria e g thermodesulfovibrio and the euryarchaeota e g archaeoglobus castro et al 2000 in this review the term srb is used to refer to all bacteria and archaea ecologically dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr plays a major role in the global sulfur and carbon cycle crowe et al 2014 more than 50 of the organic carbon mineralization in marine sediments is related to dsr and about 97 megatons of sulfur compounds are removed annually from the biosphere by the sulfur cycle and deposited into the ocean volkov and rozanov 1983 beyond their ecological role srb also have an important economic impact on the modern society due to their biocorrosion of materials enning and garrelfs 2014 sulfate is commonly applied as the counterion for iron salts or aluminum used as coagulants in water treatment resulting in around 50 500 mg so4 2 l in sewage lens et al 1998 rubio rincón et al 2017 the sulfate is converted to sulfide 0 6 13 5 mg s l by srb mediation in sewer systems during sewage transportation jiang et al 2013 and the amount of produced sulfide accumulating in the sewer headspace can reach concentrations above 1000 ppmv nielsen et al 2008 gaseous sulfide causes concrete sewers to corrode at the crown after being oxidized to h2so4 the costs of rehabilitating and preventing sewer corrosion are estimated at billions of dollars annually pikaar et al 2014 in recent years sulfate laden brackish water resulting from seawater intrusion is also becoming a great concern for local water resource conservation given that nearly two thirds of the world s population live within 150 km of a coastline hinrichsen 1999 the average socioeconomic loss due to seawater intrusion is about 1 1 billion usd year in china alone xu et al 2009 moreover as a typical byproduct sulfate is produced in many industrial processes such as leather tanning kraft pulping petroleum refining and acid mine drainage amd lens et al 1998 across all industrial sectors the estimated costs of sulfur induced treatment range from 2 to 3 of the gross domestic product in developed countries koch et al 2002 kruger 2011 the adverse impacts of srb are obvious but in fact these organisms can also be used beneficially for example dissolved heavy metals can be captured via sulfide precipitation in many engineered and natural environments hao et al 2014 srb based technologies e g thioteq and sulfateq by paques have also been applied at an industrial scale for the treatment of amd which is considered as one of the most serious pollution threats to ecosystems worldwide huisman et al 2006 another state of the art srb based process known as the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process has recently undergone large scale trial for the treatment of saline municipal sewage in hong kong wu et al 2016 in hong kong seawater is used for toilet flushing the implementation of srb associated technologies provides extra benefits such as the production of metal sulfide nanoparticles and biohydrogen martins and pereira 2013 wang et al 2013 and even the synthesis of bioplastics hai et al 2004 via the mediation of srb however an imbalance in the ph temperature and salinity conditions will directly limit the performance of srb particularly in scaling up the process zhou et al 2011 for instance srb activity reduced by 30 50 when the ph was elevated from neutral ph 7 6 to 8 6 9 0 gutierrez et al 2009 at haloalkaline conditions 34 5 g nacl l only 72 mg l 1 h 1 of sulfate reduction rate was achieved which is tenfold less than that of the neutral conditions sousa et al 2015 a fundamental metabolic understanding and proper control strategies play a significant role in optimizing existing srb based techniques and developing new ones to date two prevalent types of metabolism are identified and accepted in srb growth electron transport phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation thauer et al 2007 proton gradient is created via redox reactions generating a proton motive force for production of adenosine triphosphate atp in electron transport phosphorylation in substrate level phosphorylation atp is formed during exergonic oxidation reactions of organic substrates recently a new type of srb metabolism was investigated involving extracellular electron transfer between sulfate reduction and methane oxidation mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme scheller et al 2016 electron carriers driving the extracellular electron transfer between microorganisms were the focus of that srb anme study while details of that metabolism are yet to be uncovered wegener et al 2015 mcglynn et al 2015 extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes which is considered as a new electron transfer pathway of srb has also been drawing recent interest this review paper investigates and analyzes the advances made in the field of dsr in the past decade with a focus on revealing the different types of metabolism discussing the limitations of industrial application particularly in extreme operational conditions and evaluating the feasibility of harvesting energy and resources as an additional benefit of using srb based technologies 2 metabolism of sulfate reduction srb at one time were believed to be capable of growing only on organic substrates e g acetate pyruvate lactate and propionate and energy was conserved mainly or exclusively via substrate level phosphorylation in 1978 badziong and thauer reported that desulfovibrio vulgaris proliferated with hydrogen h2 as the electron donor and sulfate as the electron acceptor demonstrating the electron transport phosphorylation in the metabolism of srb for the first time sulfate is commonly used as the electron acceptor but oxidized sulfur species e g s0 so3 2 and s2o3 2 sulfonates dimethylsulfoxide nitrate nitrite iron iii oxygen fumarate acrylate arsenate chromate and uranium are also competent electron acceptors and were well summarized by rabus et al 2013 2 1 dissimilatory sulfate reduction in dsr sulfate so4 2 is first reduced to sulfite so3 2 and the produced so3 2 is subsequently converted to sulfide s2 the so4 2 is initially activated with two molecules of atp during which the enzyme atp sulfurylase catalyzes the attachment of so4 2 to a phosphate of atp forming adenosine phosphosulfate aps as shown in fig 1 a thereafter the activated so4 2 in aps is reduced directly to so3 2 by aps reductase with the release of adenosine monophosphate amp and the consumption of two electrons reduction of so3 2 to s2 is presently treated as a black box and two mechanisms were proposed in one hypothesis so3 2 is reduced to hs in a single step by a single enzyme bisulfite reductase peck and legall 1982 and bisulfite reductase was found present in desulfovibrio the alternative pathway proposed by fitz and cypionka 1989 involves several enzymes i e sulfite reductase trithionate reductase and thiosulfate reductase and intermediates in the last step of sulfate reduction such that trithionate and thiosulfate are produced the trithionate pathway the trithionate pathway was confirmed by using in vitro assays of desulfovibrio vulgaris in the investigation of how dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrab reduces so3 2 santos et al 2015 in this pathway reduction of so3 2 to dsrc trisulfide is first performed by dsrab which is a widespread enzyme involved in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism anantharaman et al 2018 the produced dsrc trisulfide is then reduced to sulfide and dsrcr by the dsrmkjop complex as shown in fig 1b dsrc acts as a physiological partner of dsrab in the reduction of so3 2 venceslau et al 2014 when dsrc is absent i e only dsrab is present in vitro or in limited supply i e so3 2 is much more than reduced dsrc thiosulfate s2o3 2 may become dominant because of the reaction of so3 2 with s2 in vivo or the partial reduction of sulfate with dsrab in vitro leavitt et al 2015 despite remaining uncertainties about the pathway current findings offer overwhelming support for the argument that dsrc and dsrab are central and key proteins in the metabolism of srb dissimilating so3 2 to s2 with advances in analytical techniques intracellular sulfur metabolites and their isotopic compositions such as 34s and 33s have been examined recently to reveal the sulfur transfer pathway sim et al 2017 the detection accuracy however is limited due to the interference of abundant phosphate 2 2 electron transport phosphorylation substrate level phosphorylation is active in the presence of organics while atp can be produced via electron transport phosphorylation when h2 serves as the electron donor for dsr h2 is available from outside of the cell membrane in anaerobic conditions e g acidogenesis and acetogenesis and it can also be generated in the cytoplasm h2 is utilized in the periplasmic membrane when acting as the sole energy source for srb where it is oxidized by periplasmic hydrogenase hase1 generating electrons and hydrogen ion h as shown in fig 2 a the produced electrons attach themselves to electron carriers such as multiple hemec3 type cytochromes within the periplasm and are then transferred to the cytoplasm where dsr occurs through the inner membrane da silva et al 2013 the generated h is pumped across the cytoplasmic membrane with a proton motive pump pmp during electron transport viz a mitchell type of vectorial proton translocation forming an h gradient between the periplasm and the cytoplasm fitz and cypionka 1991 veshaguri et al 2016 the formed h gradient is subsequently used to drive the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate with membrane bound atp synthases as the catalyst fig 2 in an earlier study when srb desulfovibrio strain grew on lactate substrate level phosphorylation was believed to be the major atp source for sulfate activation even though h2 formation was also observed odom and peck 1981 a h2 cycling was proposed in that case h2 is produced through lactate oxidation by cytoplasmic hydrogenases hase2 and diffuses out of the cell to serve as an electron donor thereafter through electron transport phosphorylation h2 is thereupon oxidized by hase1 with the production of electrons and with h generating atp for dsr an extension of the h2 cycling was proposed based on the genome sequence of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough and the genes echabcdef and coomklxuhf were found to be responsible for the production of periplasmic and cytoplasmic hydrogenases which catalyze h2 production from lactate heidelberg et al 2004 however complete genome sequence of desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 illustrated that the annotated cytoplasmic hydrogenases which are essential for h2 cycling were absent and no evidence of energy conservation for h2 cycling based on their genetic examination was found hauser et al 2011 price et al 2014 a new alternative electron flow and energy conservation of desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 with h2 catabolism was proposed accordingly whereby sulfate accepts electrons directly from lactate and pyruvate oxidation in the presence of menaquinone mq keller et al 2014 a later study deduced that the transmembrane complex dsrmkjop could serve to carry electrons and pass the electrons directly through mq to dsr as a complementary pathway santos et al 2015 in addition to h2 formate can be oxidized by formate dehydrogenases fdhs in the periplasm of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough heidelberg et al 2004 electrons generated from the oxidation of formate can be conveyed by electron carriers such as the periplasmic tetraheme cytochrome network to the cytoplasmic membrane for sulfate activation and reduction and the produced h contributes to the pmp for atp synthesis through electron transport phosphorylation accumulation of formate during growth with lactate and sulfate was observed in desulfovibrio alaskensis g20 when a gene encoding cytochrome c3 an electron acceptor for the periplasmic fdhs was deleted li et al 2009 soluble periplasmic fdhs fdhab and fdhabc3 were found to play a formate oxidation role in mutant strains desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough cultivated with lactate and sulfate however formate cycling does not appear to be prevalent even among species that grow on formate the electron transfer pathways are species specific morais silva et al 2013 2014 2 3 substrate level phosphorylation srb fall into two broad categories in substrate level phosphorylation complete organic oxidizers which convert organics to carbon dioxide and incomplete organic oxidizers with acetate as an end product widdel et al 1983 to date over 120 srb species across more than 40 genera have been identified among which 70 are incomplete oxidizers for instance species of the genus desulfotomaculum generally consume acetate while those of the genus desulfovibrio do not other examples were summarized by hao et al 2014 acetate is quantitatively the most important physiological electron donor for complete oxidizers and up to 70 of sulfide comes from oxidation of acetate in sediments with sufficient sulfate liamleam and annachhatre 2007a b thauer 1982 complete oxidizers operate according to one of two metabolic pathways the citric acid cycle cac in desulfobacter and the oxidative carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ocmd pathway in organisms such as desulfotomaculum and desulfobacterium fed with acetate fig 2b thauer 1988 goevert and conrad 2008 acetate utilization via the ocmd pathway is the predominant metabolic route for most complete organic oxidizer this is probably because the omcd pathway has the advantage that all oxidation steps proceed at redox potentials are more negative than that of the aps hso3 couple 60 mv and that of the hso3 hs couple 116 mv while the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the cac pathway is an endergonic reaction 33 mv thauer et al 2007 pyruvate and lactate lactate is the classical electron donor for most srb and is oxidized by a d or l lactate dehydrogenase ildh to pyruvate the produced pyruvate will be oxidized to acetate ultimately ildh5 utilized in this route is mainly found in clostridial srb keller et al 2014 lactate oxidation at substrate level phosphorylation of srb yields two molecules of atp which are subsequently used for sulfate activation resulting in a net gain in atp of zero the atp thus should be supplied via an additional pathway for the completion of sulfate reduction this further supports the h2 cycling model electron transfer in the metabolism of srb feeding on lactate is still obscure weghoff et al 2015 with two hypothesized pathways 1 electrons react with h to form h2 for energy conservation 2 electrons are transferred through the cytoplasmic membrane and delivered to one of the periplasmic electron carrier cytochromes c3 ultimately crossing the membrane again to contribute to dsr sim et al 2013 propionate propionate serves as the electron donor and carbon source for several incomplete e g desulfobulbus desulforhopalus and desulfofaba and complete e g desulfococcus desulfonema and desulfosarcina oxidizers abildgaard et al 2004 el houari et al 2017 incomplete degradation of propionate was investigated with desulfobulbus propionicus and the methylmalonyl coa pathway as shown in fig 2d was proposed stams et al 1985 the methylmalonyl coa pathway appears to be more energetically favorable than oxidation of propionyl coa via acrylyl coa the redox potential of the acrylyl coa propionyl coa couple is 69 mv which is higher than that of a fumarate succinate couple 33 mv requiring a greater input energy before the reaction can proceed barton and hamilton 2007 the methylmalonyl coa pathway was also confirmed for complete oxidation of propionate with desulfococcus multivorans and desulfonema widdel et al 1983 syntrophic propionate oxidation has gained attention recently with a focus on electron carriers such as h2 and formate juste poinapen et al 2015 this propionate oxidation pathway however is regarded as the most thermodynamically unfavorable reaction for fatty acid degradation qiao et al 2016 li et al 2017 other organics other emerging organic contaminants including chlorinated organics monoaromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic substances and alkanes can also serve as electron donor for srb metabolism the biodegradation pathway of these substances by srb is different for example sulfamethoxazole degradation mainly involves the cleavage of the isoxazole ring jia et al 2017 while reductive dehalogenation is the key step for chlorophenols degradation under sulfidogenic conditions susarla et al 1998 srb are also capable of degrading diatrizoate via 3 5 diaminobenzoic acid pathway and coping with alkanes via subterminal carboxylation at the carbon 3 atom pathway redeker et al 2014 musat 2015 details on the degradation of emerging organics contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products under sulfidogenic condition can be referred to in ghattas et al 2017 and degradation of some toxic organics is often improved in comparison to methanogenic degradation díaz 2004 the electron donor or carbon source has a significant influence on the metabolic pathways of srb prior to the implementation of an srb mediated process the characteristics of both the substrate and the srb should be considered for instance propionate which produces intermediate h2 as the preferred reducing equivalent is recognized as a more effective electron donor for sulfate reduction than acetate huang et al 2012 ethanol was found to be an optimum electron donor for haloalkaliphilic sulfidogenic systems due to its special metabolic mechanism of rapid ethanol utilization zhou and xing 2015 in addition the ethanol utilization efficiency can be improved by using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor mbr in which acetate utilizing srb could be significantly enriched as a result the limiting step of acetate consumption in sulfidogenic conditions becomes inconspicuous sahinkaya et al 2018 benefitting from a high polysaccharide content algae and their metabolic byproducts could be an electron donor in driving the sulfate reduction for the bioremediation of amd ayala parra et al 2016 other complex sources used for srb based bioremediation were ranked in a descending order of effectiveness as follows silage compost molasses hay cattails and pulp mill biosolids schmidtova and baldwin 2011 2 4 extracellular electron transfer between anme and srb in addition to electron transfer phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation srb can obtain extracellular electrons from methane oxidation mediated by anme in a synergetic process of srb and methanogenesis ch4 so4 2 hco3 hs h2o boetius et al 2000 based on the latest investigation of thermodynamics and enzyme characteristics this process is believed to be an obligate syntrophic process the change in free energy δg available through this reaction is only 20 kj mol and the life supporting atp is estimated to be near thermodynamic equilibrium δg 0 kj mol thauer 2011 offre et al 2013 at such a low energy yield questions have been raised about the feasibility of this putative syntrophy srb were found that could gain a direct electron for sulfate reduction with anme forming a highly structured syntrophic consortium and two possible metabolic pathways of methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction were illustrated as shown in fig 3 milucka et al 2012 wegener et al 2015 mcglynn et al 2015 scheller et al 2016 wegener et al 2015 demonstrated that anme of clade 1 anme 1 could directly convey extracellular electrons via cytochrome c proteins to srb hotseep 1 with the assistance of pili structures fig 3a a similar phenomenon was also observed by using syntrophy of anme 2 and desulfobacteraceae lineage seep srb mcglynn et al 2015 in addition to direct extracellular electron transfer between anme and srb zero valent sulfur may also play a crucial role as an intermediate in this process milucka et al 2012 methane can be oxidized by anme 2 with a concomitant reduction of sulfate to zero valent sulfur s0 the produced s0 is expunged outside the cell where it reacts with sulfide forming disulfides which can be further disproportionately degraded by srb to sulfate and sulfide fig 3b disproportionation of s0 can only be performed by a minority of srb and has neither been observed in srb hotseep 1 nor seep srb wegener et al 2016 more investigations are needed to confirm the role of sulfur disproportionation 2 5 extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes electrodes are applied as the electron supplier for sulfate reduction in microbial electrolysis cell extracellular electron transfer between srb and electrodes is currently believed to involve three types of mechanism a short range electron transfer through soluble electron carriers such as c type cytochromes b long range electron transfer mediated by pili structures and c electrical coupling by conductive redox enzymes desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough can acquire electrons from carbon based electrodes when methyl viologen serves as an electron carrier tatsumi et al 1999 guiral brugna et al 2001 lojou et al 2002 however the poor electrochemical stability of methyl viologen creates a major obstacle to application at the field scale the c type cytochromes and pili structures were found to play a key role in the extracellular electron transfer process as demonstrated by the pure culture of desulfovibrio strain g11 in a microbial electrolysis cell with graphite electrodes croese et al 2011 moreover direct extracellular electron transfer between srb desulfovibrionales and desulfobacteraceae and a carbon based electrode could occur via mediation by conductive redox enzymes sharma et al 2013 nifese hydrogenase in desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough rüdiger et al 2010 gutiérrez sánchez et al 2011 marques et al 2017 and nife hydrogenase in desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio fructosovorans alonso lomillo et al 2007 baur et al 2011 perform effectively on gold electrode surfaces for h2 oxidation 3 application of srb in extreme conditions since the 1990s srb based technologies have been implemented for sulfur laden wastewaters treatment due to the production of massive amounts of sulfate containing industrial wastewater and the prevalence of sulfate in domestic sewage 50 500 mg l sulfate lens et al 1998 rubio rincón et al 2017 despite the ability of srb to grow in a wide range of environments e g 0 100 c low to high salinity and ph of 1 9 8 srb based techniques are mostly applied under physiologically suboptimal conditions hao et al 2014 kovaliova et al 2017 this does not imply that they cannot be applied to much more extreme conditions but the effects of such conditions or the consequences of seasonal change or anthropic interventions must be considered in scaling up the process to orchestrate the bioreactions and maximize the efficiency of microorganisms under extreme conditions proper operational strategies based on the responses of srb must be developed reactions of srb during application in wastewater treatment under extreme ph temperature and salinity conditions are therefore reviewed in this section 3 1 alkaline conditions elevated ph will not only lead to cytoplasm alkalinization but also damage proteins and the cell envelope of microorganisms microorganisms employ several adaptive strategies for alkaline ph homeostasis these strategies are i increasing acid production via fermentation ii increasing the activity of monovalent cation proton antiporters to capture protons and iii changing cell surface properties in favor of cytoplasmic proton retention the production of monovalent cation proton antiporters is the most common adaptive strategy for alkaline ph hemostasis padan et al 2005 response of desulfovibrio vulgaris a model species for studying the metabolism of srb to alkaline stress ph 10 was investigated by stolyar et al 2007 an increase in atp synthase and sodium ion hydrogen ion na h antiporter nhac 2 production was observed to attenuate alkalinization in the cytoplasm via increased proton import acidification of the cytoplasm through increasing metabolic acid production was also a part of this survival strategy the alkali tolerant srb desulfovibrio alkalitolerans sp nov was first recorded to grow under alkaline conditions by abildgaard et al 2006 but detail of its response to alkaline stress is still not clear an increasing number of alkali tolerant srb species have been investigated with advanced molecular based techniques and these genera or species and their metabolic characteristics were summarized by sousa 2017 and are updated with the latest findings in table 1 alkaline sulfate laden wastewaters are generated in food processing e g meat food and beverage processing as well as many other chemical and industrial operations for instance the ph of effluents from the textile industry generally ranges from 9 to 11 and the ph of alkali reduction wastewater from the artificial silk industry can even exceed 12 shen et al 2011 although some srb species were characterized as alkali tolerant it is difficult to isolate and enrich them for the purposes of alkaline wastewater treatment adaptation of prevalent srb species is a common means to seeding sulfate reducing reactors however it is inevitable that the reactor will perform at partial effectiveness for instance srb activity reduced by 30 50 when the ph was elevated from neutral ph 7 6 to 8 6 9 0 which could be ascribed to the inhibition of specific enzymatic reactions and disruption of cell homeostasis gutierrez et al 2009 feasibility of performing sulfate reduction under alkaline conditions ph 9 was demonstrated in a continuous bioreactor with an srb growth rate 18 mmol l 1 d 1 that was approximately tenfold less than that in neutral conditions sousa et al 2015 sulfate reducing granular sludge provides a potential solution to acclimatizing srb to alkaline environments through a defensive layered structure such a layered structure creates a better collective defense and a communal environment for synergy of microbial consortia and self protective capacity hao et al 2014 2016 srb granules have been investigated at a lab scale for the treatment of alkaline textile wastewater showing an efficient adaption to the new alkaline operational conditions ph 9 without prior acclimation with 90 azo dye removal zeng et al 2017 additionally the system ph gradually decreased from an initial 9 2 to 7 4 in the granular system which was probably due to the reactions of acidogenesis in the presence of with srb in the granular microbial consortia 3 2 acidic conditions aquatic acidic conditions are characterized by higher proton concentrations which subsequently create a diffusion pressure on the cell membrane of microorganisms carboxyl groups present mainly in the undissociated form at low ph conditions could diffuse into the cell and act as an uncoupler inhibiting the growth of organisms koschorreck 2008 under such conditions more energy is required to maintain a higher circumneutral internal ph by pumping protons out of the membrane through proton motive force so that less energy is available for growth sánchez andrea et al 2014 in sulfidogenic systems hydrogen sulfide h2s is an inhibitor in low ph conditions as it combines with iron in ferredoxin cytochrome and other essential iron containing compounds of the cell ceasing the electron transport systems koschorreck 2008 the ph associated inhibition of organic acids in srb can also be severe for example a 50 growth inhibition was observed in a mixed srb culture at 0 9 mm of undissociated acetic acid ph 6 2 sánchez andrea et al 2013 as for desulfosporosinus spp an acidotolerant srb the na h antiporter potassium ion atpase k atpase and amino acid decarboxylases participate in enabling growth at a low ph of 1 0 6 5 karnachuk et al 2017 moreover in desulfovibrio magneticus the k transporting atpase involved in the generation of positive internal membrane potential with an influx of k can inhibit the flux of protons kovaliova et al 2017 although desulfurella amilsii is able to grow at ph as low as 3 its metabolism is still deficient florentino et al 2017 the existence and activity of acidotolerant and acidophilic srb e g desulfosporosinus acidiphilus and desulfosporosinus acididurans are further summarized in table 2 amd is a typical acidic wastewater and is considered as one of the most serious sources of pollution in natural environments as it contaminates ground and surface watercourses huisman et al 2006 nordstrom et al 2015 although bioremediation of amd using srb has been successfully demonstrated in pilot scale and full scale operations the sensitivity of srb to acidity limits their efficiency in amd remediation using acidophilic and acid tolerant sulfidogenic microorganisms in amd treatment is likely to extend the range of srb applications however attempts to isolate acidophilic or acid tolerant strains of srb asrb have mostly been unsuccessful the main reason for failing to isolate asrb is the use of organic acids such as lactate which is toxic to many acidophiles in acidic conditions these compounds exist predominantly as non dissociated lipophilic molecules and as such can traverse bacterial membranes where they dissociate in the circumneutral internal cell cytoplasm causing a disequilibrium and acidification of the cytosol ňancucheo et al 2017 enrichment of asrb with non acidic organic substrates such as glycerol h2 and alcohols was proven effective ňancucheo et al 2016 when glycerol was used as the carbon source for an acidophilic sulfidogenic bioreactor in amd treatment with a ph of 2 1 5 0 the system showed both robust and adaptable performance santos and johnson 2017 colipai et al 2018 also demonstrated that asrb desulfosporosinus acididurans were enriched with glycerol as the electron donor with a ph of 4 5 however acetic acid is one undesirable byproduct of the process indicating that glycerol is only partially utilized and aerobic downstream processing would be needed to remove the residual organics before final discharge the importance of organic carbon as a selective driver of asrb demands further investigation sulfate reduction based technologies applied in amd treatment and reported in the past five years are summarized in table 3 srb have relatively high tolerance towards sulfide for instance only 50 activity of srb was inhibited with a free hydrogen sulfide concentration of 1000 mg l isa et al 1986 however formation of metal sulfide precipitates could also affect srb by forming a coating layer that blocks the transport of substrates and eventually inhibits microbial activity for example accumulation of around 10 mg l zns and 5 mg l cus could cease sulfate reduction in amd treatment utgikar et al 2002 in addition disposal of the metal rich biomass of amd treatment normally entails solidification disposal at landfills and long term management currently the in situ separation of metal sulfides from the biomass is a preferred preprocessing approach the sulfidogenic inverse fluidized bed reactor ifbr is designed to separate metal sulfides produced from the biomass in amd treatment celis garcía et al 2007 metal sulfides accumulate at the bottom of the ifbr and the biomass bed is fixed between the middle to top portion of the reactor around 80 of metal sulfides were recovered in an ifbr and no inhibition of srb was observed with an influent ph of 5 gallegos garcia et al 2009 however the performance of sulfate reduction in the ifbr was significantly affected when the ph was less than 5 and the chemical oxygen demand cod lower than 30 and sulfate removal efficiency lower than 20 decreased with a drop of the ph villa gomez et al 2015a b application of the ifbr offers an opportunity for the treatment of amd or other metal containing industrial wastewaters with simultaneous recovery of metals 3 3 high temperature conditions membrane permeability increases and membrane lipid proteins of microorganisms become increasingly disorganized with rising temperature guyot et al 2015 extensive production of heat shock proteins hsps and atp dependent proteases that degrade misfolded proteins is the ubiquitous response to temperature stress of microorganisms haslbeck and vierling 2015 in addition microorganisms up regulate and down regulate cell processes and genes to cope with the temperature change for instance in desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough protein turnover and chaperones are up regulated at 50 c while energy production nucleotide transport ribosomal structure and biogenesis are down regulated to deal with temperature rises chhabra et al 2006 the majority of thermophilic srb reported in the literature are isolated from geothermal habitats such as oil field water petroleum reservoirs and hot springs and their specific physiological properties facilitate their growth in high temperature conditions the carboxylesterase af est2 from the hyperthermophilic srb archaeoglobus fulgidus was found to be highly thermostable and stable in extreme environments sayer et al 2016 response of archaeoglobus fulgidus to heat shock has been investigated by a whole genome study showing that af1298 is auto regulated rohlin et al 2005 in addition to archaeoglobus fulgidus a considerable variety of thermophilic srb such as desulfotomaculum thermodesulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium have been isolated enriched or examined during the last two decades from diverse terrestrial and marine environments these thermophilic srb and their growth conditions are summarized in table 4 the temperature of industrial wastewaters can be far from the physiological optima of microorganisms thermophilic systems are preferred over conventional mesophilic systems operated between 20 and 35 c in some industrial wastewater treatment systems to reduce energy consumption by mitigating the need for cooling rintala and lettinga 1992 visser et al 1992 thermophilic srb have attracted interest for various biotechnological applications such as treatment of paper mill wastewater rintala et al 1991 sipma et al 1999 parshina et al 2005 and desulfurization of flue gases both at around 55 c van houten et al 1997 parshina et al 2005 qian et al 2015 table 5 summarizes the sulfate reduction rates hydraulic retention times hrts benefits drawbacks among other parameters of using different electron donors in the application of sulfate reduction processes under elevated temperature conditions h2 is a less efficient electron donor under thermophilic conditions due to the formation of methane as a by product from h2 and carbon dioxide co2 moreover the solubility of h2 declines with increasing temperature thermophilic h2 utilizing microorganisms circumvent this challenge by increasing affinity and lowering the threshold concentration for h2 under thermophilic conditions 55 c sulfate conversion rates of up to 312 mg l 1 h 1 have been achieved with h2 which is considerably lower than mesophilic conditions van houten et al 1997 lu et al 2017 methanol is proved to be the most efficient electron donor under thermophilic conditions for srb owing to a higher substrate affinity weijma et al 2000a 2000b vallero et al 2004a b when the thermophilic srb desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii was employed for methanol degradation at 60 c two methanol degradation pathways i e cobalt dependent methanol methyltransferase and cobalt independent methanol dehydrogenase could assist srb in outcompeting methanogens sousa et al 2018 3 4 low temperature conditions in contrast to heat shock the membrane fluidity and stabilization of protein structures will decrease upon temperature drops causing a reduced efficiency of rna transcription and translation phadtare 2004 for srb rates of both growth and decay are sensitive to low temperature van den brand et al 2014 reported that utilization rates of both acetate and propionate by srb were 1 9 times lower at 10 c than that at 20 c psychrotolerant srb can apply several strategies at the molecular level in response to transitions between low and intermediate temperatures desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain hrm2 regarded as a model organism of psychrotolerant srb can grow at temperatures as low as 0 c rabus et al 2002 at low temperatures membrane fluidity would be enhanced in desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain hrm2 by increasing the proportion of cellular unsaturated fatty acids and short chain fatty acids while the overall protein patterns from 0 to 31 c would remain very similar additionally psychrotolerant srb would often reduce their metabolic activity instead of resynthesizing adapted enzymes a summary of 15 psychrotolerant sulfate reducer species and their growth conditions is provided in table 6 these species were typically isolated from sediments and lakes featuring cold ambient conditions most psychrotolerant srb can use different electron donors such as formate pyruvate and lactate with so4 2 so3 2 s2o3 2 or s0 as the electron acceptor special membrane compositions in psychrotolerant srb more fatty acids than membranes of mesophiles might lead to a more efficient solute uptake at low temperatures moreover different enzymes or enzyme activity could be another explanation for the comparable sulfate reduction rates of psychrophiles and mesophiles at different temperatures amd generation undergoes seasonal dynamics and the greatest releases have been recorded during spring snowmelt in spring and winter 10 c psychrotolerant srb should preferably be applied for amd treatment long term operation of a pilot scale bioreactor at a low temperature 9 c with formate as the carbon source successfully demonstrated enrichment of formate utilizing psychrotolerant mesophilic srb desulfomicrobium with a sulfate reduction rate of 32 mg l 1 h 1 and a metal removal rate of over 95 fe mn ni zn cu and cr auvinen et al 2009 in addition application of anaerobic mbr for domestic wastewater dww treatment in cold regions is drawing more attention smith et al 2012 however interference of srb in the anaerobic mbr system cannot be avoided as srb will compete with methanogens for organics and cause sulfide corrosion problems during dww treatment although a pilot scale anaerobic mbr for dww treatment demonstrated a nearly 50 decrease of sulfate reduction with temperature drop from 25 30 c to 9 11 c shin et al 2014 allowing a higher conversion of organics to methane the sulfur associated issues such as fouling induced by sulfide precipitates and poly sulfur s0 remain a challenge in anaerobic mbr systems it is suggested that anaerobic mbr is more appropriate for treating dww with a sufficiently high cod so4 2 ratio 10 or in the absence of sulfate lei et al 2018 shin and bae 2018 as shown in table 7 sulfate reduction rates dropped to 0 25 mg l 1 h 1 at 9 c when silage served as the carbon source for the treatment of metal containing wastewater and only one srb species similar to the psychrotolerant srb desulfovibrio arcticus was enriched wakeman et al 2010 the sulfate reduction rate was not enhanced with readily available biodegradable organics at the low temperature for instance only 11 mg l 1 h 1 of sulfate reduction was reached at 8 c when ethanol feed was used which is 17 times lower than the normal or mesothermal 33 35 c conditions sahinkaya et al 2007 the butyrate degradation rate decreased by 32 at 11 c in the presence of sulfate 798 mg l while a 35 increase in the propionate conversion rate was observed under the same conditions rebac et al 1996 hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction requires less energy under psychrophilic conditions lettinga et al 2001 the feasibility of low temperature sulfate reduction with hydrogen as the electron donor was investigated with a bench scale gas lift bioreactor operated at 9 c by nevatalo et al 2010 their work demonstrated a sulfate reduction rate of 25 mg l 1 h 1 by using psychrotolerant sulfate reducing mesophiles while nielsen et al 2018 demonstrated that molasses is a more suitable electron donor for cultivating a more diverse community of microorganisms as defense against the low temperature conditions 3 5 salt stress ionic stress and osmotic stress are two major constraints for microorganisms under salt stress more ions e g na and k can be transferred into the cytoplasm causing an increase in the ion concentration and subsequently damaging the membrane systems and deactivating key enzymes under ionic stress conditions he et al 2010 accumulating certain solutes such as k glutamate trehalose proline and glycinebetaine to balance the osmolarity of the medium is the primary response of bacteria csonka 1989 wood 2015 desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough was found to rely on osmoprotectants such as glycine betaine and ectoine to increase the internal osmotic pressure without interfering with vital cellular protein functions several efflux systems of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough were also highly up regulated at the transcript level to cope with the high salinity mukhopadhyay et al 2006 as for halophilic srb desulfonatronospira thiodismutans growing in a na medium of concentration 3m glycine betaine was accumulated to a level of up to 16 w w to alleviate the salinity stress an unexpected property of this organism is its ability to grow chemolithoautotrophically in saturated soda brines employing the very low energy reaction of thiosulfate dismutation s2o3 2 h2o so4 2 s2 2h δgo at ph 10 22 kj oren 2011 other halophilic srb which grow in environments with a concentration of up to 5m na are shown in table 8 under high salinity conditions sulfidogenesis could be stimulated by adding electron donors of which formate was the most efficient hydrogen did not lead to increased sulfide production with any of the inorganic sulfur acceptors while acetate typically stimulated sulfur reduction strongly saline wastewaters 2 w v sodium chloride nacl are discharged from a range of industrial processes for instance seafood processing textile dyeing oil and gas production leather tanning and drinking water treatment processes xiao and roberts 2010 srb based processes for addressing high salinity 50 g nacl l wastewaters were investigated in a mesophilic up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor with an hrt of 7 8 h showing that propionate and ethanol were suitable electron donors for srb while h2 and methanol were ineffective vallero et al 2004a b it was shown in another study that the optimum hrt was 18 h with a sulfate reduction rate of 260 mg l 1 h 1 for a haloalkaliphilic bioreactor treating wastewater from the adsorption fluid of flue gas 6 g nacl l zhou et al 2014 it was also found that ethanol was a more appropriate electron donor haloalkaliphilic srb could utilize ethanol efficiently owing to their special metabolic mechanisms zhou and xing 2015 but the details are still not clear sousa et al 2015 operated a h2 fed sulfidogenic gas lift bioreactor at haloalkaline conditions 34 5 g nacl l and the sulfate reduction rate 72 mg l 1 h 1 is approximately tenfold less than reported for a full scale h2 fed sulfate reducing reactor at neutral conditions with the salt tolerant srb desulfobacter halotolerant as the sole inoculum a submerged anaerobic mbr was built for the treatment of brines with 50 g nacl l vallero et al 2005 acetate and ethanol were applied as the carbon source achieving a sulfate removal rate of 275 mg l 1 h 1 however frequent fouling of the membrane due to the high salinity limits the practical application of this process as frequent back flushing for 1 min every 10 min is required usage of seawater as an alternative non potable water resource in coastal cities leads to domestic wastewater with a high salinity 0 7 1 0 the sani process was developed for the treatment of such sewage wang et al 2009 the sani process has recently realized the engineering application of srb from lab to full 1000 m3 d scale wu et al 2016 it efficiently removes organics and nitrogen with minimal sludge in moderate salinity conditions van loosdrecht et al 2012 the besi process also based on sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification was recently applied for the treatment of saline petrochemical wastewater at a lab scale wei et al 2018 its practical application needs further investigation 3 6 common inhibitors for srb apart from aforementioned extreme conditions srb are also sensitive to the presence of some oxidative substances i e oxygen nitrite nitrate toxic substances i e heavy metals sulfide and transition metals i e molybdate and selenium the inhibitory effect depends on the concentration of inhibitors no pure srb culture could carry out dsr with the oxygen concentration exceeding 1 μm kjeldsen et al 2004 over 70 mm nitrate concentration could inhibit growth of the model srb species desulfovibrio vulgaris by nearly 40 and nitrite with a concentration over 5 mm completely ceased the growth of desulfovibrio vulgaris he et al 2006 2010 although srb have been extensively applied for metal containing wastewater treatment the process metabolism of srb will cease once srb are exposed to toxic concentrations of heavy metals e g at ph of 7 5 mg l pb for mixed culture 20 mg l zn for mixed culture and 10 mg l ni for desulfovibrio desulfuricans utgikar et al 2003 molybdate as a competitive inhibitor of srb can completely inhibit dsr of desulfovibrio vulgaris desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio desulfuricans with a concentration above 2 mm by depleting the atp pool in srb biswas et al 2009 careful design of bioreactor configuration is of great significance to relieve the microbial inhibition by creating discrete or separate operational conditions such as in the ifbr for amd treatment 4 opportunities for resource recovery through the use of srb and associated challenges diverse metabolic properties and a wide range of habitats have enabled srb to be implemented in different wastewater treatment processes in recent decades characterized by a high treatment efficiency and low operation costs moving from passive treatment to carbon neutral treatment with concomitant resource recovery is a long held goal biogas collection through anaerobic digestion has been practiced for over a century while energy saving and resource recovering in srb dominated processes or bioreactors should be considered with the rapid expansion of biological sulfur conversion technologies 4 1 biohydrogen a high hydrogenase activity is often observed in the srb systems while the main catabolic product is sulfide rather than hydrogen h2 h2 production during the breakdown of lactate from the srb species desulfovibrio vulgaris was first observed by tsuji and yagi 1980 with formate as the sole electron donor the highest h2 production rate of 0 6 mmol lmedium 1 h 1 was recorded with mediation of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough martins and pereira 2013 this production rate could be significantly enhanced to 5 mmol lmedium 1 h 1 by using a sparging reactor to maintain a low h2 partial pressure ph2 which would facilitate the thermodynamics of the reaction martins et al 2015 however whether the energy recovered from the h2 production is equivalent to the production and supply of the gas needed for sparging requires further investigation the electron transfer pathways of formate driven h2 production in desulfovibrio were proposed by martins et al 2016 a direct electron transfer involving periplasmic enzymes nifese hase and transmembrane electron transfer allows energy metabolism however the relative weights of these two pathways are not known conversely h2 production in desulfovibrio gigas occurs exclusively via the direct periplasmic enzyme route and transmembrane electron transfer is not involved at all desulfovibrio gigas and desulfovibrio vulgaris are quite distinct in terms of number type and localization of hydrogenase resulting in variations in their h2 production performance 0 26 mmol l 1h 1 in desulfovibrio vulgaris 0 11 mmol l 1h 1 in desulfovibrio gigas compared with desulfovibrio vulgaris which contains a large number of hydrogenases only two nife hases are present in desulfovibrio gigas the energy conserving hydrogenase ech and the periplasmic hynab 1 morais silva et al 2013 2014 this probably explains the limited h2 production efficiency of desulfovibrio gigas srb were also found to catalyze h2 production at the cathode of bioelectrochemical systems a pure culture of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough immobilized onto a carbon electrode could catalyze h2 production with methyl viologen as a redox mediator tatsumi et al 1999 lojou et al 2002 while a mediatorless microbial biocathode is more desirable for the stable operation of electrolysis systems a desulfitobacterium enriched culture without mediators at the cathode was proposed accordingly achieving four times higher h2 production rate than that of the abiotic controls villano et al 2011 furthermore the ability of desulfovibrio caledoniensis and desulfovibrio paquesii to accept electrons directly from a graphite cathode for catalyzing h2 production was demonstrated yu et al 2011 additional efforts are required for applying srb on h2 production microbial metabolic pathways for h2 production should also be investigated 4 2 hydrocarbons in addition to h2 hydrocarbons can be acquired by some incomplete oxidizer srb species production of aliphatic hydrocarbons of c10 c25 by desulfovibrio with organic or fatty acids supplementing seawater containing media was first observed by jankowski and zobell in 1944 n c25 c35 alkanes could be the major product up to 80 of the total hydrocarbons of hydrocarbon synthesized by desulfovibrio desulfuricans and acetate and formate are simultaneously formed with fixation of co2 bagaeva 1998 it has been hypothesized that during the metabolism of desulfovibrio desulfuricans acetate and formate generated from co2 are reduced to aldehydes which further undergo aldol condensation elongating the carbon chain to produce hydrocarbons synthesis of hydrocarbons by desulfovibrio desulfuricans depended significantly on the medium composition and the ratio of h2 to co2 the optimum is 9 1 in a gaseous phase bagaeva 2000 h2 could create a nutrient medium with a low potential which favors the growth of bacteria and their synthesis of reduced products including hydrocarbons the intracellular hydrocarbon synthesis potential of desulfovibrio desulfuricans ranges from 0 8 to 2 25 dry weight which is much greater than those of cyanobacteria 0 05 0 12 anaerobic phototrophic bacteria 0 005 0 006 and fungi 0 004 0 12 ladygina et al 2006 apart from desulfovibrio desulfuricans desulfovibrio desulfuricans g20 has also been reported to extracellularly synthesize alkanes friedman and rude 2012 overall many substantial obstacles remain to be addressed before srb could be used as an economically viable biocatalyst for the industrial manufacture of drop in biofuels 4 3 polyhydroxyalkanoates polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are biodegradable thermoplastics or elastomers used in industrial processes covering medicine fine chemicals implant biomaterials and biofuels anderson and dawes 1990 moita et al 2014 li and loh 2015 the first observation of stored phas in srb was in desulfonema magnum through microscopic inspection widdel et al 1983 several srb strains desulfonema magnum desulfosarcina variabilis desulfobotulus sapovorans desulfobacterium autotrophicum desulfovibrio vulgaris desulfotalea psychrophila and desulfococcus multivorans have been investigated for their pha synthesis ability in different saltwater media 1 7 and 20 nacl g l benzoate grown desulfonema magnum demonstrated the highest pha content of 88 wt wt of cell dry matter which is comparable to some of the best commercially applied organisms hai et al 2004 the pha contents in desulfobacterium autotrophicum desulfococcus multivorans desulfosarcina variabilis and desulfobotulus sapovorans were 11 27 22 and 43 wt wt of the cell dry matter respectively hai et al 2004 pha biosynthesis is governed by pha synthases which catalyze the polymerization of hydroxyalkanoic acids has into phas with concomitant release of coa rehm and steinbüchel 1999 the production cost of phas in fed batch mode using waste materials could reach up to 3 5 usd kg phas roland holst et al 2013 whereas that of oil based plastics is around 1 usd kg salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 most of the cost associated with the biosynthesis of phas is related to feedstock aeration if required sterilization maintaining pure culture and extraction of the phas optimistically sharing the costs between wastewater treatment and pha production would be an option when applying srb for instance 4 4 magnetite many organisms have been known since the early 1970s to sense the earth s magnetic field magnetite produced by microorganisms could be a potential physical indicator of biological activity in geological settings especially with an increased understanding of the conditions under which bacterial magnetite is formed schüler and frankel 1999 byrne et al 2015 the extracellular iron oxide magnetite was first regarded as a product of srb strain rs 1 by sakaguchi et al 1993 this bacterium synthesized bullet shaped magnetite with distinct crystallographic characteristics implying the existence of a unique biological regulatory system for crystal morphology chariaou et al 2015 the bacterium was identified as desulfovibrio magneticus using 16s rdna analysis sakaguchi et al 2002 the unique characteristics of desulfovibrio magneticus strain rs 1 were further revealed at the genic level nakazawa et al 2009 some of the genes which are responsible for magnetosome formation are missing in the rs 1 genome for example mami and maml encoded for controlling the synthesis of the magnetosome membrane are absent from the rs 1 genome murat et al 2010 furthermore mamgfdc and mms6 known to be involved in the regulation of crystal size and shape are also missing from rs 1 scheffel et al 2008 the mechanism of magnetite formation in strain rs 1 is still unknown lefèvre et al 2011 claimed that another srb strain bw 1 which belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class was capable of producing magnetite and greigite magnetite crystals produced by strain bw 1 were also bullet shaped but greigite crystals had irregular outlines and lacked a well defined crystal structure two magnetosome genes in the genome of strain bw 1 were identified one of the gene clusters encoding magnetosome proteins are close to those of the magnetite producer strain rs 1 and the second gene cluster encoding proteins are close to those of the greigite producer candidatus magnetoglobus multicellularis in addition to srb magnetite can be produced by other microorganisms such as geobacter and shewanella the maximum magnetite production rate reached 5 6 mg l 1 d 1 when magnetovibrio blakemorei strain mv 1 was cultivated silva et al 2013 moreover byrne et al 2015 successfully scaled up a laboratory scale magnetite production process to a pilot scale using geobacter sulfurreducens with a production rate of 2400 mg l 1 d 1 although the magnetite production of srb strains is currently limited capabilities for recovering magnetite have been well demonstrated and await further investigation and optimization 4 5 metal sulfides metal sulfides are extensively applied in industrial processes owing to their unique characteristics such as hydrocracking in fuel refineries hydroprocessing and oxygen reduction in fuel cells cui et al 2011 lai et al 2012 da costa et al 2016 at the nanoscale 1 100 nm metal sulfides can be further applied in cancer therapy photocatalysis optoelectronics and as anti microbial agents in textile modification technologies yang et al 2015 hong et al 2014 those metal sulfides that are commercially available are generally synthesized through methods including high gravity chemical baths γ radiation pyrolysis and thermolysis of metal complexes da costa et al 2016 high temperature and high pressure are essential in those processes and the use of hazardous chemicals surface stabilizer trioctylphosphine oxide cannot be avoided in contrast the biological production of metal sulfides is a safe cost effective and environmentally friendly synthesis method for instance cadmium sulfide cds nanoparticles of 8 nm were intracellularly synthesized by photosynthetic bacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris and e coli also are capable of producing intracellular cds nanocrystals of 2 5 nm bai and zhang 2009 sweeney et al 2004 sulfide is the product of sulfate reduction mediated by srb which can extracellularly bind to or precipitate with metal ions in solution valuable metal sulfides produced via srb metabolism are summarized in table 9 two strategies are executed when srb are applied in metal sulfide production the metal directly reacts with the sulfide in the sulfidogenic system in line system or sulfide is produced and separated as a metal precipitant agent off line system peltier et al 2011 showed that the zinc sulfide zns precipitates formed in the system of desulfovibrio sulfuricans are more stable than the abiotic zns precipitates the biogenic ni3s2 in a mixed culture of srb exhibits a better crystallinity than the corresponding abiotic samples gramp et al 2007 aggregation induced by metal binding polypeptides and proteins of organisms in the in line system limited the dispersal of metal sulfide particles in the solution reducing the potential to harvest those particles moreau et al 2007 in addition the adsorptive extracellular polymeric substances such as carboxyl thiol phosphate and amino hydroxyl of srb would obstruct the formation of metal sulfides yue et al 2015 therefore harvesting biogenic metal sulfides from sulfidogenic off line systems could be a better option particularly in the treatment of metal containing wastewater thioteq paques and biosulfide bioteq are two state of the art off line systems for metal sulfide recovery in amd treatment a modular bioreactor for selective metal recovery from amd using an off line sulfidogenic system was proposed by hedrich and johnson 2014 in which ph control is crucial for metal sulfides formation for instance with a ph value 3 cu can be selectively precipitated by sulfide while other metals fe and zn are present in significant concentrations in the leach liquors falagán et al 2017 furthermore binding characteristics of metals are also sensitive to changes in ph for example the nature surface and settling characteristics of the copper sulfide cus and zns are strongly influenced by the bulk ph lewis 2010 mokone et al 2010 when precipitation was conducted with excess sulfide at operational ph values 6 the zeta potential would reduce and the settling and dewatering properties of the zns precipitates would improve crystallinity of the metal sulfides is of utmost importance particularly when they are used in high tech industrial processes such as solar panel construction as the spatial separation of charges is crucial in the design of efficient donor acceptor heterojunctions bansal et al 2013 factors determining crystallinity in sulfidogenic systems are not clear yet although a better crystallinity of zns was obtained with desulfovibrio desulfuricans than in the abiogenic tests xu et al 2016 mineral crystallinity deserves systematic investigations to achieve metal sulfides biological production in off line sulfidogenic systems and to realize the recovery of valuable resources from waste streams 5 conclusions this paper systematically reviews the sulfate reduction process and summarizes the different types of metabolism of srb in terms of the energy sources metabolic pathways including electron transport phosphorylation and substrate level phosphorylation and the demonstrations of extracellular electron transfer mediated by anme and electrodes are discussed different electron donors not only influence the sulfate reduction rate via triggering various metabolic pathways but also determine the treatment efficiency of targeted pollutants to some extent accordingly the characteristics of the substrate should be considered before implementing a srb mediated process to ensure effective performance extracellular electron transfer associated with srb should be further investigated for practical application the ability of srb to survive and perform in extreme ph temperature and salinity conditions allows srb based technologies to be applied for the treatment of wastewaters from various industrial processes in addition because of their unique characteristics srb offer an excellent opportunity for sustainable and environmentally friendly resources recovery from waste streams of the resources that could potentially be recovered metal sulfides that are extracellularly synthesized appear to be the most feasible but more detailed study and exploration are required for specific cases declaration of interest statement there are no conflicts of interest to declare

19107,although oxidation of as iii to as v is deemed necessary to promote arsenic removal the oxidation process usually involves toxic byproducts well defined conditions energy input or sludge generation moreover extra operations are required to remove the resulting as v a heterogeneous catalytic process of cufe2o4 with peroxymonosulfate pms is established for as iii oxidation and adsorption the pms can be activated by cufe2o4 to generate radical species for as iii oxidation the cufe2o4 pms has a stronger affinity for arsenic than cufe2o4 alone oxidation and adsorption promote each other as a result the heterogeneous catalytic process is more efficient for as iii removal than a preoxidation of as iii followed by adsorption the adsorption capacity for as on cufe2o4 pms reached up to 63 9 mg g which is much higher than that of as iii 36 9 mg g or as v 45 4 mg g on cufe2o4 alone the process can work effectively over a wide range of ph values 3 9 and temperatures 10 40 c coexisting ions such as sulfate carbonate silicate and humic acid have an insignificant effect on as iii removal the as iii 1415 μg l can be completely oxidized to as v and rapidly removed to below 10 μg l less than 15 min using cufe2o4 0 2 g l pms 100 μm moreover the as iii 50 μg l can be completely oxidized and removed within 1 min the proposed process is easily applicable for the remediation of as iii contaminated water under ambient conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenite oxidation adsorption efficient removal 1 introduction arsenic as is a highly toxic substance in the aquatic environment millions of people are being exposed to the threat of arsenic because of the natural and anthropogenic release of arsenic amini et al 2008 nordstrom 2002 in natural water arsenic exists mostly in two oxidation states as iii and as v cullen and reimer 1989 francesconi and kuehnelt 2002 the dominant arsenic species in groundwater is as iii chang et al 2010 sorg et al 2014 which is more mobile and higher toxic than as v jain and ali 2000 reliable and economical methods for efficient removal of as iii in groundwater are urgently needed various methods have been employed to remove as iii from contaminated water choong et al 2007 hering et al 2017 singh et al 2015 adsorption is an attractive method due to its simple operation and low cost zhang et al 2013a many types of adsorbents have been developed especially nano adsorbents lata and samadder 2016 tang et al 2013 however as iii usually has lower affinity for adsorbents relative to as v and direct adsorption of as iii is difficult to meet the standard of arsenic in drinking water max contaminant level mcl 10 μg l dixit and hering 2003 zhang et al 2018 therefore a preoxidation of as iii to as v is necessary to reduce its toxicity and mobility thus achieving higher removal efficiencies moon et al 2017 shan and tong 2013 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 diverse processes have been developed for as iii oxidation such as chemical oxidants chlorine permanganate etc sorlini and gialdini 2010 and advanced oxidation processes aops uv h2o2 sorlini et al 2010 fenton reaction hug and leupin 2003 uv nitrite kim et al 2014 uv peroxydisulfate neppolian et al 2008 and pms wang et al 2014 the major concern for conventional chemical oxidants chlorine chloramine and ozone is the potential generation of toxic byproducts such as trihalomethane nitrosoamine and bromate sharma and sohn 2009 the uv based aops require special reaction devices drawbacks of fenton process are its strong ph dependence and sludge generation in contrast pms is a relatively benign oxidant because its end products so4 2 are normally inert and nonpolluting additionally solid pms is easier to handle compared to liquid or gas oxidants however the direct oxidation of as iii by pms is limited and time consuming although it can be enhanced with the aid of other chemicals or energy input e g fe ii aromatic compounds light and heat the generation of sludge and toxic byproducts may cause secondary pollution moreover extra processes are required to remove the resulting as v and residual as iii heterogeneous catalytic process coupling oxidation with adsorption will simplify the overall removal process kim et al 2015 önnby et al 2014 voegelin and hug 2003 metal oxides are a major class of catalysts used in heterogeneous oxidation process lei et al 2015 meanwhile they can work as efficient adsorbents for arsenic adsorption lata and samadder 2016 among various metal oxides cufe2o4 holds considerable promise due to not only its high stability and environmental benignity but also the reactivity in activating pms to produce radicals zhang et al 2013b in addition cufe2o4 can be magnetically separated from water therefore the integration of cufe2o4 with pms would provide a new strategy for the oxidation and removal of as iii this work aims to investigate the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms the process possesses some advantages integration of oxidation and adsorption for arsenic removal stable solid form for convenient operation and fast magnetic separation the as iii removal by cufe2o4 pms was examined by batch experiments the effect of solution chemistry on as iii removal was investigated the removal mechanism involving adsorption and oxidation is proposed such an integrated process of cufe2o4 pms without sludge generation and energy input is attractive for fast and efficient removal of as iii from water 2 experimental methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 and humic acid ha were purchased from shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd ferrous nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o copper nitrate cu no3 2 3h2o citric acid monohydrate c6h8o7 h2o and other chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china as v stock solution was prepared with deionized water using na3aso4 12h2o as iii stock solution was prepared with naoh solution using as2o3 as v and as iii working solutions were freshly prepared by diluting arsenic stock solutions with deionized water 2 2 synthesis of cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 particles were synthesized using a modified protocol li et al 2003 briefly 0 01 m copper nitrate 0 02 m ferrous nitrate and 0 03 m citric acid monohydrate were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring then the water was evaporated at 90 c to get a viscous gel the gel was calcined in an air atmosphere at 300 c for 4 h the calcined solid was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 24 h 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in a brown glass bottle typically a specific amount of 0 1 m pms solution was added into 30 ml of deionized water or multi component solution so4 2 50 mg l co3 2 50 mg l cl 50 mg l sio3 2 10 mg l no3 5 mg l the initial ph values were adjusted with hcl or naoh solution then a specific amount of cufe2o4 was added to the above solution after mixing for 1 min an as iii stock solution was added the suspension was stirred at 30 c under 160 rpm for a specific amount of time the total arsenic concentration was measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro blue sop germany the as iii was determined by an atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument inc china all experiments were repeated three times the effect of ions on the as iii removal was examined in the presence of na2co3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nano3 and nacl 2 4 characterizations the morphology of the samples was observed by a hitachi s 4800 scanning electron microscope japan operating at 3 0 kv transmission electron microscope tem tecnai g2 f20 usa equipped with x ray dispersive spectroscopy eds system was used to investigate the structure and composition of the samples the crystal phases of the samples were collected on an x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation xrd m21x mac science ltd japan the surface chemistry properties of the adsorbent before and after the adsorption process were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha 1063 thermo fisher scientific england and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker tensor 27 the ph values at the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent were measured in a series of 0 01 m nacl with different initial ph the brunauer emmett teller specific surface areas sbet were measured on belsorp mini ii analyzer japan magnetic property was measured with an ldj9600 magnetometer at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cufe2o4 fig 1 a illustrated the sem image of the cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 nanoclusters consisted of nanoparticles in size of approximately 10 nm inset fig 1a the eds analysis verified the presence of cu fe and o with an approximate atomic ratio of 1 2 4 fig s1 supporting information the high resolution tem hrtem image of cufe2o4 showed the 311 plane of spinel cufe2o4 with the d spacing of 0 2524 nm fig s2 zhu et al 2013 the xrd pattern further confirmed that these nanoparticles were made of spinel cufe2o4 pdf no 77 0010 fig 1b the sbet of the cufe2o4 particles was approximately 110 49 m2 g fig s3 the phpzc of cufe2o4 was around 6 7 fig s4 the magnetic measurement showed that the cufe2o4 was superparamagnetic with a magnetization saturation value of 14 7 emu g fig s5 indicating that the adsorbent could be easily separated from water using an external magnet 3 2 arsenic removal kinetics the kinetic curves of as iii removal from the multi component arsenic solution containing various competing substances by cufe2o4 with different amount of pms are shown in fig 2 a compared with cufe2o4 alone cufe2o4 pms markedly enhanced the as iii removal and the as iii removal was enhanced with increasing pms concentration fig s6 the removal efficiency of as iii c 0 971 μg l within 40 min was 49 7 by cufe2o4 alone 0 2 g l and reached to 92 6 after adding 20 μm pms significantly the removal efficiency of as iii reached up to 99 5 within 40 min when adding 100 μm pms and the residue arsenic in the solution was decreased to below 10 μg l the kinetics data of arsenic adsorption were fitted by pseudo first order model eq 1 and pseudo second order model eq 2 1 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 2 q t q e 1 1 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g are the amount of total arsenic adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min are the adsorption rate constants the fitting kinetics parameters are summarized in table s1 the data were well described by the pseudo second order model indicating that the arsenic adsorption might be a chemisorption process luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a the k 2 value was significantly increased from 0 320 to 1 009 g mg min as pms increased from 0 to 500 μm indicating that pms could accelerate as iii removal to confirm the promotion effect of pms on as iii removal by cufe2o4 the adsorption was performed without pms in the first 40 min and then pms was added fig 2b the adsorption reached equilibrium with about 47 9 of removal efficiency within the first 40 min c 0 971 μg l significantly the residual arsenic in solution was rapidly reduced to below 10 μg l as the pms 100 μm was added the results demonstrated that pms did promote as iii removal by cufe2o4 such an enhancement in as iii removal may be attributed to the transformation of as iii to as v to verify the hypothesis the adsorption kinetics of as v was studied the removal efficiency of as v by cufe2o4 alone was 90 2 within 40 min fig 2c which was higher than that of as iii by cufe2o4 alone and the k 2 for as v adsorption was higher than that for as iii adsorption 0 353 vs 0 320 g mg min when pms was added the removal efficiency of as v by cufe2o4 was increased to 97 0 however it was still lower than that of as iii by cufe2o4 pms therefore the in situ oxidation and adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms was more efficient for as iii removal than the divided process of preoxidation and adsorption the results indicated that pms probably hoisted the adsorption capacity of cufe2o4 the structure and surface chemistry of cufe2o4 with or without pms treatment were characterized the surface area virgin 110 5 m2 g 1 pms treated 112 9 m2 g 1 and crystal structure of cufe2o4 did not change fig s7 compared to virgin cufe2o4 the pms treated cufe2o4 showed a red shift in the diffuse uv visible reflectance spectra fig s8 the change in surface properties might create new adsorption sites to enhance the adsorption of both as iii and as v on cufe2o4 considering the relatively low arsenic concentration in natural groundwater the removal of as iii c 0 50 800 μg l by cufe2o4 pms was examined fig 2d attractively the arsenic in all the water samples could be rapidly reduced to below 10 μg l within 15 min especially 50 μg l as iii could be completely removed within 1 min significantly the as iii concentration rapidly dropped from 100 μg l to below 10 μg l within 2 min using a low adsorbent dose of 0 04 g l fig s9 these results indicated that the cufe2o4 pms system is highly feasible to remove as iii in a wide concentration range in actual water 3 3 arsenic removal isotherms in different water matrices fig 3 a and b shows the isotherms of as iii v adsorption by cufe2o4 with or without pms in arsenic spiked deionized water and multi component arsenic solution respectively langmuir eq 3 and freundlich models eq 4 were used to describe the adsorption isotherms 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where c e mg l is the equilibrium arsenic concentration in solution q e mg g is the amount of arsenic adsorbed on adsorbents q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity k l is the langmuir constant of adsorption and k f and n are the freundlich constants of adsorption the adsorption constants are listed in table s2 for the two water matrices the adsorption isotherm data were better fitted with freundlich model than langmuir model meaning an irreversible adsorption on heterogeneous adsorption sites impressively the adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms was better than the direct adsorption of as iii or as v just by cufe2o4 agreeing well with the kinetics results fig 2c for the arsenic spiked deionized water the q max of cufe2o4 pms for as iii from the langmuir model was 63 9 mg g in fact the q max should be higher because the maximal experimental q e was 66 8 mg g and did not reach a plateau the adsorption capacity of as iii on cufe2o4 pms is higher than that on many metal oxide adsorbents reported especially in neutral aqueous solution table s3 3 4 effect of solution chemistry the effect of ph on as iii removal by cufe2o4 pms is shown in fig 4 a the as iii removal was very effective under acidic and neutral conditions and the arsenic concentration was dramatically reduced from 1415 μg l to below 10 μg l within 40 min the as iii removal decreased obviously as the ph increased from 6 8 to 9 2 and the as iii removal was almost fully suppressed when the ph increased to 11 the surface of cufe2o4 was negatively charged when the ph was above the phpzc of cufe2o4 phpzc 6 7 the as iii removal at the ph above phpzc would be weakened by the electrostatic repulsion between arsenate anions h2aso4 and haso4 2 and negatively charged cufe2o4 fig 4b shows the effect of some ubiquitous anions such as so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 and po4 3 on as iii removal the removal kinetics are depicted in fig s10 so4 2 and co3 2 had a negligible effect on as iii removal even at high concentration levels because these ions were adsorbed mainly by electrostatic attraction while the driving force of arsenic adsorption on metal oxides was chemical adsorption gu et al 2016 sio3 2 is usually regarded as a strongly interfering substance for as iii adsorption onto metal hydr oxides christl et al 2012 however the presence of sio3 2 hardly inhibited the removal of as iii even if its concentration was as high as 50 mg l in contrast the presence of po4 3 severely inhibited the as iii removal because po4 3 had a similar adsorption mechanism with arsenate due to their considerable chemical similarity roberts et al 2004 humic acid ha widely exists in natural water fig 4c shows the effect of ha on the removal of as iii ha had no obvious effect on the as iii removal the arsenic concentration decreased to below 10 μg l within 40 min even at 20 mg l ha in addition the temperature variation 10 40 c did not influence the as iii removal fig 4d the result indicated that the cufe2o4 pms system was highly efficient for as iii removal in a wide temperature range ionic strength is known to significantly influence outer sphere interactions between solute and adsorbent surface but not affect inner sphere complexation stumm 1992 the ionic strength nacl showed a negligible effect on as iii removal fig s11 the result indicated that the arsenic adsorption onto cufe2o4 followed the inner sphere complex mechanism 3 5 as iii removal mechanism the ft ir was performed to examine the interactions between arsenic and cufe2o4 fig 5 a as iii adsorption onto cufe2o4 pms had a similar ft ir spectrum with as v adsorption onto cufe2o4 the peak at 823 cm 1 was ascribed to ν asv o m tang et al 2013 the result indicated that the as iii on cufe2o4 pms was in the form of as v and the arsenic adsorption on cufe2o4 followed the inner sphere complex mechanism in contrast there appeared two peaks at 823 cm 1 and 762 cm 1 during as iii adsorption by cufe2o4 alone which indicated that the adsorbed as iii was partly converted to as v at ph 7 the dominant as iii species in aqueous solution is as oh 3 which has no ir absorption in a range of 750 800 cm 1 goldberg and johnston 2001 the peak at 762 cm 1 would logically result from the formation of an inner sphere surface complex of as iii the as 3d xps spectra were investigated to further reveal the arsenic species on cufe2o4 as shown in fig 5b the arsenic adsorbed on cufe2o4 pms was in the form of as v namely the adsorbed as iii was completely oxidized to as v in contrast the adsorbed as iii by cufe2o4 alone was partly oxidized to as v these results were in good agreement with the ftir results the surface hydroxyl groups oh on metal oxide adsorbents play a key role in arsenic adsorption there are three possible inner sphere arsenic complexes bidentate binuclear bidentate mononuclear and monodentate mononuclear complexes fig s12 arai et al 2001 manning and goldberg 1997 the stoichiometric ratio of surface hydroxyl between fresh cufe2o4 and the cufe2o4 saturated with arsenic was 1 2 for a monodentate surface complex and 2 1 for a bidentate complex the o 1s xps spectra of cufe2o4 before or after adsorbing arsenic are shown in fig 5c and the fitted data are listed in table s4 the ratio of oh o2 of cufe2o4 increased from 20 9 to 38 1 31 0 and 33 0 after adsorbing as iii as v and as iii pms respectively the increase in oh o2 ratio indicated that the arsenic adsorption was mainly through the formation of monodentate mononuclear complex goh et al 2009 zhang et al 2005 the higher oh o2 value after as iii adsorption than as v adsorption indicated that monodentate mononuclear complex was more significant in as iii adsorption the higher proportion of oh o2 for as iii pms adsorption than as v adsorption indicated that the adsorbed as iii maintained the monodentate mononuclear complex after oxidation obviously the monodentate mononuclear complex mechanism can effectively increase the utilization of adsorption sites fig s12a 3 6 as iii oxidation mechanism the arsenic species in solution were monitored to better understand the as iii oxidation by cufe2o4 pms fig 6 a as v emerged at the beginning of the reaction and the concentration peaked at 2 min which indicated that as iii could be oxidized to as v at the initial reaction stage the as iii was almost completely transformed into as v within 5 min note that the concentration of as iii sharply decreased within 2 min which was much faster than the generation of as v this indicated that the adsorption was faster than oxidation in the early stages the as iii oxidation kinetics could be well fitted by pseudo first order model r2 0 9953 and the apparent rate constant was 0 9270 min 1 fig s13 in contrast negligible as v was detected in the solution in the absence of pms fig s14 the oxidative activity of pms was evaluated by the oxidation kinetics of as iii by pms alone fig 6b the data could be well fitted by pseudo first order model r2 9887 and the apparent rate constant was 0 0201 min 1 fig s15 the as v concentration increased with prolonging reaction time but the as iii could not be fully oxidized to as v within 40 min thus the complete oxidation of as iii by cufe2o4 pms indicated the presence of other reactive species besides pms itself in the solution it is reported that pms can be induced by cufe2o4 to generate powerful radicals for degradation of organic pollutants eqs 5 9 guan et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b additionally the formed cu iii during the reaction eq 6 could react with h2o to generate ho eq 10 lei et al 2015 5 cu ii oh hso5 cu ii ho oso3 oh 6 cu ii ho oso3 cu iii oh so4 7 so4 oh so4 2 ho 8 cu iii oh hso5 cu ii ooso3 h2o 9 2 cu ii ooso3 2h2o 2 cu ii oh 2so4 o2 2h 10 cu iii oh h2o cu ii oh ho h coumarin was used as a probe molecule of ho radicals louit et al 2005 as shown in fig s16 a fluorescence of 7 hydroxycoumarin the oxidation product of coumarin by ho at 450 nm was detected in the cufe2o4 pms system indicative of the generation of ho electron spin resonance esr test was performed to detect radicals using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as an indicator fig 6c lei et al 2015 the result clearly demonstrated the existence of both ho and so4 radicals in the cufe2o4 pms system various radical scavengers were used to evaluate the contribution of the radicals to the as iii removal ho can be scavenged by tert butanol tba k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 and formic acid fa k oh 1 9 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 methanol can scavenge both ho meoh k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 and so4 k so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 dogliotti and hayon 1967 to clearly observe the effect of scavenger addition the initial concentration of as iii was set at a high level of 7 1 mg l and the pms concentration maintained 100 μm as shown in fig 6d the removal of as iii was decreased when the scavengers were added indicating that these free radicals were indeed involved in the as iii oxidation note that although the removal of as iii was reduced after scavenger addition it was still greater than that for the case without pms besides pms itself the surface adsorbed radicals may be also potential active species for as iii oxidation it is reported that surface adsorbed radicals could be hardly quenched by scavengers huang et al 2017 lei et al 2015 to confirm the existence of surface adsorbed radicals the esr tests were performed by adding radical scavengers to the solution as shown in fig s16 when adding 500 mm tba or meoh the intensity of dmpo adducts in the cufe2o4 pms system decreased but remained recognizable this result indicated that there were the surface adsorbed radicals which could oxidize as iii even at high concentrations of scavengers due to the contributions of surface adsorbed radicals and pms itself the removal of low concentration as iii 1 415 mg l was hardly inhibited by the radical scavengers tba and meoh fig s18 in summary the radicals free or adsorbed ho and so4 as well as pms itself accounted for the oxidation of as iii 3 7 as iii removal in natural groundwater and reusability of cufe2o4 considering that natural groundwater is more complex than deionized water the adsorption of as iii in well water was conducted the groundwater quality analysis is presented in table s5 approximately 98 of as iii c 0 174 μg l was removed within only 5 min using 0 2 g l cufe2o4 with 13 μm pms and the residual arsenic in water was 3 67 μg l fig 7 a therefore the cufe2o4 pms system is highly feasible for fast removal of as iii from natural groundwater fig 7b shows the recycling of cufe2o4 0 2 g l pms 100 μm for as iii removal c 0 1415 μg l after each adsorption cycle cufe2o4 was magnetically separated and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh 5 ml for 30 mg cufe2o4 during the regeneration process almost no dissolution of iron and copper occurred the as iii removal efficiency maintained 96 within 40 min in the fourth cycle and the residual arsenic concentration was below 10 μg l although the residual arsenic was slightly above 10 μg l within 40 min in the fifth cycle the residual arsenic could be further reduced by appropriately prolonging contact time 4 conclusions this study establishes a heterogeneous catalytic process cufe2o4 pms for efficient oxidation and fast removal of as iii from water the cufe2o4 can react with pms to generate powerful radicals for as iii oxidation but also effectively sequestrate both as iii and as v this proposed process is more efficient for as iii removal than a preoxidation of as iii followed by adsorption cufe2o4 pms has a much larger adsorption capacity for as iii than cufe2o4 alone for as iii or as v this process can achieve fast removal of as iii from water to meet the drinking water standard c 0 as

19107,although oxidation of as iii to as v is deemed necessary to promote arsenic removal the oxidation process usually involves toxic byproducts well defined conditions energy input or sludge generation moreover extra operations are required to remove the resulting as v a heterogeneous catalytic process of cufe2o4 with peroxymonosulfate pms is established for as iii oxidation and adsorption the pms can be activated by cufe2o4 to generate radical species for as iii oxidation the cufe2o4 pms has a stronger affinity for arsenic than cufe2o4 alone oxidation and adsorption promote each other as a result the heterogeneous catalytic process is more efficient for as iii removal than a preoxidation of as iii followed by adsorption the adsorption capacity for as on cufe2o4 pms reached up to 63 9 mg g which is much higher than that of as iii 36 9 mg g or as v 45 4 mg g on cufe2o4 alone the process can work effectively over a wide range of ph values 3 9 and temperatures 10 40 c coexisting ions such as sulfate carbonate silicate and humic acid have an insignificant effect on as iii removal the as iii 1415 μg l can be completely oxidized to as v and rapidly removed to below 10 μg l less than 15 min using cufe2o4 0 2 g l pms 100 μm moreover the as iii 50 μg l can be completely oxidized and removed within 1 min the proposed process is easily applicable for the remediation of as iii contaminated water under ambient conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenite oxidation adsorption efficient removal 1 introduction arsenic as is a highly toxic substance in the aquatic environment millions of people are being exposed to the threat of arsenic because of the natural and anthropogenic release of arsenic amini et al 2008 nordstrom 2002 in natural water arsenic exists mostly in two oxidation states as iii and as v cullen and reimer 1989 francesconi and kuehnelt 2002 the dominant arsenic species in groundwater is as iii chang et al 2010 sorg et al 2014 which is more mobile and higher toxic than as v jain and ali 2000 reliable and economical methods for efficient removal of as iii in groundwater are urgently needed various methods have been employed to remove as iii from contaminated water choong et al 2007 hering et al 2017 singh et al 2015 adsorption is an attractive method due to its simple operation and low cost zhang et al 2013a many types of adsorbents have been developed especially nano adsorbents lata and samadder 2016 tang et al 2013 however as iii usually has lower affinity for adsorbents relative to as v and direct adsorption of as iii is difficult to meet the standard of arsenic in drinking water max contaminant level mcl 10 μg l dixit and hering 2003 zhang et al 2018 therefore a preoxidation of as iii to as v is necessary to reduce its toxicity and mobility thus achieving higher removal efficiencies moon et al 2017 shan and tong 2013 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 diverse processes have been developed for as iii oxidation such as chemical oxidants chlorine permanganate etc sorlini and gialdini 2010 and advanced oxidation processes aops uv h2o2 sorlini et al 2010 fenton reaction hug and leupin 2003 uv nitrite kim et al 2014 uv peroxydisulfate neppolian et al 2008 and pms wang et al 2014 the major concern for conventional chemical oxidants chlorine chloramine and ozone is the potential generation of toxic byproducts such as trihalomethane nitrosoamine and bromate sharma and sohn 2009 the uv based aops require special reaction devices drawbacks of fenton process are its strong ph dependence and sludge generation in contrast pms is a relatively benign oxidant because its end products so4 2 are normally inert and nonpolluting additionally solid pms is easier to handle compared to liquid or gas oxidants however the direct oxidation of as iii by pms is limited and time consuming although it can be enhanced with the aid of other chemicals or energy input e g fe ii aromatic compounds light and heat the generation of sludge and toxic byproducts may cause secondary pollution moreover extra processes are required to remove the resulting as v and residual as iii heterogeneous catalytic process coupling oxidation with adsorption will simplify the overall removal process kim et al 2015 önnby et al 2014 voegelin and hug 2003 metal oxides are a major class of catalysts used in heterogeneous oxidation process lei et al 2015 meanwhile they can work as efficient adsorbents for arsenic adsorption lata and samadder 2016 among various metal oxides cufe2o4 holds considerable promise due to not only its high stability and environmental benignity but also the reactivity in activating pms to produce radicals zhang et al 2013b in addition cufe2o4 can be magnetically separated from water therefore the integration of cufe2o4 with pms would provide a new strategy for the oxidation and removal of as iii this work aims to investigate the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms the process possesses some advantages integration of oxidation and adsorption for arsenic removal stable solid form for convenient operation and fast magnetic separation the as iii removal by cufe2o4 pms was examined by batch experiments the effect of solution chemistry on as iii removal was investigated the removal mechanism involving adsorption and oxidation is proposed such an integrated process of cufe2o4 pms without sludge generation and energy input is attractive for fast and efficient removal of as iii from water 2 experimental methods 2 1 chemicals all

with deionized water using na3aso4 12h2o as iii stock solution was prepared with naoh solution using as2o3 as v and as iii working solutions were freshly prepared by diluting arsenic stock solutions with deionized water 2 2 synthesis of cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 particles were synthesized using a modified protocol li et al 2003 briefly 0 01 m copper nitrate 0 02 m ferrous nitrate and 0 03 m citric acid monohydrate were dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring then the water was evaporated at 90 c to get a viscous gel the gel was calcined in an air atmosphere at 300 c for 4 h the calcined solid was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 24 h 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in a brown glass bottle typically a specific amount of

naoh solution then a specific amount of cufe2o4 was added to the above solution after mixing for 1 min an as iii stock solution was added the suspension was stirred at 30 c under 160 rpm for a specific amount of time the total arsenic concentration was measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro blue sop germany the as iii was determined by an atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument inc china all experiments were repeated three times the effect of ions on the as iii removal was examined in the presence of na2co3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nano3 and nacl 2 4 characterizations the morphology of the samples was observed by a hitachi s 4800 scanning electron microscope japan operating at 3 0 kv transmission electron microscope tem tecnai g2 f20 usa equipped with x ray dispersive spectroscopy eds system was used to investigate the structure and composition of the samples the crystal phases of the samples were collected on an x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation xrd m21x mac science ltd japan the surface chemistry properties of the adsorbent before and after the adsorption process were determined

of the adsorbent were measured in a series of 0 01 m nacl with different initial ph the brunauer emmett teller specific surface areas sbet were measured on belsorp mini ii analyzer japan magnetic property was measured with an ldj9600 magnetometer at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cufe2o4 fig 1 a illustrated the sem image of the cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 nanoclusters consisted of nanoparticles in size of approximately 10 nm inset fig 1a the eds analysis verified the presence of cu fe and o with an approximate atomic ratio of 1 2 4 fig s1 supporting information the high resolution tem hrtem image of cufe2o4 showed the 311 plane of spinel cufe2o4 with the d spacing of 0 2524 nm fig s2 zhu et al 2013 the xrd pattern further confirmed that these nanoparticles were made of spinel cufe2o4 pdf no 77 0010 fig 1b the sbet of the cufe2o4 particles was approximately 110 49 m2 g fig s3 the phpzc of cufe2o4 was around 6 7 fig s4 the magnetic measurement showed that the cufe2o4 was superparamagnetic with a magnetization saturation value of 14 7 emu g fig s5 indicating that the adsorbent could be easily separated from water using an external magnet 3 2 arsenic removal kinetics the kinetic curves of as iii removal from the multi component arsenic solution containing various competing substances by cufe2o4 with different amount of pms are shown in fig 2 a compared with cufe2o4 alone cufe2o4 pms markedly enhanced the as iii removal and the as iii removal was enhanced with increasing pms concentration fig s6 the removal efficiency of as iii c 0 971 μg l within 40 min was 49 7 by cufe2o4 alone 0 2 g l and reached to 92 6 after adding 20 μm pms significantly the removal efficiency of as iii reached up to 99 5 within 40 min when adding 100 μm pms and the residue arsenic in the solution was decreased to below 10 μg l the kinetics data of arsenic adsorption were fitted by pseudo first order model eq 1 and pseudo second order model eq 2 1 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 2 q t q e 1 1 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g are the amount of total arsenic adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min are the adsorption rate constants the fitting kinetics parameters are summarized in table s1 the data were well described by the pseudo second order model indicating that the arsenic adsorption might be a chemisorption process luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a the k 2 value was significantly increased from 0 320 to 1 009 g mg min as pms increased from 0 to 500 μm indicating that pms could accelerate as iii removal to confirm the promotion effect of pms on as iii removal by cufe2o4 the adsorption was performed without pms in the first 40 min and then pms was added fig 2b the adsorption reached equilibrium with about 47 9 of removal efficiency within the first 40 min c 0 971 μg l significantly the residual arsenic in solution was rapidly reduced to below 10 μg l as the pms 100 μm was added the results demonstrated that pms did promote as iii removal by cufe2o4 such an enhancement in as iii removal may be attributed to the transformation of as iii to as v to verify the hypothesis the adsorption kinetics of as v was studied the removal efficiency of as v by cufe2o4 alone was 90 2 within 40 min fig 2c which was higher than that of as iii by cufe2o4 alone and the k 2 for as v adsorption was higher than that for as iii adsorption 0 353 vs 0 320 g mg min when pms was added the removal efficiency of as v by cufe2o4 was increased to 97 0 however it was still lower than that of as iii by cufe2o4 pms therefore the in situ oxidation and adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms was more efficient for as iii removal than the divided process of preoxidation and adsorption the results indicated that pms probably hoisted the adsorption capacity of cufe2o4 the structure and surface chemistry of cufe2o4 with or without pms treatment were characterized the surface area virgin 110 5 m2 g 1 pms treated 112 9 m2 g 1 and crystal structure of cufe2o4 did not change fig s7 compared to virgin cufe2o4 the pms treated cufe2o4 showed a red shift in the diffuse uv visible reflectance spectra fig s8 the change in surface properties might create new adsorption sites to enhance the adsorption of both as iii and as v on cufe2o4 considering the relatively low arsenic concentration in natural groundwater the removal of as iii c 0 50 800 μg l by cufe2o4 pms was examined fig 2d attractively the arsenic in all the water samples could be rapidly reduced to below 10 μg l within 15 min especially 50 μg l as iii could be completely removed within 1 min significantly the as iii concentration rapidly dropped from 100 μg l to below 10 μg l within 2 min using a low adsorbent dose of 0 04 g l fig s9 these results indicated that the cufe2o4 pms system is highly feasible to remove as iii in a wide concentration range in actual water 3 3 arsenic removal isotherms in different water matrices fig 3 a and b shows the isotherms of as iii v adsorption by cufe2o4 with or without pms in arsenic spiked deionized water and multi component arsenic solution respectively langmuir eq 3 and freundlich models eq 4 were used to describe the adsorption isotherms 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where c e mg l is the equilibrium arsenic concentration in solution q e mg g is the amount of arsenic adsorbed on adsorbents q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity k l is the langmuir constant of adsorption and k f and n are the freundlich constants of adsorption the adsorption constants are listed in table s2 for the two water matrices the adsorption isotherm data were better fitted with freundlich model than langmuir model meaning an irreversible adsorption on heterogeneous adsorption sites impressively the adsorption of as iii by cufe2o4 pms was better than the direct adsorption of as iii or as v just by cufe2o4 agreeing well with the kinetics results fig 2c for the arsenic spiked deionized water the q max of cufe2o4 pms for as iii from the langmuir model was 63 9 mg g in fact the q max should be higher because the maximal experimental q e was 66 8 mg g and did not reach a plateau the adsorption capacity of as iii on cufe2o4 pms is higher than that on many metal oxide adsorbents reported especially in neutral aqueous solution table s3 3 4 effect of solution chemistry the effect of ph on as iii removal by cufe2o4 pms is shown in fig 4 a the as iii removal was very effective under acidic and neutral conditions and the arsenic concentration was dramatically reduced from 1415 μg l to below 10 μg l within 40 min the as iii removal decreased obviously as the ph increased from 6 8 to 9 2 and the as iii removal was almost fully suppressed when the ph increased to 11 the surface of cufe2o4 was negatively charged when the ph was above the phpzc of cufe2o4 phpzc 6 7 the as iii removal at the ph above phpzc would be weakened by the electrostatic repulsion between arsenate anions h2aso4 and haso4 2 and negatively charged cufe2o4 fig 4b shows the effect of some ubiquitous anions such as so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 and po4 3 on as iii removal the removal kinetics are depicted in fig s10 so4 2 and co3 2 had a negligible effect on as iii removal even at high concentration levels because these ions were adsorbed mainly by electrostatic attraction while the driving force of arsenic adsorption on metal oxides was chemical adsorption gu et al 2016 sio3 2 is usually regarded as a strongly interfering substance for as iii adsorption onto metal hydr oxides christl et al 2012 however the presence of sio3 2 hardly inhibited the removal of as iii even if its concentration was as high as 50 mg l in contrast the presence of po4 3 severely inhibited the as iii removal because po4 3 had a similar adsorption mechanism with arsenate due to their considerable chemical similarity roberts et al 2004 humic acid ha widely exists in natural water fig 4c shows the effect of ha on the removal of as iii ha had no obvious effect on the as iii removal the arsenic concentration decreased to below 10 μg l within 40 min even at 20 mg l ha in addition the temperature variation 10 40 c did not influence the as iii removal fig 4d the result indicated that the cufe2o4 pms system was highly efficient for as iii removal in a wide temperature range ionic strength is known to significantly influence outer sphere interactions between solute and adsorbent surface but not affect inner sphere complexation stumm 1992 the ionic strength nacl showed a negligible effect on as iii removal fig s11 the result indicated that the arsenic adsorption onto cufe2o4 followed the inner sphere complex mechanism 3 5 as iii removal mechanism the ft ir was performed to examine the interactions between arsenic and cufe2o4 fig 5 a as iii adsorption onto cufe2o4 pms had a similar ft ir spectrum with as v adsorption onto cufe2o4 the peak at 823 cm 1 was ascribed to ν asv o m tang et al 2013 the result indicated that the as iii on cufe2o4 pms was in the form of as v and the arsenic adsorption on cufe2o4 followed the inner sphere complex mechanism in contrast there appeared two peaks at 823 cm 1 and 762 cm 1 during as iii adsorption by cufe2o4 alone which indicated that the adsorbed as iii was partly converted to as v at ph 7 the dominant as iii species in aqueous solution is as oh 3 which has no ir absorption in a range of 750 800 cm 1 goldberg and johnston 2001 the peak at 762 cm 1 would logically result from the formation of an inner sphere surface complex of as iii the as 3d xps spectra were investigated to further reveal the arsenic species on cufe2o4 as shown in fig 5b the arsenic adsorbed on cufe2o4 pms was in the form of as v namely the adsorbed as iii was completely oxidized to as v in contrast the adsorbed as iii by cufe2o4 alone was partly oxidized to as v these results were in good agreement with the ftir results the surface hydroxyl groups oh on metal oxide adsorbents play a key role in arsenic adsorption there are three possible inner sphere arsenic complexes bidentate binuclear bidentate mononuclear and monodentate mononuclear complexes fig s12 arai et al 2001 manning and goldberg 1997 the stoichiometric ratio of surface hydroxyl between fresh cufe2o4 and the cufe2o4 saturated with arsenic was 1 2 for a monodentate surface complex and 2 1 for a bidentate complex the o 1s xps spectra of cufe2o4 before or after adsorbing arsenic are shown in fig 5c and the fitted data are listed in table s4 the ratio of oh o2 of cufe2o4 increased from 20 9 to 38 1 31 0 and 33 0 after adsorbing as iii as v and as iii pms respectively the increase in oh o2 ratio indicated that the arsenic adsorption was mainly through the formation of monodentate mononuclear complex goh et al 2009 zhang et al 2005 the higher oh o2 value after as iii adsorption than as v adsorption indicated that monodentate mononuclear complex was more significant in as iii adsorption the higher proportion of oh o2 for as iii pms adsorption than as v adsorption indicated that the adsorbed as iii maintained the monodentate mononuclear complex after oxidation obviously the monodentate mononuclear complex mechanism can effectively increase the utilization of adsorption sites fig s12a 3 6 as iii oxidation mechanism the arsenic species in solution were monitored to better understand the as iii oxidation by cufe2o4 pms fig 6 a as v emerged at the beginning of the reaction and the concentration peaked at 2 min which indicated that as iii could be oxidized to as v at the initial reaction stage the as iii was almost completely transformed into as v within 5 min note that the concentration of as iii sharply decreased within 2 min which was much faster than the generation of as v this indicated that the adsorption was faster than oxidation in the early stages the as iii oxidation kinetics could be well fitted by pseudo first order model r2 0 9953 and the apparent rate constant was 0 9270 min 1 fig s13 in contrast negligible as v was detected in the solution in the absence of pms fig s14 the oxidative activity of pms was evaluated by the oxidation kinetics of as iii by pms alone fig 6b the data could be well fitted by pseudo first order model r2 9887 and the apparent rate constant was 0 0201 min 1 fig s15 the as v concentration increased with prolonging reaction time but the as iii could not be fully oxidized to as v within 40 min thus the complete oxidation of as iii by cufe2o4 pms indicated the presence of other reactive species besides pms itself in the solution it is reported that pms can be induced by cufe2o4 to generate powerful radicals for degradation of organic pollutants eqs 5 9 guan et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b additionally the formed cu iii during the reaction eq 6 could react with h2o to generate ho eq 10 lei et al 2015 5 cu ii oh hso5 cu ii ho oso3 oh 6 cu ii ho oso3 cu iii oh so4 7 so4 oh so4 2 ho 8 cu iii oh hso5 cu ii ooso3 h2o 9 2 cu ii ooso3 2h2o 2 cu ii oh 2so4 o2 2h 10 cu iii oh h2o cu ii oh ho h coumarin was used as a probe molecule of ho radicals louit et al 2005 as shown in fig s16 a fluorescence of 7 hydroxycoumarin the oxidation product of coumarin by ho at 450 nm was detected in the cufe2o4 pms system indicative of the generation of ho electron spin resonance esr test was performed to detect radicals using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as an indicator fig 6c lei et al 2015 the result clearly demonstrated the existence of both ho and so4 radicals in the cufe2o4 pms system various radical scavengers were used to evaluate the contribution of the radicals to the as iii removal ho can be scavenged by tert butanol tba k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 and formic acid fa k oh 1 9 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 methanol can scavenge both ho meoh k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 and so4 k so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 dogliotti and hayon 1967 to clearly observe the effect of scavenger addition the initial concentration of as iii was set at a high level of 7 1 mg l and the pms concentration maintained 100 μm as shown in fig 6d the removal of as iii was decreased when the scavengers were added indicating that these free radicals were indeed involved in the as iii oxidation note that although the removal of as iii was reduced after scavenger addition it was still greater than that for the case without pms besides pms itself the surface adsorbed radicals may be also potential active species for as iii oxidation it is reported that surface adsorbed radicals could be hardly quenched by scavengers huang et al 2017 lei et al 2015 to confirm the existence of surface adsorbed radicals the esr tests were performed by adding radical scavengers to the solution as shown in fig s16 when adding 500 mm tba or meoh the intensity of dmpo adducts in the cufe2o4 pms system decreased but remained recognizable this result indicated that there were the surface adsorbed radicals which could oxidize as iii even at high concentrations of scavengers due to the contributions of surface adsorbed radicals and pms itself the removal of low concentration as iii 1 415 mg l was hardly inhibited by the radical scavengers tba and meoh fig s18 in summary the radicals free or adsorbed ho and so4 as well as pms itself accounted for the oxidation of as iii 3 7 as iii removal in natural groundwater and reusability of cufe2o4 considering that natural groundwater is more complex than deionized water the adsorption of as iii in well water was conducted the groundwater quality analysis is presented in table s5 approximately 98 of as iii c 0 174 μg l was removed within only 5 min using 0 2 g l cufe2o4 with 13 μm pms and the residual arsenic in water was 3 67 μg l fig 7 a therefore the cufe2o4 pms system is highly feasible for fast removal of as iii from natural groundwater fig 7b shows the recycling of cufe2o4 0 2 g l pms 100 μm for as iii removal c 0 1415 μg l after each adsorption cycle cufe2o4 was magnetically separated and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh 5 ml for 30 mg cufe2o4 during the regeneration process almost no dissolution of iron and copper occurred the as iii removal efficiency maintained 96 within 40 min in the fourth cycle and the residual arsenic concentration was below 10 μg l although the residual arsenic was slightly above 10 μg l within 40 min in the fifth cycle the residual arsenic could be further reduced by appropriately prolonging contact time 4 conclusions this study establishes a heterogeneous catalytic process cufe2o4 pms for efficient oxidation and fast removal of as iii from water the cufe2o4 can react with pms to generate powerful radicals for as iii oxidation but also effectively sequestrate both as iii and as v this proposed process is more efficient for as iii removal than a preoxidation of as iii followed by adsorption cufe2o4 pms has a much larger adsorption capacity for as iii than cufe2o4 alone for as iii or as v this process can achieve fast removal of as iii from water to meet the drinking water standard c 0 as iii 1415 μg l cufe2o4 0 2 g l pms 100 μm t 15 min additionally the cufe2o4 pms system can work effectively in a broad range of geochemical conditions furthermore cufe2o4 can be easily separated for regeneration and reuse in summary the established process is highly feasible for the remediation of as iii contaminated water under ambient conditions declaration of interests none acknowledgments

19108,many arsenic bearing freshwaters are facing with eutrophication and consequent algae induced anoxia hypoxia events however arsenic cycling in eutrophic waters and its impact on public health are poorly understood laboratory simulation experiments are performed in this study to investigate the effect of algal blooms on the cycling of arsenic in a sediment water air system we found that the anoxia induced by the degradation of algal biomass promoted an acute arsenic mostly as iii release within two days from sediment to both the water and atmosphere and the release effluxes were proportional to the algae dosage the reduction and methylation of arsenic were enhanced at the sediment water interface owing to the significant increase in arsenate reductase genes arra and arsc and arsenite methyltransferase genes arsm caused by increased anoxia the analysis of synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that the concomitantly released natural organic matter nom and sulfur s at the sediment water interface reduced the as iii release to a certain extent in the later reducing period of incubation by forming as2s3 43 51 and as iii fe nom 28 35 our results

the atmosphere by forming volatile arsines such as arsine ash3 monomethylarsine meash2 dimethylarsine me2ash and trimethylarsine tmas through microbial activities under anaerobic conditions webster et al 2016 volatile arsenic species have been proven stable for hours during the daytime and weeks in dark conditions in the atmosphere jakob et al 2010 mestrot et al 2011b thus potentially represent a serious health risks for tourists fisherman local residents and wild animals mestrot et al 2011b increasing studies have shown that arsenic volatilization from soils can be stimulated by adding exogenous natural organic matters noms such as clover cattle manure and plant straw huang et al 2012 mestrot et al 2009 2011a in eutrophic freshwater systems senescent algal blooms serve as an exogenous nom that is continuously deposited onto arsenic polluted sediments gao et al 2012 hasegawa et al 2009 2010 sheng et al 2012 which may stimulate the arsenic volatilization however compared to the widespread concern of various arsenic species in the water column the release of volatile arsenic compounds in the eutrophic freshwaters is often overlooked partly owing to the lack of satisfactory methods to measure them in the open lake field faust et al 2016 mestrot et al 2009 therefore the investigation of arsenic volatilization through laboratory simulation experiments may bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters the endogenous release of arsenic in freshwaters is often influenced by exogenous noms however the role of the noms on arsenic mobility and bioavailability is highly controversial langner et al 2012 noms are typically recognized as affecting arsenic mobilization and bioavailability indirectly through microbial activity the addition of noms as a nutrient can stimulate the activity of indigenous arsenic metabolism functional microbes to influence arsenic speciation for example from as v to the more mobile as iii huang et al 2012 it can also fuel the dissimilatory reducing bacteria as an active electron donor to drive the reduction processes of iron and sulfate in anoxic sediments meharg et al 2006 weber et al 2010 thereby indirectly controlling arsenic mobility by the interaction of arsenic with the generated ferrous matter kirk et al 2010 xu et al 2011 or sulﬁdes la force et al 2000 langner et al 2013 moon et al 2017 nevertheless nom has been proved to be a sorbent for both as iii and as v to directly control arsenic mobility hoffman et al 2013 in numerous natural wetland systems and peat sediments with abundant noms the enrichments of arsenic are shown not related to the presence of arsenic bearing minerals but through the interaction with noms gonzález et al 2006 langner et al 2012 rothwell et al 2010 increasing spectroscopic evidences have highlighted that as iii as v can bind to noms by forming of as nom or as polyvalent cations nom complexes depending on the intrinsic chemical heterogeneity of the environments hoffmann et al 2013 langner et al 2012 2013 the senescent algal blooms can induce a nom rich anoxic sediment water interface in eutrophic freshwaters where interactions between noms and as iii could potentially be an important mechanism for arsenic mobilization and sequestration however there is not enough spectroscopic evidence to assess the role of as nom on arsenic cycling in freshwaters suffering from algal blooms gao et al 2012 moon et al 2017 in this study we investigated the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in the microcosmic sediment water air system with low algae dosage lad and high algae dosage had representing the normal algal blooms level and black bloom eruption level in freshwaters respectively our primary objectives are i to illustrate the potential risks of arsenic in aquatic and atmosphere of freshwaters undergoing eutrophication ii to elucidate the mechanism of arsenic speciation and volatilization during algal biomass degradation and iii to quantify the extent of arsenic binding to noms sulﬁdes and mineral oxides under different redox conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation surface sediment 0 10 cm and water was sampled from caohai n 24 57 25 1 e 102 37 102 40 northeastern basin of lake dianchi in kunming city yunnan province china the surface area of lake dianchi is 309 km2 with an average depth of 4 4 m it is a typical arsenic polluted lake with a total arsenic concentration of 6 55 12 2 μg l in water column and 24 5 152 9 mg kg in surface sediments wei and zhang 2012

the arsenic release potential of algal biomass itself without a sediment supply through a comparison between the control lad and had groups we can obtain arsenic speciation and mobilization at different eutrophication induced nom levels to further clarify the amount of total arsenic released from the sediments we compared the arsenic mobilization between the control 2 and had groups by comparing among the control had s control and s had groups the impact of microbial activity on arsenic speciation and mobilization can be evaluated except for control 2 all cylindrical plexiglass

applied biosystems inc usa the details are shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae induced arsenic release to air oxygen depletion by the microbial degradation of the sinking algae induced hypoxia anoxia dissolved oxygen 1 mg l and eh 150 mv at the swi from day 2 fig 1 a supplementary fig s4 the water of the had group became malodorous and black owing to the generation of black ferrous sulfide precipitates han et al 2015 on day 4 with the anaerobic deterioration indicating the outbreak of black blooms fig 1a accompanying with the algae induced hypoxia anoxia 25 4 and 100 ng of total volatile arsenic including both tmas and ash3 were released into the atmosphere during the 18 day incubation in the lad and had groups respectively fig 1b corresponding to an average flux of 0 431 and 1 73 μg m2 d respectively supplementary table s6 the volatilization effluxes of the total arsenic in the lad and had were 2 and 8 times higher than that of the control respectively indicating that the volatilization capacity of arsenic was significantly improved under more reducing conditions induced by algae blooms degradation arsenic volatilization involves arsenic reduction and methylation metabolic pathways challenger 1945 huang et al 2012 with the metabolites of tmas ash3 meash2 or me2ash in this study only tmas and ash3 were detected and the predominant volatile arsenic species changed from tmas to ash3 which is the most poisonous arsenic species faust et al 2016 when black blooms occurred in had fig 1b ash3 production as recognized as a fungi or methanoarchaea induced biotransformation process under strong reducing condition pakulska and czerczak 2006 wang et al 2014 has also been observed in some paddies or peats with organic matter amendment mestrot et al 2011a theoretically ash3 can persist for five days under light pantsar kallio and korpela 2000 and 19 weeks under dark conditions jakob et al 2010 mestrot et al 2011b thus enabling its long distance transportation from the emission source therefore algae induced anoxia in arsenic polluted freshwaters may pose greater health risk to the residents nearby through respiratory exposure 3 2 algae induced arsenic release to water algal blooms degradation increased the total dissolved arsenic in the overlying water fig 1c the total dissolved arsenic in the control group remained at 7 11 μg l throughout the experiment in contrast it increased following the onset of hypoxia anoxia fig 1a peaked at day 4 followed by a gradual decrease until the end of the experiment in the lad and had groups the maximum total dissolved arsenic concentration in water in the lad 19 μg l and had 38 μg l groups were 2 and 4 times higher than the who drinking water limit of 10 μg l respectively decomposed algal biomass can contribute one tenth of the increased total dissolved arsenic 3 02 0 50 μg l in the overlying water implying that the excess was resulted from endogenous release related to algae induced anoxia hypoxia this result was supported by the distinct enlargement of concentration gradients for total dissolved arsenic in porewater at a depth of 20 5 mm when algae were added supplementary fig s5 the calculated dissolved arsenic flux across the swi was switched from negative in the control group to positive in the lad and had groups over the incubation fig 1d thus confirming the change from arsenic sink to source for surface sediments 0 2 cm during the microbial degradation of algal blooms integrating the total dissolved arsenic flux data over the 18 day incubation yield a cumulated arsenic release of 3 94 mg m2 in lad 13 2 mg m2 in had into the overlying water fig 1d corresponding to an average diffusive flux of 0 219 0 733 mg m2 d supplementary table s6 with the endogenous release of arsenic during algae induced hypoxia anoxia the predominant arsenic species converted from as v into as iii 79 8 97 2 and methylated as i e mma and dma 2 33 11 3 in both overlying water fig 1c and surface sediments supplementary fig s6 the reduction and methylation rate of arsenic increased with algae dosage indicating that the nom rich anoxic condition was favorable for the production of as iii and methylated as as observed in natural eutrophic systems hasegawa et al 2009 2010 li et al 2014 the toxicity sequence of different arsenic species is ash3 as iii as v mma dma tmao who 1981 implying that the expansion of algal blooms may enhance the toxic impact of arsenic in the water column 3 3 microbially mediated arsenic speciation arsenic reduction and methylation processes at sediment water air interfaces were detected after algae addition in unsterilized groups fig 1b c and supplementary fig s4a however in sterilized groups compared to the s control group adding high algae dosage in the s had group did not promote arsenic volatilization to air arsenic reduction and methylation in the overlying water and arsenic reduction in surface sediments supplementary fig s7 these implied that the reduction of as v to as iii or ash3 and the methylation of as iii to mma dma or tmas during the algae decomposition was primarily a microbially mediated process which agreed with previous studies huang et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a to further uncover the arsenic metabolism mechanism during the microbial degradation of algal biomass the abundance of different arsenic metabolism functional genes i e arsenite oxidation aioa arsenate respiratory reduction arra arsenate reduction arsc and arsenite methylation arsm genes suhadolnik et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in the overlying water surface sediments 0 2 cm and deep sediments 2 4 cm was analyzed and shown in fig 2 significant abundance shifts of functional genes were focused on the overlying water column and surface sediments fig 2a and b respectively where arsenic reduction and methylation occurred primarily fig 1c and supplementary fig s6 the copy number of aioa genes decreased significantly when algae were added indicating the inhibited growth of arsenite oxidative bacteria at the swi however the arra genes notably increased from 3 10 106 to 9 54 106 copies l in the water column fig 2a and from 2 39 106 to 4 69 106 copies g in the surface sediments with increasing algae dosage fig 2b accompanied with the similar notable increase of arsc and arsm genes these results demonstrated that the organic carbon enriched anoxic environments fig 1a and supplementary table s7 promoted the growth of arsenate reductive bacteria and arsenite methylated bacteria leading to more formation of arsenite arsines and methylated arsenic at sediment water air interfaces fig 1b and c 3 4 geochemically controlled arsenic release and sequestration the endogenous release of arsenic was paralleled by the release of dissolved fe ii and dissolved organic carbon doc from sediments this was supported by the similar regular patterns for dissolved fe ii and doc in the overlying water fig 3 a b and the increased concentration gradients of porewater dissolved fe ii and doc at the depth of 20 5 mm for treatments with algal biomass compared to the control supplementary fig s5 doc is an indicator of organic matter degradation and mineralization gao et al 2012 highly significant positive correlations p 0 01 were found between doc and total dissolved as doc and dissolved fe ii in the water column throughout the experiment respectively and their correlation coefficients increased with increasing algae dosage fig 3d it clearly implied that the anaerobic degradation of algal blooms in eutrophic freshwaters may develop favorable conditions e g low redox at swi supplementary fig s4 and plenty of electron donor postma et al 2012 for microbial reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides this facilitated the increase in fe ii tfe and as iii tas in surface sediments supplementary fig s6 leading to the concurrent release of as iii and fe ii into the overlying water figs 1c and 3b bennett et al 2012 bose and sharma 2002 roberts et al 2009 however although significantly positive correlations p 0 05 existed between the total dissolved as and fe ii in treatments with algal biomass fig 3d the correlations degraded slightly from 0 584 in the lad group to 0 445 in the had group implying that there may be alternative factors other than fe ii may exist that affected the as iii mobilization during black boom eruption much lower dissolved so4 2 concentrations in the overlying water and porewater profile of 20 5 mm were found in the had group than in both the lad and control groups fig 3c and supplementary fig s5 thus verifying that the microbial sulfate reduction process was enhanced with increased anaerobic degree induced by a higher algae dosage han et al 2015 the generated sulfide can immobilize as iii by direct precipitation as arsenic sulﬁdes such as orpiment as2s3 realgar ass arsenopyrite feass and thioarsenic species h3asoxsy la force et al 2000 langner et al 2013 moon et al 2017 it can also interact with the abundant fe ii at the anaerobic swi fig 3b and fig s6b to form iron sulfide precipitates fes or fes2 pyrite that can potentially adsorb the released as iii moon et al 2017 additionally in this study the degradation of algal blooms induced nom rich anoxic environments fig 3c and supplementary table s7 this implied that noms can immobilize as iii by directly binding to the functional groups of noms e g sulfhydryl group or phenolic oh group to form nom as iii complexes or using polyvalent metal cations e g fe as a bridge to form nom polyvalent cations as iii complexes hoffmann et al 2013 langner et al 2012 2013 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 sundman et al 2014 a notable increase in the oxidizable fraction of arsenic including both nom and s bound arsenic in the surface sediments were found with increasing algae dosage fig 3e supporting the effect of sulfide and noms on arsenic sequestration under nom rich anoxic environments which can be responsible for the gradual decline of total dissolved arsenic in the overlying water at the later period of the incubation fig 1c to verify and quantify the interactions of arsenic with fe sulfides and noms under various redox conditions arsenic and iron k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra analyses of surface sediments were conducted the lcf of the arsenic and iron k edge xanes spectra of the surface sediments with reference compounds fig 4 a and c and the corresponding fit results are summarized in fig 4b and d with increasing algae inputs the proportion of arsenic adsorbed to ferrihydrite decreased from 38 0 to 14 2 fig 4b combined with ferrihydrite fraction decreasing from 31 2 to 21 1 fig 4d respectively confirming the primary mechanism of iron redox controlled arsenic release in freshwaters suffering with degraded algal blooms however a notable increase in orpiment as2s3 fraction from 34 3 to 51 2 indicated the formation of as2s3 under the algae induced anoxia condition fig 4b which even became the principal as iii sequestration during black blooms eruption in natural systems arsenic sulﬁdes are typically formed under high temperature conditions such as in hot springs o day et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 instead our results indicated the microbe mediated formation of as2s3 like minerals under sulfate reduced anaerobic environments at the ambient temperature as observed in previous studies bostick et al 2004 o day et al 2004 xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 moreover our results also highlighted particulate nom as as iii sequestrators by the formation of ternary complexes of nom fe as iii fig 4b and d during algae induced hypoxia anoxia the nom fe as iii fraction can even account for approximately 35 of the solid phase arsenic speciation during black blooms eruption in freshwaters fig 4b it was formed when liberated iron under strong anaerobic conditions was acted as a bridge between negatively charged as iii and the organic ligands of noms at the swi as observed in arsenic polluted deep peat layers where both iron and noms are enriched hoffmann et al 2013 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 in natural systems polyvalent metal cations can also act as bridges between other oxyanions e g phosphate and selenite and organic ligands to immobilize these oxyanions by forming similar ternary complexes gerke 2010 gustafsson and johnsson 1994 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 3 5 conceptual model for arsenic cycling in arsenic polluted freshwaters that are coupled with eutrophication gao et al 2012 rahman and hasegawa 2012 the mobilization of arsenic across the sediment water air could be triggered by algal blooms fig 5 the anaerobic degradation of the senescent algae stimulated the reductive dissolution of as v as iii bearing iron oxides in the surface sediments causing a rapid release of fe ii fe iii and arsenic to the water column algae induced hypoxia anoxia favored the activity of indigenous arsenate reductive bacteria arsc and arra genes and arsenite methylated bacteria arsm gene thus promoting the production of as iii mma and dma in the overlying water known as the final products of arsenic microbial reduction and methylation bentley and chasteen 2002 small amounts of ash3 and tmas were formed and emitted into the atmosphere with ash3 as the dominant volatile arsenic species however the consequent s and nom rich environments may serve partially as potential geochemical traps for the released as iii in the later anoxic period of algal blooms season by the formation of arsenic sulfides 43 0 51 2 and nom fe as iii 28 3 34 8 in natural eutrophic waters extensive production sinking and subsequent microbial decomposition of algal blooms typically lasts for months gao et al 2012 hasegawa et al 2009 2010 sheng et al 2012 thus increasing the potential arsenic exposure risks in both water and air taking lake dianchi 309 km2 as an example in the normal algal blooms level it was estimated that approximately 8 21 t of arsenic equivalent to 3 28 of total arsenic in surface sediments could be released into the overlying water within four months from june to september of algal blooms season sheng et al 2012 however during black blooms explosion up to 27 2 t of arsenic approximately 11 of the surface sediment arsenic capacity can be released into water fig 5 supplementary table s6 the released arsenic in the water column can threaten human health through direct exposure or ingestion of arsenic accumulated aquatic organisms such as caridina dianchiensis yang et al 2017 moreover it was estimated that 16 0 64 1 kg of arsenic is likely to be volatilized during the algal blooms season per year corresponding to 0 0065 0 026 of total arsenic present in the surface sediments fig 5 supplementary table s6 this value is close to the volatilization rates 0 002 0 17 for peat and paddy soils mestrot et al 2011a arsenic biovolatilization from paddy and peat soils constitute 2 6 of the global natural arsenic emission 46500 t y chilvers 1987 mestrot et al 2011a however the relevant contribution estimation from eutrophic freshwaters require further clarification based on worldwide arsenic pollution status in freshwaters and its in situ arsenic volatilization rules 3 6 environmental implications harmful algal blooms are currently increasing globally and they are likely to expand further in the coming decades owing to the continued eutrophication and worsening global warming huisman et al 2018 arsenic endogenous release to water and air induced by the degradation of senescent algal blooms combined with the anticipated increase in release fluxes related to the intensification of eutrophication in freshwaters highlights the need for appropriate mitigation strategies in the short term combating the algae induced anoxia hypoxia by oxygenation zhang et al 2018 may be a logical and feasible method to limit arsenic endogenous release in eutrophic waters in the long term controlling arsenic endogenous release by the prevention of algal blooms or eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems will require extensive efforts for nutrient input control huisman et al 2018 our results may also provide insight for arsenic dynamics in other wetlands such as paddy fields large areas of paddy soils in south and southeast asia are contaminated with arsenic zhao et al 2015 where diverse exogenous organic fertilizers such as rice straw and cattle manure have been applied as soil amendment to obtain elevated rice yields huang et al 2012 it is generally believed that arsenic accumulation in grains straw and arsenic volatilization from rice plants and paddy soil can be promoted strongly during the decomposition of the organic fertilizers mestrot et al 2011a however the consequent nom and s rich sediments may act as traps for dissolved as iii under a reducing condition and therefore influence arsenic cycling in flooded paddy fields 4 conclusion this study explored the effect of algal degradation on the cycling of arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters algae induced hypoxia anoxia facilitated a rapid endogenous release of arsenic as iii dominant to both overlying water and air which may affect drinking water safety agricultural irrigation and recreations usage of the affected freshwaters the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides in anaerobic surface sediments was responsible for the endogenous release of as iii although the formation of as2s3 and nom fe as iii could partially ease this release process moreover the accompanied reduction and methylation of arsenic was attributed to the accumulation of arsenate reductive and arsenite methylated microbes at the swi

19108,many arsenic bearing freshwaters are facing with eutrophication and consequent algae induced anoxia hypoxia events however arsenic cycling in eutrophic waters and its impact on public health are poorly understood laboratory simulation experiments are performed in this study to investigate the effect of algal blooms on the cycling of arsenic in a sediment water air system we found that the anoxia induced by the degradation of algal biomass promoted an acute arsenic mostly as iii release within two days from sediment to both the water and atmosphere and the release effluxes were proportional to the algae dosage the reduction and methylation of arsenic were enhanced at the sediment water interface owing to the significant increase in arsenate reductase genes arra and arsc and arsenite methyltransferase genes arsm caused by increased anoxia the analysis of synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that the concomitantly released natural organic matter nom and sulfur s at the sediment water interface reduced the as iii release to a certain extent in the later reducing period of incubation by forming as2s3 43 51 and as iii fe nom 28 35 our results

in many arsenic polluted inland waters dirszowsky and wilson 2015 gao et al 2012 hirata et al 2011 lin et al 2016 rahman and hasegawa 2012 wei et al 2011 in the summer when algal blooms are likely to erupt increased total dissolved arsenic and as iii levels have been observed in some eutrophic freshwaters such as the mine impacted balmer lake in canada biwa lake in japan and dianchi lake in china hasegawa et al 2010 martin and pedersen 2004 rahman and hasegawa 2012 yang et al 2016 however the mechanism of arsenic biogeochemical cycling in eutrophic waters especially during algae induced anoxia hypoxia events remains poorly understood existing studies based on field sampling and monitoring have indicated the potential correlation between algae induced anoxia hypoxia condition and the endogenous release of arsenic into the water column martin and pedersen 2004 rahman and hasegawa 2012 yang et al 2016 the concentrations of total dissolved arsenic including as v as iii methylarsonic acid mma and dimethylarsinic acid dma v released into the water column vary by several orders of magnitude ranging from 12 2 to 8500 μg l in different eutrophic freshwaters depending on the total arsenic levels in sediments and the environmental chemistry martin and pedersen 2004 rahman and hasegawa 2012 yang et al 2016 however the maximum permissible arsenic level is 10 μg l if freshwaters are used for drinking water world health organization who or urban water supply sources cj t206 2005 china mohan et al 2007 except for the release into the water column arsenic can also escape into the atmosphere by forming volatile arsines such as arsine ash3 monomethylarsine meash2 dimethylarsine me2ash and trimethylarsine tmas through microbial activities under anaerobic conditions webster et al 2016 volatile arsenic species have been proven stable for hours during the daytime and weeks in dark conditions in the atmosphere jakob et al 2010 mestrot et al 2011b thus potentially represent a serious health risks for tourists fisherman local residents and wild animals mestrot et al 2011b increasing studies have shown that arsenic volatilization from soils can be stimulated by adding exogenous natural organic matters noms such as clover cattle manure and plant straw huang et al 2012 mestrot et al 2009 2011a in eutrophic freshwater systems senescent algal blooms serve as an exogenous nom that is continuously deposited onto arsenic polluted sediments gao et al 2012 hasegawa et al 2009 2010 sheng et al 2012 which may stimulate the arsenic volatilization however compared to the widespread concern of various arsenic species in the water column the release of volatile arsenic compounds in the eutrophic freshwaters is often overlooked partly owing to the lack of satisfactory methods to measure them in the open lake field faust et al 2016 mestrot et al 2009 therefore the investigation of arsenic volatilization through laboratory simulation experiments may bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters the endogenous release of arsenic in freshwaters is often influenced by exogenous noms however the role of the noms on arsenic mobility and bioavailability is highly controversial langner et al 2012 noms are typically recognized as affecting arsenic mobilization and bioavailability indirectly through microbial activity the addition of noms as a nutrient can stimulate the activity of indigenous arsenic metabolism functional microbes to influence arsenic speciation for example from as v to the more mobile as iii huang et al 2012 it can also fuel the dissimilatory reducing bacteria as an active electron donor to drive the reduction processes of iron and sulfate in anoxic sediments meharg et al 2006 weber et al 2010 thereby indirectly controlling arsenic mobility by the interaction of arsenic with the generated ferrous matter kirk et al 2010 xu et al 2011 or sulﬁdes la force et al 2000 langner et al 2013 moon et al 2017 nevertheless nom has been proved to be a sorbent for both as iii and as v to directly control arsenic mobility hoffman et al 2013 in numerous natural wetland systems and peat sediments with abundant noms the enrichments of arsenic are shown not related to the presence of arsenic bearing minerals but through the interaction with noms gonzález et al 2006 langner et al 2012 rothwell et al 2010 increasing spectroscopic evidences have highlighted that as iii as v can bind to noms by forming of as nom or as polyvalent cations nom complexes depending on the intrinsic chemical heterogeneity of the environments hoffmann et al 2013 langner et al 2012 2013 the senescent algal blooms can induce a nom rich anoxic sediment water interface in eutrophic freshwaters where interactions between noms and as iii could potentially be an important mechanism for arsenic mobilization and sequestration however there is not enough spectroscopic evidence to assess the role of as nom on arsenic cycling in freshwaters suffering from algal blooms gao et al 2012 moon et al 2017 in this study we investigated the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in the microcosmic sediment water air system with low algae dosage lad and high algae dosage had representing the normal algal blooms level and black bloom eruption level in freshwaters respectively our primary objectives are i to illustrate the potential risks of arsenic in aquatic and atmosphere of freshwaters undergoing eutrophication ii to elucidate the mechanism of arsenic speciation and volatilization during algal biomass degradation and iii to quantify the extent of arsenic binding to noms sulﬁdes and mineral oxides under different redox conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation surface sediment 0 10 cm and water was sampled from caohai n 24 57 25 1 e 102 37 102 40 northeastern basin of lake dianchi in kunming city yunnan province china the surface area of lake dianchi is 309 km2 with an average depth of 4 4 m it is a typical arsenic polluted lake with a total arsenic concentration of 6 55 12 2 μg l in water column and 24 5 152 9 mg kg in surface sediments wei and zhang 2012

sterilized sediments and lake water with an added 0 60 g of sterilized dried algal biomass ⅵ the control 2 group consists of 600 ml of lake water with 0 60 g of added dried algal biomass representing the arsenic release potential of algal biomass itself without a sediment supply through a comparison between the control lad and had groups we can obtain arsenic speciation and mobilization at different eutrophication induced nom levels to further clarify the amount of total arsenic released from the sediments we compared the arsenic mobilization between the control 2 and had groups by comparing among the control had s control and s had groups the impact of microbial activity on arsenic speciation and mobilization can be evaluated except for control 2 all cylindrical plexiglass

biomass were autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c and another 0 2 nan3 was added into the water to further inhibit microbial growth each microcosm was stabilized for three weeks before algal biomass

compensate for the sampling losses the mixed sediments 0 20 20 40 and 40 mm were sampled in an anaerobic glove box and stored at 80 c before chemical extraction synchrotron based x ray absorption

applied biosystems inc usa the details are shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae induced arsenic release to air oxygen depletion by the microbial degradation of the sinking algae induced hypoxia anoxia dissolved oxygen 1 mg l and eh 150 mv at the swi from day 2 fig 1 a supplementary fig s4 the water of the had group became malodorous and black owing to the generation of black ferrous sulfide precipitates han et al 2015 on day 4 with the anaerobic deterioration indicating the outbreak of black blooms fig 1a accompanying with the algae induced hypoxia anoxia 25 4 and 100 ng of total volatile arsenic including both tmas and ash3 were released into the atmosphere during the 18 day incubation in the lad and had groups respectively fig 1b corresponding to an average flux of 0 431 and 1 73 μg m2 d respectively supplementary table s6 the volatilization effluxes of the total arsenic in the lad and had were 2 and 8 times higher than that of the control respectively indicating that the volatilization capacity of arsenic was significantly improved under more reducing conditions induced by algae blooms degradation arsenic volatilization involves arsenic reduction and methylation metabolic pathways challenger 1945 huang et al 2012 with the metabolites of tmas ash3 meash2 or me2ash in this study only tmas and ash3 were detected and the predominant volatile arsenic species changed from tmas to ash3 which is the most poisonous arsenic species faust et al 2016 when black blooms occurred in had fig 1b ash3 production as recognized as a fungi or methanoarchaea induced biotransformation process under strong reducing condition pakulska and czerczak 2006 wang et al 2014 has also been observed in some paddies or peats with organic matter amendment mestrot et al 2011a theoretically ash3 can persist for five days under light pantsar kallio and korpela 2000 and 19 weeks under dark conditions jakob et al 2010 mestrot et al 2011b thus enabling its long distance transportation from the emission source therefore algae induced anoxia in arsenic polluted freshwaters may pose greater health risk to the residents nearby through respiratory exposure 3 2 algae induced arsenic release to water algal blooms degradation increased the total dissolved arsenic in the overlying water fig 1c the total dissolved arsenic in the control group remained at 7 11 μg l throughout the experiment in contrast it increased following the onset of hypoxia anoxia fig 1a peaked at day 4 followed by a gradual decrease until the end of the experiment in the lad and had groups the maximum total dissolved arsenic concentration in water in the lad 19 μg l and had 38 μg l groups were 2 and 4 times higher than the who drinking water limit of 10 μg l respectively decomposed algal biomass can contribute one tenth of the increased total dissolved arsenic 3 02 0 50 μg l in the overlying water implying that the excess was resulted from endogenous release related to algae induced anoxia hypoxia this result was supported by the distinct enlargement of concentration gradients for total dissolved arsenic in porewater at a depth of 20 5 mm when algae were added supplementary fig s5 the calculated dissolved arsenic flux across the swi was switched from negative in the control group to positive in the lad and had groups over the incubation fig 1d thus confirming the change from arsenic sink to source for surface sediments 0 2 cm during the microbial degradation of algal blooms integrating the total dissolved arsenic flux data over the 18 day incubation yield a cumulated arsenic release of 3 94 mg m2 in lad 13 2 mg m2 in had into the overlying water fig 1d corresponding to an average diffusive flux of 0 219 0 733 mg m2 d supplementary table s6 with the endogenous release of arsenic during algae induced hypoxia anoxia the predominant arsenic species converted from as v into as iii 79 8 97 2 and methylated as i e mma and dma 2 33 11 3 in both overlying water fig 1c and surface sediments supplementary fig s6 the reduction and methylation rate of arsenic increased with algae dosage indicating that the nom rich anoxic condition was favorable for the production of as iii and methylated as as observed in natural eutrophic systems hasegawa et al 2009 2010 li et al 2014 the toxicity sequence of different arsenic species is ash3 as iii as v mma dma tmao who 1981 implying that the expansion of algal blooms may enhance the toxic impact of arsenic in the water column 3 3 microbially mediated arsenic speciation arsenic reduction and methylation processes at sediment water air interfaces were detected after algae addition in unsterilized groups fig 1b c and supplementary fig s4a however in sterilized groups compared to the s control group adding high algae dosage in the s had group did not promote arsenic volatilization to air arsenic reduction and methylation in the overlying water and arsenic reduction in surface sediments supplementary fig s7 these implied that the reduction of as v to as iii or ash3 and the methylation of as iii to mma dma or tmas during the algae decomposition was primarily a microbially mediated process which agreed with previous studies huang et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a to further uncover the arsenic metabolism mechanism during the microbial degradation of algal biomass the abundance of different arsenic metabolism functional genes i e arsenite oxidation aioa arsenate respiratory reduction arra arsenate reduction arsc and arsenite methylation arsm genes suhadolnik et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in the overlying water surface sediments 0 2 cm and deep sediments 2 4 cm was analyzed and shown in fig 2 significant abundance shifts of functional genes were focused on the overlying water column and surface sediments fig 2a and b respectively where arsenic reduction and methylation occurred primarily fig 1c and supplementary fig s6 the copy number of aioa genes decreased significantly when algae were added indicating the inhibited growth of arsenite oxidative bacteria at the swi however the arra genes notably increased from 3 10 106 to 9 54 106 copies l in the water column fig 2a and from 2 39 106 to 4 69 106 copies g in the surface sediments with increasing algae dosage fig 2b accompanied with the similar notable increase of arsc and arsm genes these results demonstrated that the organic carbon enriched anoxic environments fig 1a and supplementary table s7 promoted the growth of arsenate reductive bacteria and arsenite methylated bacteria leading to more formation of arsenite arsines and methylated arsenic at sediment water air interfaces fig 1b and c 3 4 geochemically controlled arsenic release and sequestration the endogenous release of arsenic was paralleled by the release of dissolved fe ii and dissolved organic carbon doc from sediments this was supported by the similar regular patterns for dissolved fe ii and doc in the overlying water fig 3 a b and the increased concentration gradients of porewater dissolved fe ii and doc at the depth of 20 5 mm for treatments with algal biomass compared to the control supplementary fig s5 doc is an indicator of organic matter degradation and mineralization gao et al 2012 highly significant positive correlations p 0 01 were found between doc and total dissolved as doc and dissolved fe ii in the water column throughout the experiment respectively and their correlation coefficients increased with increasing algae dosage fig 3d it clearly implied that the anaerobic degradation of algal blooms in eutrophic freshwaters may develop favorable conditions e g low redox at swi supplementary fig s4 and plenty of electron donor postma et al 2012 for microbial reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides this facilitated the increase in fe ii tfe and as iii tas in surface sediments supplementary fig s6 leading to the concurrent release of as iii and fe ii into the overlying water figs 1c and 3b bennett et al 2012 bose and sharma 2002 roberts et al 2009 however although significantly positive correlations p 0 05 existed between the total dissolved as and fe ii in treatments with algal biomass fig 3d the correlations degraded slightly from 0 584 in the lad group to 0 445 in the had group implying that there may be alternative factors other than fe ii may exist that affected the as iii mobilization during black boom eruption much lower dissolved so4 2 concentrations in the overlying water and porewater profile of 20 5 mm were found in the had group than in both the lad and control groups fig 3c and supplementary fig s5 thus verifying that the microbial sulfate reduction process was enhanced with increased anaerobic degree induced by a higher algae dosage han et al 2015 the generated sulfide can immobilize as iii by direct precipitation as arsenic sulﬁdes such as orpiment as2s3 realgar ass arsenopyrite feass and thioarsenic species h3asoxsy la force et al 2000 langner et al 2013 moon et al 2017 it can also interact with the abundant fe ii at the anaerobic swi fig 3b and fig s6b to form iron sulfide precipitates fes or fes2 pyrite that can potentially adsorb the released as iii moon et al 2017 additionally in this study the degradation of algal blooms induced nom rich anoxic environments fig 3c and supplementary table s7 this implied that noms can immobilize as iii by directly binding to the functional groups of noms e g sulfhydryl group or phenolic oh group to form nom as iii complexes or using polyvalent metal cations e g fe as a bridge to form nom polyvalent cations as iii complexes hoffmann et al 2013 langner et al 2012 2013 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 sundman et al 2014 a notable increase in the oxidizable fraction of arsenic including both nom and s bound arsenic in the surface sediments were found with increasing algae dosage fig 3e supporting the effect of sulfide and noms on arsenic sequestration under nom rich anoxic environments which can be responsible for the gradual decline of total dissolved arsenic in the overlying water at the later period of the incubation fig 1c to verify and quantify the interactions of arsenic with fe sulfides and noms under various redox conditions arsenic and iron k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra analyses of surface sediments were conducted the lcf of the arsenic and iron k edge xanes spectra of the surface sediments with reference compounds fig 4 a and c and the corresponding fit results are summarized in fig 4b and d with increasing algae inputs the proportion of arsenic adsorbed to ferrihydrite decreased from 38 0 to 14 2 fig 4b combined with ferrihydrite fraction decreasing from 31 2 to 21 1 fig 4d respectively confirming the primary mechanism of iron redox controlled arsenic release in freshwaters suffering with degraded algal blooms however a notable increase in orpiment as2s3 fraction from 34 3 to 51 2 indicated the formation of as2s3 under the algae induced anoxia condition fig 4b which even became the principal as iii sequestration during black blooms eruption in natural systems arsenic sulﬁdes are typically formed under high temperature conditions such as in hot springs o day et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 instead our results indicated the microbe mediated formation of as2s3 like minerals under sulfate reduced anaerobic environments at the ambient temperature as observed in previous studies bostick et al 2004 o day et al 2004 xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 moreover our results also highlighted particulate nom as as iii sequestrators by the formation of ternary complexes of nom fe as iii fig 4b and d during algae induced hypoxia anoxia the nom fe as iii fraction can even account for approximately 35 of the solid phase arsenic speciation during black blooms eruption in freshwaters fig 4b it was formed when liberated iron under strong anaerobic conditions was acted as a bridge between negatively charged as iii and the organic ligands of noms at the swi as observed in arsenic polluted deep peat layers where both iron and noms are enriched hoffmann et al 2013 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 in natural systems polyvalent metal cations can also act as bridges between other oxyanions e g phosphate and selenite and organic ligands to immobilize these oxyanions by forming similar ternary complexes gerke 2010 gustafsson and johnsson 1994 mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 3 5 conceptual model for arsenic cycling in arsenic polluted freshwaters that are coupled with eutrophication gao et al 2012 rahman and hasegawa 2012 the mobilization of arsenic across the sediment water air could be triggered by algal blooms fig 5 the anaerobic degradation of the senescent algae stimulated the reductive dissolution of as v as iii bearing iron oxides in the surface sediments causing a rapid release of fe ii fe iii and arsenic to the water column algae induced hypoxia anoxia favored the activity of indigenous arsenate reductive bacteria arsc and arra genes and arsenite methylated bacteria arsm gene thus promoting the production of as iii mma and dma in the overlying water known as the final products of arsenic microbial reduction and methylation bentley and chasteen 2002 small amounts of ash3 and tmas were formed and emitted into the atmosphere with ash3 as the dominant volatile arsenic species however the consequent s and nom rich environments may serve partially as potential geochemical traps for the released as iii in the later anoxic period of algal blooms season by the formation of arsenic sulfides 43 0 51 2 and nom fe as iii 28 3 34 8 in natural eutrophic waters extensive production sinking and subsequent microbial decomposition of algal blooms typically lasts for months gao et al 2012 hasegawa et al 2009 2010 sheng et al 2012 thus increasing the potential arsenic exposure risks in both water and air taking lake dianchi 309 km2 as an example in the normal algal blooms level it was estimated that approximately 8 21 t of arsenic equivalent to 3 28 of total arsenic in surface sediments could be released into the overlying water within four months from june to september of algal blooms season sheng et al 2012 however during black blooms explosion up to 27 2 t of arsenic approximately 11 of the surface sediment arsenic capacity can be released into water fig 5 supplementary table s6 the released arsenic in the water column can threaten human health through direct exposure or ingestion of arsenic accumulated aquatic organisms such as caridina dianchiensis yang et al 2017 moreover it was estimated that 16 0 64 1 kg of arsenic is likely to be volatilized during the algal blooms season per year corresponding to 0 0065 0 026 of total arsenic present in the surface sediments fig 5 supplementary table s6 this value is close to the volatilization rates 0 002 0 17 for peat and paddy soils mestrot et al 2011a arsenic biovolatilization from paddy and peat soils constitute 2 6 of the global natural arsenic emission 46500 t y chilvers 1987 mestrot et al 2011a however the relevant contribution estimation from eutrophic freshwaters require further clarification based on worldwide arsenic pollution status in freshwaters and its in situ arsenic volatilization rules 3 6 environmental implications harmful algal blooms are currently increasing globally and they are likely to expand further in the coming decades owing to the continued eutrophication and worsening global warming huisman et al 2018 arsenic endogenous release to water and air induced by the degradation of senescent algal blooms combined with the anticipated increase in release fluxes related to the intensification of eutrophication in freshwaters highlights the need for appropriate mitigation strategies in the short term combating the algae induced anoxia hypoxia by oxygenation zhang et al 2018 may be a logical and feasible method to limit arsenic endogenous release in eutrophic waters in the long term controlling arsenic endogenous release by the prevention of algal blooms or eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems will require extensive efforts for nutrient input control huisman et al 2018 our results may also provide insight for arsenic dynamics in other wetlands such as paddy fields large areas of paddy soils in south and southeast asia are contaminated with arsenic zhao et al 2015 where diverse exogenous organic fertilizers such as rice straw and cattle manure have been applied as soil amendment to obtain elevated rice yields huang et al 2012 it is generally believed that arsenic accumulation in grains straw and arsenic volatilization from rice plants and paddy soil can be promoted strongly during the decomposition of the organic fertilizers mestrot et al 2011a however the consequent nom and s rich sediments may act as traps for dissolved as iii under a reducing condition and therefore influence arsenic cycling in flooded paddy fields 4 conclusion this study explored the effect of algal degradation on the cycling of arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters algae induced hypoxia anoxia facilitated a rapid endogenous release of arsenic as iii dominant to both overlying water and air which may affect drinking water safety agricultural irrigation and recreations usage of the affected freshwaters the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing iron oxides in anaerobic surface sediments was responsible for the endogenous release of as iii although the formation of as2s3 and nom fe as iii could partially ease this release process moreover the accompanied reduction and methylation of arsenic was attributed to the accumulation of arsenate reductive and arsenite methylated microbes at the swi

19109,fecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli e coli and enterococcus have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens however the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged particularly in tropical aquatic environments the objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators pathogens and environmental parameters the spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations a total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries and tested for fecal indicator bacteria coliphages human specific markers pathogenic bacteria and viruses the prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees of the enteric viruses norovirus gii was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration although strong correlations were found between indicators only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens the results in this study showed that none of the bacteria phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens inclusion of the alternative indicators methanobrevibacter smithii bacteroides and human polyomaviruses hpyvs to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human the microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus help to identify sites which have poor water quality this approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria indicators pathogens enteric viruses coliphages occurrence correlations 1 introduction increasing urbanization industrialization and agricultural activity have greatly impaired surface water quality globally waterborne pathogens include viruses and bacteria which can be introduced into the urban water cycle via leaking sewers urban runoff agricultural runoff and wastewater discharges arnone and walling 2007 enteric viruses are widely recognized as the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens causing both sporadic and outbreak related illnesses la rosa et al 2012 among enteric viruses noroviruses astroviruses enteroviruses adenoviruses and hepatitis a virus are the most extensively studied aw et al 2009 ganesh and lin 2013 of these adenovirus caliciviruses includes norovirus enterovirus and hepatitis a virus are listed in the usepa ccl3 which are currently not subjected to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations and which may require regulation under the safe drinking water act sdwa usepa 2009 little is known about the epidemiology of enteric viruses as well as their occurrence and behavior in tropical aquatic environments since most studies have been conducted in temperate and cold regions in addition to enteric viruses other potential emerging viral pathogens e g hepatitis e virus sapovirus nipah virus coronavirus bird flu virus may originate from wild animals in tropical catchment forests hepatitis e virus hev a causative agent of human hepatitis e is a single stranded positive sense rna virus from the genus hepevirus nan et al 2017 hev is transmitted primarily in humans by the fecal oral route through contaminated drinking water or food outbreaks normally occur in developing or undeveloped countries ahmad et al 2010 howard et al 2010 khan et al 2011 however recent evidence has shown that various animal species have serum antibodies to hev suggesting hepatitis e is a zoonotic disease meng 2010 nan et al 2017 li et al 2005 reported that genotype 3 hev rna was detected in both patient serum and wild boar meat li et al 2005 this raises concern that hev may be discharged into tributaries through animals which exist in forested areas sapovirus is another emerging enteric virus it belongs to caliciviruses and causes acute viral gastroenteritis haramoto et al 2008 sano et al 2011 as it has been identified in bats dogs pigs and mink oka et al 2015 it may also exist in tropical catchment waters other potential zoonotic viruses include coronavirus such as sars casanova et al 2009 de wit et al 2016 and bird flu virus influenza a virus subtypes h5n1 and h7n9 peiris et al 2007 shi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 apart from viruses bacteria that cause illness from recreational waters include salmonella pseudomonas aeruginosa shigella campylobacter and enteropathogenic escherichia coli hlavsa et al 2015 sanborn and takaro 2013 p aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen and occurs naturally in aquatic environments however the infections caused by p aeruginosa in recreational waters should not be neglected particularly for young children elder people and immune compromised population moreover p aeruginosa is currently one of the major bacteria that is capable of multiple drug resistance aloush et al 2006 hirsch and tam 2010 another bacterium that can cause recreational water related illness is salmonella although salmonellae are usually known as foodborne pathogens water could be a potential mode of transmission salmonella can be found in the feces of a large variety of vertebrates including humans reptiles birds farm and wild animals matias et al 2016 silva et al 2014 to date water quality monitoring is still based on the detection of fecal indicator bacteria i e e coli and enterococcus ideally fecal indicator bacteria should originate from the same host as the pathogen and have similar survival pattern as the pathogen outside the host however substantial evidence shows the limitations of using only these indicators to represent the water quality from a fecal point of view byappanahalli et al 2006 field and samadpour 2007 wu et al 2011 studies have shown the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in tropical regions byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 carrillo et al 1985 this could be due to the higher humidity warmer conditions heavier rainfall with highly erosive rains that encourage the splash effect and transportation of microorganisms in tropical regions rochelle newall et al 2015 although there is less seasonal variation in tropical regions as compared to temperate regions the monsoon season wet season and inter monsoon season dry season showed significant difference in the occurrence of microorganisms chuah and ziegler 2018 nguyen et al 2016 rochelle newall et al 2016 consequently alternative indicators such as coliphages and human specific markers have been suggested to address the limitation of fecal indicator bacteria field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2013 2014 the relationship between the presence of pathogens including viruses and alternative indicators has been studied however disparate results have been obtained harwood et al 2014 and jofre et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive review of the correlations between alternative indicators and coliphages with epidemiological studies and pathogens wu et al 2011 suggested several factors that could contribute to the varied results in different studies sample size and the number of positive samples for pathogens are among the main factors that determine the correlations between indicators and pathogens in recent years it was reported that wild boar numbers in singapore s forests are rapidly increasing national parks board of singapore 2013 possibly resulting in potential contamination of hev in tributaries although this has yet to be established the close proximity of forests and wetlands and urban populations in singapore could lead to exposure of zoonotic pathogens through discharge into tributaries and reservoirs potentially resulting in health risks to humans to date the emerging viral pathogens have not received sufficient attention and there have been no studies on these viruses in singapore s surface waters in this study surveillance of indicators and pathogens was carried out to determine the prevalence of pathogens in catchments with different land use providing a baseline of the surface water quality in tropical urban environments with a range of land use as there are contrasting results in previous correlation studies between indicators including alternative indicators and pathogens this study aims to identify the major correlations and examine if these indicators are associated with the occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens for the tropical catchments studied the spatial and temporal distributions of indicators and pathogens were also studied in order to identify the diversity patterns of these microorganisms in reservoirs and tributaries with different land use as well as the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites and land use studies this study was conducted in singapore coordinates of singapore 1 352083 103 8198395 with a land area of 719 1 km2 and population of 5 61 million

from the singapore land authority sla and pub singapore s national water agency where the land use subcategories were defined by the urban redevelopment authority ura however to reduce the number of parameters subcategories were merged into 5 main categories i residential ii urban iii green iv agricultural and v water body the characteristics for each sampling location are described in table 1 in order to reduce the number of parameters the weightage of land use which is the combination of different land use categories was calculated for the calculation of weightage numbers 4 3 2 and 1 were assigned to residential urban agriculture and green respectively a final weightage number was calculated according to the contribution of each land use category to each sampling site 2 2 water

of data was carried out before the selection of statistical analysis method the non parametric statistical method kendall tau b was selected for the correlation analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to examine if there was a significant difference in microorganism population and environmental parameters for different sites and sampling duration cluster analysis was used to classify the sampling sites according to the microbial population the dissimilarity of the microbial community between samples was analyzed with principal coordinates analysis pco plots cluster analysis and pco plot were carried out with primer software version 7 primer e ltd while the rest of the statistical analyses were done with spss software version 22 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters the mean standard deviation and minimum readings of environmental parameters are summarized in table 2 the water temperature and ph in local surface waters were relatively constant throughout the two year study with a standard deviation of 1 36 c and 0 97 respectively a wider range of readings was found in other environmental parameters such as salinity conductivity dissolved oxygen do and turbidity table 2 the environmental parameters for each sampling area are presented in fig s2 3 2 occurrence and abundance of microbial indicators and pathogens in surface waters 29 targets were tested including fecal indicators coliphages human specific markers bacterial pathogens plant virus and enteric viruses table 2 prior to the quantification of these microorganisms a recovery test for pre concentration was conducted using the bacteriophage ms2 the recovery of pre concentration achieved in this study was 70 80 saeidi et al 2017 all the samples were subjected to an inhibitory test for qpcr samples with inhibition level greater than 3 ct units were diluted in order to achieve an inhibition level less than 3 ct units the total number of observed samples numobs and the percentage of nondetects nds are reported in table 2 fecal indicators e coli and enterococcus were detected in most of the water samples with the percentage of nondetects of 7 3 and 8 6 respectively the percentage of nondetects in coliphages was between 21 8 and 35 5 the genotypes of frna showed that frna g2 was more prevalent 52 3 in environmental waters compared to other genotypes such as frna g1 17 1 g3 5 and g4 1 8 bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b theta was detected most frequently 34 1 among the human specific markers followed by hpyvs 9 5 and m smithii 3 6 the opportunistic bacterial pathogen p aeruginosa was detected more frequently using the idexx kit with pseudalert 91 8 compared to the qpcr method 66 4 nevertheless the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two methods p 0 536 norovirus gii astrovirus and influenza a virus were the three most prevalent enteric viruses detected in singapore s surface waters table 2 the cell concentration for each microorganism was reported as the geometric mean and respective standard deviation by substituting the nondetects with half the lowest detection limit in addition the cell concentration was also reported in higher percentile i e 90 ile and 95 ile with the kaplan meirer method as recommended by helsel 2005 for data with more than 80 nondetects helsel 2005 e coli and enterococcus were frequently detected in water samples collected with a geometric mean of 111 7 mpn 100 ml and 40 7 mpn 100 ml respectively in general the coliphage counts were lower than the fecal indicator bacteria frna g2 had higher counts geometric mean 457 gc l among the other genotypes pepper mild mottle virus pmmov was generally more prevalent 70 4 and at much higher concentration geometric mean 2027 1 gc l than the other human specific markers of the enteric viruses tested in this study norovirus gii had the highest geometric mean 921 7 gc l followed by astrovirus 384 6 gc l influenza a virus 352 4 gc l norovirus gi 173 5 gc l and aichi virus 142 3 gc l 3 3 spatial variation of microbial indicators and pathogens the samples were divided into 7 subgroups based on the sampling locations table 1 water samples from both reservoir and tributaries were collected from sampling area a b and c while only reservoir samples were collected from sampling area d to g fig 1 shows the boxplot of the occurrence of microbial indicators in water samples collected from these 7 sampling areas throughout the two years sampling duration where the data from reservoirs and tributaries are plotted separately fig 1 in general the cell concentrations of all microbial indicators were higher in water samples collected from tributaries than reservoirs in particular water samples collected from the tributaries at sampling area a showed significantly high concentrations of frna g2 b theta and hpyvs similarly sampling sites b c and f had high concentrations of human specific markers i e frna g2 b theta and pmmov it is interesting to note that a relatively high concentration of frna g1was also observed in sampling area g parkland area the occurrence of pathogens in term of spatial variation is presented in fig 2 a g salmonella spp was commonly found in tributaries detection frequency ranged from 25 5 to 39 13 compared to reservoirs detection frequency 0 except for reservoir samples at sampling area g the concentration of salmonella spp at sampling area g ranged from 12 gc 100 ml to 523 gc 100 ml with a detection frequency of 37 5 the concentration of p aeruginosa in tributaries geometric mean with qpcr 558 10 gc 100 ml geometric mean with pseudalert 1088 76 mpn 100 ml were generally higher than reservoirs geometric mean with qpcr 34 96 gc 100 ml geometric mean with pseudalert 13 23 mpn 100 ml despite the low occurrence of adenovirus in all the samples tested overall detection frequency 12 7 the results showed that adenovirus was mostly detected in tributaries collected from sampling area c urbanized commercial area detection frequency 33 33 geometric mean 48 03 gc l the concentration of norovirus gii was generally high in both tributaries and reservoirs except for the reservoir samples at sampling area c sampling area a residential area with construction sites had the highest geometric mean of norovirus gii 1325 87 gc l followed by sampling area b agriculture area 1188 41 gc l and sampling area f industrial area 1100 30 gc l while sampling area d green area near wild life parks had the lowest geometric mean of norovirus gii 349 22 gc l other highly prevalent enteric viruses found in local surface waters were astrovirus and influenza a virus the geometric mean of astrovirus and influenza a virus at various sampling areas ranged from 274 45 gc l to 543 62 gc l and from 260 21 gc l to 492 90 gc l respectively the non parametric statistical analysis kruskal wallis test was carried out to test the significant difference in spatial distribution for microbial indicators and pathogens all microbial indicators were significantly different between sampling sites except for frna g1 and frna g4 table s2 these two indicators were infrequently detected in the water samples nds 82 3 and 98 2 respectively meanwhile for pathogens there were only two pathogens i e p aeruginosa and influenza a virus which showed a significant difference in concentration between sampling sites 3 4 temporal variation of microbial indicators and pathogens the occurrence data were categorized into four seasons i northeast monsoon december march ii inter monsoon april may iii southwest monsoon june september and iv inter monsoon october november based on the time when the samples were collected figs 3 and 4 based on the kruskal wallis test none of the microbial indicators showed statistically significant difference at the p 0 05 level between the seasons for the reservoir samples table s3 however b theta hpyvs and pmmov showed significant differences between seasons for the water samples collected from tributaries p 0 05 b theta had a relatively lower concentration during the southwest monsoon compared to other seasons while pmmov had the opposite trend where the concentration during the southwest monsoon was higher than other seasons hpyvs were mainly detected in december 2014 and january 2015 however this human specific marker was not detected in the subsequent northeast monsoon among the pathogens in reservoir samples norovirus gii astrovirus aichi virus and influenza a virus showed a significant difference between seasons table s3 the occurrence and concentration of norovirus gii was low during the inter monsoon apr may and pairwise comparisons showed that their counts were significantly different between the inter monsoon apr may and northeast monsoon as well as inter monsoon apr may and southwest monsoon periods fig s3 in general relatively high concentrations of astrovirus aichi virus and influenza a virus were found during the northeast monsoon in reservoir samples for water samples collected from tributaries p aeruginosa norovirus gi enterovirus and influenza a virus were the pathogens that showed significant differences in concentration between seasons table s3 the results revealed that norovirus gi and influenza a had the highest geometric mean during the southwest monsoon while p aeruginosa and enterovirus achieved the highest geometric means during the inter monsoon apr may period overall no universal trend can be drawn from the seasonal variation for microbes tested in this study rainfall intensity rainfall duration antecedent dry period and dilution factor could be some of the factors that affected the microbial concentration in different seasons kruskal wallis test revealed that rainfall do temperature salinity and electrical conductivity are significantly different during monsoon and inter monsoon seasons table s3 and fig s1 table s4 further described the rainfall pattern for different seasons in singapore based on the data collected during the sampling events in this two year study 3 5 correlations between microbial indicators pathogens and environmental parameters correlation analysis was conducted with kendal s tau b method the correlations were examined i between indicators table 3 ii between indicators and pathogens table 4 iii among pathogens table 5 and iv between environmental parameters and indicators pathogens table 6 this study found significant correlations among the fecal indicator bacteria r 0 670 and coliphages r 0 511 as well as between fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages r 0 432 0 801 among the pathogens p aeruginosa was the only pathogen that had moderate to good correlations with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages r 0 388 0 692 table 4 while weak correlations were found between fecal indicator bacteria coliphages and salmonella r 0 199 0 265 and also aichi virus r 0 124 0 293 alternative indicators which are suggested to be highly associated with human waste contamination were also examined in this study correlations analyses showed that frna g2 r 0 422 0 502 b theta r 0 340 0 497 and pmmov r 0 264 0 419 were correlated with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages table 3 frna g2 b theta and pmmov which are more specific to human fecal pollution were significantly correlated with most of the indicators except frna g4 unfortunately most of the enteric viruses did not have significant correlations greater than 0 3 with the alternative indicators except for aichi virus and sapovirus improved correlations were found between aichi virus and hpyvs r 0 471 and also between aichi virus and m smithii r 0 315 while sapovirus was correlated with frna g3 r 0 382 and m smithii r 0 332 although alternative indicators did not improve the correlations with p aeruginosa as compared with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages however moderate correlations were found with b theta hpyvs and pmmov r 0 325 0 480 correlation with salmonella also improved with b theta r 0 321 the results from this study revealed very weak correlations among the pathogens r 0 3 except for salmonella and p aeruginosa detected with qpcr r 0 313 note that there were two methods qpcr and idexx method used in this study for p aeruginosa quantification and both methods were significantly correlated at r 0 440 in terms of environmental factors an increase in temperature significantly reduced the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria coliphages frna g2 b theta hpyvs and bacterial pathogens while ec and salinity showed the opposite trend as expected the lower the do the higher the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages turbidity was generally correlated with the concentrations of bacteria and coliphage but not with the concentration of enteric viruses the correlation analysis also showed that the impact of daily rainfall was positively although weakly correlated with the occurrence of microbial indicators while weak negative correlations were observed between antecedent dry period and microbial indicators in addition there was a greater influence of land use on the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages compared to enteric viruses among the indicators and pathogens pmmov was significantly correlated with land use r 0 451 3 6 spatial clustering within the microbial community and relationships with environmental parameters an assessment of spatial variations in surface water quality is important for identifying sites where water quality has been impaired and subsequently to allow management to make better decisions to control and restore the water quality cluster analysis was used to group the sampling sites based on the occurrence of microorganisms data was log transformed and resemblance was conducted with bray curtis similarity hierarchical clustering was applied for the cluster analysis and the clustering result is illustrated by a dendrogram fig 5 at a similarity of 87 the sampling sites can generally be classified into five main clusters i e i to v the reservoir samples were clustered into two main clusters i and ii where cluster i comprised 7 reservoir samples collected from sampling areas b d e and g sampling areas b d and g are reservoirs located in areas where there are extensive forests and or green areas with minimal impact from anthropogenic activities although sampling area e is a reservoir in a residential area there is no direct surface runoff drain channeled into the reservoir hence the water quality is less impacted by nearby residential land use in comparison reservoir samples from sampling areas a c and f were grouped into cluster ii where industrial commercial and residential including several construction sites zones are predominant the water samples collected from tributaries at sampling area a sampling site a tributary1 and sampling area c sampling site c tributary1 were classified into two independent clusters cluster iii and cluster iv respectively the rest of the tributaries had high similarity in term of the distribution of microorganisms and were classified into the same cluster cluster v due to the large complexity between samples pco analysis was conducted to understand the similarity or dissimilarity of the microorganism community between samples the pco plot revealed that 71 1 of the variation could be explained through pco 1 and pco2 fig 6 by limiting the r value to greater than 0 5 the main variables that contributed to pco1 were e coli r 0 92 enterococcus r 0 90 somatic coliphage r 0 85 f coliphage r 0 71 total coliphage r 0 99 frna g2 r 0 75 b theta r 0 62 p aeruginosa r 0 71 pseudalert r 0 89 and pmmov r 0 65 norovirus gii was the only variable that contributed to pco2 with r 0 92 the impact of environmental variables on the distributions of microorganisms was also analyzed with the pco plot fig 6b by projecting the environmental vectors on the same axes and setting the r value to greater than 0 3 temperature r 0 36 ec r 0 37 salinity r 0 39 turbidity r 0 37 do r 0 3 and land use weightage r 0 53 were the main environmental variables that influenced the distribution of microorganisms further discussion can be found in the supplementary information 4 discussion our study examined the occurrence and the abundance of microbial indicators and pathogens in the surface waters over a period of two years in this study pre concentration using hollow fiber ultrafiltration was used to simultaneously concentrate a wide range of microbes from the environment this method allowed the parallel detection of viruses bacteria and protozoa data not shown to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive and systematic surveillance study done in tropical surface waters 4 1 microbial indicators studies have shown strong positive correlations between the membrane filter technique and idexx kits budnick et al 1996 kinzelman et al 2005 as such the readings from idexx kits were compared directly with usepa recreational water quality guideline values in this study the geometric mean for e coli 111 7 mpn 100 ml was below the usepa s recreational water quality guideline value of 126 cfu 100 ml for primary contact recreational activities usepa 2012 meanwhile the geometric mean for enterococcus 40 7 mpn 100 ml was slightly above the usepa s guideline value 35 cfu 100 ml according to singapore s recreational water quality guidelines it is recommended that recreational waters are suitable for primary contact recreational activities if enterococcus counts are below 200 counts 100 ml 95 of the time source www nea gov sg based on reservoir data enterococcus counts were always low in reservoirs compared to tributaries and generally fulfilled the requirement for primary contact recreational activities except for sampling area f geometric mean 41 5 mpn 100 ml 80 of the time the enterococcus counts were below 200 counts 100 ml nevertheless all reservoirs in singapore are currently not open for primary contact activities the coliphage analyses showed that somatic coliphages were generally more prevalent and had higher concentrations compared to f coliphages which is in agreement with other studies aw and gin 2010 benjamin chung et al 2017 lodder and de roda husman 2005 the recent introduction of a new coliphage host e coli cb390 which can simultaneously detect both somatic coliphages and f coliphages was also used in this study guzmán et al 2008 as reported in earlier studies this study also found no statistical difference between the sum of concentrations detected using e coli cn13 somatic coliphage and e coli famp f coliphage with the concentrations detected using e coli cb390 total coliphages for the environmental water samples tested mann whitney test p 0 221 bailey et al 2017 most of the serious threats to humans is believed to originate from human waste contamination rather than from animal waste field and samadpour 2007 unfortunately the source of contamination is difficult to track based on fecal indicator bacteria as these indicators could be released into environment by both humans and animals fecal sources souza et al 1999 as a result the human specific markers such as b theta hpyvs and m smithii have been suggested as potential markers for human waste contamination carson et al 2005 harwood et al 2014 johnston et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 2012 yampara iquise et al 2008 in this study a high prevalence of b theta was observed compared to hpyvs and m smithii an earlier study showed that b theta was more sensitive towards the detection of human waste contamination although hpyvs gave better specificity in terms of human source tracking unpublished data carson et al 2005 found a cross reactivity with dogs 16 of 31 samples in their b theta assay carson et al 2005 however griffith et al 2009 showed that the detection of b theta was among the most reliable methods to detect samples containing human fecal material with no false positive results griffith et al 2009 studies have shown that the genotypes of frna are associated with different sources of contamination hsu et al 1995 stewart pullaro et al 2006 i e the presence of frna g2 and g3 are typically associated with human waste contamination while frna g1 and g4 are typically associated with animal wastes in this study frna g2 was the most prevalent genotype among the four genotype groups this may explain the high probability of human waste contamination in the water samples tested however studies also revealed the possible detection of frna g2 in poultry pig and cattle feces schaper et al 2002b and the presence of frna g4 in human feces hsu et al 1995 in this study a higher prevalence of frna g2 detection frequency 52 3 was found compared to frna g3 detection frequency 5 this finding contradicts an earlier study which reported that frna g2 seems to be more prominent in cold regions while frna g3 dominated in warm regions furuse et al 1978 one of the possible reasons could be the higher persistence of frna g2 compared to frna g3 in natural environments schaper et al 2002a it is also interesting to note that a relatively high concentration of frna g1 was observed at sampling area g a protected catchment with rich biodiversity this is consistent with the fact that frna g1 is associated with fecal wastes from animals cole et al 2003 pmmov a virus that can infect pepper plants has been suggested as one of the potential indicators for human fecal contamination due to its high abundance in human feces and high prevalence in the human population zhang et al 2005 although pmmov showed high prevalence in local surface waters the application of this indicator in human waste source tracking needs to be evaluated carefully particularly in the context of wastewater reuse studies have shown the difficulty in removing pmmov during wastewater treatment due to its high abundance and persistence kitajima et al 2014 in summary the detection of these different human specific markers suggested a high probability of human waste contamination in the tributaries at sampling sites a b c and f although the tributaries where these markers were detected are not used for recreational water activities the tracking of human source contamination would be useful to identify the upstream source of pollution and hence provide better mitigation strategies to remedy downstream contamination problems 4 2 pathogens norovirus gii 51 8 astrovirus 64 5 and influenza a virus 65 4 were the three most prevalent enteric viruses detected in singapore s surface waters norovirus gii showed a similar range of detection rate 48 69 with earlier studies in singapore aw and gin 2011 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 a relatively high prevalence of norovirus gii was also reported in environmental surface waters at different locations calgua et al 2013 kishida et al 2012 kiulia et al 2014 lee and kim 2008 in this study a higher prevalence of norovirus gii 51 8 was found compared to norovirus gi 40 a virus decay study conducted in groundwater revealed that norovirus gii was more persistent than norovirus gi charles et al 2009 as currently there is no available cell line for the norovirus infectivity test the detection of norovirus relies on molecular methods teunis et al 2008 demonstrated the low infectious dose for norovirus where the 50 infectious dose ld50 was equivalent to 1015 genomes copies or 18 viruses teunis et al 2008 ngazoa et al 2008 reported approximately 30 of norovirus genomes were detected in river water after 30 days incubation at 25 c this explains the high prevalence of norovirus in surface waters found in this study another study on viral persistence revealed that the reduction rate of nucleic acid of norovirus surrogates was significantly lower than the reduction rate of infectivity bae and schwab 2008 nevertheless extra precautions are needed when interpreting health risks brought by norovirus due to its low infectious dose in the case of astrovirus the detection frequency 58 was comparable to the results reported by aw and gin s study 2011 50 although there is no clear explanation for the high prevalence of astrovirus in local surface waters compared to other places pusch et al 2005 steyer et al 2011 taylor et al 2001 one of the reasons could be due to the persistence of certain serogroups of astrovirus in tropical conditions another possible explanation is the close genetic relationship between human astrovirus and animal astrovirus as well the cross infectivity of human and animal astrovirus de benedictis et al 2011 delwart 2012 influenza a viruses are pathogens that can infect large numbers of warm blooded animals such as birds pigs horses and humans it is believed that aquatic birds serve as a natural reservoir for all known subtypes of influenza a virus and are probably the ultimate source of human pandemic influenza strains taubenberger and morens 2010 webster et al 1992 studies have shown that a high persistence of influenza a viruses in environmental waters which can remain infectious over a long period depending on the strain types and environmental factors e g salinity temperature ph dublineau et al 2011 keeler et al 2013 2014 stallknecht et al 1990 webster et al 1992 in this study a high detection rate of influenza a virus was found 64 5 which is higher than those previously reported in france 44 4 deboosere et al 2011 and netherlands 40 heijnen and medema 2011 heijnen and medema et al s study suggested the discharge of treated sewage was not the primary source of influenza a virus detected in river water but rather was mainly from aquatic birds due to the very low prevalence of influenza a virus in sewage samples 1 out of 10 samples in our study the highest mean concentration of influenza a virus was found at sampling area b mean 3063 85 gc l which was an area dominated by chicken farming although other studies showed the high prevalence of adenovirus in natural environments jiang 2006 rigotto et al 2010 the detection frequency of adenovirus observed in this study was only 12 7 with a geometric mean concentration of 29 gc l a low prevalence of adenovirus was also reported in choi and jiang s study 2005 where 16 out of 114 river samples from california had positive detections of adenovirus in the same study negative results were reported for infection of adenovirus using two human tissue culture cell lines hek293a and a5949 choi and jiang 2005 similarly this study also found negative results for infectious adenovirus using the integrated cell culture pcr icc pcr with human colon carcinoma caco 2 cell line in surface waters in contrast positive infectivity results were observed in samples collected from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant data not shown the absence of infectious adenovirus observed in surface waters could be due to the loss of viral infectivity after exposure to sunlight or other harsh conditions in the natural environment in addition to the low concentrations detected comparing the occurrence data obtained in this study with earlier studies conducted in singapore a clear trend of reduction in enteric viruses i e adenovirus rotavirus and enterovirus was found aw and gin 2011 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 this showed the effectiveness of the public sewers rehabilitation programme to restore the structural integrity of the sewerage system and hence minimize pollution to surface waters high prevalence of sapovirus has been reported in many environmental waters such as in japan 20 kitajima et al 2010 and south africa 14 92 murray et al 2013 however a low detection frequency was found in this study 4 1 as reported in kitajima et al s study 2010 sapovirus was mostly detected during winter time november to march this may explain the low prevalence of sapovirus in singapore which has warm tropical temperature throughout the year hepatitis e virus was detected sporadically at different locations with the highest geometric mean of 999 38 gc l at sampling area d an area surrounded by green areas forests as well as wild life parks the seasonal distribution patterns revealed a higher prevalence and concentration of hepatitis e virus during the northeast monsoon and southwest monsoon fig 4 consistent with heavy rain which could flush animals feces from green areas or parks into the tributaries and reservoirs although p aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is ubiquitously present in natural environments the ability of p aeruginosa to resist multiple antibiotics makes this opportunistic pathogen a clinically important pathogen lister et al 2009 in this study a high detection frequency of p aeruginosa was observed using the idexx kit i e pseudalert compared to the qpcr method this could be due to the lower detection limit that can be achieved with the idexx kit in addition the qpcr method only quantifies the toxin a synthesis regulating gene rega gene while the idexx kit quantifies p aeruginosa strains although the correlation between the readings from pseudalert and qpcr is not strong r 0 440 p 0 01 the wilcoxon sign rank test showed that the detection of p aeruginosa did not elicit a statistically significant difference with both methods p 0 536 in this study salmonella spp was not detected in reservoirs except for sampling area g with concentrations up to 523 gc 100 ml and detection frequency of 37 5 reptiles amphibians and birds are some animals that frequently carry salmonella spp silva et al 2014 sampling area g is a relatively protected forested area low urban development but the presence of these animals in the natural environment may have contributed to the higher counts and prevalence of salmonella spp in reservoirs here compared to other sites 4 3 correlations between indicators pathogens and environmental variables several epidemiological studies have been conducted to relate the presence of indicator bacteria with gastroenteritis illness however some studies have shown limited correlations between fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens wu et al 2011 alternative indicators such as human specific markers i e bacteroides m smithii and hpyvs coliphages i e somatic and f coliphages genotypes of frna phages and plant virus i e pmmov have recently been proposed to allow for better prediction of human pathogens hughes et al 2017 mcquaig et al 2009 2012 vergara et al 2015 yampara iquise et al 2008 as a result a number of recent studies have focused on correlations between the alternative indicators and pathogens harwood et al 2014 jofre et al 2016 nevertheless disparate results were reported to our knowledge none of the studies have related these indicators to a wide range of human viruses particularly enteric viruses in waters as shown in the earlier studies this study found significant correlations among fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages liang et al 2015 lodder et al 2010 rezaeinejad et al 2014 this is expected as coliphages are the phages for e coli hosts and all these indicators should have originated from the same sources however fecal indicator bacteria coliphages did not correlate well with most of the pathogens except for p aeruginosa similar to many other studies nevertheless there are some studies which demonstrated limited correlations between indicator bacteria coliphages and pathogens for instance significant weak correlation was found between f coliphage and norovirus gi r 0 233 and norovirus gii r 0 312 rezaeinejad et al 2014 even though lodder et al 2010 and liang et al 2015 failed to show the correlation between coliphages and norovirus the inclusion of alternative indicators in this study improved the correlations with pathogens especially for salmonella spp sapovirus and aichi virus liang et al s study 2015 showed an improvement in predictive stepwise linear regreasion models for salmonella spp and norovirus gii by incorporating the alternative indicators i e hpyvs and m smithii there are several factors that may contribute to the lack of correlation between indicators and pathogens these factors include the survival and transport of indicators pathogens in the natural environment shedding patterns among host populations detection method percentage of positive detection land uses as well as geographic variation wu et al 2011 the major drawback for fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages is that these bacteria phages cannot indicate the source of pollution as they are present in both human and animal wastes havelaar et al 1986 as such it is not surprising that very weak or even no correlation was found between indicators coliphages and enteric viruses which are mainly excreted from infected humans apart from the different shedding patterns for human pathogens fecal indicator bacteria are also able to persist for extended periods and may even grow in the natural environment byappanahalli et al 2006 in an earlier controlled laboratory study the survival of indicators and human specific indicators was examined together with adenovirus under the effects of sunlight and salinity liang et al 2017 the study showed that b theta had slightly lower decay rates compared to adenovirus in both fresh and sea water while m smithii had higher decay rates than adenovirus in both fresh and seawaters these differences may explain the slightly better correlations between b theta and adenovirus compared to other indicators in this study r 0 233 the weak correlations between fecal indicators coliphages and pathogens could also be due to the different detection methods these differences could have implications on the final results due to variations in sensitivity recovery rate and specificity thus similar detection methods will usually yield better correlations in this study p aeruginosa quantified with idexx kits correlated better with indicators examined with culture based method than p aeruginosa quantified by the molecular method the low shedding rate and low percentage of positive detection in pathogens also contributed to the lack of correlation with indicators among the pathogens p aeruginosa quantified by idexx kit is the only pathogen that achieved high detection frequency 91 8 and hence stronger correlations with indicators were observed apart from the factors discussed above land use also played a major role in the correlation analysis compared with the earlier studies conducted in singapore relatively weak correlations were found in this study particularly between the indicators and pathogens the reason being this study extended the sampling sites to other major reservoirs in singapore which covered various types of land use whereas the previous study focused on a single urbanized reservoir and its tributaries when separate correlation analysis was conducted based on specific sites the correlations improved significantly while this study showed a higher concentration of microbes during the wet season compared to dry season rochelle newall et al 2016 the study failed to draw a general seasonal variation pattern for microbes except for human specific markers similarly a study in vietnam also showed no significant seasonal difference in e coli nguyen et al 2016 as the sampling events were conducted on a monthly basis limited storm water samples were collected to represent a complete hydrology profile during the monsoon wet season nevertheless correlation analysis showed consistent relationships albeit weak between the concentration of indicator microbes and rainfall r 0 163 to 0 209 as well as antecedent dry period r 0 121 to 0 190 5 conclusions the present study reports the occurrence and distribution of microbial indicators pathogenic bacteria and enteric viruses in tropical surface waters collected from 7 sampling areas 19 sampling sites with varied land use over a period of two years the application of hollow fiber ultrafiltration coupled with molecular detection methods allowed rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide range of microorganisms including the presence of pathogenic viruses despite the strong correlations among the indicators and coliphages relative weak or no correlations were found between indicators and viral pathogens the present study also failed to identify a universal indicator that was associated with all the pathogens tested in addition the correlations between indicators and pathogens could be highly variable depending on environmental factors such as temperature land use rainfall geographical location etc as such future prediction of pathogens may require a suite of indicators rather than a single indicator machine learning models which enable learning from large data sets could be a better approach for future pathogen predictive models statistical analyses revealed that the occurrence of indicators was significantly different between sampling sites compared to pathogens cluster analysis and pco plots successfully identified potential sites which had degraded or poorer water quality this will aid in management strategies to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality as current detection of enteric viruses was based on molecular methods it was not possible to give strong evidence on the risks of these viruses which rely mainly on cell culture infectivity tests nevertheless preliminary studies on virus infectivity showed that a relatively low fraction of infectious adenovirus and astrovirus was present when measured with icc pcr compared to qpcr which is in agreement with other studies choi and jiang 2005 le cann et al 2004 as such the interpretation of health risks brought by these enteric viruses need to be evaluated carefully declaration of interest

19109,fecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli e coli and enterococcus have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens however the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged particularly in tropical aquatic environments the objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators pathogens and environmental parameters the spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations a total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries and tested for fecal indicator bacteria coliphages human specific markers pathogenic bacteria and viruses the prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees of the enteric viruses norovirus gii was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration although strong correlations were found between indicators only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens the results in this study showed that none of the bacteria phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens inclusion of the alternative indicators methanobrevibacter smithii bacteroides and human polyomaviruses hpyvs to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human the microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus help to identify sites which have poor water quality this approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria indicators pathogens enteric viruses coliphages occurrence correlations 1 introduction increasing urbanization industrialization and agricultural activity have greatly impaired surface water quality globally waterborne pathogens include viruses and bacteria which can be introduced into the urban water cycle via leaking sewers urban runoff agricultural runoff and wastewater discharges arnone and walling 2007 enteric viruses are widely recognized as the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens causing both sporadic and outbreak related illnesses la rosa et al 2012 among enteric viruses noroviruses astroviruses enteroviruses adenoviruses and hepatitis a virus are the most extensively studied aw et al 2009 ganesh and lin 2013 of these adenovirus caliciviruses includes norovirus enterovirus and hepatitis a virus are listed in the usepa ccl3 which are currently not subjected to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations and which may require regulation under the safe drinking water act sdwa usepa 2009 little is known about the epidemiology of enteric viruses as well as their occurrence and behavior in tropical aquatic environments since most studies have been conducted in temperate and cold regions in addition to enteric viruses other potential emerging viral pathogens e g hepatitis e virus sapovirus nipah virus coronavirus bird flu virus may originate from wild animals in tropical catchment forests hepatitis e virus hev a causative agent of human hepatitis e is a single stranded positive sense rna virus from the genus hepevirus nan et al 2017 hev is transmitted primarily in humans by the fecal oral route through contaminated drinking water or food outbreaks normally occur in developing or undeveloped countries ahmad et al 2010 howard et al 2010 khan et al 2011 however recent evidence has shown that various animal species have serum antibodies to hev suggesting hepatitis e is a zoonotic disease meng 2010 nan et al 2017 li et al 2005 reported that genotype 3 hev rna was detected in both patient serum and wild boar meat li et al 2005 this raises concern that hev may be discharged into tributaries through animals which exist in forested areas sapovirus is another emerging enteric virus it belongs to caliciviruses and causes acute viral gastroenteritis haramoto et al 2008 sano et al 2011 as it has been identified in bats dogs pigs and mink oka et al 2015 it may also exist in tropical catchment waters other potential zoonotic viruses include coronavirus such as sars casanova et al 2009 de wit et al 2016 and bird flu virus influenza a virus subtypes h5n1 and h7n9 peiris et al 2007 shi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 apart from viruses bacteria that cause illness from recreational waters include salmonella pseudomonas aeruginosa shigella campylobacter and enteropathogenic escherichia coli hlavsa et al 2015 sanborn and takaro 2013 p aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen and occurs naturally in aquatic environments however the infections caused by p aeruginosa in recreational waters should not be neglected particularly for young children elder people and immune compromised population moreover p aeruginosa is currently one of the major bacteria that is capable of multiple drug resistance aloush et al 2006 hirsch and tam 2010 another bacterium that can cause recreational water related illness is salmonella although salmonellae are usually known as foodborne pathogens water could be a potential mode of transmission salmonella can be found in the feces of a large variety of vertebrates including humans reptiles birds farm and wild animals matias et al 2016 silva et al 2014 to date water quality monitoring is still based on the detection of fecal indicator bacteria i e e coli and enterococcus ideally fecal indicator bacteria should originate from the same host as the pathogen and have similar survival pattern as the pathogen outside the host however substantial evidence shows the limitations of using only these indicators to represent the water quality from a fecal point of view byappanahalli et al 2006 field and samadpour 2007 wu et al 2011 studies have shown the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in tropical regions byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 carrillo et al 1985 this could be due to the higher humidity warmer conditions heavier rainfall with highly erosive rains that encourage the splash effect and transportation of microorganisms in tropical regions rochelle newall et al 2015 although there is less seasonal variation in tropical regions as compared to temperate regions the monsoon season wet season and inter monsoon season dry season showed significant difference in the occurrence of microorganisms chuah and ziegler 2018 nguyen et al 2016 rochelle newall et al 2016 consequently alternative indicators such as coliphages and human specific markers have been suggested to address the limitation of fecal indicator bacteria field and samadpour 2007 harwood et al 2013 2014 the relationship between the presence of pathogens including viruses and alternative indicators has been studied however disparate results have been obtained harwood et al 2014 and jofre et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive review of the correlations between alternative indicators and coliphages with epidemiological studies and pathogens wu et al 2011 suggested several factors that could contribute to the varied results in different studies sample size and the number of positive samples for pathogens are among the main factors that determine the correlations between indicators and pathogens in recent years it was reported that wild boar numbers in singapore s forests are rapidly increasing national parks board of singapore 2013 possibly resulting in potential contamination of hev in tributaries although this has yet to be established the close proximity of forests and wetlands and urban populations in singapore could lead to exposure of zoonotic pathogens through discharge into tributaries and reservoirs potentially resulting in health risks to humans to date the emerging viral pathogens have not received sufficient attention and there have been no studies on these viruses in singapore s surface waters in this study surveillance of indicators and pathogens was carried out to determine the prevalence of pathogens in catchments with different land use providing a baseline of the surface water quality in tropical urban environments with a range of land use as there are contrasting results in previous correlation studies between indicators including alternative indicators and pathogens this study aims to identify the major correlations and examine if these indicators are associated with the occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens for the tropical catchments studied the spatial and temporal distributions of indicators and pathogens were also studied in order to identify the diversity patterns of these microorganisms in reservoirs and tributaries with different land use as well as the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites and land use studies this study was conducted in singapore coordinates of singapore 1 352083 103 8198395 with a land area of 719 1 km2 and population of 5 61 million people as of 2016 department of statistics singapore 2016 sampling sites and land use categories were mapped with arcgis version 10 3 1 software esri redlands ca usa land use shape files were obtained from the singapore land authority sla and pub singapore s national water agency where the land use subcategories were defined by the urban redevelopment authority ura however to reduce the number of parameters subcategories were merged into 5 main categories i residential ii urban iii green iv agricultural and v water body the characteristics for each sampling location are described in table 1 in order to reduce the number of parameters the weightage of land use which is the combination of different land use categories was calculated for the calculation of weightage numbers 4 3 2 and 1 were assigned to residential urban agriculture and green respectively a final weightage number was calculated according to the contribution of each land use category to each sampling site 2 2 water sampling and processing water samples 234 samples were collected throughout the two year study november 2014 to february 2017 from 7 sites 10 reservoirs and 9 tributaries in singapore located in

of data was carried out before the selection of statistical analysis method the non parametric statistical method kendall tau b was selected for the correlation analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to examine if there was a significant difference in microorganism population and environmental parameters for different sites and sampling duration cluster analysis was used to classify the sampling sites according to the microbial population the dissimilarity of the microbial community between samples was analyzed with principal coordinates analysis pco plots cluster analysis and pco plot were carried out with primer software version 7 primer e ltd while the rest of the statistical analyses were done with spss software version 22 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters the mean standard deviation and minimum readings of environmental parameters are summarized in table 2 the water temperature and ph in local surface waters were relatively constant throughout the two year study with a standard deviation of 1 36 c and 0 97 respectively a wider range of readings was found in other environmental parameters such as salinity conductivity dissolved oxygen do and turbidity table 2 the environmental parameters for each sampling area are presented in fig s2 3 2 occurrence and abundance of microbial indicators and pathogens in surface waters 29 targets were tested including fecal indicators coliphages human specific markers bacterial pathogens plant virus and enteric viruses table 2 prior to the quantification of these microorganisms a recovery test for pre concentration was conducted using the bacteriophage ms2 the recovery of pre concentration achieved in this study was 70 80 saeidi et al 2017 all the samples were subjected to an inhibitory test for qpcr samples with inhibition level greater than 3 ct units were diluted in order to achieve an inhibition level less than 3 ct units the total number of observed samples numobs and the percentage of nondetects nds are reported in table 2 fecal indicators e coli and enterococcus were detected in most of the water samples with the percentage of nondetects of 7 3 and 8 6 respectively the percentage of nondetects in coliphages was between 21 8 and 35 5 the genotypes of frna showed that frna g2 was more prevalent 52 3 in environmental waters compared to other genotypes such as frna g1 17 1 g3 5 and g4 1 8 bacteroides thetaiotaomicron b theta was detected most frequently 34 1 among the human specific markers followed by hpyvs 9 5 and m smithii 3 6 the opportunistic bacterial pathogen p aeruginosa was detected more frequently using the idexx kit with pseudalert 91 8 compared to the qpcr method 66 4 nevertheless the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two methods p 0 536 norovirus gii astrovirus and influenza a virus were the three most prevalent enteric viruses detected in singapore s surface waters table 2 the cell concentration for each microorganism was reported as the geometric mean and respective standard deviation by substituting the nondetects with half the lowest detection limit in addition the cell concentration was also reported in higher percentile i e 90 ile and 95 ile with the kaplan meirer method as recommended by helsel 2005 for data with more than 80 nondetects helsel 2005 e coli and enterococcus were frequently detected in water samples collected with a geometric mean of 111 7 mpn 100 ml and 40 7 mpn 100 ml respectively in general the coliphage counts were lower than the fecal indicator bacteria frna g2 had higher counts geometric mean 457 gc l among the other genotypes pepper mild mottle virus pmmov was generally more prevalent 70 4 and at much higher concentration geometric mean 2027 1 gc l than the other human specific markers of the enteric viruses tested in this study norovirus gii had the highest geometric mean 921 7 gc l followed by astrovirus 384 6 gc l influenza a virus 352 4 gc l norovirus gi 173 5 gc l and aichi virus 142 3 gc l 3 3 spatial variation of microbial indicators and pathogens the samples were divided into 7 subgroups based on the sampling locations table 1 water samples from both reservoir and tributaries were collected from sampling area a b and c while only reservoir samples were collected from sampling area d to g fig 1 shows the boxplot of the occurrence of microbial indicators in water samples collected from these 7 sampling areas throughout the two years sampling duration where the data from reservoirs and tributaries are plotted separately fig 1 in general the cell concentrations of all microbial indicators were higher in water samples collected from tributaries than reservoirs in particular water samples collected from the tributaries at sampling area a showed significantly high concentrations of frna g2 b theta and hpyvs similarly sampling sites b c and f had high concentrations of human specific markers i e frna g2 b theta and pmmov it is interesting to note that a relatively high concentration of frna g1was also observed in sampling area g parkland area the occurrence of pathogens in term of spatial variation is presented in fig 2 a g salmonella spp was commonly found in tributaries detection frequency ranged from 25 5 to 39 13 compared to reservoirs detection frequency 0 except for reservoir samples at sampling area g the concentration of salmonella spp at sampling area g ranged from 12 gc 100 ml to 523 gc 100 ml with a detection frequency of 37 5 the concentration of p aeruginosa in tributaries geometric mean with qpcr 558 10 gc 100 ml geometric mean with pseudalert 1088 76 mpn 100 ml were generally higher than reservoirs geometric mean with qpcr 34 96 gc 100 ml geometric mean with pseudalert 13 23 mpn 100 ml despite the low occurrence of adenovirus in all the samples tested overall detection frequency 12 7 the results showed that adenovirus was mostly detected in tributaries collected from sampling area c urbanized commercial area detection frequency 33 33 geometric mean 48 03 gc l the concentration of norovirus gii was generally high in both tributaries and reservoirs except for the reservoir samples at sampling area c sampling area a residential area with construction sites had the highest geometric mean of norovirus gii 1325 87 gc l followed by sampling area b agriculture area 1188 41 gc l and sampling area f industrial area 1100 30 gc l while sampling area d green area near wild life parks had the lowest geometric mean of norovirus gii 349 22 gc l other highly prevalent enteric viruses found in local surface waters were astrovirus and influenza a virus the geometric mean of astrovirus and influenza a virus at various sampling areas ranged from 274 45 gc l to 543 62 gc l and from 260 21 gc l to 492 90 gc l respectively the non parametric statistical analysis kruskal wallis test was carried out to test the significant difference in spatial distribution for microbial indicators and pathogens all microbial indicators were significantly different between sampling sites except for frna g1 and frna g4 table s2 these two indicators were infrequently detected in the water samples nds 82 3 and 98 2 respectively meanwhile for pathogens there were only two pathogens i e p aeruginosa and influenza a virus which showed a significant difference in concentration between sampling sites 3 4 temporal variation of microbial indicators and pathogens the occurrence data were categorized into four seasons i northeast monsoon december march ii inter monsoon april may iii southwest monsoon june september and iv inter monsoon october november based on the time when the samples were collected figs 3 and 4 based on the kruskal wallis test none of the microbial indicators showed statistically significant difference at the p 0 05 level between the seasons for the reservoir samples table s3 however b theta hpyvs and pmmov showed significant differences between seasons for the water samples collected from tributaries p 0 05 b theta had a relatively lower concentration during the southwest monsoon compared to other seasons while pmmov had the opposite trend where the concentration during the southwest monsoon was higher than other seasons hpyvs were mainly detected in december 2014 and january 2015 however this human specific marker was not detected in the subsequent northeast monsoon among the pathogens in reservoir samples norovirus gii astrovirus aichi virus and influenza a virus showed a significant difference between seasons table s3 the occurrence and concentration of norovirus gii was low during the inter monsoon apr may and pairwise comparisons showed that their counts were significantly different between the inter monsoon apr may and northeast monsoon as well as inter monsoon apr may and southwest monsoon periods fig s3 in general relatively high concentrations of astrovirus aichi virus and influenza a virus were found during the northeast monsoon in reservoir samples for water samples collected from tributaries p aeruginosa norovirus gi enterovirus and influenza a virus were the pathogens that showed significant differences in concentration between seasons table s3 the results revealed that norovirus gi and influenza a had the highest geometric mean during the southwest monsoon while p aeruginosa and enterovirus achieved the highest geometric means during the inter monsoon apr may period overall no universal trend can be drawn from the seasonal variation for microbes tested in this study rainfall intensity rainfall duration antecedent dry period and dilution factor could be some of the factors that affected the microbial concentration in different seasons kruskal wallis test revealed that rainfall do temperature salinity and electrical conductivity are significantly different during monsoon and inter monsoon seasons table s3 and fig s1 table s4 further described the rainfall pattern for different seasons in singapore based on the data collected during the sampling events in this two year study 3 5 correlations between microbial indicators pathogens and environmental parameters correlation analysis was conducted with kendal s tau b method the correlations were examined i between indicators table 3 ii between indicators and pathogens table 4 iii among pathogens table 5 and iv between environmental parameters and indicators pathogens table 6 this study found significant correlations among the fecal indicator bacteria r 0 670 and coliphages r 0 511 as well as between fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages r 0 432 0 801 among the pathogens p aeruginosa was the only pathogen that had moderate to good correlations with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages r 0 388 0 692 table 4 while weak correlations were found between fecal indicator bacteria coliphages and salmonella r 0 199 0 265 and also aichi virus r 0 124 0 293 alternative indicators which are suggested to be highly associated with human waste contamination were also examined in this study correlations analyses showed that frna g2 r 0 422 0 502 b theta r 0 340 0 497 and pmmov r 0 264 0 419 were correlated with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages table 3 frna g2 b theta and pmmov which are more specific to human fecal pollution were significantly correlated with most of the indicators except frna g4 unfortunately most of the enteric viruses did not have significant correlations greater than 0 3 with the alternative indicators except for aichi virus and sapovirus improved correlations were found between aichi virus and hpyvs r 0 471 and also between aichi virus and m smithii r 0 315 while sapovirus was correlated with frna g3 r 0 382 and m smithii r 0 332 although alternative indicators did not improve the correlations with p aeruginosa as compared with fecal indicator bacteria coliphages however moderate correlations were found with b theta hpyvs and pmmov r 0 325 0 480 correlation with salmonella also improved with b theta r 0 321 the results from this study revealed very weak correlations among the pathogens r 0 3 except for salmonella and p aeruginosa detected with qpcr r 0 313 note that there were two methods qpcr and idexx method used in this study for p aeruginosa quantification and both methods were significantly correlated at r 0 440 in terms of environmental factors an increase in temperature significantly reduced the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria coliphages frna g2 b theta hpyvs and bacterial pathogens while ec and salinity showed the opposite trend as expected the lower the do the higher the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages turbidity was generally correlated with the concentrations of bacteria and coliphage but not with the concentration of enteric viruses the correlation analysis also showed that the impact of daily rainfall was positively although weakly correlated with the occurrence of microbial indicators while weak negative correlations were observed between antecedent dry period and microbial indicators in addition there was a greater influence of land use on the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages compared to enteric viruses among the indicators and pathogens pmmov was significantly correlated with land use r 0 451 3 6 spatial clustering within the microbial community and relationships with environmental parameters an assessment of spatial variations in surface water quality is important for identifying sites where water quality has been impaired and subsequently to allow management to make better decisions to control and restore the water quality cluster analysis was used to group the sampling sites based on the occurrence of microorganisms data was log transformed and resemblance was conducted with bray curtis similarity hierarchical clustering was applied for the cluster analysis and the clustering result is illustrated by a dendrogram fig 5 at a similarity of 87 the sampling sites can generally be classified into five main clusters i e i to v the reservoir samples were clustered into two main clusters i and ii where cluster i comprised 7 reservoir samples collected from sampling areas b d e and g sampling areas b d and g are reservoirs located in areas where there are extensive forests and or green areas with minimal impact from anthropogenic activities although sampling area e is a reservoir in a residential area there is no direct surface runoff drain channeled into the reservoir hence the water quality is less impacted by nearby residential land use in comparison reservoir samples from sampling areas a c and f were grouped into cluster ii where industrial commercial and residential including several construction sites zones are predominant the water samples collected from tributaries at sampling area a sampling site a tributary1 and sampling area c sampling site c tributary1 were classified into two independent clusters cluster iii and cluster iv respectively the rest of the tributaries had high similarity in term of the distribution of microorganisms and were classified into the same cluster cluster v due to the large complexity between samples pco analysis was conducted to understand the similarity or dissimilarity of the microorganism community between samples the pco plot revealed that 71 1 of the variation could be explained through pco 1 and pco2 fig 6 by limiting the r value to greater than 0 5 the main variables that contributed to pco1 were e coli r 0 92 enterococcus r 0 90 somatic coliphage r 0 85 f coliphage r 0 71 total coliphage r 0 99 frna g2 r 0 75 b theta r 0 62 p aeruginosa r 0 71 pseudalert r 0 89 and pmmov r 0 65 norovirus gii was the only variable that contributed to pco2 with r 0 92 the impact of environmental variables on the distributions of microorganisms was also analyzed with the pco plot fig 6b by projecting the environmental vectors on the same axes and setting the r value to greater than 0 3 temperature r 0 36 ec r 0 37 salinity r 0 39 turbidity r 0 37 do r 0 3 and land use weightage r 0 53 were the main environmental variables that influenced the distribution of microorganisms further discussion can be found in the supplementary information 4 discussion our study examined the occurrence and the abundance of microbial indicators and pathogens in the surface waters over a period of two years in this study pre concentration using hollow fiber ultrafiltration was used to simultaneously concentrate a wide range of microbes from the environment this method allowed the parallel detection of viruses bacteria and protozoa data not shown to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive and systematic surveillance study done in tropical surface waters 4 1 microbial indicators studies have shown strong positive correlations between the membrane filter technique and idexx kits budnick et al 1996 kinzelman et al 2005 as such the readings from idexx kits were compared directly with usepa recreational water quality guideline values in this study the geometric mean for e coli 111 7 mpn 100 ml was below the usepa s recreational water quality guideline value of 126 cfu 100 ml for primary contact recreational activities usepa 2012 meanwhile the geometric mean for enterococcus 40 7 mpn 100 ml was slightly above the usepa s guideline value 35 cfu 100 ml according to singapore s recreational water quality guidelines it is recommended that recreational waters are suitable for primary contact recreational activities if enterococcus counts are below 200 counts 100 ml 95 of the time source www nea gov sg based on reservoir data enterococcus counts were always low in reservoirs compared to tributaries and generally fulfilled the requirement for primary contact recreational activities except for sampling area f geometric mean 41 5 mpn 100 ml 80 of the time the enterococcus counts were below 200 counts 100 ml nevertheless all reservoirs in singapore are currently not open for primary contact activities the coliphage analyses showed that somatic coliphages were generally more prevalent and had higher concentrations compared to f coliphages which is in agreement with other studies aw and gin 2010 benjamin chung et al 2017 lodder and de roda husman 2005 the recent introduction of a new coliphage host e coli cb390 which can simultaneously detect both somatic coliphages and f coliphages was also used in this study guzmán et al 2008 as reported in earlier studies this study also found no statistical difference between the sum of concentrations detected using e coli cn13 somatic coliphage and e coli famp f coliphage with the concentrations detected using e coli cb390 total coliphages for the environmental water samples tested mann whitney test p 0 221 bailey et al 2017 most of the serious threats to humans is believed to originate from human waste contamination rather than from animal waste field and samadpour 2007 unfortunately the source of contamination is difficult to track based on fecal indicator bacteria as these indicators could be released into environment by both humans and animals fecal sources souza et al 1999 as a result the human specific markers such as b theta hpyvs and m smithii have been suggested as potential markers for human waste contamination carson et al 2005 harwood et al 2014 johnston et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 2012 yampara iquise et al 2008 in this study a high prevalence of b theta was observed compared to hpyvs and m smithii an earlier study showed that b theta was more sensitive towards the detection of human waste contamination although hpyvs gave better specificity in terms of human source tracking unpublished data carson et al 2005 found a cross reactivity with dogs 16 of 31 samples in their b theta assay carson et al 2005 however griffith et al 2009 showed that the detection of b theta was among the most reliable methods to detect samples containing human fecal material with no false positive results griffith et al 2009 studies have shown that the genotypes of frna are associated with different sources of contamination hsu et al 1995 stewart pullaro et al 2006 i e the presence of frna g2 and g3 are typically associated with human waste contamination while frna g1 and g4 are typically associated with animal wastes in this study frna g2 was the most prevalent genotype among the four genotype groups this may explain the high probability of human waste contamination in the water samples tested however studies also revealed the possible detection of frna g2 in poultry pig and cattle feces schaper et al 2002b and the presence of frna g4 in human feces hsu et al 1995 in this study a higher prevalence of frna g2 detection frequency 52 3 was found compared to frna g3 detection frequency 5 this finding contradicts an earlier study which reported that frna g2 seems to be more prominent in cold regions while frna g3 dominated in warm regions furuse et al 1978 one of the possible reasons could be the higher persistence of frna g2 compared to frna g3 in natural environments schaper et al 2002a it is also interesting to note that a relatively high concentration of frna g1 was observed at sampling area g a protected catchment with rich biodiversity this is consistent with the fact that frna g1 is associated with fecal wastes from animals cole et al 2003 pmmov a virus that can infect pepper plants has been suggested as one of the potential indicators for human fecal contamination due to its high abundance in human feces and high prevalence in the human population zhang et al 2005 although pmmov showed high prevalence in local surface waters the application of this indicator in human waste source tracking needs to be evaluated carefully particularly in the context of wastewater reuse studies have shown the difficulty in removing pmmov during wastewater treatment due to its high abundance and persistence kitajima et al 2014 in summary the detection of these different human specific markers suggested a high probability of human waste contamination in the tributaries at sampling sites a b c and f although the tributaries where these markers were detected are not used for recreational water activities the tracking of human source contamination would be useful to identify the upstream source of pollution and hence provide better mitigation strategies to remedy downstream contamination problems 4 2 pathogens norovirus gii 51 8 astrovirus 64 5 and influenza a virus 65 4 were the three most prevalent enteric viruses detected in singapore s surface waters norovirus gii showed a similar range of detection rate 48 69 with earlier studies in singapore aw and gin 2011 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 a relatively high prevalence of norovirus gii was also reported in environmental surface waters at different locations calgua et al 2013 kishida et al 2012 kiulia et al 2014 lee and kim 2008 in this study a higher prevalence of norovirus gii 51 8 was found compared to norovirus gi 40 a virus decay study conducted in groundwater revealed that norovirus gii was more persistent than norovirus gi charles et al 2009 as currently there is no available cell line for the norovirus infectivity test the detection of norovirus relies on molecular methods teunis et al 2008 demonstrated the low infectious dose for norovirus where the 50 infectious dose ld50 was equivalent to 1015 genomes copies or 18 viruses teunis et al 2008 ngazoa et al 2008 reported approximately 30 of norovirus genomes were detected in river water after 30 days incubation at 25 c this explains the high prevalence of norovirus in surface waters found in this study another study on viral persistence revealed that the reduction rate of nucleic acid of norovirus surrogates was significantly lower than the reduction rate of infectivity bae and schwab 2008 nevertheless extra precautions are needed when interpreting health risks brought by norovirus due to its low infectious dose in the case of astrovirus the detection frequency 58 was comparable to the results reported by aw and gin s study 2011 50 although there is no clear explanation for the high prevalence of astrovirus in local surface waters compared to other places pusch et al 2005 steyer et al 2011 taylor et al 2001 one of the reasons could be due to the persistence of certain serogroups of astrovirus in tropical conditions another possible explanation is the close genetic relationship between human astrovirus and animal astrovirus as well the cross infectivity of human and animal astrovirus de benedictis et al 2011 delwart 2012 influenza a viruses are pathogens that can infect large numbers of warm blooded animals such as birds pigs horses and humans it is believed that aquatic birds serve as a natural reservoir for all known subtypes of influenza a virus and are probably the ultimate source of human pandemic influenza strains taubenberger and morens 2010 webster et al 1992 studies have shown that a high persistence of influenza a viruses in environmental waters which can remain infectious over a long period depending on the strain types and environmental factors e g salinity temperature ph dublineau et al 2011 keeler et al 2013 2014 stallknecht et al 1990 webster et al 1992 in this study a high detection rate of influenza a virus was found 64 5 which is higher than those previously reported in france 44 4 deboosere et al 2011 and netherlands 40 heijnen and medema 2011 heijnen and medema et al s study suggested the discharge of treated sewage was not the primary source of influenza a virus detected in river water but rather was mainly from aquatic birds due to the very low prevalence of influenza a virus in sewage samples 1 out of 10 samples in our study the highest mean concentration of influenza a virus was found at sampling area b mean 3063 85 gc l which was an area dominated by chicken farming although other studies showed the high prevalence of adenovirus in natural environments jiang 2006 rigotto et al 2010 the detection frequency of adenovirus observed in this study was only 12 7 with a geometric mean concentration of 29 gc l a low prevalence of adenovirus was also reported in choi and jiang s study 2005 where 16 out of 114 river samples from california had positive detections of adenovirus in the same study negative results were reported for infection of adenovirus using two human tissue culture cell lines hek293a and a5949 choi and jiang 2005 similarly this study also found negative results for infectious adenovirus using the integrated cell culture pcr icc pcr with human colon carcinoma caco 2 cell line in surface waters in contrast positive infectivity results were observed in samples collected from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant data not shown the absence of infectious adenovirus observed in surface waters could be due to the loss of viral infectivity after exposure to sunlight or other harsh conditions in the natural environment in addition to the low concentrations detected comparing the occurrence data obtained in this study with earlier studies conducted in singapore a clear trend of reduction in enteric viruses i e adenovirus rotavirus and enterovirus was found aw and gin 2011 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 this showed the effectiveness of the public sewers rehabilitation programme to restore the structural integrity of the sewerage system and hence minimize pollution to surface waters high prevalence of sapovirus has been reported in many environmental waters such as in japan 20 kitajima et al 2010 and south africa 14 92 murray et al 2013 however a low detection frequency was found in this study 4 1 as reported in kitajima et al s study 2010 sapovirus was mostly detected during winter time november to march this may explain the low prevalence of sapovirus in singapore which has warm tropical temperature throughout the year hepatitis e virus was detected sporadically at different locations with the highest geometric mean of 999 38 gc l at sampling area d an area surrounded by green areas forests as well as wild life parks the seasonal distribution patterns revealed a higher prevalence and concentration of hepatitis e virus during the northeast monsoon and southwest monsoon fig 4 consistent with heavy rain which could flush animals feces from green areas or parks into the tributaries and reservoirs although p aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is ubiquitously present in natural environments the ability of p aeruginosa to resist multiple antibiotics makes this opportunistic pathogen a clinically important pathogen lister et al 2009 in this study a high detection frequency of p aeruginosa was observed using the idexx kit i e pseudalert compared to the qpcr method this could be due to the lower detection limit that can be achieved with the idexx kit in addition the qpcr method only quantifies the toxin a synthesis regulating gene rega gene while the idexx kit quantifies p aeruginosa strains although the correlation between the readings from pseudalert and qpcr is not strong r 0 440 p 0 01 the wilcoxon sign rank test showed that the detection of p aeruginosa did not elicit a statistically significant difference with both methods p 0 536 in this study salmonella spp was not detected in reservoirs except for sampling area g with concentrations up to 523 gc 100 ml and detection frequency of 37 5 reptiles amphibians and birds are some animals that frequently carry salmonella spp silva et al 2014 sampling area g is a relatively protected forested area low urban development but the presence of these animals in the natural environment may have contributed to the higher counts and prevalence of salmonella spp in reservoirs here compared to other sites 4 3 correlations between indicators pathogens and environmental variables several epidemiological studies have been conducted to relate the presence of indicator bacteria with gastroenteritis illness however some studies have shown limited correlations between fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens wu et al 2011 alternative indicators such as human specific markers i e bacteroides m smithii and hpyvs coliphages i e somatic and f coliphages genotypes of frna phages and plant virus i e pmmov have recently been proposed to allow for better prediction of human pathogens hughes et al 2017 mcquaig et al 2009 2012 vergara et al 2015 yampara iquise et al 2008 as a result a number of recent studies have focused on correlations between the alternative indicators and pathogens harwood et al 2014 jofre et al 2016 nevertheless disparate results were reported to our knowledge none of the studies have related these indicators to a wide range of human viruses particularly enteric viruses in waters as shown in the earlier studies this study found significant correlations among fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages liang et al 2015 lodder et al 2010 rezaeinejad et al 2014 this is expected as coliphages are the phages for e coli hosts and all these indicators should have originated from the same sources however fecal indicator bacteria coliphages did not correlate well with most of the pathogens except for p aeruginosa similar to many other studies nevertheless there are some studies which demonstrated limited correlations between indicator bacteria coliphages and pathogens for instance significant weak correlation was found between f coliphage and norovirus gi r 0 233 and norovirus gii r 0 312 rezaeinejad et al 2014 even though lodder et al 2010 and liang et al 2015 failed to show the correlation between coliphages and norovirus the inclusion of alternative indicators in this study improved the correlations with pathogens especially for salmonella spp sapovirus and aichi virus liang et al s study 2015 showed an improvement in predictive stepwise linear regreasion models for salmonella spp and norovirus gii by incorporating the alternative indicators i e hpyvs and m smithii there are several factors that may contribute to the lack of correlation between indicators and pathogens these factors include the survival and transport of indicators pathogens in the natural environment shedding patterns among host populations detection method percentage of positive detection land uses as well as geographic variation wu et al 2011 the major drawback for fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages is that these bacteria phages cannot indicate the source of pollution as they are present in both human and animal wastes havelaar et al 1986 as such it is not surprising that very weak or even no correlation was found between indicators coliphages and enteric viruses which are mainly excreted from infected humans apart from the different shedding patterns for human pathogens fecal indicator bacteria are also able to persist for extended periods and may even grow in the natural environment byappanahalli et al 2006 in an earlier controlled laboratory study the survival of indicators and human specific indicators was examined together with adenovirus under the effects of sunlight and salinity liang et al 2017 the study showed that b theta had slightly lower decay rates compared to adenovirus in both fresh and sea water while m smithii had higher decay rates than adenovirus in both fresh and seawaters these differences may explain the slightly better correlations between b theta and adenovirus compared to other indicators in this study r 0 233 the weak correlations between fecal indicators coliphages and pathogens could also be due to the different detection methods these differences could have implications on the final results due to variations in sensitivity recovery rate and specificity thus similar detection methods will usually yield better correlations in this study p aeruginosa quantified with idexx kits correlated better with indicators examined with culture based method than p aeruginosa quantified by the molecular method the low shedding rate and low percentage of positive detection in pathogens also contributed to the lack of correlation with indicators among the pathogens p aeruginosa quantified by idexx kit is the only pathogen that achieved high detection frequency 91 8 and hence stronger correlations with indicators were observed apart from the factors discussed above land use also played a major role in the correlation analysis compared with the earlier studies conducted in singapore relatively weak correlations were found in this study particularly between the indicators and pathogens the reason being this study extended the sampling sites to other major reservoirs in singapore which covered various types of land use whereas the previous study focused on a single urbanized reservoir and its tributaries when separate correlation analysis was conducted based on specific sites the correlations improved significantly while this study showed a higher concentration of microbes during the wet season compared to dry season rochelle newall et al 2016 the study failed to draw a general seasonal variation pattern for microbes except for human specific markers similarly a study in vietnam also showed no significant seasonal difference in e coli nguyen et al 2016 as the sampling events were conducted on a monthly basis limited storm water samples were collected to represent a complete hydrology profile during the monsoon wet season nevertheless correlation analysis showed consistent relationships albeit weak between the concentration of indicator microbes and rainfall r 0 163 to 0 209 as well as antecedent dry period r 0 121 to 0 190 5 conclusions the present study reports the occurrence and distribution of microbial indicators pathogenic bacteria and enteric viruses in tropical surface waters collected from 7 sampling areas 19 sampling sites with varied land use over a period of two years the application of hollow fiber ultrafiltration coupled with molecular detection methods allowed rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide range of microorganisms including the presence of pathogenic viruses despite the strong correlations among the indicators and coliphages relative weak or no correlations were found between indicators and viral pathogens the present study also failed to identify a universal indicator that was associated with all the pathogens tested in addition the correlations between indicators and pathogens could be highly variable depending on environmental factors such as temperature land use rainfall geographical location etc as such future prediction of pathogens may require a suite of indicators rather than a single indicator machine learning models which enable learning from large data sets could be a better approach for future pathogen predictive models statistical analyses revealed that the occurrence of indicators was significantly different between sampling sites compared to pathogens cluster analysis and pco plots successfully identified potential sites which had degraded or poorer water quality this will aid in management strategies to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality as current detection of enteric viruses was based on molecular methods it was not possible to give strong evidence on the risks of these viruses which rely mainly on cell culture infectivity tests nevertheless preliminary studies on virus infectivity showed that a relatively low fraction of infectious adenovirus and astrovirus was present when measured with icc pcr compared to qpcr which is in agreement with other studies choi and jiang 2005 le cann et al 2004 as such the interpretation of health risks brought by these enteric viruses need to be evaluated carefully declaration of interest
