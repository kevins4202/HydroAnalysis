10450,subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most efficient types of water saving irrigation technology however in regions prone to drought during the planting period crop germination may be a problem under sdi a 2 year field experiment was conducted in chifeng inner mongolia china to assess the impacts of two planting methods pms flat planting fp and alternate row bed planting ap and four pre emergence irrigation pi levels 15 25 45 and 60 mm on corn germination grain yield and crop water productivity wpc under sdi the ap method utilized a small lister furrow that was 10 cm deep and the corn seeds were planted 5 cm beneath the lister furrow the results indicated that the soil water at the depth of 5 cm vertically below the seeds sm5 was on average 27 higher under ap than under fp 24 hours after pi the emergence rate under ap initially increased at the lower pi values and then decreased at the highest pi amount 60 mm the maximum emergence rate 98 on average for two years was obtained at 45 mm pi under ap the emergence rate under fp increased with the pi level but the average two year emergence rates were all lower than 80 the two year average grain yield and the wpc reached maximum values of 15 3 mg ha 1 and 35 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 45 mm and 25 mm pi under ap respectively the average emergence rate yield and wpc under ap increased by 21 24 and 21 respectively compared with those under fp no significant differences in kernels ear or kernel mass under ap or fp were caused by different pi levels an emergence rate of approximately 90 to 95 for corn was obtained when the sm5 was approximately 82 to 90 of field capacity 24 h after pi in conclusion ap with suitable pi can increase the corn emergence rate and improve the grain yield and wpc under sdi in areas prone to drought conditions at planting keywords planting method pre emergence irrigation alternate row bed planting corn emergence rate grain yield crop water productivity 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most efficient methods of irrigation sdi system can last 10 20 years without replacement or major degradation lamm and trooien 2003 and is more efficient in terms of input versus output than surface and center pivot irrigation diotto and irmak 2016 wu et al 2019 sdi can also improve the irrigation water use efficiency by reducing the primary nonbeneficial water balance components i e deep percolation evaporation and runoff lamm 2002 phene 2002 howell and evett 2005 however crop establishment problems can be a major impediment to the adoption of sdi lamm et al 2012 schiavon et al 2015 mo et al 2017a especially in regions that are prone to drought during crop establishment the multiple year operation of an sdi system requires a safe installation depth below the normal tillage depth camp 1998 camp and lamm 2003 which is typically more than 25 cm in china in addition the topsoil 0 10 cm where seeds are planted may become dry and loosely consolidated due to evaporation and tillage before planting which makes it difficult for the soil matric potential to support water transport to the seeds ultimately these issues may lead to emergence delays or crop failure lamm et al 2012 guan et al 2016 in xinjiang production and construction corps china the area of sdi for corn and cotton decreased from 8000 ha to 70 ha in the last 9 years li et al 2018 and one of the primary reasons for this decrease was difficulties with germination in some regions sprinkler or surface irrigation has been used to ensure crop establishment huang and li 2002 zai et al 2011 schiavon et al 2012 schiavon et al 2014 but the use of two irrigation systems increases capital and operational expenses and decreases economic returns hillel 2000 lamm et al 2012 shallow dripline depths less than 20 cm might result in more uniform seed germination bordovsky et al 2012 wang et al 2015 however this method is mostly used in no tillage systems sorensen and lamb 2015 or for perennial crops such as alfalfa wang et al 2018a or vegetables leskovar et al 2001 zotarelli et al 2008 coolong 2016 for lower value and annual crops such as corn and wheat the costs of annual dripline installation and retrieval may be prohibitive other strategies such as the use of soil amendments or pulsed water application were found to be unsatisfactory bordovsky et al 2012 fall or winter irrigation after harvest following tillage developed as a preplant irrigation practice in northern china for germination and salt management luo et al 2014 chen et al 2017 most preplant irrigation uses furrow or flood irrigation stone et al 1994 schlegel et al 2012 bushong et al 2014 and sprinkler irrigation musick and lamm 1990 kisekka et al 2017 methods but sdi use for preplant irrigation is uncommon lamm 2002 bordovsky 2020 some researchers propose placing driplines above an impermeable material to promote the upward movement of soil water the effectiveness of this practice has been variable and the corresponding costs are relatively high charlesworth and muirhead 2003 elnesr and alazba 2015 under the conditions of surface irrigation the relationship between the emergence rate of corn and the soil water content around the seeds is typically quadratic ma et al 2014 in different soils the lower limit of soil water content at the 0 20 cm soil layer for summer corn germination was 65 70 of the field capacity fc value xue et al 2014 in a pot based experiment hou et al 2006 found that the emergence rate of corn reached 90 at soil water contents of 78 and 73 fc for loam and sandy soil respectively there are few or no studies on the relationship between corn emergence rate and soil water content around seeds when using sdi in a previous study mo et al 2017a a new planting method alternate row bed planting ap was proposed for corn production with sdi we found that planting seeds at a position 5 cm below the bottom of a 10 cm deep trapezoidal lister furrow decreases the distance between the seeds and dripline and can allow the applied water to reach the seeds more easily lister planting is a technology that was developed over 100 years ago that can enhance germination and crop establishment in regions that are prone to dry soil conditions and limited precipitation during the planting period cunningham 1915 the emergence rate and crop yield were greater with ap than with conventional flat planting fp in a study by mo et al 2017a studies have shown that corn yield is significantly affected by planting density irmak and djaman 2016 and typically exhibits a quadratic response to planting density duncan 1984 ottman and welch 1989 for example in northwestern kansas when irrigation and fertilization are adequate increasing planting density from 55 600 to 85 300 plants ha 1 increased grain yield by 6 12 lamm and trooien 2001 lamm et al 2009 schlegel et al 2012 in a study performed by guevara escobar et al 2005 the yield reached 15 3 mg ha 1 which is a high level for sdi when the planting density increased to 133 000 plants ha 1 in our previous study mo et al 2017a the harvested plant density was 75 075 plants ha 1 there is the potential for further yield and crop water productivity improvements with better crop germination and establishment under suitable pre emergence irrigation pi management in this study a 2 year field experiment was conducted 1 to investigate the influence of the planting method pm and pi amount on the soil water content around the seeds and 2 to analyze the response mechanisms of the corn emergence rate seedling growth grain yield and crop water productivity to pm and pi furthermore this study aims to clarify the quantitative relationship between the emergence rate and the soil water content and provide a firmer scientific basis for crop establishment using pi under sdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 in chifeng inner mongolia china 42 56 53 n 119 4 20 e the area has a semiarid continental monsoon climate with a frost free period of approximately 135 days the last

arrange the two experimental factors the planting method pm and the pre emergence irrigation amount pi each treatment had three replications as shown in table 1 two pms were used namely alternate row bed planting ap and flat planting fp and four pi levels were applied 15 25 45 and 60 mm due to the sdi system and operational scheduling constraints pi was applied two days after planting in both years for ap a multifunctional air suction precision seeder with a modified furrow lister shank was used to create a 10 cm depth furrow in order to plant the seeds 5 cm beneath the furrow bottom for fp the same seeder without the modified furrow lister shank was used for planting the corn cropping pattern and the lateral layout of the driplines under ap and fp are shown in fig 1 and a photo of ap is shown in fig 2 the corn hybrid xianyu 335 was used in both years of the experiment and the planting dates were may 8 2015 and may 5 2016 which were the local recommended planting dates wang et al 2017 the corn seeds were planted in alternating wide narrow 80 40 cm rows with a target planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 pest weeds and insects control was accomplished using standard practices for the region liang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 the area of each plot was 400 m2 8 m 50 m each plot included six driplines and twelve crop rows and the spacing between each plot was 1 5 m the sdi system fig 3 was installed in april 2015 and included a hydrocyclone filter kingland technology co ltd beijing china with a 2 5 inch inlet outlet diameter and a capacity of 16 35 m3 h 1 and a 120 mesh screen filter considering the long term use of the sdi system the locally popular rotary tillage depths 20 25 cm and that the subsurface dripline should generally be buried as shallow as possible camp 1998 the dripline installation depth was set as 30 cm the spacing between two driplines was 120 cm figs 1 3 the driplines were installed parallel to the corn rows ridges and in the middle of the narrow row the driplines had a wall thickness of 0 38 mm emitter spacing of 30 cm and emitter discharge of 1 05 l h 1 and were manufactured by netafim netafim limited company tel aviv hashalom israel during the period from planting to the v3 third leaf stage in 2015 no effective precipitation occurred in 2016 the effective rainfall was 11 1 mm 5 8 mm on may 12 and 5 3 mm on may 23 for the same period to guarantee that corn germination was not affected by the effective rainfall 24 tarpaulins were used to cover each of the 24 plots the rainwater could flow down the tarpaulin to the soil area between two plots after each rain event the tarpaulins were removed after the pi events that occurred during the planting period the subsequent irrigation events for the remainder of the irrigation season were initiated when the measured volumetric water content was between 70 and 75 of field capacity the amount of water applied to the field at each event was calculated as 1 i 85 e t p where i is the irrigation amount mm et is the evapotranspiration mm which can be calculated by formula 2 and p is the effective precipitation mm a proportion of 85 is the locally recommended irrigation schedule for optimal yield and crop water productivity yuan 2015 2 e t k c i i n e t 0 where et 0 is the short grass reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated by the penman monteith formula using meteorological data measured at the site k c is the crop coefficient and n is the number of days between irrigation events based on the results from several research studies at the same site the corn growth at the v6 sixth leaves stage has a kc 1 0 at vt tasseling kc 1 2 at r2 filling kc 0 9 and at r4 dough kc 0 6 kang 2014 the sdi system was used for fertigation and the amounts of n p2o5 and k2o applied in all the treatments were the same at 290 kg ha 1 135 kg ha 1 and 135 kg ha 1 respectively the details of the irrigation and n application schedule for both years are shown in table 2 for p2o5 and k2o the application proportions of the basal and topdressing fertilizer in the different growth stages were the same as those in wang et al 2018b all of the topdressing fertilizers were water soluble and a self priming injection pump h 38 m q 3 m3 h was used to pump the fertilizer solution to the sdi system a pattern of 1 4 w 1 2 n 1 4 w was used to ensure uniform fertilization which consisted of clean water irrigation for 1 4 of the duration fertilizer application for 1 2 of the duration and clean water irrigation again to flush the system for the remaining 1 4 duration li et al 2003 2 3 observation indexes and methods 2 3 1 meteorological data and soil water an automatic weather station et107 manufactured by campbell scientific usa located 100 m from the experimental plots continuously monitored meteorological data such as wind velocity air temperature relative humidity and other data necessary to calculate et 0 during the corn growing season the daily average temperature relative humidity et 0 and precipitation at the experimental site are shown in fig 4 the precipitation during sowing to harvest in 2015 and 2016 was 180 mm and 250 mm respectively after planting the volumetric soil water content at a depth of 5 cm beneath the seeds was measured by augers then three sets of sentek envirosmart water sensors sentek pty ltd stepney south australia were installed between the wide row and the narrow row and in the crop row between two corn plants fig 1 and data were recorded once every hour each of the sensors had four probes that monitored the soil water at depths of 5 15 35 and 55 cm beneath the seed the average values from the three sensors were used to guide the irrigation intervals and to calculate the seasonal change in soil water storage for the 0 to 55 cm soil profile beneath the seed and were also used to calculate the seasonal corn evapotranspiration when analyzing the soil water variation below the corn seeds the values from the sensor in the crop row between two corn plants were used additionally gravimetric soil water samples at the same depths as the probes were obtained by augers five times during the corn growth period and these samples were used to calibrate the data gathered by the water sensors 2 3 2 seedling emergence rate and growth characteristics the emergence rate was determined as the final emergence number divided by the target planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 corn seedling emergence was determined by the number of plants exhibiting 2 cm of leaf outgrowth from the topsoil in a test plot area of 6 m 1 m the observation of the germination rate began 10 days after planting with an observation interval of every 2 days ending when the emergence number no longer changed when the corn reached the v6 growth stage plant height stem diameter and biomass of entire plant measurements were taken for five randomly selected plants from each plot biomass of these samples was determined by full enzyme deactivation for 0 5 h at 105 c and oven drying at 75 c until a constant weight was achieved sui et al 2018 2 3 3 corn yield and crop water productivity after the corn reached physiological maturity appearance of a black layer at the base of the kernels chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the entire corn plants from a 10 m row length from the middle four rows of each plot were harvested to determine grain yield and yield components ear number kernels per ear and kernel mass at a grain moisture content of 14 on a wet basis i e 14 water mass wet grain mass crop water use or evapotranspiration etc was calculated with the water balance equation as formula 3 3 etc i p sw dp roff where etc is the evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water applied mm p is the precipitation mm sw is the change in the soil water content mm dp is the deep percolation mm and roff is the amount of runoff mm since the amount of irrigation water was carefully controlled dp and roff were assumed to be negligible crop water productivity wpc was calculated as corn yield divided by the seasonal etc fernández et al 2020 2 3 4 data analysis the variance analysis method with the planting method and pre emergence irrigation amount as two fixed factors was used to assess the variations in emergence rate plant height stem diameter dry biomass at the v6 stage yield and its components and the etc and wpc of corn the significance of the differences between the means was identified using the least significance difference test at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed by spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 soil volumetric water content in both years after planting the volumetric soil water content at the 5 cm depth sw5 beneath the seeds in ap was 12 and 11 greater than that beneath the seeds in fp respectively table 3 the change in sw5 with different pre emergence irrigation amounts pis at two times 0 h after irrigation and 24 h after soil water distribution is shown in fig 5 compared with the sw5 after planting table 3 the sw5 was on average 15 less before the pi event the sw5 after irrigation under ap increased with the increase in pi fig 5a and fig 5c particularly so for the first incremental increases in pi the sw5 after pi for ap 25 increased by 81 compared with the initial sw5 and it was 43 greater than that for ap 15 when averaged over the two years compared with that under ap 25 the ap 45 and ap 60 increased the sw5 by only 14 and 17 respectively under fp sw5 responded positively to an increase in pi values greater than 25 mm fig 5a and fig 5c compared with that under fp the ap sw5 increased by 49 at 15 mm pi by 89 at 25 mm pi by 36 at 45 mm pi and by 25 at 60 mm pi for the two year averages after 24 h of soil water redistribution the sw5 of ap and fp was still greater at higher pi levels but the difference was not as notable as the increase that occurred immediately after irrigation suggesting a more uniform soil water condition after 24 h fig 5b and fig 5d 3 2 corn germination and seedling growth as shown in table 4 the pm and pi both had significant effects p 0 05 on the corn emergence rate plant height stem diameter and dry biomass at the v6 stage there was a significant interaction effect p 0 01 between pm and pi on corn dry biomass under ap the trend of emergence rate initially increased and then slightly decreased with the increase in pi when pi was greater than 25 mm the emergence rate of ap exceeded 90 and the maximum value was obtained in ap 45 reaching 96 6 in 2015 and 100 0 in 2016 in comparison with that under ap 15 the ap 25 ap 45 and ap 60 treatments caused an average emergence rate increase of 16 to 24 in 2015 and 2016 respectively and the difference was statistically significant no significant difference was observed in the emergence rate between ap 45 and ap 60 under fp the emergence rate increased with the increase in pi and the maximum value was obtained in fp 60 reaching 80 in 2015 and 76 in 2016 the average emergence rate of fp in the two years among all pi treatments was lower than 80 and was significantly and greatly reduced under fp 15 in 2016 under ap the change trends of plant height and dry biomass with increasing of pi were both similar to the trend in emergence rate all of the indexes mentioned above obtained the highest values at 45 mm pi the plant height and dry biomass were significantly lower for ap 15 than for ap 45 and ap 60 and they were similar between ap 45 and ap 60 the stem diameter also increased with the increase in pi and the highest stem diameter was obtained in ap 60 the difference in stem diameter among ap 15 ap 25 and ap 45 was significantly different only in 2016 under fp with the exception of plant height all crop physiological indexes increased with pi and the plant height and dry biomass in both years were both significantly lower under fp 15 than under the other treatments compared with those under fp ap had average increases of 21 in the emergence rate 221 in dry biomass 36 in plant height and 37 in stem diameter for the two years among the four pi treatments since the sampling time in 2016 was 8 days later than that in 2015 the dry biomass plant height and stem diameter in 2016 were all higher than those in 2015 3 3 corn yield and its components the responses of grain yield and ear density ear number per unit area to pi were similar to the response of emergence rate to pi table 5 the yield and ear density under ap first increased and then decreased at the highest pi level 60 mm however under fp the two year average yield and ear density increased over the entire range of pi the effects of pm and pi on yield were significant p 0 05 but their interaction effect was statistically insignificant p 0 05 the yield under ap was highest when pi was 45 mm this yield was 19 greater than the ap 15 yield in both years and the difference was significant p 0 05 however there were no significant differences in yield among ap 25 ap 45 and ap 60 for the fp treatments when pi was 25 45 and 60 mm there were no significant differences in the yield but the grain yields of these treatments were significantly higher than the yield at 15 mm pi in 2015 the effect of the pm on kernels per ear was statistically significant in 2016 but not in 2015 there were no statistical interaction effects between pm and pi for kernels per ear or kernel mass for kernels per ear ap had a 6 higher average than fp while fp had a 2 higher average kernel mass than ap the different responses of these two indexes in ap and fp are not unusual because when there are fewer kernels per ear the kernel mass often increases to help compensate there were no significant differences in kernels per ear or kernel mass under ap at different levels of pi similar to the yield the kernels per ear and kernel mass under fp 60 in 2016 both reached the maximum values in this study but the effect of pi on these indexes was not significant 3 4 water use and crop water productivity in 2015 corn etc ranged from 403 to 454 mm and from 393 to 445 mm for ap and fp respectively table 5 the seasonal average etc for all treatments was 419 mm in 2016 etc values were higher ranging from 412 to 489 mm and from 406 to 483 mm for ap and fp with a seasonal average etc of 440 mm for all treatments there was a nonsignificant trend of etc increasing with the increase in pi for the two planting methods the effect of pi on etc in both years was significant p 0 01 for 2015 and 2016 the average etc at all pi levels under ap increased by 2 3 and 1 4 respectively compared with those under fp but this difference was not significant the effect of pm and pi on the two year average crop water productivity wpc was significant p 0 01 with a trend toward maximum values of 35 1 and 29 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 25 mm pi for ap and fp respectively but their interaction effect was statistically insignificant p 0 05 the wpc was significantly lower for ap 15 and ap 60 than for ap 25 and ap 45 there were no significant differences in wpc under fp at different pi levels compared with that of fp the two year average wpc under ap increased by 26 at 15 mm pi by 21 at 25 mm pi by 25 at 45 mm pi and by 12 at 60 mm pi 3 5 relationship between emergence rate and percent of field capacity fc the corn emergence rates were linearly related to the soil water content expressed here as the percentage of field capacity fc at 5 cm below the seeds at 24 h after pi in both years fig 5 using a linear function the emergence rate reached 90 to 95 when the fc was approximately 82 to 90 4 discussion 4 1 ap application to increase soil water around seeds the soil bulk density and water content of the 0 10 cm soil layer were lower than those of the deeper soil the trapezoidal seed bed lister furrow with a 10 cm depth created by alternate row bed planting ap allowed seeding into the firmer moist soil avoiding the looser and drier topsoil the flat planting fp method had to contend with the topsoil inhibiting water movement to seeds and seed germination in essence ap was able to avoid to a great extent the weak soil capillary strength situation near the soil surface and the seeds and allowed the applied water to reach the seeds more easily ap is a type of lister planting that has a long history cunningham 1915 and can be utilized in drought prone areas when precipitation during crop establishment is limited but ap is certainly a new use of the lister planting technique for overcoming the germination problems of sdi the ap method has similar effects but a different application technique than the method of lamm et al 2012 who recommended moving the topsoil into a traffic furrow and planting into wetter and firmer soil the purpose of planting the seeds at a deeper depth 5 cm to 11 cm as proposed by guan et al 2016 was also to avoid poor soil water conditions however at deeper planting depths the soil temperature is lower less oxygen is available and more energy consumption is required for seed germination and these factors can affect seedling emergence cao et al 2015 ap appears to be a promising planting method in this region of inner mongolia where limited precipitation and dry soils during the planting period can reduce germination however it should be noted that planting in lister furrows can be problematic when appreciable precipitation occurs in the crop germination period due to waterlogging or soil crusting and seed burial from eroded furrow sidewalls cunningham 1915 when the initial soil conditions are fixed the distance from the water resource to the seed i e the dripline depth and the irrigation amount become the main factors affecting the soil water in the vicinity of seeds charlesworth and muirhead 2003 liu and li 2009 el abedin et al 2015 bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 the ap method shortened the vertical distance from the dripline to seeds from 25 cm to 15 cm compared to that under fp mo et al 2017a 2017b the sw5 in ap was higher than that in fp under the four pi treatments regardless of the elapsed time 0 or 24 h since irrigation fig 4 immediately after irrigation 0 h a pi of only 15 mm was able to affect sw5 under ap while a pi of more than 25 mm was required to appreciably affect sw5 under fp the test site in inner mongolia typically experiences windy conditions in early may which results in relatively dry at the soil surfaces the potential gradient between dry and wet soil caused by irrigation can produce upward flow jones et al 2003 chen et al 2019 and it was observed that the water applied to the topsoil of fp 15 and fp 25 resulted in increases in their sw5 24 h after pi similar results were found in the experiments of provenzano 2007 and monjezi et al 2013 which indicated that the wetting front would move up some distance after several hours of soil water redistribution however under ap 25 ap 45 ap 60 fp 45 and fp 60 due to the larger amounts of applied water in the topsoil at the end of pi the higher evaporation and greater soil water redistribution also caused the sw5 to decrease after 24 h the sw5 of ap 15 was lower than those of the other ap treatments and the sw5 of fp treatments were lower than those of the ap treatments fig 6 4 2 the role of pm and pi in corn germination seed germination is of primary importance for optimizing the field production of any crop plant meena et al 2015 and soil water availability is a primary factor affecting germination araujo et al 2011 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 soil water stress not only reduces seed vitality and slows the rate of cell membrane repair leading to increased leakage of substances such as glucose amino acids k and ca2 from seeds but also inhibits the synthesis of proteins needed for germination and decreases the activity of amylase singh et al 1981 in a study by pablo et al 2007 when the dripline depth increased from 15 cm to 30 cm at the same pi the corn emergence rate decreased from 99 to 36 due to soil water stress since ap decreases the distance between the seeds and the dripline and improves the soil water environment around the seeds ap with pi greatly improved the emergence rate compared with that under fp however the emergence rate under ap decreased when the pi increased to 60 mm probably because excessive irrigation may lead to poor aeration and low soil temperatures huang and li 2002 karandish and shahnazari 2016 there was also evidence that ap provided a better environment for seedlings and early plant growth than fp table 4 4 3 yield response when crop establishment is nonlimited i e the emergence rate is uniform the distance between seeds and subsurface driplines has little or no appreciable effect on crop yield quality etc or wpc machado et al 2003 lamm and trooien 2005 lamm et al 2010 li et al 2016 when germination is hindered by dry soil conditions decreasing the distance between the seeds and the subsurface dripline have positive effects on corn grain yield and wpc this was confirmed in the present study as the average yield and wpc under ap were 24 and 21 greater respectively than those under fp and there was a 12 yield increase and a 16 wpc increase when the dripline depth decreased from 35 cm to 30 cm mo et al 2017a similarly pablo et al 2007 found an 86 yield increase and 87 wpc increase when the dripline depth decreased from 30 cm to 15 cm the results of this study indicated that a higher emergence rate resulted in a higher corn grain yield among the three yield components pi only had a significant effect on ear density which means that the ear density was the main reason for the significant differences in yield among the different pi treatments this is consistent with the research results of lamm et al 2009 lamm and trooien 2001 pablo et al 2007 and schlegel et al 2012 on average the number of kernels per ear decreased with increasing ear density and the kernel mass decreased with an increase in the number of kernels per ear however the decrease in kernels per ear and kernel mass was generally compensated for by higher ear density table 5 similar conclusions were obtained in the study of lamm and trooien 2001 4 4 etc and wpc response when the emergence rate is uniform corn grain yield usually shows a quadratic relationship irmak et al 2016 or a curvilinear relationship payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2013 with seasonal etc due to the differences in the emergence rate the relationship trend of yield and etc in this study was not obvious improving crop water productivity in agriculture is expected to play a very important role in ensuring food and water security in china kang et al 2017 the primary strategy for increasing wpc is to increase yield through agronomic practices and by implementing advanced irrigation technologies howell et al 1990 kang et al 2017 in this study the yield of ap was higher than that of fp resulting in the wpc of ap being significantly higher than that of fp the greatest wpc was observed during the drier year 2015 and the lowest values were obtained in the wetter year of 2016 for all treatments which was similar to the results obtained by irmak et al 2016 under sdi irmak et al 2016 reported that corn wpc ranged from 8 to 31 kg ha 1 mm 1 at the west central research and extension center nebraska at the same location payero et al 2009 reported corn wpc values that ranged from 13 to 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 during a two year experiment howell et al 2013 reported corn wpc values that ranged from 11 to 15 kg ha 1 mm 1 during a two year experiment in bushland texas in their study corn water use ranged from 335 to 956 mm and the grain yield ranged from 2 6 to 14 7 mg ha 1 therefore the lower wpc values could be due to the very high water use in their study compared to that in the present study which was conducted under different soil and climatic conditions 4 5 relationship of fc to emergence rate most previous studies on the relationship between corn germination and seed zone soil water were carried out under rain shelters or in pot based experiments using rain shelters ma et al 2014 proposed that a soil water level of 80 to 84 of field capacity was needed for the spring corn emergence rate to reach 90 to 95 in jilin province china hou et al 2006 found in a pot based experiment that soil water levels of 73 to 78 of field capacity were required for the corn emergence rate to reach 90 the suitable soil water conditions in the aforementioned studies were all lower than the results obtained in this paper which may be due to the substantial differences in soil and environmental conditions among the studies in the sandy loam soil in this study the corn emergence rate reached 90 to 95 under sdi when the soil water level at 5 cm beneath the seeds was approximately 84 to 90 of field capacity 5 conclusions we investigated the effects of the planting method pm and pre emergence irrigation pi on corn germination seedling growth and grain yield under sdi the results indicated that alternate row bed planting ap can provide a firmer and moister seed zone by removing the loosely consolidated dry topsoil an additionally important aspect of ap is that it shortens the distance between the seeds and dripline allowing the potential use of pre emergence irrigation through the sdi system because of these advantages ap significantly increases the amount of soil water around the seeds for germination sufficient soil water resulted in a higher corn emergence rate and thus the higher grain yield and crop water productivity wpc the effects of pm and pi on the emergence rate and yield were all statistically significant when pi was 45 mm under ap the emergence rate and yield under ap reached their maximum values namely 98 and 15 3 mg ha 1 respectively the two year average wpc reached a maximum of 35 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 25 mm pi under ap across the different pi levels the emergence rate corn grain yield and wpc under ap were on average 21 24 and 21 greater than those under flat planting fp respectively the germination rate and the soil water level in the vicinity of the seed were also positively and linearly related it is concluded that the ap method with a suitable amount of pi could improve corn germination and grain yield for sdi corn production in regions that are prone to drought during the corn planting and crop germination period declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that

10450,subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most efficient types of water saving irrigation technology however in regions prone to drought during the planting period crop germination may be a problem under sdi a 2 year field experiment was conducted in chifeng inner mongolia china to assess the impacts of two planting methods pms flat planting fp and alternate row bed planting ap and four pre emergence irrigation pi levels 15 25 45 and 60 mm on corn germination grain yield and crop water productivity wpc under sdi the ap method utilized a small lister furrow that was 10 cm deep and the corn seeds were planted 5 cm beneath the lister furrow the results indicated that the soil water at the depth of 5 cm vertically below the seeds sm5 was on average 27 higher under ap than under fp 24 hours after pi the emergence rate under ap initially increased at the lower pi values and then decreased at the highest pi amount 60 mm the maximum emergence rate 98 on average for two years was obtained at 45 mm pi under ap the emergence rate under fp increased with the pi level but the average two year emergence rates were all lower than 80 the two year average grain yield and the wpc reached maximum values of 15 3 mg ha 1 and 35 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 45 mm and 25 mm pi under ap respectively the average emergence rate yield and wpc under ap increased by 21 24 and 21 respectively compared with those under fp no significant differences in kernels ear or kernel mass under ap or fp were caused by different pi levels an emergence rate of approximately 90 to 95 for corn was obtained when the sm5 was approximately 82 to 90 of field capacity 24 h after pi in conclusion ap with suitable pi can increase the corn emergence rate and improve the grain yield and wpc under sdi in areas prone to drought conditions at planting keywords planting method pre emergence irrigation alternate row bed planting corn emergence rate grain yield crop water productivity 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most efficient methods of irrigation sdi system can last 10 20 years without replacement or major degradation lamm and trooien 2003 and is more efficient in terms of input versus output than surface and center pivot irrigation diotto and irmak 2016 wu et al 2019 sdi can also improve the irrigation water use efficiency by reducing the primary nonbeneficial water balance components i e deep percolation evaporation and runoff lamm 2002 phene 2002 howell and evett 2005 however crop establishment problems can be a major impediment to the adoption of sdi lamm et al 2012 schiavon et al 2015 mo et al 2017a especially in regions that are prone to drought during crop establishment the multiple year operation of an sdi system requires a safe installation depth below the normal tillage depth camp 1998 camp and lamm 2003 which is typically more than 25 cm in china in addition the topsoil 0 10 cm where seeds are planted may become dry and loosely consolidated due to evaporation and tillage before planting which makes it difficult for the soil matric potential to support water transport to the seeds ultimately these issues may lead to emergence delays or crop failure lamm et al 2012 guan et al 2016 in xinjiang production and construction corps china the area of sdi for corn and cotton decreased from 8000 ha to 70 ha in the last 9 years li et al 2018 and one of the primary reasons for this decrease was difficulties with germination in some regions sprinkler or surface irrigation has been used to ensure crop establishment huang and li 2002 zai et al 2011 schiavon et al 2012 schiavon et al 2014 but the use of two irrigation systems increases capital and operational expenses and decreases economic returns hillel 2000 lamm et al 2012 shallow dripline depths less than 20 cm might result in more uniform seed germination bordovsky et al 2012 wang et al 2015 however this method is mostly used in no tillage systems sorensen and lamb 2015 or for perennial crops such as alfalfa wang et al 2018a or vegetables leskovar et al 2001 zotarelli et al 2008 coolong 2016 for lower value and annual crops such as corn and wheat the costs of annual dripline installation and retrieval may be prohibitive other strategies such as the use of soil amendments or pulsed water application were found to be unsatisfactory bordovsky et al 2012 fall or winter irrigation after harvest following tillage developed as a preplant irrigation practice in northern china for germination and salt management luo et al 2014 chen et al 2017 most preplant irrigation uses furrow or flood irrigation stone et al 1994 schlegel et al 2012 bushong et al 2014 and sprinkler irrigation musick and lamm 1990 kisekka et al 2017 methods but sdi use for preplant irrigation is uncommon lamm 2002 bordovsky 2020 some researchers propose placing driplines above an impermeable material to promote the upward movement of soil water the effectiveness of this practice has been variable and the corresponding costs are relatively high charlesworth and muirhead 2003 elnesr and alazba 2015 under the conditions of surface irrigation the relationship between the emergence rate of corn and the soil water content around the seeds is typically quadratic ma et al 2014 in different soils the lower limit of soil water content at the 0 20 cm soil layer for summer corn germination was 65 70 of the field capacity fc value xue et al 2014 in a pot based experiment hou et al 2006 found that the emergence rate of corn reached 90 at soil water contents of 78 and 73 fc for loam and sandy soil respectively there are few or no studies on the relationship between corn emergence rate and soil water content around seeds when using sdi in a previous study mo et al 2017a a new planting method alternate row bed planting ap was proposed for corn production with sdi we found that planting seeds at a position 5 cm below the bottom of a 10 cm deep trapezoidal lister furrow decreases the distance between the seeds and dripline and can allow the applied water to reach the seeds more easily lister planting is a technology that was developed over 100 years ago that can enhance germination and crop establishment in regions that are prone to dry soil conditions and limited precipitation during the planting period cunningham 1915 the emergence rate and crop yield were greater with ap than with conventional flat planting fp in a study by mo et al 2017a studies have shown that corn yield is significantly affected by planting density irmak and djaman 2016 and typically exhibits a quadratic response to planting density duncan 1984 ottman and welch 1989 for example in northwestern kansas when irrigation and fertilization are adequate increasing planting density from 55 600 to 85 300 plants ha 1 increased grain yield by 6 12 lamm and trooien 2001 lamm et al 2009 schlegel et al 2012 in a study performed by guevara escobar et al 2005 the yield reached 15 3 mg ha 1 which is a high level for sdi when the planting density increased to 133 000 plants ha 1 in our previous study mo et al 2017a the harvested plant density was 75 075 plants ha 1 there is the potential for further yield and crop water productivity improvements with better crop germination and establishment under suitable pre emergence irrigation pi management in this study a 2 year field experiment was conducted 1 to investigate the influence of the planting method pm and pi amount on the soil water content around the seeds and 2 to analyze the response mechanisms of the corn emergence rate seedling growth grain yield and crop water productivity to pm and pi furthermore this study aims to clarify the quantitative relationship between the emergence rate and the soil water content and provide a firmer scientific basis for crop establishment using pi under sdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were

arrange the two experimental factors the planting method pm and the pre emergence irrigation amount pi each treatment had three replications as shown in table 1 two pms were used namely alternate row bed planting ap and flat planting fp and four pi levels were applied 15 25 45 and 60 mm due to the sdi system and operational scheduling constraints pi was applied two days after planting in both years for ap a multifunctional air suction precision seeder with a modified furrow lister shank was used to create a 10 cm depth furrow in order to plant the seeds 5 cm beneath the furrow bottom for fp the same seeder without the modified furrow lister shank was used for planting the corn cropping pattern and the lateral layout of the driplines under ap and fp are shown in fig 1 and a photo of ap is shown in fig 2 the corn hybrid xianyu 335 was used in both years of the experiment and the planting dates were may 8 2015 and may 5 2016 which were the local recommended planting dates wang et al 2017 the corn seeds were planted in alternating wide narrow 80 40 cm rows with a target planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 pest weeds and insects control was accomplished using standard practices for the region liang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 the area of each plot was 400 m2 8 m 50 m each plot included six driplines and twelve crop rows and the spacing between each plot was 1 5 m the sdi system fig 3 was installed in april 2015 and included a hydrocyclone filter kingland technology co ltd beijing china with a 2 5 inch inlet outlet diameter and a capacity of 16 35 m3 h 1 and a 120 mesh screen filter considering the long term use of the sdi system the locally popular rotary tillage depths 20 25 cm and that the subsurface dripline should generally be buried as shallow as possible camp 1998 the dripline installation depth was set as 30 cm the spacing between two driplines was 120 cm figs 1 3 the driplines were installed parallel to the corn rows ridges and in the middle of the narrow row the driplines had a wall thickness of 0 38 mm emitter spacing of 30 cm and emitter discharge of 1 05 l h 1 and were manufactured by netafim netafim limited company tel aviv hashalom israel during the period from planting to the v3 third leaf stage in 2015 no effective precipitation occurred in 2016 the effective rainfall was 11 1 mm 5 8 mm on may 12 and 5 3 mm on may 23 for the same period to guarantee that corn germination was not affected by the effective rainfall 24 tarpaulins were used to cover each of the 24 plots the rainwater could flow down the tarpaulin to the soil area between two plots after each rain event the tarpaulins were removed after the pi events that occurred during the planting period the subsequent irrigation events for the remainder of the irrigation season were initiated when the measured volumetric water content was between 70 and 75 of field capacity the amount of water applied to the field at each event was calculated as 1 i 85 e t p where i is the irrigation amount mm et is the evapotranspiration mm which can be calculated by formula 2 and p is the effective precipitation mm a proportion of 85 is the locally recommended irrigation

growth at the v6 sixth leaves stage has a kc 1 0 at vt tasseling kc 1 2 at r2 filling kc 0 9 and at r4 dough kc 0 6 kang 2014 the sdi system was used for fertigation and the amounts of n p2o5 and k2o applied in all the treatments were the same at 290 kg ha 1 135 kg ha 1 and 135 kg ha 1 respectively the details of the irrigation and n application schedule for both years are shown in table 2 for p2o5 and k2o the application proportions of the basal and topdressing fertilizer in the different growth stages were the same as those in wang et al 2018b all of the topdressing fertilizers were water soluble and a self priming injection pump h 38 m q 3 m3 h was used to pump the fertilizer solution to the sdi system a pattern of 1 4 w 1 2 n 1 4 w was used to ensure uniform fertilization which consisted of clean water irrigation for 1 4 of the duration fertilizer application for 1 2 of the duration and clean water irrigation again to flush the system for the remaining 1 4 duration li et al 2003 2 3 observation indexes and methods 2 3 1 meteorological data and soil water an automatic weather station et107 manufactured by campbell scientific usa located 100 m from the experimental plots continuously monitored meteorological data such as wind velocity air temperature relative humidity and other data necessary to calculate et 0 during the corn growing season the daily average temperature relative humidity et 0 and precipitation at the experimental site are shown in fig 4 the precipitation during sowing to harvest in 2015 and 2016 was 180 mm and 250 mm respectively after planting the volumetric soil water content at a depth of 5 cm beneath the seeds was measured by augers then three sets of sentek envirosmart water sensors sentek pty ltd stepney south australia were installed between the wide row and the narrow row and in the crop row between two corn plants fig 1 and data were recorded once every hour each of the sensors had four probes that monitored the soil water at depths of 5 15 35 and 55 cm beneath the seed the average values from the three sensors were used to guide the irrigation intervals and to calculate the seasonal change in soil water storage for the 0 to 55 cm soil profile beneath the seed and were also used to calculate the seasonal corn evapotranspiration when analyzing the soil water variation below the corn seeds the values from the sensor in the crop row between two corn plants were used additionally gravimetric soil water samples at the same depths as the probes were obtained by augers five times during the corn growth period and these samples were used to calibrate the data gathered by the water sensors 2 3 2 seedling emergence rate and growth characteristics the emergence rate was determined as the final emergence number divided by the target planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 corn seedling emergence was determined by the number of plants exhibiting 2 cm of leaf outgrowth from the topsoil in a test plot area of 6 m 1 m the observation of the germination rate began 10 days after planting with an observation interval of every 2 days ending when the emergence number no longer changed when the corn reached the v6 growth stage plant height stem diameter and biomass of entire plant measurements were taken for five randomly selected plants from each plot biomass of these samples was determined by full enzyme deactivation for 0 5 h at 105 c and oven drying at 75 c until a constant weight was achieved sui et al 2018 2 3 3 corn yield and crop water productivity after the corn reached physiological maturity appearance of a black layer at the base of the kernels chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the entire corn plants from a 10 m row length from the middle four rows of each plot were harvested to determine grain yield and yield components ear number kernels per ear and kernel mass at a grain moisture content of 14 on a wet basis i e 14 water mass wet grain mass crop water use or evapotranspiration etc was calculated with the water balance equation as formula 3 3 etc i p sw dp roff where etc is the evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water applied mm p is the precipitation mm sw is the change in the soil water content mm dp is the deep percolation mm and roff is the amount of runoff mm since the amount of irrigation water was carefully controlled dp and roff were assumed to be negligible crop water productivity wpc was calculated as corn yield divided by the seasonal etc fernández et al 2020 2 3 4 data analysis the variance analysis method with the planting method and pre emergence irrigation amount as two fixed factors was used to assess the variations in emergence rate plant height stem diameter dry biomass at the v6 stage yield and its components and the etc and wpc of corn the significance of the differences between the means was identified using the least significance difference test at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed by spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 soil volumetric water content in both years after planting the volumetric soil water content at the 5 cm depth sw5 beneath the seeds in ap was 12 and 11 greater than that beneath the seeds in fp respectively table 3 the change in sw5 with different pre emergence irrigation amounts pis at two times 0 h after irrigation and 24 h after soil water distribution is shown in fig 5 compared with the sw5 after planting table 3 the sw5 was on average 15 less before the pi event the sw5 after irrigation under ap increased with the increase in pi fig 5a and fig 5c particularly so for the first incremental increases in pi the sw5 after pi for ap 25 increased by 81 compared with the initial sw5 and it was 43 greater than that for ap 15 when averaged over the two years compared with that under ap 25 the ap 45 and ap 60 increased the sw5 by only 14 and 17 respectively under fp sw5 responded positively to an increase in pi values greater than 25 mm fig 5a and fig 5c compared with that under fp the ap sw5 increased by 49 at 15 mm pi by 89 at 25 mm pi by 36 at 45 mm pi and by 25 at 60 mm pi for the two year averages after 24 h of soil water redistribution the sw5 of ap and fp was still greater at higher pi levels but the difference was not as notable as the increase that occurred immediately after irrigation suggesting a more uniform soil water condition after 24 h fig 5b and fig 5d 3 2 corn germination and seedling growth as shown in table 4 the pm and pi both had significant effects p 0 05 on the corn emergence rate plant height stem diameter and dry biomass at the v6 stage there was a significant interaction effect p 0 01 between pm and pi on corn dry biomass under ap the trend of emergence rate initially increased and then slightly decreased with the increase in pi when pi was greater than 25 mm the emergence rate of ap exceeded 90 and the maximum value was obtained in ap 45 reaching 96 6 in 2015 and 100 0 in 2016 in comparison with that under ap 15 the ap 25 ap 45 and ap 60 treatments caused an average emergence rate increase of 16 to 24 in 2015 and 2016 respectively and the difference was statistically significant no significant difference was observed in the emergence rate between ap 45 and ap 60 under fp the emergence rate increased with the increase in pi and the maximum value was obtained in fp 60 reaching 80 in 2015 and 76 in 2016 the average emergence rate of fp in the two years among all pi treatments was lower than 80 and was significantly and greatly reduced under fp 15 in 2016 under ap the change trends of plant height and dry biomass with increasing of pi were both similar to the trend in emergence rate all of the indexes mentioned above obtained the highest values at 45 mm pi the plant height and dry biomass were significantly lower for ap 15 than for ap 45 and ap 60 and they were similar between ap 45 and ap 60 the stem diameter also increased with the increase in pi and the highest stem diameter was obtained in ap 60 the difference in stem diameter among ap 15 ap 25 and ap 45 was significantly different only in 2016 under fp with the exception of plant height all crop physiological indexes increased with pi and the plant height and dry biomass in both years were both significantly lower under fp 15 than under the other treatments compared with those under fp ap had average increases of 21 in the emergence rate 221 in dry biomass 36 in plant height and 37 in stem diameter for the two years among the four pi treatments since the sampling time in 2016 was 8 days later than that in 2015 the dry biomass plant height and stem diameter in 2016 were all higher than those in 2015 3 3 corn yield and its components the responses of grain yield and ear density ear number per unit area to pi were similar to the response of emergence rate to pi table 5 the yield and ear density under ap first increased and then decreased at the highest pi level 60 mm however under fp the two year average yield and ear density increased over the entire range of pi the effects of pm and pi on yield were significant p 0 05 but their interaction effect was statistically insignificant p 0 05 the yield under ap was highest when pi was 45 mm this yield was 19 greater than the ap 15 yield in both years and the difference was significant p 0 05 however there were no significant differences in yield among ap 25 ap 45 and ap 60 for the fp treatments when pi was 25 45 and 60 mm there were no significant differences in the yield but the grain yields of these treatments were significantly higher than the yield at 15 mm pi in 2015 the effect of the pm on kernels per ear was statistically significant in 2016 but not in 2015 there were no statistical interaction effects between pm and pi for kernels per ear or kernel mass for kernels per ear ap had a 6 higher average than fp while fp had a 2 higher average kernel mass than ap the different responses of these two indexes in ap and fp are not unusual because when there are fewer kernels per ear the kernel mass often increases to help compensate there were no significant differences in kernels per ear or kernel mass under ap at different levels of pi similar to the yield the kernels per ear and kernel mass under fp 60 in 2016 both reached the maximum values in this study but the effect of pi on these indexes was not significant 3 4 water use and crop water productivity in 2015 corn etc ranged from 403 to 454 mm and from 393 to 445 mm for ap and fp respectively table 5 the seasonal average etc for all treatments was 419 mm in 2016 etc values were higher ranging from 412 to 489 mm and from 406 to 483 mm for ap and fp with a seasonal average etc of 440 mm for all treatments there was a nonsignificant trend of etc increasing with the increase in pi for the two planting methods the effect of pi on etc in both years was significant p 0 01 for 2015 and 2016 the average etc at all pi levels under ap increased by 2 3 and 1 4 respectively compared with those under fp but this difference was not significant the effect of pm and pi on the two year average crop water productivity wpc was significant p 0 01 with a trend toward maximum values of 35 1 and 29 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 25 mm pi for ap and fp respectively but their interaction effect was statistically insignificant p 0 05 the wpc was significantly lower for ap 15 and ap 60 than for ap 25 and ap 45 there were no significant differences in wpc under fp at different pi levels compared with that of fp the two year average wpc under ap increased by 26 at 15 mm pi by 21 at 25 mm pi by 25 at 45 mm pi and by 12 at 60 mm pi 3 5 relationship between emergence rate and percent of field capacity fc the corn emergence rates were linearly related to the soil water content expressed here as the percentage of field capacity fc at 5 cm below the seeds at 24 h after pi in both years fig 5 using a linear function the emergence rate reached 90 to 95 when the fc was approximately 82 to 90 4 discussion 4 1 ap application to increase soil water around seeds the soil bulk density and water content of the 0 10 cm soil layer were lower than those of the deeper soil the trapezoidal seed bed lister furrow with a 10 cm depth created by alternate row bed planting ap allowed seeding into the firmer moist soil avoiding the looser and drier topsoil the flat planting fp method had to contend with the topsoil inhibiting water movement to seeds and seed germination in essence ap was able to avoid to a great extent the weak soil capillary strength situation near the soil surface and the seeds and allowed the applied water to reach the seeds more easily ap is a type of lister planting that has a long history cunningham 1915 and can be utilized in drought prone areas when precipitation during crop establishment is limited but ap is certainly a new use of the lister planting technique for overcoming the germination problems of sdi the ap method has similar effects but a different application technique than the method of lamm et al 2012 who recommended moving the topsoil into a traffic furrow and planting into wetter and firmer soil the purpose of planting the seeds at a deeper depth 5 cm to 11 cm as proposed by guan et al 2016 was also to avoid poor soil water conditions however at deeper planting depths the soil temperature is lower less oxygen is available and more energy consumption is required for seed germination and these factors can affect seedling emergence cao et al 2015 ap appears to be a promising planting method in this region of inner mongolia where limited precipitation and dry soils during the planting period can reduce germination however it should be noted that planting in lister furrows can be problematic when appreciable precipitation occurs in the crop germination period due to waterlogging or soil crusting and seed burial from eroded furrow sidewalls cunningham 1915 when the initial soil conditions are fixed the distance from the water resource to the seed i e the dripline depth and the irrigation amount become the main factors affecting the soil water in the vicinity of seeds charlesworth and muirhead 2003 liu and li 2009 el abedin et al 2015 bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 the ap method shortened the vertical distance from the dripline to seeds from 25 cm to 15 cm compared to that under fp mo et al 2017a 2017b the sw5 in ap was higher than that in fp under the four pi treatments regardless of the elapsed time 0 or 24 h since irrigation fig 4 immediately after irrigation 0 h a pi of only 15 mm was able to affect sw5 under ap while a pi of more than 25 mm was required to appreciably affect sw5 under fp the test site in inner mongolia typically experiences windy conditions in early may which results in relatively dry at the soil surfaces the potential gradient between dry and wet soil caused by irrigation can produce upward flow jones et al 2003 chen et al 2019 and it was observed that the water applied to the topsoil of fp 15 and fp 25 resulted in increases in their sw5 24 h after pi similar results were found in the experiments of provenzano 2007 and monjezi et al 2013 which indicated that the wetting front would move up some distance after several hours of soil water redistribution however under ap 25 ap 45 ap 60 fp 45 and fp 60 due to the larger amounts of applied water in the topsoil at the end of pi the higher evaporation and greater soil water redistribution also caused the sw5 to decrease after 24 h the sw5 of ap 15 was lower than those of the other ap treatments and the sw5 of fp treatments were lower than those of the ap treatments fig 6 4 2 the role of pm and pi in corn germination seed germination is of primary importance for optimizing the field production of any crop plant meena et al 2015 and soil water availability is a primary factor affecting germination araujo et al 2011 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 soil water stress not only reduces seed vitality and slows the rate of cell membrane repair leading to increased leakage of substances such as glucose amino acids k and ca2 from seeds but also inhibits the synthesis of proteins needed for germination and decreases the activity of amylase singh et al 1981 in a study by pablo et al 2007 when the dripline depth increased from 15 cm to 30 cm at the same pi the corn emergence rate decreased from 99 to 36 due to soil water stress since ap decreases the distance between the seeds and the dripline and improves the soil water environment around the seeds ap with pi greatly improved the emergence rate compared with that under fp however the emergence rate under ap decreased when the pi increased to 60 mm probably because excessive irrigation may lead to poor aeration and low soil temperatures huang and li 2002 karandish and shahnazari 2016 there was also evidence that ap provided a better environment for seedlings and early plant growth than fp table 4 4 3 yield response when crop establishment is nonlimited i e the emergence rate is uniform the distance between seeds and subsurface driplines has little or no appreciable effect on crop yield quality etc or wpc machado et al 2003 lamm and trooien 2005 lamm et al 2010 li et al 2016 when germination is hindered by dry soil conditions decreasing the distance between the seeds and the subsurface dripline have positive effects on corn grain yield and wpc this was confirmed in the present study as the average yield and wpc under ap were 24 and 21 greater respectively than those under fp and there was a 12 yield increase and a 16 wpc increase when the dripline depth decreased from 35 cm to 30 cm mo et al 2017a similarly pablo et al 2007 found an 86 yield increase and 87 wpc increase when the dripline depth decreased from 30 cm to 15 cm the results of this study indicated that a higher emergence rate resulted in a higher corn grain yield among the three yield components pi only had a significant effect on ear density which means that the ear density was the main reason for the significant differences in yield among the different pi treatments this is consistent with the research results of lamm et al 2009 lamm and trooien 2001 pablo et al 2007 and schlegel et al 2012 on average the number of kernels per ear decreased with increasing ear density and the kernel mass decreased with an increase in the number of kernels per ear however the decrease in kernels per ear and kernel mass was generally compensated for by higher ear density table 5 similar conclusions were obtained in the study of lamm and trooien 2001 4 4 etc and wpc response when the emergence rate is uniform corn grain yield usually shows a quadratic relationship irmak et al 2016 or a curvilinear relationship payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2013 with seasonal etc due to the differences in the emergence rate the relationship trend of yield and etc in this study was not obvious improving crop water productivity in agriculture is expected to play a very important role in ensuring food and water security in china kang et al 2017 the primary strategy for increasing wpc is to increase yield through agronomic practices and by implementing advanced irrigation technologies howell et al 1990 kang et al 2017 in this study the yield of ap was higher than that of fp resulting in the wpc of ap being significantly higher than that of fp the greatest wpc was observed during the drier year 2015 and the lowest values were obtained in the wetter year of 2016 for all treatments which was similar to the results obtained by irmak et al 2016 under sdi irmak et al 2016 reported that corn wpc ranged from 8 to 31 kg ha 1 mm 1 at the west central research and extension center nebraska at the same location payero et al 2009 reported corn wpc values that ranged from 13 to 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 during a two year experiment howell et al 2013 reported corn wpc values that ranged from 11 to 15 kg ha 1 mm 1 during a two year experiment in bushland texas in their study corn water use ranged from 335 to 956 mm and the grain yield ranged from 2 6 to 14 7 mg ha 1 therefore the lower wpc values could be due to the very high water use in their study compared to that in the present study which was conducted under different soil and climatic conditions 4 5 relationship of fc to emergence rate most previous studies on the relationship between corn germination and seed zone soil water were carried out under rain shelters or in pot based experiments using rain shelters ma et al 2014 proposed that a soil water level of 80 to 84 of field capacity was needed for the spring corn emergence rate to reach 90 to 95 in jilin province china hou et al 2006 found in a pot based experiment that soil water levels of 73 to 78 of field capacity were required for the corn emergence rate to reach 90 the suitable soil water conditions in the aforementioned studies were all lower than the results obtained in this paper which may be due to the substantial differences in soil and environmental conditions among the studies in the sandy loam soil in this study the corn emergence rate reached 90 to 95 under sdi when the soil water level at 5 cm beneath the seeds was approximately 84 to 90 of field capacity 5 conclusions we investigated the effects of the planting method pm and pre emergence irrigation pi on corn germination seedling growth and grain yield under sdi the results indicated that alternate row bed planting ap can provide a firmer and moister seed zone by removing the loosely consolidated dry topsoil an additionally important aspect of ap is that it shortens the distance between the seeds and dripline allowing the potential use of pre emergence irrigation through the sdi system because of these advantages ap significantly increases the amount of soil water around the seeds for germination sufficient soil water resulted in a higher corn emergence rate and thus the higher grain yield and crop water productivity wpc the effects of pm and pi on the emergence rate and yield were all statistically significant when pi was 45 mm under ap the emergence rate and yield under ap reached their maximum values namely 98 and 15 3 mg ha 1 respectively the two year average wpc reached a maximum of 35 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 25 mm pi under ap across the different pi levels the emergence rate corn grain yield and wpc under ap were on average 21 24 and 21 greater than those under flat planting fp respectively the germination rate and the soil water level in the vicinity of the seed were also positively and linearly related it is concluded that the ap method with a suitable amount of pi could improve corn germination and grain yield for sdi corn production in regions that are prone to

10451,using high yielding cultivars is an important measure to maintain grain production especially in dryland environments a field study in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons was conducted at luancheng station in the north china plain ncp to investigate winter wheat cultivars with high yielding characteristics under water deficit conditions the experiment contained two parts with part one involving 10 cultivars of winter wheat grown under i0 rainfed i1 one irrigation and i2 two irrigations treatments and part two involving 32 cultivars grown under i1 treatment the three irrigation regimes i0 i1 and i2 provided approximately 60 70 and 80 of the seasonal potential evapotranspiration respectively yield variations were up to 47 among the 10 cultivars in the two seasons and several cultivars could produce continuously higher yields than those of other cultivars under the different treatments high yielding cultivars produced higher water productivity than that of other cultivars no single agronomic or physiological characteristics except for biomass could explain the yield differences among cultivars however canopy temperature ct during the grain filling stage had a continuous negative linear correlation with grain yield under limited water supply conditions in a high yielding environment the results indicated that the genetic variation in grain yield might be attributed to the ability to withdraw soil water especially the deeper soil water during the grain filling stage which would result in a cooler canopy ct as an indicator of high yielding cultivars was further confirmed among the 32 cultivars under i1 treatment in the 2016 17 a relative adequate water supply during the grain filling stage also prolonged leaf greenness which was beneficial to dry matter production and grain yield therefore the ability to efficiently utilize soil water and maintain dry matter production during the grain filling stage are two important characteristics for maintaining the high yield of winter wheat under water deficit conditions in the ncp keywords canopy temperature post anthesis dry matter accumulation grain yield water use efficiency winter wheat 1 introduction improvements in wheat yield by breeding have been well reported fleury et al 2010 ihsan et al 2016 richards et al 2002 in china for instance an average wheat yield improvement of 52 has occurred due to genetic improvement since the 1980s zhang et al 2013 however drought as a major abiotic stress factor seriously limits the growth development and production of wheat lobell et al 2015 especially when stress occurs during the reproductive growth stage which can result in significant reductions in yield and quality jiang et al 2014 drought stress poses a major challenge to plant breeders in terms of increasing or maintaining crop production compared with that under full irrigation conditions wheat grain yield among different genotypes was 49 0 61 7 lower under rainfed conditions ali et al 2007 monneveux et al 2005 tari 2016 zhang et al 2017a similarly under water limited conditions the grain yield variation in cultivars ranged from 20 0 to 71 8 lopes and reynolds 2010 sharma et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 to assess the yield stability of individual cultivars in various environments the finlay wilkinson fw model has been widely used to study the genotype environment interactions of crops finlay and wilkinson 1963 zhang et al 2017b xavier et al 2018 the large regression coefficient in this model indicates a relatively high crop sensitivity to environmental changes the morpho physiological features of cultivars are closely related to the mechanisms and strategies of drought resistance under drought conditions characteristics related to drought resistance such as crop canopy temperature ct photosynthetic rate chlorophyll carbon isotope discrimination δ13c biomass production and allocation efficiency ash content and root distribution have been widely studied deery et al 2016 hlaváčová et al 2018 monneveux et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 however due to the genotype environment and genotype environment interactions selectable traits might produce opposite results under different environmental conditions at the leaf level wheat cultivars that sustain relatively high flag leaf photosynthesis during the grain filling phase tend to produce better yields than those sustaining lower flag leaf photosynthesis fischer et al 1998 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013a no consistent correlation was found between photosynthetic rate and wheat grain yield among 64 cultivars driever et al 2014 up to the canopy level ct a cost effective and large scale method can be used to quickly identify drought tolerant cultivars deery et al 2016 drought and high solar radiation reduce leaf stomatal conductance to maintain evaporative demand genotypic variation in energy balance stomatal conductance and transpiration reveals the ability of plants to extract soil water and produce and partition dry matter thereby affecting ct balota et al 2008 a significant genotypic variation in wheat ct has been demonstrated in several reports fischer et al 1998 mason and singh 2014 pinter et al 1990 both thapa et al 2018 and zhang et al 2016 found a significant negative relationship between grain yield and ct under irrigation and dryland conditions however no correlation of ct with grain yield was observed under irrigated and rainfed conditions in spain royo et al 2002 additionally transpiration efficiency and δ13c have been evaluated and have a strong relationship across various environmental conditions borzouei et al 2020 tausz posch et al 2012 wheat cultivars could generate grains with different ratios of 13c to 12c under water limited and fully irrigated conditions wasson et al 2012 kernel δ13c was positively correlated with grain yield under moderate stress and full irrigation conditions but negatively correlated with grain yield under severe drought del pozo et al 2016 additionally δ13c has been reported as an indirect trait that can be used to assess crop water use efficiency wue wang et al 2013b in agronomic terms drought directly reduces organ size leaves stems spikes and tillers at various developmental stages ihsan et al 2016 furthermore the performance of dry matter accumulation in pre anthesis and post anthesis related to the intrinsic photosynthetic activities of leaves and inflorescences as well as biomass allocation efficiency could decline under drought conditions hlaváčová et al 2018 root related drought adaptive characteristics such as root biomass root distribution and root shoot ratio are mainly affected by genetic background and year fang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 richards 1991 and richards et al 2007 confirmed that early root vigor in crops may be related to a relatively deep root system in the field a uniform and deep root architecture reduces water use in the vegetative stage and increases access to water from deep soil layers during the reproductive growth stage palta et al 2011 the root length density may help a plant maximize its use of resources and contribute to the production of biomass and a higher yield in dryland environments where crops depend on deep soil water during the grain filling stage saradadevi et al 2015 thus maximal soil moisture is captured for transpiration and minimal water is lost by soil evaporation thereby increasing the wue cultivars with uniform and deep root architectural features may be better in dryland environments breeding to improve the morpho physiological and or agronomic features has greatly contributed to grain yield increases however little is known about changes in the systematic performance among morpho physiological and agronomic features due to environmental stress in the north china plain ncp winter wheat production is affected by water stress dai 2011 and climatic condition limitations fang et al 2017b therefore selecting cultivars that could alleviate these limitations to achieve high production is very important in this region the objectives of this study were i to assess the correlations between morphological and physiological traits and the final grain yield of winter wheat cultivars and ii to select traits related to high yield and high wue cultivars under limited water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 growing conditions and cultivars tested the experiment was carried out at luancheng station in the ncp 37 53 n 114 40 e an elevation of 50 m this region is characterized by a monsoon climate and during the growing season of winter wheat which is from early october to early june of the following year rainfall is usually less than 100 mm water deficits usually occur during winter wheat cultivation the nutrient contents of the 0 20 cm topsoil layer at the experimental site were 18 7 g kg soil organic matter 1 01 g kg total n and 78 24 and 86 mg kg available n p and k respectively the experiment was a randomized block design with 10 and 32 cultivars and three irrigation regimes three irrigation regimes were applied to the cultivars i0 no irrigation during the growing season i1 80 mm of water applied at the jointing stage stage 30 and i2 80 and 70 mm of water applied at the jointing stage 30 and anthesis stage stage 65 respectively zadoks et al 1974 ten cultivars were tested under i0 and i2 and 32 cultivars were tested under i1 in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons irrigation water was pumped underground and transferred to the field using a low pressure water transportation system a flow meter was installed at the outlet of the system to record the amount of water applied to each plot all the cultivars used in this study were recently released cultivars and are widely used by local farmers table s1 the land was managed in the same manner in the two successive seasons uniform land was divided into three sections for the three irrigation regimes the section with the i1 treatment had a larger area than that of the other two sections because 32 cultivars were tested in this section within each irrigation section cultivars were grown in randomly arranged plots each plot had an area of 8 m 4 m with three replications of each cultivar all the cultivars were sown at a density of 400 plants m2 with a row spacing of 20 cm on 8 10 2016 and

applied as needed crops were managed to remain free of weeds and diseases 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data meteorological data from 2016 to 2018 came from an automatic weather station 100 m

contents ct was continuously measured with a hand held infrared thermometer nec avio technologies co tokyo jpn between 11 00 and 14 00 on cloudless days at major growing stages in each plot the view angle was set at 45 with respect to the canopy thermal images were analysed using infrec analyzer ns9500 lite software with the emissivity set at 0 98 during analysis the soil temperature from the underlying soil surface was not included the values were averaged and divided into jointing stage stages 30 59 anthesis stage stages 60 69 and grain filling stage stages 72 78 the leaf photosynthetic rate was regularly measured using a gas exchange system li 6400 li cor usa and four flag leaves for each treatment from anthesis to maturity stages 65 79 were analyzed these selected flag leaves were nonshaded and fully extended leaves the measurement time was from 9 00 to 11 00 on sunny days the values were averaged and separated into the anthesis stage stages 60 69 and grain filling stage stages

divided into the jointing stage stages 30 59 anthesis stage stages 60 69 middle grain filling stage stages 75 and late grain filling stage stage 77 2 2 4 root sampling roots were measured at maturity using a 10 cm diameter soil corer from the soil surface down to 1 5 m in 10 cm increments half of the corer was placed on the crop row and the other half between the rows with three replicates obtained for each treatment after sampling the soils were transported to the laboratory and washed using a sieve to obtain roots after separating the roots from debris the root length was measured based on the line intersect method using a 1 27 cm grid 2 2 5 kernel carbon isotope discrimination grain carbon isotope discrimination δ13c was measured at harvest for each plot using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso prime 100 irms isoprime co uk after grains were oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight samples were ground into powder with a ball mill then 30 mg samples were packed in silver capsules and analyzed the δ13c values were calculated using the following equation 3 δ 13 c δ 13 c a δ 13 c p 1 δ 13 c p 1000 where δ 13ca is the isotopic composition of atmospheric air in this region 10 and δ 13cp is the measured value of the sample 2 2 6 soil water monitoring and evapotranspiration calculation in this study the soil volumetric water contents were regularly recorded approximately 7 10 days by a neutron meter 503dr cpn international inc usa to a depth of 2 m in 20 cm increments for several selected cultivars the soil water contents for other cultivars were monitored to a depth of 2 m at sowing and harvesting using the gravimetric method the volumetric soil water content was calculated by multiplying soil water contents by the soil bulk density which was measured based on the conventional method the soil bulk density was 1 55 1 65 1 56 1 50 1 60 1 67 1 67 1 60 1 64 and 1 50 g cm3 for each 20 cm soil layer from 0 to 200 cm respectively evapotranspiration et was calculated according to the water balance equation zhang et al 2008 4 et p i swd r d cr where p is the precipitation i is the irrigation swd is the soil water depletion which is the soil water content before sowing minus that after harvesting for the top 2 m soil profile r is the runoff d is deep percolation and cr is the capillary rise to the root zone runoff and capillary rise were negligible due to the small rainfall amount and deep groundwater tables 40 m below the soil surface deep drainage was taken as zero due to the limited irrigation conditions wue was defined as the grain yield divided by the seasonal et daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation which represented the rate of evapotranspiration from a reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the input of the daily weather data included the daily maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours crop potential evapotranspiration etp which was considered as the et under a full water supply was calculated by multiplying the et0 by the crop coefficient kc from liu et al 2002 2 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed using r software r version 3 6 0 and excell software finlay wilkinson fw model finlay and wilkinson 1963 was used to assess the performance in yield among all the cultivars under different water regimes and different seasons the grain yield wue and physiological characteristics of different cultivars under the same irrigation regimes were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 correlation analysis was conducted between grain yield and the physiological traits 3 results 3 1 soil water conditions fig 1 presents the changes in the daily et0 and average soil water contents for the top 1 m soil profile under the three irrigation treatments for the two seasons the soil water contents were greater than 80 of the field capacity in the top 1 m soil profile at sowing crops experienced a wintering period from december to february and recovered in march with a lower growth rate and lower et0 than those occurring after march therefore relatively high soil water conditions were maintained from sowing to the recovery period under all irrigation treatments at the end of march winter wheat started its rapid growing stage and the increase in growth and the high et0 led to a significant increase in crop water use rapid declines in soil water contents were observed in the i0 treatment group the low rainfall amount could not replenish the dried soil profile fig 1 irrigation during the jointing stage for i1 and i2 replenished the soil water use and high soil water contents were maintained until anthesis without additional irrigation in i1 the soil water contents declined rapidly during the grain filling stage and the soil water contents were at consistently lower levels in i0 than in i1 or i2 the irrigation at anthesis in i2 improved the soil water content during the grain filling stage the changes in soil water content indicated that the soil water deficit increased as the growing season progressed and during the grain filling stage the water deficit was highest level in i0 and i1 between the two years 2017 18 had a higher rainfall and lower et0 and the variation in soil water among the treatments was smaller than that in the 2016 17 season the average seasonal et was 346 0 414 8 and 440 6 mm in i0 i1 and i2 in 2016 17 and 298 9 374 9 and 394 9 mm in 2017 18 table 1 respectively seasonal et for i0 i1 and i2 met approximately 60 70 and 80 of the etp respectively for both seasons zhang et al 2008 indicated that winter wheat could achieve the highest yield under 84 etp therefore the i2 treatment in this study could be used as an optimized irrigation scheme 3 2 seasonal yield variation related to weather condition large seasonal weather variation existed during the two seasons which affected the grain production of winter wheat table 2 shows the average grain yield of ten cultivars in the i0 i1 and i2 treatments the average yield under i0 i1 and i2 in the 2016 17 season was 23 0 22 7 and 32 8 greater than that in the 2017 18 season sowing was delayed 14 days in 2017 18 due to heavy rainfall 93 7 mm before sowing which led to a decrease in temperature eventually resulting in a decline in tiller numbers and the spike numbers per area tables 2 and 3 the spike differentiation process between recovery and jointing period in the 2017 18 season was shortened due to higher temperature which reduced the seed numbers per spike fig 2 and table 3 compared with solar radiation and sunshine hour at grain filling stage in the 2016 17 season the two factors in the 2017 18 season were decreased by 33 4 and 34 1 respectively which caused the lower seed weight table 3 the yield potential of winter wheat was not fully achieved in the 2017 18 season which reduced the yield difference among cultivars table s2 3 3 grain yield and wue among the ten cultivars the fw regression model was used to compare the performance of different cultivars the mean environmental yield was the seasonal average grain yield of the 10 cultivars under each irrigation treatment the mean grain yield of the 10 cultivars was 6034 5 6767 4 and 7830 8 kg ha in the 2016 17 season for i0 i1 and i2 respectively and the values were 4647 1 5234 2 and 5342 2 kg ha respectively in the 2017 18 season fig 3 a b the yield difference among the three irrigation treatments was smaller in 2017 18 15 6 13 7 and 8 5 for the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively than in 2016 17 15 4 31 2 and 21 7 for the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively due to weather conditions fig 4 shows the regression lines of individual cultivar yield against the environmental mean yield the results indicated that the yield difference among cultivars was greater in high yielding environments grain yield 6500 kg ha than in low yielding environments grain yield 6500 kg ha there were genotype and environment interactions that affected grain production and the interactions mainly occurred under low yielding environments table 4 and fig 4 due to the small difference in grain production among the cultivars under low yielding environments the cultivars that produced significantly higher yields than those of other cultivars under high yielding environments should be prioritized the grain yield of some varieties outperformed others across a wide range of environments as shown in fig 4 among the 10 cultivars sy20 and nd399 could be taken as high yielding cultivars grain yields were 5 greater than the mean grain yield and gy5218 as a low yielding cultivar grain yield was 5 lower than the mean grain yield as indicated in fig 3 sy20 produced 5 1 32 5 and 18 7 higher yields than those of gy5218 in i0 i1 and i2 respectively in the high yielding season of 2016 17 and the values were reduced to 5 0 2 4 and 3 6 respectively in the low yielding season of 2017 18 nd399 had the highest grain yield in 2016 17 season but had relative low grain yield in 2017 18 indicating that nd399 could not well adapt to a wide range of environments the grain yield of other cultivars such as zm1062 jm22 and gy2018 was not outstanding in either high yielding or low yielding environments using less water to produce more grain is very important in regions with water shortages a significant positive linear relationship was found between wue and the grain yield among the 10 winter wheat cultivars as shown in supplemental fig s1 the process of breeding to select high yielding cultivars also improves wue the wue of sy20 was the highest among the 10 cultivars similar to its yield performance fig 3c d therefore selecting a high yielding cultivar not only improves grain production but also increases water productivity 3 4 correlation analysis of the grain yield with agronomic and physiological characteristics no significant correlation was found between yield with ct biomass lai leaf chlorophyll contents from jointing 30 59 stages to anthesis stages 60 69 table 5 shows that the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and the final above ground biomass played a key role in the final yield in a wide range of environments therefore the agronomic and physiological characteristics after anthesis were related to the final yield of different cultivars in a high yielding environment cultivars with relatively low ct values tended to produce higher yields than those with high ct values while in a low yielding environment the relationship between grain yield and ct disappeared table 5 and fig 5 a a significant relationship between grain yield and chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage was confirmed only in i1 and i2 in 2016 17 and in i1 in 2017 18 table 5 and fig 5b the increase in grain yield under a moderate water supply over that without irrigation might be partially attributed to the higher leaf chlorophyll contents during the grain filling stage there was large variation in the photosynthetic rate at anthesis and grain filling stages among the cultivars fig s2 the difference in kernel δ13c among cultivars was not significant table s3 no significant correlation between these physiological traits and grain yield was found in any environments seasonal et could not indicate the differences in grain yields among cultivars under the same growing conditions however cultivars with relatively low et tended to produce higher wue than that of cultivars with relatively high et table 6 a relatively long root length tended to result in a higher grain yield and wue in i2 in 2016 17 and 2017 18 the reasons for this might be related to the increase in the root water extraction capacity which could increase biomass no continuous significant relationship was confirmed between agronomic or physiological traits and grain yield and wue indicating that the difference among the cultivars was affected by many factors and a single factor may not sufficiently capture this difference 3 5 crop characteristics related to the high yielding potential of the cultivars table 5 indicates that some characteristics had a closer relationship with yield in the high yielding season than in the low yielding season biomass production was the major factor determining the final yield a further comparison of the two cultivars with the highest yield and the lowest yield showed that the difference in biomass production existed during the whole growing period under i1 and i2 treatments fig 6 post anthesis dry matter contributed to more than 90 of grain production in both cultivars the high yielding cultivar had higher contributions from post anthesis dry matter production than from pre anthesis dry matter production therefore improving post anthesis dry matter might be a major factor that should be considered when breeding high yielding cultivars the grain filling duration of winter wheat was limited in the ncp the current winter wheat cultivars did not differ significantly in their flowering time fig s3 therefore varieties that had a high photosynthesis capacity during the grain filling stage would be desirable due to their potential to produce a higher yield this capacity would be related to greenness maintenance as well as the soil water uptake ability during the grain filling stage under limited water supply conditions table 5 shows that a relatively high leaf chlorophyll content during the grain filling stage had a positive correlation with the final grain yield the soil water uptake ability at the late growing stages of the crop i e when the whole soil profile became relatively dry would depend on the root distribution in the deep soil layer and the water use strategies of the crop under a limited water supply if the water use during vegetative growth was reduced more water in the soil profile would be available during the grain filling stage the higher water uptake ability would result in a lower ct and fig 5 clearly indicates this correlation although the difference in total root length among cultivars was not significant at maturity the different cultivars had different water uptake abilities for example prior to early grain filling cultivar gy5218 consumed more soil water 104 9 mm than cultivar sy20 68 1 mm in the i1 treatment in the 2016 17 season for the 2 m soil profile in the i1 treatment the total amount of soil water extracted by the low yielding cultivar gy5218 was slightly higher than that extracted by the high yielding cultivar sy20 with the increase in soil water use during the grain filling stage especially in the 60 180 cm soil profile biomass production was enhanced thereby resulting in an increase in the transpiration rate and a low ct smaller root length density 0 8 cm cm3 in deep soil layer was a limiting factor which restricted the full utilization of soil water the increase in soil water use by sy20 during the grain filling stage might be related to its higher root length density in the 60 150 cm soil layer fig 7 3 6 testing for the desired characteristic in a large pool of cultivars the above analysis showed that ct during grain filling was a good indicator for selecting cultivars with a high yielding potential under limited water supply conditions this indicator was tested on the 32 cultivars in i1 in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons correlation analysis indicated that cultivars with relatively low cts during the grain filling stage performed better in the high yielding environment in the 2016 17 season than the other cultivars fig 8 while this relationship was not found in a low yielding environment in the 2017 18 season the unfavorable growing conditions in 2017 18 reduced the yield potential of high yielding cultivars resulting in smaller yield differences among the tested cultivars 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield performance of different cultivars drought during the young microspore stage of pollen development has a greater influence on grain number while drought during the anthesis and grain filling phases results in a reduction in grain size and a substantial decrease in the yield of winter wheat the set of 10 wheat cultivars tested in this work exhibited high variability in grain yield as well as physiological and agronomic traits yield variation among cultivars was 17 5 46 6 and 9 9 25 3 respectively in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons under the three irrigation regimes and cultivars with a higher yield usually had a higher wue crop performance is controlled by both genotype and environment specifically compared with zm175 and gy5218 nd399 and sy20 were more sensitive to irrigation application and showed a significant increase in grain yield under i2 in a normal season 2016 17 some cultivars sy20 nd399 and zm1062 appeared to be better than the others in terms of grain yield in all treatments in both years fig 3 the results of this study were similar to those of keser et al 2017 and del pozo et al 2016 and their results also showed that cultivars had different performance responses to drought stress and large yield variation among cultivars crop performance is affected not only by genotype but also by environment it is desirable to use cultivars with high yielding potentials to improve grain production 4 2 dry matter allocation to grain yield the higher grain yield among cultivars was related to the higher biomass production consistent with previous findings dry matter accumulation is considered a selection criterion nakhforoosh et al 2016 prior to anthesis stem and spike growth influenced the assimilate supply to the spike while biomass reallocation and translocation i e the storage of dry matter in organs was also sensitive to drought cultivars with relatively high yields generally benefit from increased biomass production a small leaf area light leaves and high δ13c balota et al 2017 other studies indicated that dry matter translocation efficiency and spike stem ratio contributed the most to increased production in italian and spanish wheat álvaro et al 2008 in the current study the results showed that the post anthesis biomass accumulation contributed the most to final grain yield post anthesis dry matter accumulation was mainly controlled by root water uptake and post anthesis physiological processes the results from this study showed that high yielding cultivars had a higher ratio of water consumption during the grain filling stage which favored dry matter accumulation during this growth period in the ncp due to the rapid temperature increase at the late growth stages of winter wheat the grain filling stage of winter wheat lasted approximately only one month although the grain filling duration was short 90 of the grain yield was from dry matter production during this period therefore cultivar characteristics favoring dry matter production after anthesis would be desirable under limited water supply water consumption to the root zone profile was relatively high and usually during the grain filling stage soil water contents became quite low fig 1 cultivars that could efficiently utilize stored soil water in the deep soil profile would maintain photosynthesis capacity longer and produce more post anthesis dry matter for yield formation than cultivars that could not efficiently utilize stored water saradadevi et al 2015 4 3 morphological and physiological traits of high yielding cultivars at the leaf level a higher photosynthetic rate which depends on the leaf chlorophyll platform is the main driving force for increased dry matter assimilation organ formation and crop yield under drought stress hlaváčová et al 2018 the results from this study did not show a consistent correlation of leaf photosynthetic rate with grain production among the cultivars in either season recently released cultivars have been bred for various traits in addition to photosynthetic performance makino 2011 the leaf photosynthetic rate was also affected by the leaf surface light intensity general plant health and developmental stages richards 2000 feng et al 2014 photosynthesis at a single leaf level may not be able to determine the total photosynthesis capacity at the canopy level richards 2000 leaf chlorophyll is not only a platform for photosynthetic machinery but also regarded as a stay green trait reflecting the dynamics of leaf greenness subudhi et al 2000 the stay green phenotype indicated the underlying genotypic driver of assimilation and the ability of nitrogen uptake and remobilization but also reflected root water uptake ability rebetzke et al 2016 the results of this study showed that the leaf chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage had a positive correlation with the final yield among the cultivars tested and two seasons under the moderate irrigation treatment the results of this study agreed with those of the report of lopes and reynolds 2012 this characteristic could be partially explained by the soil water uptake ability under limited water supply a high soil water uptake ability supplied the water needed to maintain the photosynthetic capacity ultimately enhancing the potential biomass and grain yield fischer et al 1998 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013a cultivars maintaining relatively high transpiration rates under limited water supply conditions usually exhibit high root water uptake ability and high leaf photosynthesis rates the results from this study indicated that ct at the grain filling stage was negatively correlated with grain yield the nonsignificant correlation of ct with yield during other growth stages might be because during these other growing stages soil water contents were relatively high and could meet the water requirements of the crop fig 1 under limited water supply conditions the accumulated water use resulted in a relatively dry soil profile during grain filling in the ncp the ability to maintain a low ct was related to the root water uptake ability a strong association between a low ct and increased rooting depth was observed among wheat cultivars particularly during the grain filling stage reynolds et al 2006 pinter et al 1990 amani et al 1996 according to li et al 2019 cultivars with a relatively low ct had a deeper rooting system 6 2 8 1 cm than those with a higher ct in a set of 646 genotypes in australia drought tolerant wheat cultivars were able to extract more water from deeper soil profiles in dryland environments than drought susceptible cultivars thapa et al 2016 in the current study cultivar sy20 had a lower ct than cultivar gy5218 in the 2016 17 season thus the high yielding sy20 cultivar had the characteristic of a deep root system which allows the plant to extract more water available for grain filling zaman allah et al 2011 ct could be used to distinguish the difference in grain yield among cultivars under rainfed conditions fang et al 2017b the polygenic basis underpinning ct has revealed the improvement of trait heritability thus screening for ct within a breeding program is important rebetzke et al 2012 the δ13c in kernels has a significant positive relationship with grain yield as growing conditions improve good growing conditions could favor soil water uptake to increase leaf stomal conductance and photosynthetic capacity thereby improving the fixation assimilation and remobilization of carbohydrates to the grains medina et al 2019 previous studies have shown that whether the relationship between kernel δ13c and grain yield is positive or negative depends on soil water availability del pozo et al 2016 medina et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 some studies also found that the genetic variation in grain δ13c resulting from carboxylation by rubisco and co2 diffusion to the chloroplast depended on some physiological processes baruah et al 2017 in this study the relationship between δ13c and grain yield under various soil water conditions was not significant which was different from previous studies the reasons might be that the pool of ten cultivars was small and the growth conditions did not allow for the full expression of the δ13c characteristic among the cultivars 5 conclusion large variations in grain yield among cultivars were observed selecting a good cultivar has the potential to improve grain production as well as water productivity under the growing conditions of the ncp a high yielding cultivar could be screened through the traits of a relatively low ct at the grain filling stage and a high leaf chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage under water limited conditions these two factors were closely related to the high soil water uptake ability and the strategy of allowing for more water consumption during the gain filling stage due to the high contribution of dry matter production to final grain yield after anthesis therefore a low ct and high chlorophyll content could be used as indicators in high yielding environments for selecting traits of winter wheat cultivars

10451,using high yielding cultivars is an important measure to maintain grain production especially in dryland environments a field study in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons was conducted at luancheng station in the north china plain ncp to investigate winter wheat cultivars with high yielding characteristics under water deficit conditions the experiment contained two parts with part one involving 10 cultivars of winter wheat grown under i0 rainfed i1 one irrigation and i2 two irrigations treatments and part two involving 32 cultivars grown under i1 treatment the three irrigation regimes i0 i1 and i2 provided approximately 60 70 and 80 of the seasonal potential evapotranspiration respectively yield variations were up to 47 among the 10 cultivars in the two seasons and several cultivars could produce continuously higher yields than those of other cultivars under the different treatments high yielding cultivars produced higher water productivity than that of other cultivars no single agronomic or physiological characteristics except for biomass could explain the yield differences among cultivars however canopy temperature ct during the grain filling stage had a continuous negative linear correlation with grain yield under limited water supply conditions in a high yielding environment the results indicated that the genetic variation in grain yield might be attributed to the ability to withdraw soil water especially the deeper soil water during the grain filling stage which would result in a cooler canopy ct as an indicator of high yielding cultivars was further confirmed among the 32 cultivars under i1 treatment in the 2016 17 a relative adequate water supply during the grain filling stage also prolonged leaf greenness which was beneficial to dry matter production and grain yield therefore the ability to efficiently utilize soil water and maintain dry matter production during the grain filling stage are two important characteristics for maintaining the high yield of winter wheat under water deficit conditions in the ncp keywords canopy temperature post anthesis dry matter accumulation grain yield water use efficiency winter wheat 1 introduction improvements in wheat yield by breeding have been well reported fleury et al 2010 ihsan et al 2016 richards et al 2002 in china for instance an average wheat yield improvement of 52 has occurred due to genetic improvement since the 1980s zhang et al 2013 however drought as a major abiotic stress factor seriously limits the growth development and production of wheat lobell et al 2015 especially when stress occurs during the reproductive growth stage which can result in significant reductions in yield and quality jiang et al 2014 drought stress poses a major challenge to plant breeders in terms of increasing or maintaining crop production compared with that under full irrigation conditions wheat grain yield among different genotypes was 49 0 61 7 lower under rainfed conditions ali et al 2007 monneveux et al 2005 tari 2016 zhang et al 2017a similarly under water limited conditions the grain yield variation in cultivars ranged from 20 0 to 71 8 lopes and reynolds 2010 sharma et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 to assess the yield stability of individual cultivars in various environments the finlay wilkinson fw model has been widely used to study the genotype environment interactions of crops finlay and wilkinson 1963 zhang et al 2017b xavier et al 2018 the large regression coefficient in this model indicates a relatively high crop sensitivity to environmental changes the morpho physiological features of cultivars are closely related to the mechanisms and strategies of drought resistance under drought conditions characteristics related to drought resistance such as crop canopy temperature ct photosynthetic rate chlorophyll carbon isotope discrimination δ13c biomass production and allocation efficiency ash content and root distribution have been widely studied deery et al 2016 hlaváčová et al 2018 monneveux et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 however due to the genotype environment and genotype environment interactions selectable traits might produce opposite results under different environmental conditions at the leaf level wheat cultivars that sustain relatively high flag leaf photosynthesis during the grain filling phase tend to produce better yields than those sustaining lower flag leaf photosynthesis fischer et al 1998 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013a no consistent correlation was found between photosynthetic rate and wheat grain yield among 64 cultivars driever et al 2014 up to the canopy level ct a cost effective and large scale method can be used to quickly identify drought tolerant cultivars deery et al 2016 drought and high solar radiation reduce leaf stomatal conductance to maintain evaporative demand genotypic variation in energy balance stomatal conductance and transpiration reveals the ability of plants to extract soil water and produce and partition dry matter thereby affecting ct balota et al 2008 a significant genotypic variation in wheat ct has been demonstrated in several reports fischer et al 1998 mason and singh 2014 pinter et al 1990 both thapa et al 2018 and zhang et al 2016 found a significant negative relationship between grain yield and ct under irrigation and dryland conditions however no correlation of ct with grain yield was observed under irrigated and rainfed conditions in spain royo et al 2002 additionally transpiration efficiency and δ13c have been evaluated and have a strong relationship across various environmental conditions borzouei et al 2020 tausz posch et al 2012 wheat cultivars could generate grains with different ratios of 13c to 12c under water limited and fully irrigated conditions wasson et al 2012 kernel δ13c was positively correlated with grain yield under moderate stress and full irrigation conditions but negatively correlated with grain yield under severe drought del pozo et al 2016 additionally δ13c has been reported as an indirect trait that can be used to assess crop water use efficiency wue wang et al 2013b in agronomic terms drought directly reduces organ size leaves stems spikes and tillers at various developmental stages ihsan et al 2016 furthermore the performance of dry matter accumulation in pre anthesis and post anthesis related to the intrinsic photosynthetic activities of leaves and inflorescences as well as biomass allocation efficiency could decline under drought conditions hlaváčová et al 2018 root related drought adaptive characteristics such as root biomass root distribution and root shoot ratio are mainly affected by genetic background and year fang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 richards 1991 and richards et al 2007 confirmed that early root vigor in crops may be related to a relatively deep root system in the field a uniform and deep root architecture reduces water use in the vegetative stage and increases access to water from deep soil layers during the reproductive growth stage palta et al 2011 the root length density may help a plant maximize its use of resources and contribute to the production of biomass and a higher yield in dryland environments where crops depend on deep soil water during the grain filling stage saradadevi et al 2015 thus maximal soil moisture is captured for transpiration and minimal water is lost by soil evaporation thereby increasing the wue cultivars with uniform and deep root architectural features may be better in dryland environments breeding to improve the morpho physiological and or agronomic features has greatly contributed to grain yield increases however little is known about changes in the systematic performance among morpho physiological and agronomic features due to environmental stress in the north china plain ncp winter wheat production is affected by water stress dai 2011 and climatic condition limitations fang et al 2017b therefore selecting cultivars that could alleviate these limitations to achieve high production is very important in this region the objectives of this study were i to assess the correlations between morphological and physiological traits and the final grain yield of winter wheat cultivars and ii to select traits related to high yield and high wue cultivars under limited water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 growing conditions and cultivars tested the experiment was carried out at luancheng station in the ncp 37 53 n 114 40 e an elevation of 50 m this region is characterized by a monsoon climate and during the growing season of winter wheat which is from early october to early june of the following year rainfall is usually less than 100 mm water deficits usually occur during winter wheat cultivation the nutrient contents of the 0 20 cm topsoil layer at the experimental site were 18 7 g kg soil organic matter 1 01 g kg total n and 78 24 and 86 mg kg available n p and k respectively the experiment was a randomized block design with 10 and 32 cultivars and three irrigation regimes three irrigation regimes were applied to the cultivars i0 no irrigation during the growing season i1 80 mm of water applied at the jointing stage stage 30 and i2 80 and 70 mm of water applied at the jointing stage 30 and anthesis stage stage 65 respectively zadoks et al 1974 ten cultivars were tested under i0 and i2 and 32 cultivars were tested under i1 in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons irrigation water was pumped underground and transferred to the field using a low pressure water transportation system a flow meter was installed at the outlet of the system to record the amount of water applied to each plot all the cultivars used in this study were recently released cultivars and are widely used by local farmers table s1 the land was managed in the same manner in the two successive seasons uniform land was divided into three sections for the three irrigation regimes the section with the i1 treatment had a larger area than that of the other two sections because 32 cultivars were tested in this section within each irrigation section cultivars were grown in randomly arranged plots each plot had an area of 8 m 4 m with three replications of each cultivar all the cultivars were sown at a density of 400 plants m2 with a row spacing of 20 cm on 8 10 2016 and

applied as needed crops were managed to remain free of weeds and diseases 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data meteorological data from 2016 to 2018 came from an automatic weather station 100 m

major stages for each measurement approximately 60 80 stems were cut at the ground level from each plot and leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter li 3000 li cor inc usa the lai was calculated using the plant density thereafter the plants were oven dried to a constant weight at 80 c to measure the dry matter at harvest in addition to the measurement of total biomass seed weight and seed numbers per spike were recorded the seed weight and total dry matter were used to calculate the harvest index hi at maturity a 1 2 m 4 m area in the center of each plot was harvested manually and then immediately threshed by a machine to separate the grain after air drying converted to 13 water content the weight of the grain in each plot was determined the contributions of pre anthesis and post anthesis dry matter to grain yield were calculated according to dordas and sioulas 2009 and liu et al 2016 1 c o n t r i b u t i o n o f p r e a n t h e s i s d r y m a t t e r t o g r a i n y i e l d

contents ct was continuously measured with a hand held infrared thermometer nec avio technologies co tokyo jpn between 11 00 and 14 00 on cloudless days at major growing stages in each plot the view angle was set at 45 with respect to the canopy thermal images were analysed using infrec analyzer ns9500 lite software with the emissivity set at 0 98 during analysis the soil temperature from the underlying soil surface was not included the values were averaged and divided into jointing stage stages 30 59 anthesis stage stages 60 69 and grain filling stage stages 72 78 the leaf photosynthetic rate was regularly measured using a gas exchange system li 6400 li cor usa and four flag leaves for each treatment from anthesis to maturity stages 65 79 were analyzed these selected flag leaves were nonshaded and fully extended leaves the measurement time was from 9 00 to 11 00 on sunny days the values were averaged and separated into the anthesis stage stages 60 69 and grain filling stage stages 72 78 values the chlorophyll content of ten flag leaves was measured using a spad 502 instrument minolta tokyo jpn from jointing stage to the milking stage in each plot the values were averaged and divided into the jointing stage stages 30 59 anthesis stage stages 60 69 middle grain filling stage stages 75 and late grain filling stage stage 77 2 2 4 root sampling roots were measured at maturity using a 10 cm diameter soil corer from the soil surface down to 1 5 m in 10 cm increments half of the corer was placed on the crop row and the other half between the rows with three replicates obtained for each treatment after sampling the soils were transported to the laboratory and washed using a sieve to obtain roots after separating the roots from debris the root length was measured based on the line intersect method using a 1 27 cm grid 2 2 5 kernel carbon isotope discrimination grain carbon isotope discrimination δ13c was measured at harvest for each plot using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso prime 100 irms isoprime co uk after grains were oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight samples were ground into powder with a ball mill then 30 mg samples were packed in silver capsules and analyzed the δ13c values were calculated using the following equation 3 δ 13 c δ 13 c a δ 13 c p 1 δ 13 c p 1000 where δ 13ca is the isotopic composition of atmospheric air in this region 10 and δ 13cp is the measured value of the sample 2 2 6 soil water monitoring and evapotranspiration calculation in this study the soil volumetric water contents were regularly recorded approximately 7 10 days by a neutron meter 503dr cpn international inc usa to a depth of 2 m in 20 cm increments for several selected cultivars the soil water contents for other cultivars were monitored to a depth of 2 m at sowing and harvesting using the gravimetric method the volumetric soil water content was calculated by multiplying soil water contents by the soil bulk density which was measured based on the conventional method the soil bulk density was 1 55 1 65 1 56 1 50 1 60 1 67 1 67 1 60 1 64 and 1 50 g cm3 for each 20 cm soil layer from 0 to 200 cm respectively evapotranspiration et was calculated according to the water balance equation zhang et al 2008 4 et p i swd r d cr where p is the precipitation i is the irrigation swd is the soil water depletion which is the soil water content before sowing minus that after harvesting for the top 2 m soil profile r is the runoff d is deep percolation and cr is the capillary rise to the root zone runoff and capillary rise were negligible due to the small rainfall amount and deep groundwater tables 40 m below the soil surface deep drainage was taken as zero due to the limited irrigation conditions wue was defined as the grain yield divided by the seasonal et daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation which represented the rate of evapotranspiration from a reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the input of the daily weather data included the daily maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours crop potential evapotranspiration etp which was considered as the et under a full water supply was calculated by multiplying the et0 by the crop coefficient kc from liu et al 2002 2 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed using r software r version 3 6 0 and excell software finlay wilkinson fw model finlay and wilkinson 1963 was used to assess the performance in yield among all the cultivars under different water regimes and different seasons the grain yield wue and physiological characteristics of different cultivars under the same irrigation regimes were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 correlation analysis was conducted between grain yield and the physiological traits 3 results 3 1 soil water conditions fig 1 presents the changes in the daily et0 and average soil water contents for the top 1 m soil profile under the three irrigation treatments for the two seasons the soil water contents were greater than 80 of the field capacity in the top 1 m soil profile at sowing crops experienced a wintering period from december to february and recovered in march with a lower growth rate and lower et0 than those occurring after march therefore relatively high soil water conditions were maintained from sowing to the recovery period under all irrigation treatments at the end of march winter wheat started its rapid growing stage and the increase in growth and the high et0 led to a significant increase in crop water use rapid declines in soil water contents were observed in the i0 treatment group the low rainfall amount could not replenish the dried soil profile fig 1 irrigation during the jointing stage for i1 and i2 replenished the soil water use and high soil water contents were maintained until anthesis without additional irrigation in i1 the soil water contents declined rapidly during the grain filling stage and the soil water contents were at consistently lower levels in i0 than in i1 or i2 the irrigation at anthesis in i2 improved the soil water content during the grain filling stage the changes in soil water content indicated that the soil water deficit increased as the growing season progressed and during the grain filling stage the water deficit was highest level in i0 and i1 between the two years 2017 18 had a higher rainfall and lower et0 and the variation in soil water among the treatments was smaller than that in the 2016 17 season the average seasonal et was 346 0 414 8 and 440 6 mm in i0 i1 and i2 in 2016 17 and 298 9 374 9 and 394 9 mm in 2017 18 table 1 respectively seasonal et for i0 i1 and i2 met approximately 60 70 and 80 of the etp respectively for both seasons zhang et al 2008 indicated that winter wheat could achieve the highest yield under 84 etp therefore the i2 treatment in this study could be used as an optimized irrigation scheme 3 2 seasonal yield variation related to weather condition large seasonal weather variation existed during the two seasons which affected the grain production of winter wheat table 2 shows the average grain yield of ten cultivars in the i0 i1 and i2 treatments the average yield under i0 i1 and i2 in the 2016 17 season was 23 0 22 7 and 32 8 greater than that in the 2017 18 season sowing was delayed 14 days in 2017 18 due to heavy rainfall 93 7 mm before sowing which led to a decrease in temperature eventually resulting in a decline in tiller numbers and the spike numbers per area tables 2 and 3 the spike differentiation process between recovery and jointing period in the 2017 18 season was shortened due to higher temperature which reduced the seed numbers per spike fig 2 and table 3 compared with solar radiation and sunshine hour at grain filling stage in the 2016 17 season the two factors in the 2017 18 season were decreased by 33 4 and 34 1 respectively which caused the lower seed weight table 3 the yield potential of winter wheat was not fully achieved in the 2017 18 season which reduced the yield difference among cultivars table s2 3 3 grain yield and wue among the ten cultivars the fw regression model was used to compare the performance of different cultivars the mean environmental yield was the seasonal average grain yield of the 10 cultivars under each irrigation treatment the mean grain yield of the 10 cultivars was 6034 5 6767 4 and 7830 8 kg ha in the 2016 17 season for i0 i1 and i2 respectively and the values were 4647 1 5234 2 and 5342 2 kg ha respectively in the 2017 18 season fig 3 a b the yield difference among the three irrigation treatments was smaller in 2017 18 15 6 13 7 and 8 5 for the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively than in 2016 17 15 4 31 2 and 21 7 for the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively due to weather conditions fig 4 shows the regression lines of individual cultivar yield against the environmental mean yield the results indicated that the yield difference among cultivars was greater in high yielding environments grain yield 6500 kg ha than in low yielding environments grain yield 6500 kg ha there were genotype and environment interactions that affected grain production and the interactions mainly occurred under low yielding environments table 4 and fig 4 due to the small difference in grain production among the cultivars under low yielding environments the cultivars that produced significantly higher yields than those of other cultivars under high yielding environments should be prioritized the grain yield of some varieties outperformed others across a wide range of environments as shown in fig 4 among the 10 cultivars sy20 and nd399 could be taken as high yielding cultivars grain yields were 5 greater than the mean grain yield and gy5218 as a low yielding cultivar grain yield was 5 lower than the mean grain yield as indicated in fig 3 sy20 produced 5 1 32 5 and 18 7 higher yields than those of gy5218 in i0 i1 and i2 respectively in the high yielding season of 2016 17 and the values were reduced to 5 0 2 4 and 3 6 respectively in the low yielding season of 2017 18 nd399 had the highest grain yield in 2016 17 season but had relative low grain yield in 2017 18 indicating that nd399 could not well adapt to a wide range of environments the grain yield of other cultivars such as zm1062 jm22 and gy2018 was not outstanding in either high yielding or low yielding environments using less water to produce more grain is very important in regions with water shortages a significant positive linear relationship was found between wue and the grain yield among the 10 winter wheat cultivars as shown in supplemental fig s1 the process of breeding to select high yielding cultivars also improves wue the wue of sy20 was the highest among the 10 cultivars similar to its yield performance fig 3c d therefore selecting a high yielding cultivar not only improves grain production but also increases water productivity 3 4 correlation analysis of the grain yield with agronomic and physiological characteristics no significant correlation was found between yield with ct biomass lai leaf chlorophyll contents from jointing 30 59 stages to anthesis stages 60 69 table 5 shows that the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and the final above ground biomass played a key role in the final yield in a wide range of environments therefore the agronomic and physiological characteristics after anthesis were related to the final yield of different cultivars in a high yielding environment cultivars with relatively low ct values tended to produce higher yields than those with high ct values while in a low yielding environment the relationship between grain yield and ct disappeared table 5 and fig 5 a a significant relationship between grain yield and chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage was confirmed only in i1 and i2 in 2016 17 and in i1 in 2017 18 table 5 and fig 5b the increase in grain yield under a moderate water supply over that without irrigation might be partially attributed to the higher leaf chlorophyll contents during the grain filling stage there was large variation in the photosynthetic rate at anthesis and grain filling stages among the cultivars fig s2 the difference in kernel δ13c among cultivars was not significant table s3 no significant correlation between these physiological traits and grain yield was found in any environments seasonal et could not indicate the differences in grain yields among cultivars under the same growing conditions however cultivars with relatively low et tended to produce higher wue than that of cultivars with relatively high et table 6 a relatively long root length tended to result in a higher grain yield and wue in i2 in 2016 17 and 2017 18 the reasons for this might be related to the increase in the root water extraction capacity which could increase biomass no continuous significant relationship was confirmed between agronomic or physiological traits and grain yield and wue indicating that the difference among the cultivars was affected by many factors and a single factor may not sufficiently capture this difference 3 5 crop characteristics related to the high yielding potential of the cultivars table 5 indicates that some characteristics had a closer relationship with yield in the high yielding season than in the low yielding season biomass production was the major factor determining the final yield a further comparison of the two cultivars with the highest yield and the lowest yield showed that the difference in biomass production existed during the whole growing period under i1 and i2 treatments fig 6 post anthesis dry matter contributed to more than 90 of grain production in both cultivars the high yielding cultivar had higher contributions from post anthesis dry matter production than from pre anthesis dry matter production therefore improving post anthesis dry matter might be a major factor that should be considered when breeding high yielding cultivars the grain filling duration of winter wheat was limited in the ncp the current winter wheat cultivars did not differ significantly in their flowering time fig s3 therefore varieties that had a high photosynthesis capacity during the grain filling stage would be desirable due to their potential to produce a higher yield this capacity would be related to greenness maintenance as well as the soil water uptake ability during the grain filling stage under limited water supply conditions table 5 shows that a relatively high leaf chlorophyll content during the grain filling stage had a positive correlation with the final grain yield the soil water uptake ability at the late growing stages of the crop i e when the whole soil profile became relatively dry would depend on the root distribution in the deep soil layer and the water use strategies of the crop under a limited water supply if the water use during vegetative growth was reduced more water in the soil profile would be available during the grain filling stage the higher water uptake ability would result in a lower ct and fig 5 clearly indicates this correlation although the difference in total root length among cultivars was not significant at maturity the different cultivars had different water uptake abilities for example prior to early grain filling cultivar gy5218 consumed more soil water 104 9 mm than cultivar sy20 68 1 mm in the i1 treatment in the 2016 17 season for the 2 m soil profile in the i1 treatment the total amount of soil water extracted by the low yielding cultivar gy5218 was slightly higher than that extracted by the high yielding cultivar sy20 with the increase in soil water use during the grain filling stage especially in the 60 180 cm soil profile biomass production was enhanced thereby resulting in an increase in the transpiration rate and a low ct smaller root length density 0 8 cm cm3 in deep soil layer was a limiting factor which restricted the full utilization of soil water the increase in soil water use by sy20 during the grain filling stage might be related to its higher root length density in the 60 150 cm soil layer fig 7 3 6 testing for the desired characteristic in a large pool of cultivars the above analysis showed that ct during grain filling was a good indicator for selecting cultivars with a high yielding potential under limited water supply conditions this indicator was tested on the 32 cultivars in i1 in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons correlation analysis indicated that cultivars with relatively low cts during the grain filling stage performed better in the high yielding environment in the 2016 17 season than the other cultivars fig 8 while this relationship was not found in a low yielding environment in the 2017 18 season the unfavorable growing conditions in 2017 18 reduced the yield potential of high yielding cultivars resulting in smaller yield differences among the tested cultivars 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield performance of different cultivars drought during the young microspore stage of pollen development has a greater influence on grain number while drought during the anthesis and grain filling phases results in a reduction in grain size and a substantial decrease in the yield of winter wheat the set of 10 wheat cultivars tested in this work exhibited high variability in grain yield as well as physiological and agronomic traits yield variation among cultivars was 17 5 46 6 and 9 9 25 3 respectively in the 2016 17 and 2017 18 seasons under the three irrigation regimes and cultivars with a higher yield usually had a higher wue crop performance is controlled by both genotype and environment specifically compared with zm175 and gy5218 nd399 and sy20 were more sensitive to irrigation application and showed a significant increase in grain yield under i2 in a normal season 2016 17 some cultivars sy20 nd399 and zm1062 appeared to be better than the others in terms of grain yield in all treatments in both years fig 3 the results of this study were similar to those of keser et al 2017 and del pozo et al 2016 and their results also showed that cultivars had different performance responses to drought stress and large yield variation among cultivars crop performance is affected not only by genotype but also by environment it is desirable to use cultivars with high yielding potentials to improve grain production 4 2 dry matter allocation to grain yield the higher grain yield among cultivars was related to the higher biomass production consistent with previous findings dry matter accumulation is considered a selection criterion nakhforoosh et al 2016 prior to anthesis stem and spike growth influenced the assimilate supply to the spike while biomass reallocation and translocation i e the storage of dry matter in organs was also sensitive to drought cultivars with relatively high yields generally benefit from increased biomass production a small leaf area light leaves and high δ13c balota et al 2017 other studies indicated that dry matter translocation efficiency and spike stem ratio contributed the most to increased production in italian and spanish wheat álvaro et al 2008 in the current study the results showed that the post anthesis biomass accumulation contributed the most to final grain yield post anthesis dry matter accumulation was mainly controlled by root water uptake and post anthesis physiological processes the results from this study showed that high yielding cultivars had a higher ratio of water consumption during the grain filling stage which favored dry matter accumulation during this growth period in the ncp due to the rapid temperature increase at the late growth stages of winter wheat the grain filling stage of winter wheat lasted approximately only one month although the grain filling duration was short 90 of the grain yield was from dry matter production during this period therefore cultivar characteristics favoring dry matter production after anthesis would be desirable under limited water supply water consumption to the root zone profile was relatively high and usually during the grain filling stage soil water contents became quite low fig 1 cultivars that could efficiently utilize stored soil water in the deep soil profile would maintain photosynthesis capacity longer and produce more post anthesis dry matter for yield formation than cultivars that could not efficiently utilize stored water saradadevi et al 2015 4 3 morphological and physiological traits of high yielding cultivars at the leaf level a higher photosynthetic rate which depends on the leaf chlorophyll platform is the main driving force for increased dry matter assimilation organ formation and crop yield under drought stress hlaváčová et al 2018 the results from this study did not show a consistent correlation of leaf photosynthetic rate with grain production among the cultivars in either season recently released cultivars have been bred for various traits in addition to photosynthetic performance makino 2011 the leaf photosynthetic rate was also affected by the leaf surface light intensity general plant health and developmental stages richards 2000 feng et al 2014 photosynthesis at a single leaf level may not be able to determine the total photosynthesis capacity at the canopy level richards 2000 leaf chlorophyll is not only a platform for photosynthetic machinery but also regarded as a stay green trait reflecting the dynamics of leaf greenness subudhi et al 2000 the stay green phenotype indicated the underlying genotypic driver of assimilation and the ability of nitrogen uptake and remobilization but also reflected root water uptake ability rebetzke et al 2016 the results of this study showed that the leaf chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage had a positive correlation with the final yield among the cultivars tested and two seasons under the moderate irrigation treatment the results of this study agreed with those of the report of lopes and reynolds 2012 this characteristic could be partially explained by the soil water uptake ability under limited water supply a high soil water uptake ability supplied the water needed to maintain the photosynthetic capacity ultimately enhancing the potential biomass and grain yield fischer et al 1998 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013a cultivars maintaining relatively high transpiration rates under limited water supply conditions usually exhibit high root water uptake ability and high leaf photosynthesis rates the results from this study indicated that ct at the grain filling stage was negatively correlated with grain yield the nonsignificant correlation of ct with yield during other growth stages might be because during these other growing stages soil water contents were relatively high and could meet the water requirements of the crop fig 1 under limited water supply conditions the accumulated water use resulted in a relatively dry soil profile during grain filling in the ncp the ability to maintain a low ct was related to the root water uptake ability a strong association between a low ct and increased rooting depth was observed among wheat cultivars particularly during the grain filling stage reynolds et al 2006 pinter et al 1990 amani et al 1996 according to li et al 2019 cultivars with a relatively low ct had a deeper rooting system 6 2 8 1 cm than those with a higher ct in a set of 646 genotypes in australia drought tolerant wheat cultivars were able to extract more water from deeper soil profiles in dryland environments than drought susceptible cultivars thapa et al 2016 in the current study cultivar sy20 had a lower ct than cultivar gy5218 in the 2016 17 season thus the high yielding sy20 cultivar had the characteristic of a deep root system which allows the plant to extract more water available for grain filling zaman allah et al 2011 ct could be used to distinguish the difference in grain yield among cultivars under rainfed conditions fang et al 2017b the polygenic basis underpinning ct has revealed the improvement of trait heritability thus screening for ct within a breeding program is important rebetzke et al 2012 the δ13c in kernels has a significant positive relationship with grain yield as growing conditions improve good growing conditions could favor soil water uptake to increase leaf stomal conductance and photosynthetic capacity thereby improving the fixation assimilation and remobilization of carbohydrates to the grains medina et al 2019 previous studies have shown that whether the relationship between kernel δ13c and grain yield is positive or negative depends on soil water availability del pozo et al 2016 medina et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 some studies also found that the genetic variation in grain δ13c resulting from carboxylation by rubisco and co2 diffusion to the chloroplast depended on some physiological processes baruah et al 2017 in this study the relationship between δ13c and grain yield under various soil water conditions was not significant which was different from previous studies the reasons might be that the pool of ten cultivars was small and the growth conditions did not allow for the full expression of the δ13c characteristic among the cultivars 5 conclusion large variations in grain yield among cultivars were observed selecting a good cultivar has the potential to improve grain production as well as water productivity under the growing conditions of the ncp a high yielding cultivar could be screened through the traits of a relatively low ct at the grain filling stage and a high leaf chlorophyll content at the late grain filling stage under water limited conditions these two factors were closely related to the high soil water uptake ability and the strategy of allowing for more water consumption during the gain filling stage due to the high contribution of dry matter production to final grain yield after anthesis therefore a low ct and high chlorophyll content could be used as indicators in high yielding environments for selecting traits of winter wheat cultivars

10452,furrow irrigation in cotton growing vertosols is the most preferred method in australia after fertilisation irrigation water interacts with the soil which can dissolve nitrogen n compounds into the run off water the run off or tail water that leaves the field is enriched with n and can reduce crop n use efficiency during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 n solute concentration in the irrigation water and run off was measured in a tillage cropping rotation experiment in the continuous cotton treatments 2014 2015 when urea was broadcast on the surface of furrow irrigated cotton system 11 of the applied fertiliser 260 kg n ha 1 was lost from the field in the tail water most of the losses from the soil occurred during the first irrigation as nitrate and urea the irrigation water supplied 10 kg dissolved organic nitrogen don kg n ha 1 to the field during 2015 2016 when subsurface banding of the urea was used losses equated to 5 of applied n in irrigated continuous cotton treatments in a second crop treatment an irrigated maize rotation the broadcasted urea was leached into the soil by rainfall before a 100 mm irrigation event the run off losses were less than the sub surface urea banding and in this treatment were 0 5 of the applied fertiliser the study shows that don n no3 n nh4 n urea n are dissolved from the soil in cotton production systems and lost to furrow irrigation run off this dissolved n maybe denitrified in the cotton irrigation network if the tail water is not reused quickly the results show that n contributions from irrigation water need to be accounted for overall n budget of the cotton farm to improve the n use efficiency keywords fertiliser run off irrigation nitrogen cotton 1 introduction it has been estimated that the global average riverine flux of nitrogen n in 2008 was 34 5 tg n yr 1 which represented 23 of the applied n to agriculture fields being lost to river flow schlesinger 2008 the export of nitrogen n from agricultural fields has long been recognised as causing water quality decline with associated ecological impacts beman et al 2005 contributing to lower nitrogen use efficiency and lower yields in field rochester et al 1993 and contributing to global warming through indirect nitrous oxide n2o n emissions turner et al 2015 macdonald et al 2016 in australian cotton gossypium hirsutum l production systems detailed studies about n run off are limited some studies do exist that examine the effect of irrigation practice on n run off mchugh et al 2008 found in a two year study where the fertiliser was surface applied that n export was significantly greater for furrow 15 1 kg n ha 1 relative to subsurface drip irrigation 2 9 kg n ha 1 these fluxes represent 7 and 3 of the applied fertiliser 250 kg n ha 1 internationally ebrahimian et al 2012 in a fertigation trial in pakistan reported run off nitrate no3 n losses of 19 kg n ha 1 and 26 kg n ha 1 during two fertigation events in an furrow irrigated cotton field which represented 26 and 32 of the inflow fertiliser similar to the global average n loss in 2013 nitrogen rates for irrigated cotton in australia ranged between 93 370 kg n ha 1 roth rural 2014 and based on the run off factor derived by mchugh et al 2008 losses in the order of 7 40 kg ha 1 could be expected in australian cotton production systems fertiliser the run off water is captured and reused on farm thus the n lost from the field can be recycled if applied back to the field before it is lost from the irrigation network through percolation denitrification or stored in the sediments the retention of fertiliser and soil derived n in the field is an option that can be employed by the growers to improve crop nitrogen use efficiency while mchugh et al 2008 showed that drip irrigation could potentially reduce n run off losses in cotton production systems the installation cost can be prohibitive a number of studies in irrigated maize production systems have indicated that removing the fertiliser from the wheel track and irrigation furrow and banding or basal application near the plant line silburn and hunter 2009 siyal et al 2012 or by disconnecting the irrigation water from the fertiliser bed benjamin et al 1998 lehrsch et al 2000 2001 or improve irrigation efficiency would significantly reduce n losses in this study we measured the flux of n from two different urea n fertiliser applications from split broadcast yr1 to a split drilled practice yr2 further there is a growing recognition in the literature that dissolved organic n don urea n no3 n and an ammonium n nh4 n are equally important components in agriculture production waters and soils mulvaney and bremner 1979 van kessel et al 2009v davis et al 2016 the objective of this research was to quantify the impact of fertilizer timing and method on n load and n composition of irrigation water and runoff water for furrow irrigated cotton and maize 2 methods 2 1 field site and trial experimental design this monitoring measurement project was conducted in a long term tillage crop rotation experiment located at the australian cotton research institute acri near narrabri in northern new south wales 149 27 e 30 18 s acri is within the namoi catchment and the climate is semi arid with a mild winter and a hot summer fig 2 the mean annual rainfall is 593 mm and summer cotton production often requires 6 7 additional 100 mm irrigations over the season the irrigation water is typically sourced from surface water supplied via the naomi river however when surface water allocations are reduced due to drought groundwater is used the soil at the experimental site is deep uniform grey clay and was classified as a fine thermic montmorillonitic typic haplustert soil survey staff 1996 particle size distribution in the 0 00 0 30 m depth is 53 g 100 g clay 2 μm 21 g 100 g silt 2 20 μm and 26 g 100 g sand 20 μm 2 mm the surface soil is slightly alkaline ph 7 2 but this varies when the irrigation water is switched between surface and ground water supplies the soil at the site is described in detail by ringrose voase and nadelko 2006 and hulugalle et al 2012 the long term tillage crop rotation experiment was conducted in a split plot design the difference between treatments was based on tillage crop rotation and historical management the long term tillage crop rotation experiment which had

defoliated late march to early when at least 60 of bolls were opened picking of cotton occurs in april or early may every year using mechanical four row cotton picker which measured harvested mass hulugalle et al 2020 the lint yield was calculated from the lint turnout determined for each treatment maize seeds pioneer p1467 were planted 6 7 seeds m2 or 20 kg ha 1 as per treatment schedule maize

planted in 2015 winter urea was applied to wheat before sowing at a rate of 20 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg n ha 1 subsequently during later july or early august the wheat was harvested in nov 2015 and maize was planted over wheat standing stubble the other wheat fallow cotton treatment was left fallow from nov dec 2015 2 2 irrigation management cotton and maize crops were irrigated at an average rate of 1 ml ha 1 subject to water rainfall and soil water content the total irrigation volumes mm across all the treatments are presented in table 2 the first irrigation for cotton maize was done immediately after planting the subsequent irrigations were scheduled 5 6 weeks after first irrigation for cotton and subsequent irrigations were done every two weeks subject rainfall 2 3 runoff and irrigation water sampling san dimas flumes 200 mm wilm et al 1936 were used to measure the runoff volume from each treatment the galvanized steel flumes were manufactured as per standard specifications outlined by walkowiak 2008 two flumes were installed in head end of the field and six flumes were installed in the tail end of the cotton maize rows fig 1 outside the actual cropping area runoff water from four inter rows in each treatment were directed into the flume for flow measurement and sample collection nachimuthu et al 2018 the standard flow calibration equation for converting flow height into flow discharge for a 200 mm san dimas flume is 1 q 0 053 h 1 34 where q l s 1 is discharge and h is water height in the flume mm the flow height is measured using a teledyne isco 730 bubbler module connected to a teledyne isco 6712 standard portable water sampler which logs the flow height in minute intervals the module uses a differential pressure transducer and a flow of bubbles to measure liquid levels to determine flow height the samplers were programmed to flow weighted based sampling module to capture the representative sample of entire runoff or irrigation event after each runoff event samples were collected and transported to lab next day morning the irrigation efficiency is the ratio of the amount of infiltrated water to applied water 2 4 electrical conductivity dissolved

and min till cwm were 10 19 bales ha 1 in 2015 16 the cotton yield for minimum and maximum tillage treatments were 9 31 and 9 46 bales ha 1 during both the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 seasons the irrigation efficiency in the cotton crops was above 65 68 and 70 respectively but less than the 75 efficiency target table 2 during 2014 2015 seven irrigations were measured in the cotton phase which produced 257 mm run off during 2015 2016 seven irrigations measured in the continuous cotton treatments which produced 233 mm run off over the course of the irrigation season 1 5 t tds ha 1 2014 2015 and 0 5 t tds ha 1 2015 2016 were added to the field from the irrigation water the irrigation efficiency was only 50 in the maize treatments in 2015 2016 and 257 mm run off occurred during the season 3 2 total seasonal n field flux 3 2 1 continuous cotton when the fertiliser was applied as a surface broadcast 2014 2015 11 of the n was lost to run off compared to only 5 n in the subsurface banding method 2015 2016 fig 3 a similar effect has been shown in fallow short term rainfall simulator and fertiliser placement experiments in grain production systems baker and laflen 1982 mostaghimi et al 1991 the n loss in the subsurface banding application method was similar to the loss measured in the drip irrigation study by mchugh et al 2008 whereas the surface broadcast application is greater but both are lower than the global n run off lost estimate schlesinger 2008 the n run off efficiency factor however may not be constant and will change at different fertiliser rates or environmental conditions there was no evidence of increased n flux after the midseason broadcast n application in the cotton cropping systems during either measurement year figs 4 and 5 this may be due to the reduced rate relative to the early season application table 1 3 2 2 maize despite having the same application method as the continuous cotton 2014 2015 the loss of n from the maize treatments 2015 2016 was 0 kg n ha 1 compared to 16 kg n ha 1 in case of the continuous cotton 2014 2015 the fertiliser was broadcast the day before a 100 mm irrigation event with the aim of reducing the ammonia volatilisation loss by washing the fertiliser into the soil inadvertently this also resulted in run off n losses the maize fertiliser application in 2015 2016 occurred on the morning of 21 12 2015 and on 23 12 2015 3 6 mm rainfall occurred further rain occurred on the 25 12 2015 7 2 mm and 27 12 2015 15 4 mm before a 100 mm irrigation on the 31 12 2015 acri weather station http www weather cottassist com au these light rainfall events moved the n deeper into the soil and it wasn t available to interact with the subsequent irrigation water at the soil surface the apparent rainfall tillage and placement effects are evident in the flux fig 4 for both the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 years relative to the continuous cotton fig 3 3 2 3 total season n input from the irrigation water the n content of the irrigation water 12 and 11 kg n ha 1 entered the field in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively during the 2014 15 season the irrigation water supplied 5 6 kg don n ha 1 to the field over the season in 2015 16 the irrigation water supply 1 kg don n to the field there may be variations in n loading in the irrigation water due to a number of causes the 2015 2016 irrigation water was sourced from groundwater whereas in the preceding season the namoi river was the source this is reflected in the variation in tds added to the field between the two measurement years in both cases the tail water was reused and mixed with the irrigation water water restrictions in 2015 2016 reduced the farm water allocation and subsequently the planting area was also reduced at the research station this resulted in less n use on the farm and hence less fertiliser n and soil don was probably lost from the fields in the run off water 3 3 seasonal n composition and timing during the 2014 2015 cotton season when the fertiliser was surface broadcast the urea n and don n flux was as important as the no3 n flux figs 3 4 the average of all the measured tillage treatments shows that the urea loss is large in surface broadcast fertiliser fig 4 urea n and no3 n flux are similar between the field average and the continuous cotton treatments the urea n fertiliser during the first irrigation was on the surface and was able to be dissolved and a proportion flushed out of the field as urea fig 5 in systems such as this where the fertiliser is in contact with the irrigation water n movement and losses have been shown to occur lehrsch et al 2000 2001 during subsequent irrigation the urea n flux fig 5f returns to background whilst the no3 n flux returns to background by the third irrigation fig 5e again the n composition varies between each irrigation and these composition changes are an integration of the whole of farm operations irrigation 1 occurs early in the season when there is an excess of field n post fertilisation which is washed into the irrigation network during transit and storage the n present in the tail water is utilised by microbes and converted to organic n and no3 n which is then present in the measured irrigation water figs 5b and 6 b the don n present in the first irrigation tail water is from the decomposing cotton maize or wheat residues and conversion of the urea n and don production by microbial activity in the water column in 2014 2015 the irrigation water supplied 12 kg don n ha 1 to the soil in irrigations 1 and 2 in 2015 2016 the irrigation water did contribute to the net soil nitrogen balance at the end of the season it appears that the subsurface banding of the urea into the soil not only reduced the amount of n exported but also altered its composition figs 5 7 there was a reduction in the flux of no3 n due to the burial of urea which a similar finding to lembi et al 1985 who found that the deeper placement of n fertiliser greatly reduced the flux on no3 n in the 2015 2016 continuous cotton plots the no3 n flux was the largest component of the overall n loss and urea n was a very small component the urea n flux 0 1 kg n ha 1 was an order of magnitude less than the urea n flux 8 kg n ha 1 in 2014 2015 fig 3 the urea flux from the maize was 0 kg n ha 1 fig 7 due to the rainfall dissolving the fertiliser and its subsequent conversion to don nh4 n and no3 n over the course of the season no3 n is exported from mid november 2015 through to late february 2016 and this probably

10452,furrow irrigation in cotton growing vertosols is the most preferred method in australia after fertilisation irrigation water interacts with the soil which can dissolve nitrogen n compounds into the run off water the run off or tail water that leaves the field is enriched with n and can reduce crop n use efficiency during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 n solute concentration in the irrigation water and run off was measured in a tillage cropping rotation experiment in the continuous cotton treatments 2014 2015 when urea was broadcast on the surface of furrow irrigated cotton system 11 of the applied fertiliser 260 kg n ha 1 was lost from the field in the tail water most of the losses from the soil occurred during the first irrigation as nitrate and urea the irrigation water supplied 10 kg dissolved organic nitrogen don kg n ha 1 to the field during 2015 2016 when subsurface banding of the urea was used losses equated to 5 of applied n in irrigated continuous cotton treatments in a second crop treatment an irrigated maize rotation the broadcasted urea was leached into the soil by rainfall before a 100 mm irrigation event the run off losses were less than the sub surface urea banding and in this treatment were 0 5 of the applied fertiliser the study shows that don n no3 n nh4 n urea n are dissolved from the soil in cotton production systems and lost to furrow irrigation run off this dissolved n maybe denitrified in the cotton irrigation network if the tail water is not reused quickly the results show that n contributions from irrigation water need to be accounted for overall n budget of the cotton farm to improve the n use efficiency keywords fertiliser run off irrigation nitrogen cotton 1 introduction it has been estimated that the global average riverine flux of nitrogen n in 2008 was 34 5 tg n yr 1 which represented 23 of the applied n to agriculture fields being lost to river flow schlesinger 2008 the export of nitrogen n from agricultural fields has long been recognised as causing water quality decline with associated ecological impacts beman et al 2005 contributing to lower nitrogen use efficiency and lower yields in field rochester et al 1993 and contributing to global warming through indirect nitrous oxide n2o n emissions turner et al 2015 macdonald et al 2016 in australian cotton gossypium hirsutum l production systems detailed studies about n run off are limited some studies do exist that examine the effect of irrigation practice on n run off mchugh et al 2008 found in a two year study where the fertiliser was surface applied that n export was significantly greater for furrow 15 1 kg n ha 1 relative to subsurface drip irrigation 2 9 kg n ha 1 these fluxes represent 7 and 3 of the applied fertiliser 250 kg n ha 1 internationally ebrahimian et al 2012 in a fertigation trial in pakistan reported run off nitrate no3 n losses of 19 kg n ha 1 and 26 kg n ha 1 during two fertigation events in an furrow irrigated cotton field which represented 26 and 32 of the inflow fertiliser similar to the global average n loss in 2013 nitrogen rates for irrigated cotton in australia ranged between 93 370 kg n ha 1 roth rural 2014 and based on the run off factor derived by mchugh et al 2008 losses in the order of 7 40 kg ha 1 could be expected in australian cotton production systems fertiliser the run off water is captured and reused on farm thus the n lost from the field can be recycled if applied back to the field before it is lost from the irrigation network through percolation denitrification or stored in the sediments the retention of fertiliser and soil derived n in the field is an option that can be employed by the growers to improve crop nitrogen use efficiency while mchugh et al 2008 showed that drip irrigation could potentially reduce n run off losses in cotton production systems the installation cost can be prohibitive a number of studies in irrigated maize production systems have indicated that removing the fertiliser from the wheel track and irrigation furrow and banding or basal application near the plant line silburn and hunter 2009 siyal et al 2012 or by disconnecting the irrigation water from the fertiliser bed benjamin et al 1998 lehrsch et al 2000 2001 or improve irrigation efficiency would significantly reduce n losses in this study we measured the flux of n from two different urea n fertiliser applications from split broadcast yr1 to a split drilled practice yr2 further there is a growing recognition in the literature that dissolved organic n don urea n no3 n and an ammonium n nh4 n are equally important components in agriculture production waters and soils mulvaney and bremner 1979 van kessel et al 2009v davis et al 2016 the objective of this research was to quantify the impact of fertilizer timing and method on n load and n composition of irrigation water and runoff water for furrow irrigated cotton and maize 2 methods 2 1 field site and trial experimental design this monitoring measurement project was conducted in a long term tillage crop rotation experiment located at the australian cotton research institute acri near narrabri in northern new south wales 149 27 e 30 18 s acri is within the namoi catchment and the climate is semi arid with a mild winter and a hot summer fig 2 the mean annual rainfall is 593 mm and summer cotton production often requires 6 7 additional 100 mm irrigations over the season the irrigation water is typically sourced from surface water supplied via the naomi river however when surface water allocations are reduced due to drought groundwater is used the soil at the experimental site is deep uniform grey clay and was classified as a fine thermic montmorillonitic typic haplustert soil survey staff 1996 particle size distribution in the 0 00 0 30 m depth is 53 g 100 g clay 2 μm 21 g 100 g silt 2 20 μm and 26 g 100 g sand 20 μm 2 mm the surface soil is slightly alkaline ph 7 2 but this varies when the irrigation water is switched between surface and ground water supplies the soil at the site is described in detail by ringrose voase and nadelko 2006 and hulugalle et al 2012 the long term tillage crop rotation experiment was conducted in a split plot design the difference between treatments was based on tillage crop rotation and historical management the long term tillage crop rotation experiment which had

rotation system was designated as the main plot treatments and maize as sub plot treatment replicated four times in plots 190 m long and 8 24 rows the runoff flumes and automatic water samplers were installed in the first replication of each treatment cotton is usually planted seed rate 18 kg ha 1 in october every year as per treatment schedule in 2015 var sicot71 brf was planted and in 2014 liberty link sicot 70 bl was planted cotton received fertiliser n as urea surface applied as two splits 180 kg n ha 1 at planting and 80 kg nha 1 2 5 months after planting in 2014 15 season in 2015 season urea was drilled 180 kg n ha 1 into bed 10 cm deep before sowing on either side of the planting row an additional 80 kg n ha 1 of urea was broadcast to cotton in mid jan 2016 cotton plants were defoliated late march to early when at least 60 of bolls were opened picking of cotton occurs in april or early may every year using mechanical four row cotton picker which measured harvested mass hulugalle et al 2020 the lint yield was calculated from the lint turnout determined for each treatment maize seeds pioneer p1467 were planted 6 7 seeds m2 or 20 kg ha 1 as per treatment schedule maize treatments received fertiliser n as urea surface applied 260 kg n ha 1 maize crop was irrigated at an average rate of 1 ml ha 1 subject to water rainfall and soil water content wheat var crusader is planted in 2015 winter urea was applied to wheat before sowing at a rate of 20 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg n ha 1 subsequently during later july or early august the wheat was harvested in nov 2015 and maize was planted over wheat standing stubble the other wheat fallow cotton treatment was left fallow from nov dec 2015 2 2 irrigation management cotton and maize crops were irrigated at an average rate of 1 ml ha 1 subject to water rainfall and soil water content the total irrigation volumes mm across all the treatments are presented in table 2 the first irrigation for cotton maize was done immediately after planting the subsequent irrigations were scheduled 5 6 weeks after first irrigation for cotton and subsequent irrigations were done every two weeks subject rainfall 2 3 runoff and irrigation water sampling san dimas flumes 200 mm wilm et al 1936 were used to measure the runoff volume from each treatment the galvanized steel flumes were manufactured as per standard specifications outlined by walkowiak 2008 two flumes were installed in head end of the field and six flumes were installed in the tail end of the cotton maize rows fig 1 outside the actual cropping area runoff water from four inter rows in each treatment were directed into the flume for flow measurement and sample collection nachimuthu et al 2018 the standard flow calibration equation for converting flow height into flow discharge for a 200 mm san dimas flume is 1 q 0 053 h 1 34 where q l s 1 is discharge and h is water height in the flume mm the flow height is measured using a teledyne isco 730 bubbler module connected to a teledyne isco 6712 standard portable water sampler which logs the flow height in minute intervals the module uses a differential pressure transducer and a flow of bubbles to measure liquid levels to determine flow height the samplers were programmed to flow weighted based sampling module to capture the representative sample of entire runoff or irrigation event after each runoff event samples were collected and transported to lab next day morning the irrigation efficiency is the ratio of the amount of infiltrated water to applied water 2 4 electrical conductivity dissolved organic and mineral nitrogen analysis electrical conductivity ds m 1 of the surface run off was measured in the field using a tps wp81 tps brendale qld and a k 10 gk series conductivity sensor in the

bremner 1970 both sample tubes were stored below 4 c and returned to the laboratory for analysis within 3 days of collection nitrate nitrite n nox n and ammonium n were analysed simultaneously on separate channels with the cadmium reduction method method 4500 nitrate e rice et al 2012 and with the alkaline phenol method method 4500 ammonia f rice et al 2012 total nitrogen tn was analysed on a

and min till cwm were 10 19 bales ha 1 in 2015 16 the cotton yield for minimum and maximum tillage treatments were 9 31 and 9 46 bales ha 1 during both the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 seasons the irrigation efficiency in the cotton crops was above 65 68 and 70 respectively but less than the 75 efficiency target table 2 during 2014 2015 seven irrigations were measured in the cotton phase which produced 257 mm run off during 2015 2016 seven irrigations measured in the continuous cotton treatments which produced 233 mm run off over the course of the irrigation season 1 5 t tds ha 1 2014 2015 and 0 5 t tds ha 1 2015 2016 were added to the field from the irrigation water the irrigation efficiency was only 50 in the maize treatments in 2015 2016 and 257 mm run off occurred during the season 3 2 total seasonal n field flux 3 2 1 continuous cotton when the fertiliser was applied as a surface broadcast 2014 2015 11 of the n was lost to run off compared to only 5 n in the subsurface banding method 2015 2016 fig 3 a similar effect has been shown in fallow short term rainfall simulator and fertiliser placement experiments in grain production systems baker and laflen 1982 mostaghimi et al 1991 the n loss in the subsurface banding application method was similar to the loss measured in the drip irrigation study by mchugh et al 2008 whereas the surface broadcast application is greater but both are lower than the global n run off lost estimate schlesinger 2008 the n run off efficiency factor however may not be constant and will change at different fertiliser rates or environmental conditions there was no evidence of increased n flux after the midseason broadcast n application in the cotton cropping systems during either measurement year figs 4 and 5 this may be due to the reduced rate relative to the early season application table 1 3 2 2 maize despite having the same application method as the continuous cotton 2014 2015 the loss of n from the maize treatments 2015 2016 was 0 kg n ha 1 compared to 16 kg n ha 1 in case of the continuous cotton 2014 2015 the fertiliser was broadcast the day before a 100 mm irrigation event with the aim of reducing the ammonia volatilisation loss by washing the fertiliser into the soil inadvertently this also resulted in run off n losses the maize fertiliser application in 2015 2016 occurred on the morning of 21 12 2015 and on 23 12 2015 3 6 mm rainfall occurred further rain occurred on the 25 12 2015 7 2 mm and 27 12 2015 15 4 mm before a 100 mm irrigation on the 31 12 2015 acri weather station http www weather cottassist com au these light rainfall events moved the n deeper into the soil and it wasn t available to interact with the subsequent irrigation water at the soil surface the apparent rainfall tillage and placement effects are evident in the flux fig 4 for both the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 years relative to the continuous cotton fig 3 3 2 3 total season n input from the irrigation water the n content of the irrigation water 12 and 11 kg n ha 1 entered the field in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively during the 2014 15 season the irrigation water supplied 5 6 kg don n ha 1 to the field over the season in 2015 16 the irrigation water supply 1 kg don n to the field there may be variations in n loading in the irrigation water due to a number of causes the 2015 2016 irrigation water was sourced from groundwater whereas in the preceding season the namoi river was the source this is reflected in the variation in tds added to the field between the two measurement years in both cases the tail water was reused and mixed with the irrigation water water restrictions in 2015 2016 reduced the farm water allocation and subsequently the planting area was also reduced at the research station this resulted in less n use on the farm and hence less fertiliser n and soil don was probably lost from the fields in the run off water 3 3 seasonal n composition and timing during the 2014 2015 cotton season when the fertiliser was surface broadcast the urea n and don n flux was as important as the no3 n flux figs 3 4 the average of all the measured tillage treatments shows that the urea loss is large in surface broadcast fertiliser fig 4 urea n and no3 n flux are similar between the field average and the continuous cotton treatments the urea n fertiliser during the first irrigation was on the surface and was able to be dissolved and a proportion flushed out of the field as urea fig 5 in systems such as this where the fertiliser is in contact with the irrigation water n movement and losses have been shown to occur lehrsch et al 2000 2001 during subsequent irrigation the urea n flux fig 5f returns to background whilst the no3 n flux returns to background by the third irrigation fig 5e again the n composition varies between each irrigation and these composition changes are an integration of the whole of farm operations irrigation 1 occurs early in the season when there is an excess of field n post fertilisation which is washed into the irrigation network during transit and storage the n present in the tail water is utilised by microbes and converted to organic n and no3 n which is then present in the measured irrigation water figs 5b and 6 b the don n present in the first irrigation tail water is from the decomposing cotton maize or

10453,the impact of global warming on water and nitrate losses from a rainfed canola cropping system under various artificial drainage systems was assessed using an integrated field modeling approach four subsurface drainage systems with different drain depths dx and spacings ly including d0 90l30 d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and bilevel with a drain spacing of 15 m and alternate drain depths of 0 65 and 0 90 m were considered the hydrus 2d 3d model was first calibrated and validated using data collected for all drainage systems during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 canola cropping cycles respectively and then applied to simulate water nitrate losses for different drainage systems under meteorological conditions predicted assuming expected future global warming future weather data were downscaled from 20 general circulation models and four rcp scenarios for the mid 21st century for 2041 2070 the model capability of representing experimental field data was evaluated using the mean bias error mbe the

nitrate fluxes compared to the base case this will result in an increase of 4 125 in seasonal nitrate losses from various drainage systems with the lowest and highest projections for the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 systems respectively the hydrus simulated results indicate that the d0 65l15 system is environmentally safer than the other evaluated drainage systems for predicted global warming conditions

and increasing global scarcity of blue fresh water wwap 2009 hoekstra et al 2012 on the other hand indicate that it is essential to expand rainfed agriculture in the world in this regard humid regions may be of higher importance since they receive a sufficient quantity of precipitation to fully supply crop s water requirements by green from rainfall water shahsavari et al 2019 however expanding dry land farming in these regions may be restricted by waterlogging problems which occasionally occur after heavy rainfalls and particularly in heavy soils darzi naftchali et al 2017 waterlogging threatens the year round cropping resulting in considerable areas either going out of production or experiencing reduced yields darzi naftchali et al 2013 under such circumstances installing subsurface drainage systems may help in providing suitable conditions for winter crops based cropping systems and consequently improving the annual productivity of these lands subsurface drainage systems can speed up the water table drawdown and provide better aeration during the growing season while being beneficial in terms of the water table control installed drainage systems may cause serious environmental challenges due to their negative impacts on nutrient leaching previous researchers have demonstrated that drainage systems may accelerate the leaching process of soil nutrients and in particular of nitrogen n kalita et al 2006 furukawa et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 darzi naftchali et al 2017 which is well known to be an essential crop nutrient affecting crop growth and yield

field management practices improving field management practices may increase the water nutrient holding capacity of the soil and thus reduce water and n losses azooz and arshad 1996 de vita et al 2007 triplett and dick 2008 udayasoorian et al 2009 constantin et al 2010 mitchell et al 2012 liu et al 2013 phogat et al 2013 chukalla et al 2017 drainage fluxes represent a dominant factor for water and n losses from drained areas among various influencing factors climatic variables including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 play key roles in determining the rate of drainage fluxes increased surplus precipitation defined as p et c may accelerate the rate of water and n losses due to enhanced drainage fluxes water and n losses from drained dry farming lands may become a more important concern in the future when predicted global warming which affects these climatic variables takes place numerous researchers have demonstrated various ranges of both negative as well as positive projections of climate change into p and et 0 in different parts of the world abbaspour et al 2009 dastoorani and poormohammadi 2012 terink et al 2013 agarwal et al 2014 kazemi rad and mohammadi 2015 karandish et al 2017 karandish and mousavi 2018 adham et al 2019 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 through such investigations earlier research has mainly focused on determining probable economic consequences of global warming on the agricultural sector due to the climate change impact on crop yields and productivity under different future greenhouse gas emission scenarios karandish et al 2016 harmsen et al 2009 massah bavani and morid 2005 predicting probable n losses under climate change conditions is essential because the byproduct of these losses is the pollution of water resources karandish and šimůnek 2017 due to n leaching drainage from agricultural lands zhu et al 2005 thompson et al 2007 dudley et al 2008 burow et al 2010 dahan et al 2014 karandish et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2017 this issue has higher importance in humid regions where a low recovery of n fertilizers by crops produces excessive n losses after heavy rains karandish and šimůnek 2017 although a few attempts have been made to investigate the effects of climate change on water and n losses in agricultural systems e g singh et al 2009 wang et al 2015 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 a literature review reveals that no such study has been carried out for subsurface drained paddy fields under winter rainfed cropping as such systems are in their infancy in northern iran paddy fields a comprehensive study of their behavior would enable policymakers to incorporate the effects of inherent complexities of climate change on drainage activities to protect the local environment therefore we carried out a field experiment to investigate water and n losses from a drained field cultivated with rainfed canola and with various subsurface drainage systems our research is novel since it is the first study in which environmental hazards in rainfed agriculture due to global warming are evaluated in terms of n losses from the field to the best of our knowledge our study assesses for the first time such hazards in fields with subsurface drainage systems the n dynamics under various climate change projections were assessed using the hydrus 2d 3d model from now on referred to simply as hydrus which was first calibrated and validated using the field collected data we used the hydrus model since its capability in capturing drainage and n fluxes has been previously confirmed by many researchers e g öztekin 2002 mirjat et al 2014 filipovic et al 2014 li et al 2014 mguidiche et al 2015 karandish and šimůnek 2016 mekala and nambi 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 matteau et al 2019 the main objectives of this research thus were i to calibrate and validate hydrus using experimental drainage and nitrate fluxes collected in a subsurface drained field cultivated with rainfed canola and ii to investigate the impact of climate change projections on key climatic variables drainage and nitrate fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trial 2 1 1 study area and drainage system layout the field research was carried out during two canola growing seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 in the subsurface drainage pilot of the sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university in the mazandaran province iran sanru 36 3 n 53 04 e 15 m below sea level fig 1 in 2011 this pilot was designed and implemented in a 4 5 ha consolidated paddy field darzi naftchali et al 2013 2018 darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 consisting of four subsurface drainage systems with different drain depths dx and spacings ly including d0 90l30 d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and bilevel which has a drain spacing of 15 m and alternate drain depths of 0 65 and 0 9 m fig 1 the field consisted of consolidated paddy plots 100 m long and 30 m wide considering the dimensions of the plots and the field size the drainage systems were installed at a scale much larger than the laboratory scale drainage installation costs at such a scale were very high and required a large area different drainage systems were not replicated due to limited resources and land the drainage pipes were installed so that the last drain line in each system acted as the first drain line in the adjacent system accordingly at least three drain lines were considered in each drainage system in addition the monitoring lines lines 2 4 5 7 and 9 in fig 1 for measuring drain discharge and water quality were selected to fully represent each drainage system by removing the buffering lines a detailed description of the drainage systems can be found in darzi naftchali et al 2013 2018 long term averages of annual precipitation mean temperature as well as minimum and maximum temperatures recorded in the study area are 616 mm and 17 3 c 6 c and 38 9 c respectively darzi naftchali et al 2018 the variation of climatic variables during the 2015 2016 the calibration period and 2016 2017 the validation period growing seasons is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 cropping system and data collection the area was under rice canola cropping during 2011 2017 with rice as a major crop and canola as a winter crop the data from the 2015 16 and 2016 17 canola growing seasons were used in the present study canola was cultivated in the two cropping cycles on october 3 in 2015 and on september 28 in 2016 crops were harvested on may 4 2016 and may 20 2017 all agricultural practices were the same as the conventional practices of local farmers in the study area in the growing season of 2015 2016 50 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate was applied before cultivation and 50 kg ha 1 of urea i e co nh2 2 with 46 n was applied 52 days after sowing das in the second growing season urea was applied at rates of 85 kg ha 1 85 kg ha 1 and 115 kg ha 1 at 24 96 and 116 dass respectively the growers in the region adjust fertilization based on their activities in the crop rotation for example remaining residues after the previous crop are considered by the experienced growers darzi naftchali et al 2017 before crop cultivation soil samples were collected every 30 cm to a depth of 200 cm to determine soil physical and hydraulic properties and the soil n content soil water characteristic curves of the soil samples were determined by measuring soil water contents at 14 different pressure heads varied in the range of 0 15 bars after that the retc model was applied to fit the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 to the observed retention data for each treatment two suction samplers were buried at depths of 30 cm and 60 cm beneath the surface before crop cultivation and remained continuously at 30 kpa the samplers had porous ceramic caps of 5 cm in diameter using the vacuum pump the leachate was then collected during the growing seasons once every two weeks nitrate concentrations of water samples were determined by spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach to determine daily variations in the soil water content swc during the cropping cycles a 100 cm long tdr probe trime fm imko germany was installed midway between drains in each subsurface drainage system i e 4 tdr probes were installed in the study area 1 probe 4 drainage systems tdr probes were used once a day to measure swc at a 15 cm interval during both growing seasons the accuracy of all tdr sensors was evaluated by comparing tdr measured swcs with corresponding values measured using the gravimetric method tdr measured swcs agreed well with gravimetrically measured swcs with a coefficient of determination of 95 water table depths were measured daily in observation wells that were dug out midway between adjacent drains in each drainage system free drainage management was adopted during canola growing seasons subsurface drainage discharges q were measured daily for all drainage systems as long as the flow was observed at the outlet of drains drain fluxes were measured by using partial flumes at the outlet of representative drains during drainage periods the total water discharge for a particular day is the sum of discharges over 24 h the above values were converted to water depths by dividing them with the plot area drainage water samples were taken every 15 days and several consecutive days after fertilization collected water samples were then analyzed to determine their nitrate concentrations 2 2 climate data under global warning the projections of future climate data were downscaled for four rcp scenarios the representative concentration pathways reported in the 5th ipcc report ipcc 2013 the rcp2 6 a low greenhouse gases emission scenario rcp4 5 an intermediate one rcp6 5 a high one and rcp8 5 a very high greenhouse gases emission scenario for each scenario the projections of air temperature minimum and maximum precipitation solar net radiation wind speed atmosphere pressure and relative humidity were generated using 20 different gcm models general circulation models table 1 for the future period of 2040 2070 and compared with the corresponding values obtained for the base period 1975 2005 the statistical downscaling approach was carried out based on the widely used change factor method jones et al 1997 for all climatic variables the change factor coefficients which determine the relationship between the current and future climatic variables were calculated based on eq 1 jones et al 1997 except for air temperature for which eq 2 was applied trzaska and schnarr 2014 1 δ p i p g c m f u t i p g c m b a s e i 2 δ t i t g c m f u t i t g c m b a s e i wheres δ p i is a dimensionless monthly change factor for a particular climatic variable p p g c m f u t i and p g c m b a s e i are monthly averages of future simulated and historical values of a considered climatic variable respectively δ t i is a dimensionless monthly change factor for air temperature and t g c m f u t i and t g c m b a s e i are monthly averages of future and historical values of air temperature respectively these change factors were calculated at a monthly time scale i 1 12 using generated climatic variables reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated using the penman monteith fao 56 equation pmf allen et al 1998 due to its global acceptability karandish et al 2017 et 0 was then used to estimate crop evapotranspiration as explained below 2 3 n dynamics under current and future conditions 2 3 1 the hydrus model 2 3 1 1 model description and governing equations soil water and n dynamics were simulated using the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2008 2016 the hydrus program numerically solves the richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow 3 θ h t x k h h x z k h h z k h z w u h x z where θ is the volumetric soil water content swc l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the soil water pressure head l x is the lateral coordinate l z is the vertical coordinate positive downwards t is time t and wu h x z is root water uptake t 1 which is calculated as follows 4 w u h x z γ h r d f x z w t p o t where γ h is the soil water stress response function dimensionless of feddes et al 1978 rdf is the normalized spatial root water uptake distribution l 2 tpot is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 and w is the width of the soil surface l associated with the transpiration process the stress response function was obtained from the hydrus database for maize šimůnek et al 2011 uniform root distribution was assumed in each soil layer the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships were used to model soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 the transport of nitrate no3 was modeled using the convection dispersion equation embedded in the hydrus model this equation is reported to be suitable for conservative solutes such as no3 5 θ c t x θ d x x c x θ d x z c z z θ d z z c z θ d z x c x q x c x q z c z s c where c is the no3 concentration in the liquid phase ml 3 qx and qz are the components of the volumetric flux density lt 1 dxx dzz and dxz are the components of the dispersion tensor l2t 1 bear 1972 sc is a sink term which generally includes local no3 uptake through a passive process mineralization microbial immobilization and denitrification ml 3t 1 the first term on the right side of eq 3 describes the solute flux due to dispersion the second term describes the solute flux due to convection with flowing water and the third term describes nutrient uptake by roots similarly as in other earlier studies e g ajdary et al 2007 wang et al 2010 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 mineralization gains were neglected due to the following reasons first the lack of organic matter om lmits the mineralization process in mineral soils i e soils with om 3 in the upper horizon huang et al 2009 cronologically as in our study the lack of om limits the mineralization process li et al 2003 deenik 2006 wijanarko 2015 second mineralization mainly occurs in coarse textured soils with low clay content while it decreases considerably as soil clay content increases karandish and šimůnek 2017 third the abundance of micropores in high clay soils causes a physical protection of oms from being microbially decomposed and mineralized deenik 2006 our frequent measurements also showed that no3 concentration in the soil were much higher than nh4 concentrations darzi naftchali et al 2016 only the no3 transport in the soil was thus considered in this research assuming that the input of n fertilizer in the form of urea was instantly nitrified into no3 this is similar to the assumptions made by many other researchers e g ajdary et al 2007 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 karandish and šimůnek 2017 who assumed that nitrification is faster than the other processes and nitrifying urea into no3 takes only a few days havlin et al 2006 in addition nitrification is reported to be stimulated in less organic om 3 finely textured soils with high clay content all of which are the cases in the current research we also considered that root n uptake was strictly passive which has also been assumed in many other studies e g hanson et al 2006 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 according to this assumption n uptake can be calculated by multiplying the local soil n concentration and root water uptake 2 3 1 2 flow domain and initial and boundary conditions the impermeable layer in the study area was located at a soil depth of 200 cm fig 3 hence the 2d transport domain was defined as a rectangle with a depth of 200 cm and a width of 30 m for d0 9l30 and d0 65l30 drainage systems and 15 m for the d0 65l15 and bi level drainage systems the drains are considered to be on the sides of the transport domain an unstructured triangular finite element mesh fem was used to discretize the defined transport domain a non uniform fem was generated by hydrus with finite element sizes gradually increasing with distance from the drains the entire transport domain was divided into six soil layers i e 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm 90 120 cm 120 150 cm and 150 200 cm soil depths for which different soil properties were defined to represent the high permeability of the backfilled drain trench gravel an additional soil layer was defined 10 cm around 10 cm below and 30 cm above the drains measured soil water contents in different soil layers were considered to represent initial conditions for water flow simulations the saturated soil water content was specified as an initial condition in soil layers below the water table to differentiate the saturated and unsaturated zones the atmospheric boundary condition defined using potential evaporation ep potential transpiration tp and precipitation p was applied at the top of the transport domain the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 was adopted to separate crop evapotranspiration e t c into ep and tp as follows 6 e t c k c e t 0 e p t p e p k e e t 0 t p k c b e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient k c b is the basal crop coefficient and k e is the evaporation coefficient the values of k c b for different crowing seasons were taken from allen et al 1998 0 3 1 05 and 0 25 for the initial mid and late growing stages of canola respectively the values of ke were then estimated as 0 05 0 1 and 0 1 for then mentioned growing stages respectively a seepage face boundary condition was used to represent the drains all other remaining boundaries were assigned a no flow boundary condition the initial condition for solute transport simulations was defined using the measured soil no3 content in different soil layers a third type cauchy boundary condition was used to describe the concentration flux at the top boundary and the drains a cauchy boundary condition is automatically converted into a second type neumann boundary condition during periods of drain outflow 2 3 1 3 calibration and validation the experimental data were first used to calibrate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters and then to validate the hydrus model these parameters were optimized using the inverse solution option of hydrus in this process soil hydraulic parameters including the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the saturated soil water content θs the residual soil water content θr and solute transport parameters including the longitudinal dl l and transverse dt l dispersivities were optimized measured drain fluxes q and no3 concentrations in the 2015 2016 growing season were used to calibrate the hydrus model the calibrated parameters were then used to validate the model using the same data collected in the 2016 2017 growing season the molecular diffusion coefficient was always set equal to zero since molecular diffusion in soils can usually be neglected radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 karandish and šimůnek 2017 2 3 1 4 correspondence criteria indices the capability of the hydrus model to simulate drainage water and nitrate fluxes under different treatments was assessed using the mean bias error mbe the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the model efficiency index ef as follows karandish and šimůnek 2016 7 m b e i 1 n o i p i n 8 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 o 9 e f 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 where pi and oi are simulated and observed data respectively o and p are the averages of observed and simulated data respectively and n is the number of observations 2 3 2 scenario analysis the calibrated and validated hydrus model was then applied to estimate the probable consequences of climate change projections on drainage water q and no3 fluxes for different drainage systems the climate projections were first generated for the base period i e 1975 2005 and then for all 20 gcms for four considered rcp scenarios over the 2040 2070 period to obtain consistent comparisons the initial and boundary conditions as well as all agricultural practices were considered to be the same as during the validation period i e the 2016 2017 growing season a comparative analysis was then carried out between the simulated projections for the 2041 2070 period and the base period in this regard a relative change in the considered parameter i e climatic variables drainage flux no3 flux or seasonal n loss was calculated as follows 10 r c x f x b x b 100 where rc is a relative change in the considered parameter x f and x b are values of the considered parameter in the future and base periods respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hydrus 2d 3d model efficiency the calibrated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters are summarized in table 2 fig 4 shows temporal variations of the observed and hydrus simulated drain fluxes q for different drainage systems during the calibration 2015 2016 growing season and validation 2016 2017 periods the model captured the temporal pattern of drainage fluxes q in both periods for all drainage systems well even though different drainage systems did not display the same patterns in the 2015 2016 growing season the average observed drainage fluxes q for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems were 1 08 0 97 1 13 and 2 05 mm d 1 respectively while the corresponding hydrus simulated values were 1 07 0 98 1 12 and 2 07 mm d 1 respectively the observed and hydrus simulated values matched even better during the validation period the model performance criteria summarized in table 3 also indicate the strong predictive capability of the model mbe nrmse and ef ranged from 21 7 10 3 to 24 9 10 3 mm d 1 from 23 to 37 and from 0 69 to 0 85 respectively among different drainage systems and different growing seasons the efficiency of the hydrus model to predict drainage fluxes q is also supported by other researchers e g öztekin 2002 mirjat et al 2014 filipovic et al 2014 li et al 2014 darzi naftchali et al 2018 matteau et al 2019 the quantitative assessment of the model performance as well as the visual inspection presented in fig 5 also shows good agreement between the observed and hydrus simulated soil water contents swcs in different soil layers during the calibration and validation periods with mbe nrmse and ef ranging from 0 005 to 0 002 cm3 cm 3 from 5 to 3 4 and from 0 73 to 0 99 respectively these differences may be a consequence of the fact that the hydrus simulated swcs are compared with the measured swcs which are averaged over a certain soil volume in which the swc gradient caused by irrigation precipitation drainage may not be linear karandish and šimůnek 2016 mguidiche et al 2015 the capability of the hydrus model to predict swc variations is also supported by other researchers ramos et al 2012 kandelous et al 2012 table 3 also shows good correspondence between the observed and hydrus simulated no3 concentrations in different soil layers during both growing seasons mbe 0 002 0 001 mg cm 1 d 1 nrmse 7 9 18 4 ef 0 51 0 88 which indicates that the calibrated model is well suited to describe the flow and transport processes observed in the experimental field to ensure the capability of the hydrus model to simulate the solute transport adequately we also compared temporal variations of the observed and simulated no3 fluxes in different drainage systems during the calibration and validation periods fig 6 while the hydrus model either slightly underpredicted or overpredicted no3 fluxes during different periods the simulated fluxes overall closely matched the observed data for all drainage systems during both the calibration and validation periods with correlation efficiencies of 0 77 0 9 data not shown the model performance criteria reported in table 3 also indicate the high potential of the hydrus model in capturing the no3 transport in different drainage systems mbe nrmse and ef varied in the range of 97 0 72 mg cm 1 d 1 35 5 57 and 0 77 0 87 respectively across different drainage systems and during both growing seasons the model capability of simulating n dynamics under different drainage conditions is also supported by others e g mekala and nambi 2016 matteau et al 2019 3 2 global warming projections 3 2 1 climatic variables fig 7 shows the range of relative changes in different climatic variables for different rcps along with the range of gcms projections for each scenario regardless of the type of the climatic variable fig 7 shows a different behavior of projected variables for different gcms and rcp scenarios which could be attributed to different resolutions of the ocean models for different gcms climate processes fully depend on how gcms simulate the extent of sea ice sea surface temperature surface heat ocean heat transfer and momentum fluxes ccsp 2008 karandish et al 2017 karandish and mousavi 2018 different projections by different gcms could also be attributed to many other factors which control the simulation process such as the prognostic variable for cloud characterization and the compatibility between the heat and water budgets of the atmospheric and ocean models randall et al 2007 however these differences among rcp scenarios can be attributed to the embedded assumptions in the socio economic and environmental models for each scenario other researchers have also indicated that future projections of climate variables depend on either the rcp scenarios or the selected gcm e g adham et al 2019 haj amor et al 2020 climate change projections showed both positive increases and negative decreases changes in monthly average values of t max and et 0 while monthly precipitation p is more likely to increase in the future except for rcp2 6 and a few gcms for rcp4 5 climate change may cause an increase in t min in the study area differences among the projections of different gcms rcp scenarios indicate the uncertainty in the projections of future climatic variables quantifying these ranges of uncertainties is essential since they provide more accurate insights for developing rational plans to cope with plausible consequences of global warming fig 7 shows that the range of uncertainty arising from projections of different gcms for different rcp scenarios is lower for t min and t max which indicates more similar predictions of temperatures compared to water fluxes such as p and et 0 such results are in agreement with those reported by karandish et al 2017 fig 7 also demonstrates non uniform temporal projections of climatic variables by different rcp scenarios which is also confirmed by others e g zickfeld et al 2005 girvetz et al 2009 harmsen et al 2009 agarwal et al 2014 adham et al 2019 precipitation projections seem to be less uncertain over the october january period while smaller uncertainties in the projections of other variables were observed in may fig 7 shows that compared to the base period and based on the average value obtained from all gcms under four rcps t min may increase by 0 15 1 25 c with the lowest and highest increases in april and october respectively t max may increase by 0 45 2 18 c except in april and may when t max decreases by 0 08 c and 0 15 c respectively others have reported a general increase in both t min and t max under climate change in the study area e g abbaspour et al 2009 dastoorani and poormohammadi 2012 kazemi rad and mohammadi 2015 karandish et al 2017 they also indicated a non uniform pattern of temporal projections of global warming into air temperature which is in agreement with results in our research an increase in t min in autumn and winter may be beneficial since it may provide favorable conditions for early cultivation and consequently may reduce the duration of the cropping cycle since the crop s thermal energy requirement may be supplied during a shorter period karandish et al 2016 such projections may further lead to lower crop water requirements if the positive effect of the shortened cropping cycle goes beyond the other probable negative effects of global warming on crop growth during the 2041 2070 period monthly p in the study area will always increase with the lowest increase occurring over the november january period and the highest one over the march may period fig 7 the rcp8 5 scenario led to the highest increases in monthly precipitation karandish et al 2016 carried out a high resolution assessment for entire iran and reported that global warming might cause the highest increase in p along the coast of the caspian sea where the study area is located they believed that such an increase might be attributed to an increase in air temperature which consequently causes a considerable increase in the atmospheric water holding capacity an increase in p during wet seasons which is in agreement with the findings of other researchers e g agarwal et al 2014 adham et al 2019 may cause water logging challenges indicating the necessity of installing costly drainage systems to mitigate further problems an increase in p during seasons may also provide favorable conditions for the growth of weeds and pests and may enhance soil erosion along with a considerable change in the soil available water enete and amusa 2010 such consequences may reduce economic benefits by restraining the proper crop growth fig 7 shows that monthly et 0 may slightly increase by 2 4 10 3 throughout october march the highest increase can be observed in autumn during the october december period however monthly et 0 is likely to be reduced by 0 6 and 2 3 in april and may respectively such a decrease can be a result of a small increase in monthly average t max in the same period the highest increase in et 0 can be observed in autumn having a key role in the hydrological cycle an increase in et 0 may threaten agricultural sustainability since it may lead to a significant increase in the agricultural demand for water beyond its sustainable availability in a region such an increase may cause a significant reduction in water availability due to the overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources terink et al 2013 other researchers also support a projected increase in et 0 in iran e g terink et al 2013 karandish and mousavi 2018 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 3 2 2 drainage flux daily hydrus simulated drainage fluxes for different drainage systems under future global warming projections the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario are displayed in fig 8 while daily drain fluxes due to climate change projections both decreased and increased in different periods compared to the base scenario they are more likely to increase especially during the october january period drainage fluxes are highly dependent on climatic variables and particularly on p and et 0 while an increase in et 0 may lead to a likely reduction in drainage fluxes due to an increase in crop water uptake this positive effect may be reversed by a negative impact of increased precipitation on q the results in fig 8 indicate that the monthly green water surplus gws defined as gws p et 0 for a particular month karandish and mousavi 2018 will significantly increase due to global warming and a corresponding increase in monthly precipitation which will consequently enhance drainage fluxes simulated drainage fluxes for different drainage systems seem to be more uncertain early in the simulation rather than later based on the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario average drainage fluxes during the growing season were calculated for each drainage system and the results are summarized in table 4 compared to the base period the average drainage fluxes over the cropping cycle may increase by 112 3 80 6 148 3 66 9 62 0 74 9 87 5 61 8 110 2 and 25 1 12 0 42 1 for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively for all drainage systems the rcp6 5 scenario leads to the highest increase in the average drainage flux over the cropping cycle while the rcp2 6 scenario leads to the lowest increase 3 2 3 nitrate flux daily hydrus simulated no3 fluxes for different drainage systems under future global warming projections the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario are displayed in fig 9 the visual inspection shows a dramatic increase in no3 fluxes during the october january period when monthly precipitations are also relatively high this pattern is also a consequence of increased drainage fluxes in these future climate scenarios fig 9 fig 9 also shows that during the october january period the range of uncertainties arising from the projections of different rcps is also higher than during the other periods while the bilevel and d0 65l30 drainage systems registered increased no3 fluxes during the entire growing cycle the d0 65l15 and d0 90l30 drainage systems experienced a considerable decrease in no3 fluxes during the february march period more similar predicted no3 fluxes were obtained for all drainage systems during the february march period indicating less uncertainty during this time such results may be attributed to lower no3 soil concentrations during this period due to high crop n uptake during previous months darzi naftchali et al 2017 dedatta 1981 based on the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario the minimum maximum and average no3 fluxes during the growing season were calculated for each drainage system and results are summarized in table 4 the average no3 flux over the cropping cycle may increase by 53 3 74 8 18 6 23 9 71 3 124 9 and 4 32 6 in the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively for all drainage systems the rcp4 5 and rcp6 5 scenarios may result in the highest increase in the average no3 flux over the cropping cycle 3 2 4 seasonal nitrate losses the seasonal no3 losses for different drainage systems were computed based on the ensemble average of 20 gcm projections for each rcp scenario table 4 regardless of the time i e either during the base or future periods the lowest no3 loss always occurred for the d0 65l15 drainage system where drains are installed at a shallower depth and at a smaller distance on the other hand the d0 90l30 drainage system always had the highest no3 losses during the growing seasons indicating that no3 losses increase when drains are installed at deeper depths and larger distances cooke et al 2002 burchell 2003 yoon et al 2006 these results indicate the importance of selecting a proper drainage system when sustainable agriculture and a safe environment are the primary concern table 4 shows that climate change may result in higher seasonal no3 losses for all drainage systems compared to the base period these increases will be 66 8 53 3 74 8 20 5 18 6 23 9 96 8 71 3 124 9 and 18 2 4 32 6 for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively the lowest and the highest increases in no3 losses are expected to occur in the d0 90l30 and d0 65l30 drainage systems respectively increased no3 losses due to climate change may be attributed either to increased drain fluxes or the field management practices and in particular to the n fertilization management drain fluxes can be controlled by various factors including climatic variables especially p and et 0 soil hydraulic properties the design of the drainage system and crop management hence increased seasonal no3 losses may be partially attributed to increased drainage fluxes resulting from a profound increase in surplus precipitation i e p et 0 due to global warming table 4 while future changes in climate variables may be inevitable negative consequences of climate change projections on drain fluxes may be alleviated by improving the soil water holding capacity such improvements may be achieved by applying various organic amendments such as manure or gypsum udayasoorian et al 2009 organic mulches chukalla et al 2015 or proper tillage practices liu et al 2013 organic mulching is also reported to have a positive effect on reducing nutrient leaching in agricultural lands de vita et al 2007 mitchell et al 2012 and is commonly proposed as an effective measure to prevent water pollution under intensive agriculture azooz and arshad 1996 triplett and dick 2008 constantin et al 2010 chukalla et al 2017 in particular organic mulching may restrict n leaching from the soil surface layer where sufficiently high concentrations of n enable continued uptake by roots phogat et al 2013 drain depths and spacings also affect drain fluxes wahba and christen 2006 jafari talukolaee et al 2015 reported that increasing drain spacing might reduce drainage volumes in the subsurface drained paddy field the impact of installing either deep or shallow drainage systems on drainage water quality quantity in southern australian irrigated lands was investigated by christen and skehan 2001 their results demonstrated that lower drainage volumes occur from drainage systems with reduced drain depths and spacings the long term field investigation in the paddy field in northern iran indicated that shallow drains were more effective than deeper ones in controlling the water table depth during the first three years after the installation of subsurface drainage while the reverse trend was observed in the fourth year jafari talukolaee et al 2016 however shallow drains may produce serious environmental problems since they enhance leaching and consequently may increase seasonal no3 losses darzi naftchali et al 2017 hence drain depths and spacing need to be optimized depending on the main agricultural or environmental concerns and future global warming projections n fertilization management is among the most crucial field practices which significantly affect no3 losses numerous researchers demonstrated the close relationship between the n fertilizer application rate timing and n leaching in agricultural lands mosier et al 2002 gasser et al 2002 haverkort et al 2003 daudén and quilez 2004 alva et al 2006 barton and colmer 2006 hutton et al 2008 wei et al 2009 jia et al 2014 karandish and šimůnek 2017 besides it is worth noting that the type of n fertilizer can also affect the n leaching rate jia et al 2014 on the other hand n is an essential crop nutrient that profoundly affects crop growth and yield wienhold et al 1995 jia et al 2014 an insufficient n supply in soil may result in severe yield and economic losses wienhold et al 1995 jia et a1 2014 therefore further research should be carried out to find out the environmentally economically safer applications of n fertilizers under future global warming predictions 4 conclusion field experiments and modeling analyses involving a subsurface drained field of rained canola as a winter crop were carried out to evaluate the integrated influence of subsurface drainage and global warming on probable future water and n losses our quantitative assessment successfully evaluated the capability of the hydrus model to predict soil water contents soil nitrate concentrations and drainage nitrate fluxes for various drainage systems while the downscaled weather data from 20 gcms and four rcp scenarios projected both decreases and increases in different future climatic variables the ensemble averages predicted an increase in air temperatures precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 for the 2041 2070 period surplus precipitation defines as p et 0 is also likely to increase under climate change which consequently resulted in a considerable increase in average values of drainage nitrate fluxes during the growing season such increases may lead to an increase of 4 125 in seasonal n losses for various drainage systems in the coming future our results demonstrate that negative environmental consequences of global warming in terms of its effect on water and nitrate losses may be alleviated when drains are installed at a shallow depth of 65 cm and at a spacing of 15 m d0 65l15 such a system should be more beneficial regarding either the water table control or reducing seasonal n losses from rainfed cropping systems based on our results it can be concluded that achieving sustainable rainfed agriculture under global warming requires further serious attempts to identify the best field management practices aiming at diminishing environmental consequences additionally the hydrus model could be a proper alternative to the costly and labor time consuming field investigations to determine the optimal management scenarios in rainfed lands under global warming conditions while simulating the effects of climate change projections on crop yield was not among the objectives of this research such effects may be of high importance when economic interests are considered further research is thus needed to compare both economic and environmental consequences to obtain a full picture of the coming future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10453,the impact of global warming on water and nitrate losses from a rainfed canola cropping system under various artificial drainage systems was assessed using an integrated field modeling approach four subsurface drainage systems with different drain depths dx and spacings ly including d0 90l30 d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and bilevel with a drain spacing of 15 m and alternate drain depths of 0 65 and 0 90 m were considered the hydrus 2d 3d model was first calibrated and validated using data collected for all drainage systems during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 canola cropping cycles respectively and then applied to simulate water nitrate losses for different drainage systems under meteorological conditions predicted assuming expected future global warming future weather data were downscaled from 20 general circulation models and four rcp scenarios for the mid 21st century for 2041 2070 the model capability of representing experimental field data was evaluated using the mean bias error mbe the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the model efficiency ef the hydrus 2d 3d model provided reliable description of soil water contents mbe 0 5 to 0 2 nrmse 0 005 0 034 and ef 0 73 0 99

0 72 mg cm 1 d 1 nrmse 0 35 0 57 and ef 0 77 0 87 the modeling results indicate that climate change will cause an increase of up to 148 in average daily drainage fluxes and up to 125 in average daily nitrate fluxes compared to the base case this will result in an increase of 4 125 in seasonal nitrate losses from various drainage systems with the lowest and highest projections for the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 systems respectively the hydrus simulated results indicate that the d0 65l15 system is environmentally safer than the other evaluated drainage systems for predicted global warming conditions concerning water nitrate losses keywords hydrus 2d 3d rcp scenarios climate change projections drainage flux nitrate loss 1 introduction the need to feed the growing global population on the one hand and increasing global scarcity of blue fresh water wwap 2009 hoekstra et al 2012 on the other hand indicate that it is essential to expand rainfed agriculture in the world in this regard humid regions may be of higher importance since they receive a sufficient quantity of precipitation to fully supply crop s water requirements by green from rainfall water shahsavari et al 2019 however expanding dry land farming in these regions may be restricted by waterlogging problems which occasionally occur after heavy rainfalls and particularly in heavy soils darzi naftchali et al 2017 waterlogging threatens the year round cropping resulting in considerable areas either going out of production or experiencing reduced yields darzi naftchali et al 2013 under such circumstances installing subsurface drainage systems may help in providing suitable conditions for winter crops based cropping systems and consequently improving the annual productivity of these lands subsurface drainage systems can speed up the water table drawdown and provide better aeration during the growing season while being beneficial in terms of the water table control installed drainage systems may cause serious environmental challenges due to their negative impacts on nutrient leaching previous researchers have demonstrated that drainage systems may accelerate the leaching process of soil nutrients and in particular of nitrogen n kalita et al 2006 furukawa et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 darzi naftchali et al 2017 which is well known to be an essential crop nutrient affecting crop growth and yield wienhold et al 1995 jia et al 2014 the design parameters of drainage systems including the type of the systems and the drain depth and spacing may affect water or n losses from agricultural lands christen and skehan 2001 wahba and christen 2006 jafari talukolaee et al 2015 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2017 for certain drainage systems the rate of water and n losses additionally also depends on field management practices improving field management practices may increase the water nutrient holding capacity of the soil and thus reduce water and n losses azooz and arshad 1996 de vita et al 2007 triplett and dick 2008 udayasoorian et al 2009 constantin et al 2010 mitchell et al 2012 liu et al 2013 phogat et al 2013 chukalla et al 2017 drainage fluxes represent a dominant factor for water and n losses from drained areas among various influencing factors climatic variables including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 play key roles in determining the rate of drainage fluxes increased surplus precipitation defined as p et c may accelerate the rate of water and n losses due to enhanced drainage fluxes water and n losses from drained dry farming lands may become a more important concern in the future when predicted global warming which affects these climatic variables takes place numerous researchers have demonstrated various ranges of both negative as well as positive projections of climate change into p and et 0 in different parts of the world abbaspour et al 2009 dastoorani and poormohammadi 2012 terink et al 2013 agarwal et al 2014 kazemi rad and mohammadi 2015 karandish et al 2017 karandish and mousavi 2018 adham et al 2019 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 through such investigations earlier research has mainly focused on determining probable economic consequences of global warming on the agricultural sector due to the climate change impact on crop yields and productivity under different future greenhouse gas emission scenarios karandish et al 2016 harmsen et al 2009 massah bavani and morid 2005 predicting probable n losses under climate change conditions is essential because the byproduct of these losses is the pollution of water resources karandish and šimůnek 2017 due to n leaching drainage from agricultural lands zhu et al 2005 thompson et al 2007 dudley et al 2008 burow et al 2010 dahan et al 2014 karandish et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2017 this issue has higher importance in humid regions where a low recovery of n fertilizers by crops produces excessive n losses after heavy rains karandish and šimůnek 2017 although a few attempts have been made to investigate the effects of climate change on water and n losses in agricultural systems e g singh et al 2009 wang et al 2015 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 a literature review reveals that no such study has been carried out for subsurface drained paddy fields under winter rainfed cropping as such systems are in their infancy in northern iran paddy fields a comprehensive study of their behavior would enable policymakers to incorporate the effects of inherent complexities of climate change on drainage activities to protect the local environment therefore we carried out a field experiment to investigate water and n losses from a drained field cultivated with rainfed canola and with various subsurface drainage systems our research is novel since it is the first study in which environmental hazards in rainfed agriculture due to global warming are evaluated in terms of n losses from the field to the best of our knowledge our study assesses for the first time such hazards in fields with subsurface drainage systems the n dynamics under various climate change projections were assessed using the hydrus 2d 3d model from now on referred to simply as hydrus which was first calibrated and validated using the field collected data we used the hydrus model since its capability in capturing drainage and n fluxes has been previously confirmed by many researchers e g öztekin 2002 mirjat et al 2014 filipovic et al 2014 li et al 2014 mguidiche et al 2015 karandish and šimůnek 2016 mekala and nambi 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 matteau et al 2019 the main objectives of this research thus were i to calibrate and validate hydrus using experimental drainage and nitrate fluxes collected in a subsurface drained field cultivated with rainfed canola and ii to investigate the impact of climate change projections on key climatic variables drainage and nitrate fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trial 2 1 1 study area and drainage system layout the field research was carried out during two canola growing seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 in the subsurface drainage pilot of the sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university in the mazandaran province iran sanru 36 3 n 53 04 e 15 m below sea level fig 1 in 2011 this pilot was designed and implemented in a 4 5 ha consolidated paddy field darzi naftchali et al 2013 2018 darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 consisting of four subsurface drainage systems with different drain depths dx and spacings ly including d0 90l30 d0 65l30 d0 65l15 and bilevel which has a drain spacing of 15 m and alternate drain depths of 0 65 and 0 9 m fig 1 the field consisted of consolidated paddy plots 100 m long and 30 m wide considering the dimensions of the plots and the field size the drainage systems were installed at a scale much larger than the laboratory scale drainage installation costs at such a scale were very high and required a large area different drainage systems were not replicated due to limited resources and land the drainage pipes were installed so that the last drain line in each system acted as the first drain line in the adjacent system accordingly at least three drain lines were considered in each drainage system in addition the monitoring lines lines 2 4 5 7 and 9 in fig 1 for measuring drain discharge and water quality were selected to fully represent each drainage system by removing the buffering lines a detailed description of the drainage systems can be found in darzi naftchali et al 2013 2018 long term averages of annual precipitation mean temperature as well as minimum and maximum temperatures recorded in the study area are 616 mm and 17 3 c 6 c and 38 9 c respectively darzi naftchali et al 2018 the variation of climatic variables during the 2015 2016 the calibration period and 2016 2017 the validation period growing seasons is shown in fig 2 2 1 2 cropping system and data collection the area was under rice canola cropping during 2011 2017 with rice as a major crop and canola as a winter crop the data from the 2015 16 and 2016 17 canola growing seasons were used in the present study canola was cultivated in the two cropping cycles on october 3 in 2015 and on september 28 in 2016 crops were harvested on may 4 2016 and may 20 2017 all agricultural practices were the same as the conventional practices of local farmers in the study area in the growing season of 2015 2016 50 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate was applied before cultivation and 50 kg ha 1 of urea i e co nh2 2 with 46 n was applied 52 days after sowing das in the second growing season urea was applied at rates of 85 kg ha 1 85 kg ha 1 and 115 kg ha 1 at 24 96 and 116 dass respectively the growers in the region adjust fertilization based on their activities in the crop rotation for example remaining residues after the previous crop are considered by the experienced growers darzi naftchali et al 2017 before crop cultivation soil samples were collected every 30 cm to a depth of 200 cm to determine soil physical and hydraulic properties and the soil n content soil water characteristic curves of the soil samples were determined by measuring soil water contents at 14 different pressure heads varied in the range of 0 15 bars after that the retc model was applied to fit the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 to the observed retention data for each treatment two suction samplers were buried at depths of 30 cm and 60 cm beneath the surface before crop cultivation and remained continuously at 30 kpa the samplers had porous ceramic caps of 5 cm in diameter using the vacuum pump the leachate was then collected during the growing seasons once every two weeks nitrate concentrations of water samples were determined by spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach to determine daily variations in the soil water content swc during the cropping cycles a 100 cm long tdr probe trime fm imko germany was installed midway between drains in each subsurface drainage system i e 4 tdr probes were installed in the study area 1 probe 4 drainage systems tdr probes were used once a day to measure swc at a 15 cm interval during both growing seasons the accuracy of all tdr sensors was evaluated by comparing tdr measured swcs with corresponding values measured using the gravimetric method tdr measured swcs agreed well with gravimetrically measured swcs with a coefficient of determination of 95 water table depths were measured daily in observation wells that were dug out midway between adjacent drains in each drainage system free drainage management was adopted during canola growing seasons subsurface drainage discharges q were measured daily for all drainage systems as long as the flow was observed at the outlet of drains drain fluxes were measured by using partial flumes at the outlet of representative drains during drainage periods the total water discharge for a particular day is the sum of discharges over 24 h the above values were converted to water depths by dividing them with the plot area drainage water samples were taken every 15 days and several consecutive days after fertilization collected water samples were then analyzed to determine their nitrate concentrations 2 2 climate data under global warning the projections of future climate data were downscaled for four rcp scenarios the representative concentration pathways reported in the 5th ipcc report ipcc 2013 the rcp2 6 a low greenhouse gases emission scenario rcp4 5 an intermediate one rcp6 5 a high one and rcp8 5 a very high greenhouse gases emission scenario for each scenario the projections of air temperature minimum and maximum precipitation solar net radiation wind speed atmosphere pressure and relative humidity were generated using 20 different gcm models general circulation models table 1 for the future period of 2040 2070 and compared with the corresponding values obtained for the base period 1975 2005 the statistical downscaling approach was carried out based on the widely used change factor method jones et al 1997 for all climatic variables the change factor coefficients which determine the relationship between the current and future climatic variables were calculated based on eq 1 jones et al 1997 except for air temperature for which eq 2 was applied trzaska and schnarr 2014 1 δ p i p g c m f u t i p g c m b a s e i 2 δ t i t g c m f u t i t g c m b a s e i wheres δ p i is a dimensionless monthly change factor for a particular climatic variable p p g c m f u t i and p g c m b a s e i are monthly averages of future simulated and historical values of a considered climatic variable respectively δ t i is a dimensionless monthly change factor for air temperature and t g c m f u t i and t g c m b a s e i are monthly averages of future and historical values of air temperature respectively these change factors were calculated at a monthly time scale i 1 12 using generated climatic variables reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated using the penman monteith fao 56 equation pmf allen et al 1998 due to its global acceptability karandish et al 2017 et 0 was then used to estimate crop evapotranspiration as explained below 2 3 n dynamics under current and future conditions 2 3 1 the hydrus model 2 3 1 1 model description and governing equations soil water and n dynamics were simulated using the hydrus 2d 3d model šimůnek et al 2008 2016 the hydrus program numerically solves the richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow 3 θ h t x k h h x z k h h z k h z w u h x z where θ is the volumetric soil water content swc l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the soil water pressure head l x is the lateral coordinate l z is the vertical coordinate positive downwards t is time t and wu h x z is root water uptake t 1 which is calculated as follows 4 w u h x z γ h r d f x z w t p o t where γ h is the soil water stress response function dimensionless of feddes et al 1978 rdf is the normalized spatial root water uptake distribution l 2 tpot is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 and w is the width of the soil surface l associated with the transpiration process the stress response function was obtained from the hydrus database for maize šimůnek et al 2011 uniform root distribution was assumed in each soil layer the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships were used to model soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 the transport of nitrate no3 was modeled using the convection dispersion

where c is the no3 concentration in the liquid phase ml 3 qx and qz are the components of the volumetric flux density lt 1 dxx dzz and dxz are the components of the dispersion tensor l2t 1 bear 1972 sc is a sink term which generally includes local no3 uptake through a passive process mineralization microbial immobilization and denitrification ml 3t 1 the first term on the right side of eq 3 describes the solute flux due to dispersion the second term describes the solute flux due to convection with flowing water and the third term describes nutrient uptake by roots similarly as in other earlier studies e g ajdary et al 2007 wang et al 2010 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 mineralization gains were neglected due to the following reasons first the lack of organic matter om lmits the mineralization process in mineral soils i e soils with om 3 in the upper horizon huang et al 2009 cronologically as in our study the lack of om limits the mineralization process li et al 2003 deenik 2006 wijanarko 2015 second mineralization mainly occurs in coarse textured soils with low clay content while it decreases considerably as soil clay content increases karandish and šimůnek 2017 third the abundance of micropores in high clay soils causes a physical protection of oms from being microbially decomposed and mineralized deenik 2006 our frequent measurements also showed that no3 concentration in the soil were much higher than nh4 concentrations darzi naftchali et al 2016 only the no3 transport in the soil was thus considered in this research assuming that the input of n fertilizer in the form of urea was instantly nitrified into no3 this is similar to the assumptions made by many other researchers e g ajdary et al 2007 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 karandish and šimůnek 2017 who assumed that nitrification is faster than the other processes and nitrifying urea into no3 takes only a few days havlin et al 2006 in addition nitrification is reported to be stimulated in less organic om 3 finely textured soils with high clay content all of which are the cases in the current research we also considered that root n uptake was strictly passive which has also been assumed in many other studies e g hanson et al 2006 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 according to this assumption n uptake can be calculated by multiplying the local soil n concentration and root water uptake 2 3 1 2 flow domain and initial and boundary conditions the impermeable layer in the study area was located at a soil depth of 200 cm fig 3 hence the 2d transport domain was defined as a rectangle with a depth of 200 cm and a width of 30 m for d0 9l30 and d0 65l30 drainage systems and 15 m for the d0 65l15 and bi level drainage systems the drains are considered to be on the sides of the transport domain an unstructured triangular finite element mesh fem was used to discretize the defined transport domain a non uniform fem was generated by hydrus with finite element sizes gradually increasing with distance from the drains the entire transport domain was divided into six soil layers i e 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm 90 120 cm 120 150 cm and 150 200 cm soil depths for which different soil properties were defined to represent the high permeability of the backfilled drain trench gravel an additional soil layer was defined 10 cm around 10 cm below and 30 cm above the drains measured soil water contents in different soil layers were considered to represent initial conditions for water flow simulations the saturated soil water content was specified as an initial condition in soil layers below the water table to differentiate the saturated and unsaturated zones the atmospheric boundary condition defined using potential evaporation ep potential transpiration tp and precipitation p was applied at the top of the transport domain the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 was adopted to separate crop evapotranspiration e t c into ep and tp as follows 6 e t c k c e t 0 e p t p e p k e e t 0 t p k c b e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient k c b is the basal crop coefficient and k e is the evaporation coefficient the values of k c b for different crowing seasons were taken from allen et al 1998 0 3 1 05 and 0 25 for the initial mid and late growing stages of canola respectively the values of ke were then estimated as 0 05 0 1 and 0 1 for then mentioned growing stages respectively a seepage face boundary condition was used to represent the drains all other remaining boundaries were assigned a no flow boundary condition the initial condition for solute transport simulations was defined using the measured soil no3 content in different soil layers a third type cauchy boundary condition was used to describe the concentration flux at the top boundary and the drains a cauchy boundary condition is automatically converted into a second type neumann boundary condition during periods of drain outflow 2 3 1 3 calibration and validation the experimental data were first used to calibrate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters and then to validate the hydrus model these parameters were optimized using the inverse solution option of hydrus in this process soil hydraulic parameters including the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the saturated soil water content θs the residual soil water content θr and solute transport parameters including the longitudinal dl l and transverse dt l dispersivities were optimized measured drain fluxes q and no3 concentrations in the 2015 2016 growing season were used to calibrate the hydrus model the calibrated parameters were then used to validate the model using the same data collected in the 2016 2017 growing season the molecular diffusion coefficient was always set equal to zero since molecular diffusion in soils can usually be neglected radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 karandish and šimůnek 2017 2 3 1 4 correspondence criteria indices the capability of the hydrus model to simulate drainage water and nitrate fluxes under different treatments was assessed using the mean bias error mbe the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the model efficiency index ef as follows karandish and šimůnek 2016 7 m b e i 1 n o i p i n 8 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 o 9 e f 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 where pi and oi are simulated and observed data respectively o and p are the averages of observed and simulated data respectively and n is the number of observations 2 3 2 scenario analysis the calibrated and validated hydrus model was then applied to estimate the probable consequences of climate change projections on drainage water q and no3 fluxes for different drainage systems the climate projections were first generated for the base period i e 1975 2005 and then for all 20 gcms for four considered rcp scenarios over the 2040 2070 period to obtain consistent comparisons the initial and boundary conditions as well as all agricultural practices were considered to be the same as during the validation period i e the 2016 2017 growing season a comparative analysis was then carried out between the simulated projections for the 2041 2070 period and the base period in this regard a relative change in the considered parameter i e climatic variables drainage flux no3 flux or seasonal n loss was calculated as follows 10 r c x f x b x b 100 where rc is a relative change in the considered parameter x f and x b are values of the considered parameter in the future and base periods respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hydrus 2d 3d model efficiency the calibrated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters are summarized in table 2 fig 4 shows temporal variations of the observed and hydrus simulated drain fluxes q for different drainage systems during the calibration 2015 2016 growing season and validation 2016 2017 periods the model captured the temporal pattern of drainage fluxes q in both periods for all drainage systems well even though different drainage systems did not display the same patterns in the 2015 2016 growing season the average observed drainage fluxes q for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems were 1 08 0 97 1 13 and 2 05 mm d 1 respectively while the corresponding hydrus simulated values were 1 07 0 98 1 12 and 2 07 mm d 1 respectively the observed and hydrus simulated values matched even better during the validation period the model performance criteria summarized in table 3 also indicate the strong predictive capability of the model mbe nrmse and ef ranged from 21 7 10 3 to 24 9 10 3 mm d 1 from 23 to 37 and from 0 69 to 0 85 respectively among different drainage systems and different growing seasons the efficiency of the hydrus model to predict drainage fluxes q is also supported by other researchers e g öztekin 2002 mirjat et al 2014 filipovic et al 2014 li et al 2014 darzi naftchali et al 2018 matteau et al 2019 the quantitative assessment of the model performance as well as the visual inspection presented in fig 5 also shows good agreement between the observed and hydrus simulated soil water contents swcs in different soil layers during the calibration and validation periods with mbe nrmse and ef ranging from 0 005 to 0 002 cm3 cm 3 from 5 to 3 4 and from 0 73 to 0 99 respectively these differences may be a consequence of the fact that the hydrus simulated swcs are compared with the measured swcs which are averaged over a certain soil volume in which the swc gradient caused by irrigation precipitation drainage may not be linear karandish and šimůnek 2016 mguidiche et al 2015 the capability of the hydrus model to predict swc variations is also supported by other researchers ramos et al 2012 kandelous et al 2012 table 3 also shows good correspondence between the observed and hydrus simulated no3 concentrations in different soil layers during both growing seasons mbe 0 002 0 001 mg cm 1 d 1 nrmse 7 9 18 4 ef 0 51 0 88 which indicates that the calibrated model is well suited to describe the flow and transport processes observed in the experimental field to ensure the capability of the hydrus model to simulate the solute transport adequately we also compared temporal variations of the observed and simulated no3 fluxes in different drainage systems during the calibration and validation periods fig 6 while the hydrus model either slightly underpredicted or overpredicted no3 fluxes during different periods the simulated fluxes overall closely matched the observed data for all drainage systems during both the calibration and validation periods with correlation efficiencies of 0 77 0 9 data not shown the model performance criteria reported in table 3 also indicate the high potential of the hydrus model in capturing the no3 transport in different drainage systems mbe nrmse and ef varied in the range of 97 0 72 mg cm 1 d 1 35 5 57 and 0 77 0 87 respectively across different drainage systems and during both growing seasons the model capability of simulating n dynamics under different drainage conditions is also supported by others e g mekala and nambi 2016 matteau et al 2019 3 2 global warming projections 3 2 1 climatic variables fig 7 shows the range of relative changes in different climatic variables for different rcps along with the range of gcms projections for each scenario regardless of the type of the climatic variable fig 7 shows a different behavior of projected variables for different gcms and rcp scenarios which could be attributed to different resolutions of the ocean models for different gcms climate processes fully depend on how gcms simulate the extent of sea ice sea surface temperature surface heat ocean heat transfer and momentum fluxes ccsp 2008 karandish et al 2017 karandish and mousavi 2018 different projections by different gcms could also be attributed to many other factors which control the simulation process such as the prognostic variable for cloud characterization and the compatibility between the heat and water budgets of the atmospheric and ocean models randall et al 2007 however these differences among rcp scenarios can be attributed to the embedded assumptions in the socio economic and environmental models for each scenario other researchers have also indicated that future projections of climate variables depend on either the rcp scenarios or the selected gcm e g adham et al 2019 haj amor et al 2020 climate change projections showed both positive increases and negative decreases changes in monthly average values of t max and et 0 while monthly precipitation p is more likely to increase in the future except for rcp2 6 and a few gcms for rcp4 5 climate change may cause an increase in t min in the study area differences among the projections of different gcms rcp scenarios indicate the uncertainty in the projections of future climatic variables quantifying these ranges of uncertainties is essential since they provide more accurate insights for developing rational plans to cope with plausible consequences of global warming fig 7 shows that the range of uncertainty arising from projections of different gcms for different rcp scenarios is lower for t min and t max which indicates more similar predictions of temperatures compared to water fluxes such as p and et 0 such results are in agreement with those reported by karandish et al 2017 fig 7 also demonstrates non uniform temporal projections of climatic variables by different rcp scenarios which is also confirmed by others e g zickfeld et al 2005 girvetz et al 2009 harmsen et al 2009 agarwal et al 2014 adham et al 2019 precipitation projections seem to be less uncertain over the october january period while smaller uncertainties in the projections of other variables were observed in may fig 7 shows that compared to the base period and based on the average value obtained from all gcms under four rcps t min may increase by 0 15 1 25 c with the lowest and highest increases in april and october respectively t max may increase by 0 45 2 18 c except in april and may when t max decreases by 0 08 c and 0 15 c respectively others have reported a general increase in both t min and t max under climate change in the study area e g abbaspour et al 2009 dastoorani and poormohammadi 2012 kazemi rad and mohammadi 2015 karandish et al 2017 they also indicated a non uniform pattern of temporal projections of global warming into air temperature which is in agreement with results in our research an increase in t min in autumn and winter may be beneficial since it may provide favorable conditions for early cultivation and consequently may reduce the duration of the cropping cycle since the crop s thermal energy requirement may be supplied during a shorter period karandish et al 2016 such projections may further lead to lower crop water requirements if the positive effect of the shortened cropping cycle goes beyond the other probable negative effects of global warming on crop growth during the 2041 2070 period monthly p in the study area will always increase with the lowest increase occurring over the november january period and the highest one over the march may period fig 7 the rcp8 5 scenario led to the highest increases in monthly precipitation karandish et al 2016 carried out a high resolution assessment for entire iran and reported that global warming might cause the highest increase in p along the coast of the caspian sea where the study area is located they believed that such an increase might be attributed to an increase in air temperature which consequently causes a considerable increase in the atmospheric water holding capacity an increase in p during wet seasons which is in agreement with the findings of other researchers e g agarwal et al 2014 adham et al 2019 may cause water logging challenges indicating the necessity of installing costly drainage systems to mitigate further problems an increase in p during seasons may also provide favorable conditions for the growth of weeds and pests and may enhance soil erosion along with a considerable change in the soil available water enete and amusa 2010 such consequences may reduce economic benefits by restraining the proper crop growth fig 7 shows that monthly et 0 may slightly increase by 2 4 10 3 throughout october march the highest increase can be observed in autumn during the october december period however monthly et 0 is likely to be reduced by 0 6 and 2 3 in april and may respectively such a decrease can be a result of a small increase in monthly average t max in the same period the highest increase in et 0 can be observed in autumn having a key role in the hydrological cycle an increase in et 0 may threaten agricultural sustainability since it may lead to a significant increase in the agricultural demand for water beyond its sustainable availability in a region such an increase may cause a significant reduction in water availability due to the overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources terink et al 2013 other researchers also support a projected increase in et 0 in iran e g terink et al 2013 karandish and mousavi 2018 darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 3 2 2 drainage flux daily hydrus simulated drainage fluxes for different drainage systems under future global warming projections the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario are displayed in fig 8 while daily drain fluxes due to climate change projections both decreased and increased in different periods compared to the base scenario they are more likely to increase especially during the october january period drainage fluxes are highly dependent on climatic variables and particularly on p and et 0 while an increase in et 0 may lead to a likely reduction in drainage fluxes due to an increase in crop water uptake this positive effect may be reversed by a negative impact of increased precipitation on q the results in fig 8 indicate that the monthly green water surplus gws defined as gws p et 0 for a particular month karandish and mousavi 2018 will significantly increase due to global warming and a corresponding increase in monthly precipitation which will consequently enhance drainage fluxes simulated drainage fluxes for different drainage systems seem to be more uncertain early in the simulation rather than later based on the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario average drainage fluxes during the growing season were calculated for each drainage system and the results are summarized in table 4 compared to the base period the average drainage fluxes over the cropping cycle may increase by 112 3 80 6 148 3 66 9 62 0 74 9 87 5 61 8 110 2 and 25 1 12 0 42 1 for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively for all drainage systems the rcp6 5 scenario leads to the highest increase in the average drainage flux over the cropping cycle while the rcp2 6 scenario leads to the lowest increase 3 2 3 nitrate flux daily hydrus simulated no3 fluxes for different drainage systems under future global warming projections the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario are displayed in fig 9 the visual inspection shows a dramatic increase in no3 fluxes during the october january period when monthly precipitations are also relatively high this pattern is also a consequence of increased drainage fluxes in these future climate scenarios fig 9 fig 9 also shows that during the october january period the range of uncertainties arising from the projections of different rcps is also higher than during the other periods while the bilevel and d0 65l30 drainage systems registered increased no3 fluxes during the entire growing cycle the d0 65l15 and d0 90l30 drainage systems experienced a considerable decrease in no3 fluxes during the february march period more similar predicted no3 fluxes were obtained for all drainage systems during the february march period indicating less uncertainty during this time such results may be attributed to lower no3 soil concentrations during this period due to high crop n uptake during previous months darzi naftchali et al 2017 dedatta 1981 based on the ensemble average of 20 gcms for each rcp scenario the minimum maximum and average no3 fluxes during the growing season were calculated for each drainage system and results are summarized in table 4 the average no3 flux over the cropping cycle may increase by 53 3 74 8 18 6 23 9 71 3 124 9 and 4 32 6 in the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively for all drainage systems the rcp4 5 and rcp6 5 scenarios may result in the highest increase in the average no3 flux over the cropping cycle 3 2 4 seasonal nitrate losses the seasonal no3 losses for different drainage systems were computed based on the ensemble average of 20 gcm projections for each rcp scenario table 4 regardless of the time i e either during the base or future periods the lowest no3 loss always occurred for the d0 65l15 drainage system where drains are installed at a shallower depth and at a smaller distance on the other hand the d0 90l30 drainage system always had the highest no3 losses during the growing seasons indicating that no3 losses increase when drains are installed at deeper depths and larger distances cooke et al 2002 burchell 2003 yoon et al 2006 these results indicate the importance of selecting a proper drainage system when sustainable agriculture and a safe environment are the primary concern table 4 shows that climate change may result in higher seasonal no3 losses for all drainage systems compared to the base period these increases will be 66 8 53 3 74 8 20 5 18 6 23 9 96 8 71 3 124 9 and 18 2 4 32 6 for the bilevel d0 65l15 d0 65l30 and d0 90l30 drainage systems respectively the lowest and the highest increases in no3 losses are expected to occur in the d0 90l30 and d0 65l30 drainage systems respectively increased no3 losses due to climate change may be attributed either to increased drain fluxes or the field management practices and in particular to the n fertilization management drain fluxes can be controlled by various factors including climatic variables especially p and et 0 soil hydraulic properties the design of the drainage system and crop management hence increased seasonal no3 losses may be partially attributed to increased drainage fluxes resulting from a profound increase in surplus precipitation i e p et 0 due to global warming table 4 while future changes in climate variables may be inevitable negative consequences of climate change projections on drain fluxes may be alleviated by improving the soil water holding capacity such improvements may be achieved by applying various organic amendments such as manure or gypsum udayasoorian et al 2009 organic mulches chukalla et al 2015 or proper tillage practices liu et al 2013 organic mulching is also reported to have a positive effect on reducing nutrient leaching in agricultural lands de vita et al 2007 mitchell et al 2012 and is commonly proposed as an effective measure to prevent water pollution under intensive agriculture azooz and arshad 1996 triplett and dick 2008 constantin et al 2010 chukalla et al 2017 in particular organic mulching may restrict n leaching from the soil surface layer where sufficiently high concentrations of n enable continued uptake by roots phogat et al 2013 drain depths and spacings also affect drain fluxes wahba and christen 2006 jafari talukolaee et al 2015 reported that increasing drain spacing might reduce drainage volumes in the subsurface drained paddy field the impact of installing either deep or shallow drainage systems on drainage water quality quantity in southern australian irrigated lands was investigated by christen and skehan 2001 their results demonstrated that lower drainage volumes occur from drainage systems with reduced drain depths and spacings the long term field investigation in the paddy field in northern iran indicated that shallow drains were more effective than deeper ones in controlling the water table depth during the first three years after the installation of subsurface drainage while the reverse trend was observed in the fourth year jafari talukolaee et al 2016 however shallow drains may produce serious environmental problems since they enhance leaching and consequently may increase seasonal no3 losses darzi naftchali et al 2017 hence drain depths and spacing need to be optimized depending on the main agricultural or environmental concerns and future global warming projections n fertilization management is among the most crucial field practices which significantly affect no3 losses numerous researchers demonstrated the close relationship between the n fertilizer application rate timing and n leaching in agricultural lands mosier et al 2002 gasser et al 2002 haverkort et al 2003 daudén and quilez 2004 alva et al 2006 barton and colmer 2006 hutton et al 2008 wei et al 2009 jia et al 2014 karandish and šimůnek 2017 besides it is worth noting that the type of n fertilizer can also affect the n leaching rate jia et al 2014 on the other hand n is an essential crop nutrient that profoundly affects crop growth and yield wienhold et al 1995 jia et al 2014 an insufficient n supply in soil may result in severe yield and economic losses wienhold et al 1995 jia et a1 2014 therefore further research should be carried out to find out the environmentally economically safer applications of n fertilizers under future global warming predictions 4 conclusion field experiments and modeling analyses involving a subsurface drained field of rained canola as a winter crop were carried out to evaluate the integrated influence of subsurface drainage and global warming on probable future water and n losses our quantitative assessment successfully evaluated the capability of the hydrus model to predict soil water contents soil nitrate concentrations and drainage nitrate fluxes for various drainage systems while the downscaled weather data from 20 gcms and four rcp scenarios projected both decreases and increases in different future climatic variables the ensemble averages predicted an increase in air temperatures precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 for the 2041 2070 period surplus precipitation defines as p et 0 is also likely to increase under climate change which consequently resulted in a considerable increase in average values of drainage nitrate fluxes during the growing season such increases may lead to an increase of 4 125 in seasonal n losses for various drainage systems in the coming future our results demonstrate that negative environmental consequences of global warming in terms of its effect on water and nitrate losses may be alleviated when drains are installed at a shallow depth of 65 cm and at a spacing of 15 m d0 65l15 such a system should be more beneficial regarding either the water table control or reducing seasonal n losses from rainfed cropping systems based on our results it can be concluded that achieving sustainable rainfed agriculture under global warming requires further serious attempts to identify the best field management practices aiming at diminishing environmental consequences additionally the hydrus model could be a proper alternative to the costly and labor time consuming field investigations to determine the optimal management scenarios in rainfed lands under global warming conditions while simulating the effects of climate change projections on crop yield was not among the objectives of this research such effects may be of high importance when economic interests are considered further research is thus needed to compare both economic and environmental consequences to obtain a full picture of the coming future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10454,macropores are critical pathways through which water and pollutants can bypass the soil matrix and be rapidly transported to subsurface drains and freshwater bodies we modified the drainmod model to simulate macropore flow using a simple approach as part of developing the drainmod p model to simulate phosphorus dynamics in artificially drained agricultural lands the hagen poiseuille s law was used to estimate the flow capacity of macropores when ponding depths on the soil surface are greater than kirkham s depth water is assumed to flow through macropores directly to tile drains without interaction with the soil matrix in the modified model macropore size is adjusted based on wet or dry conditions while connectivity is altered by tillage the model was tested using a 4 year data set from a subsurface drained field in northwest ohio the soils at the field are classified as very poorly drained and are prone to desiccation cracking the modified model predicted the daily and monthly subsurface drainage with average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 respectively the cumulative drainage over the 4 year simulation period was under predicted by 8 the new macropore component was able to capture about 75 of 60 peak drainage flow events however surface runoff was over predicted for the entire study period annual water budgets using measured data precipitation subsurface drainage and surface runoff and model predictions evapotranspiration vertical seepage and change in storage were not balanced with an average annual imbalance of 6 4 cm the lack of closure in the water balance suggests that errors may have occurred in field measurements particularly surface runoff overall incorporating macropore flow into drainmod improved predictions of daily drainage peaks and enabled the model to predict subsurface drainage flux contributed by macropore flow which is critical for expanding drainmod to simulate phosphorus transport in subsurface drained agricultural land keywords agricultural drainage preferential flow cracking soil hydrologic modeling 1 introduction nutrient enrichment of aquatic ecosystems is a major environmental concern tile drainage has been identified as a significant contributor to the export of agrochemicals to receiving waters algoazany et al 2007 smith et al 2015 tan and zhang 2011 particularly in the presence of preferential flow eastman et al 2010 king et al 2015 williams et al 2016 preferential flow creates non uniform wetting fronts that accelerate the transport of agricultural contaminants e g fertilizers pesticides toxic trace elements to ground and surface water beven and germann 1982 jarvis 2007 preferential flow is a general term that can be further divided into different forms of non equilibrium flow patterns as discussed by hendrickx and flury 2001 in this study we focus on macropore flow created by desiccation cracking and earthworm burrows wetting and drying cycles introduce shrinking and swelling stresses in the soil matrix and when cohesive forces are exceeded soil cracks form a process that is especially noticeable in clayey soils jarvis 2007 horn et al 1994 earthworms can burrow several hundred channels per m2 that are vertically continuous from the soil surface deep into the subsoil and with diameters ranging from 2 to 12 mm shipitalo and pedobiologia 1999 edwards et al 1988 found more than 14 000 pores per m2 of surface area with diameters 0 4 mm of which 160 pores were 5 mm in diameter in a silty loam soil at coshocton ohio jarvis 2007 defined macropores as pores with equivalent diameters larger than about 0 3 0 5 mm while a literature reviewed by beven and germann 1982 found minimum equivalent macropore diameters ranging from 0 03 to 3 mm macropore flow is of a particular concern in reduced till soil systems where macropores are not periodically disrupted by tillage practices thereby increasing the chance of accelerated contaminant transport through the macropore network into subsurface drainage systems williams et al 2016 studies have shown that agricultural fields with minimum or no tillage have faster subsurface water movement compared to fields under conventional tillage buczko et al 2006 cameira et al 2003 cullum 2009 schwen et al 2011 schwen et al 2011 reported that effective macropores decreased over the winter period in response to precipitation and limited biological activity and gradually increased in the spring and summer as a result of root development and dryer conditions presence of macropore flow can generally be inferred from breakthrough curves of conservative non reactive tracers that occur sooner than expected based on the advection dispersion equation gerke and köhne 2004 the effect of macropores on subsurface drainage increase with closer and or shallower drains as reported by sands et al 2008 and scott et al 1998 macropore flow can significantly contribute to phosphorus p losses through subsurface drainage by bypassing the most biologically active and chemically reactive portion of the soil profile which decreases the likelihood of p sorption to soil particles for instance eastman et al 2010 reported that more than 50 of total p tp in a clay loam soil was lost through subsurface drainage with 80 of p lost being in the particulate form high particulate p concentrations in tile drains implies that sediment bound p is most likely lost from surface layers with higher p concentrations via preferential flow bottcher et al 1981 chapman et al 2001 therefore macropore flow is an important pathway for p losses from artificially drained agricultural lands that should be represented in p models models capable of simulating macropore flow vary in the approach used and the level of details in assumptions made to represent the process the dual gerke and van genuchten 1993 and the hydrus šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 models assume that water flow is controlled by capillary and gravity forces in both the soil matrix and the macropore domains the approach represents the highest degree of complexity as the richards equation is used for modeling macropore flow with the requirement of a large number of input parameters that are often difficult to obtain a more simplified approach used in the rzwqm ahuja et al 1993 ma et al 2012 and macro larsbo et al 2005 models assumes that macropore flow moves only under gravity forces with capillarity being neglected in this approach macropores are represented as vertical pipes planes with water flowing only under gravity forces and no pressure head change with depth empirical equations have also been used that assume instantaneous routing of macropore flow and bypassing the soil matrix e g source responsive model by nimmo 2010 the cascade approach is another empirical approach that assumes downward macropore flow from each layer after reaching field capacity and simple infiltration equations such as the green ampt equation are used as reviewed by radcliffe et al 2015 interaction between macropores and the soil matrix is usually represented using a first order transfer equation e g source responsive model macro hydrus but also green ampt equation has been used in the rzwqm however models such as icecream larsson et al 2007 and apex ford et al 2017 simplify the process and assume no interaction between the macropore and the soil domains therefore water and contaminants entering the macropores can be directly routed to drains or lost into the deep aquifers previous work has been done by workman and skaggs 1991 1990 to simulate preferential flow in subsurface drained fields by developing a drainmod based model named preflo the one dimensional richards equation has been used in the preflo model to simulate water flow in the saturated and unsaturated matrix domain macropore flow was described using the hagen poiseuille s law a source term was added to the richards equation to account for the water flow from macropore to matrix domain however these modifications were not incorporated into drainmod s distribution version as they require replacing the simple water balance approach a key feature of drainmod with the richards equation the objectives of this study were to 1 modify the drainmod model to simulate macropore flow using simplified approaches as a step towards expanding the model to simulate p dynamics and transport in artificially drained lands and 2 test the modified model using four years of hydrologic data collected from a subsurface drained field in northwest ohio that is characterized by very poorly drained and cracking clayey soils describing the development and testing of the phosphorus version of drainmod namely drainmod p is beyond the scope of this paper 2 model description 2 1 drainmod model drainmod is a one dimensional field scale process based model that was originally developed in 1970 s to simulate the hydrology of poorly and or artificially drained shallow water table soils skaggs 1982 1978 1977 skaggs et al 2012 following recommendations by saraswat et al 2015 for reporting modeling studies we provided a brief description of the hydrologic component of the original model while describing in detail our approach for modifying the model to simulate macroppore flow in subsurface drained soils skaggs et al 2012 provided a detailed description of the hydrologic component of drainmod including approaches and equations for representing different hydrologic processes drainmod simulates the hydrology of an artificially drained field using two simple water balance equations one for the soil surface eq 1 and the other for a section of the soil profile eq 2 with a unit area that is located midway between two parallel drains and extends from the soil surface down to the top of a restrictive soil layer 1 p f δ s r o 2 δ v a d e t v l s f where p is precipitation cm f is matrix infiltration cm δ s is change in surface storage cm ro is surface runoff cm δ va is change in water free pore space cm d is subsurface drainage cm e t is evapotranspiration cm and vls is vertical and lateral seepage cm in the model water can pond on the soil surface filling the surface depressional storage when the precipitation rate is greater than the soil infiltration rate or the soil profile is saturated surface depressional storage must be filled before surface runoff can take place runoff is calculated using the surface water balance equation as the difference between precipitation and the summation of infiltration and change of water stored on the soil surface eq 1 infiltration is calculated using the green and ampt 1911 equation the water balance equation for the soil profile keeps track of the change in water free pore space by subtracting infiltrated water from subsurface drainage evapotranspiration et and seepage losses eq 2 for ponding depths greater than the soil surface roughness kirkham s depth when water can move freely to the vicinity of drains kirkham 1957 equation is used to calculate the drainage flux otherwise the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 is used in cold climates drainmod simulates the key processes affecting field hydrology including freezing thawing snow accumulation and snowmelt luo et al 2001 2000 under freezing conditions the model calculates ice content and modifies soil hydraulic conductivities infiltration parameters and drainage rates luo et al 2000 the heat equation is solved numerically to simulate conductive heat transport and predict soil temperature snowmelt takes place when air temperature rises above a user defined input base temperature the form of precipitation is determined based on a dividing rain snow input base temperature drainmod requires soil weather crop and drainage system related input parameters soil input data include soil water characteristic curve for each layer volume of water drained and upward flux as functions of water table depth wtd infiltration parameters for green and ampt equation and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil layer weather inputs are hourly precipitation data maximum and minimum daily temperature and when possible daily potential evapotranspiration pet values if hourly precipitation data are not available the daily records can be used and evenly distributed over four or six hours every day centered at either 6 00 a m or 6 00 p m skaggs et al 2012 pet can be calculated using the thornthwaite 1948 method or read by the model as an input file if data are available et supply is calculated using the upward flux and wtd relationship defined by the user when the maximum upward flux is not sufficient to meet the et demand water is removed from the top layers creating a dry zone that can go as deep as the rooting depth drainmod uses approaches based on darcy s law to calculate lateral and vertical seepage crop data include desired planting date growing days crop stress parameters root depth over the growing season and parameters describing field working conditions drain system parameters include drain depth and spacing effective drain radius depth to impermeable layer storage parameters and initial water table depth additionally parameters describing drain outlet settings are required if the model is set to simulate controlled drainage or subirrigation if applicable the user defines vertical and or lateral seepage parameters drainmod hydrologic predictions include infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff et vertical and lateral seepage water table depth and drained pore volume in the soil profile output summaries can be on a daily monthly and yearly basis 2 2 modeling macropore flow in drainmod compared to many hydrologic models drainmod is relatively simple and easy to parameterize in order to maintain this key feature of the model a simple approach using the hagen poiseuille s equation has been selected to simulate macropore flow in drainmod the equation considers laminar flow through macropores and has two forms according to the shape of macropores one form represents macropores as vertical cylinders and is a function of the number of macropores per unit area and the average pore radius eq 3a the other is used for planer cracks and takes into consideration the total length of cracks per unit area and the average crack width eq 3b both equations were implemented in drainmod as follows 3a q m a c p m a c ρ g r p 2 8 μ where p m a c n π r p 2 3b q m a c p m a c ρ g d 2 12 μ where p m a c l d where q m a c is macropore flow capacity cm s 1 ρ is density of water g cm 3 g is gravitational constant cm s 2 r p is average radius of cylindrical pores cm μ is dynamic viscosity of water g cm 1 s 1 p m a c is macroporosity defined as the total volume of macropores as a fraction of the soil volume cm3 cm 3 n is number of pores per unit area cm 2 l is total length of cracks per unit area cm cm 2 and d is average crack width cm according to beven and germann 1982 total macroporosity can be divided into hydraulically connected effective pores the ones conducting flow rapidly and dead ended pores that can be considered a part of the soil matrix domain fig 1 while there are no universally accepted threshold values for macroporosity beven and germann 1982 suggested that macropores generally represent only 1 5 of the total soil volume these values represent only the hydraulically effective macropores which are likely to conduct water and solutes macroporosity can be estimated experimentally using the tension infiltrometer buczko et al 2006 jarvis et al 1987 watson and luxmoore 1986 that provides an estimate of water flowing preferentially a smoke test has been proposed to manually count the number of macropores connected to subsurface drains and visually estimate the average pore radius fox et al 2012 petersen et al 2012 in our model we only simulate effective macropores that are directly connected to subsurface drains fig 1 to maintain the simplicity of the model we assume the effect of macropores that are not directly connected to drains on groundwater flow and solute transport can be reasonably represented by increasing the soil matrix hydraulic conductivity during the model calibration water enters macropores only from the soil surface when water ponding depth exceeds a user defined depth that represents the soil surface roughness kirkham s depth s1 as shown in fig 2 under these conditions water can move freely on the soil surface to the vicinity of drains and flow directly to the subsurface drains through connected macropores for simplicity water entering macropores is assumed to be directly routed to drains without interacting with the soil matrix the hagen poiseuille s equation is used to calculate the maximum allowable capacity of macropores to deliver water at each time step the daily macropore flow is computed as the summation of hourly differences between the maximum surface storage smax and kirkham s depth water amount greater than maximum surface storage and infiltration is defined as surface runoff based on this description the drainmod s water balance equation at the surface eq 1 was modified to calculate surface runoff as following 4 r o p f δ s m f where mf is macropore flow cm under the assumption of no interaction between macropore and soil matrix domains no changes were made to the soil profile water balance equation eq 2 in drainmod priority was set to water flowing through macropores then water draining from the soil matrix and both are limited by the drainage coefficient a user input parameter that defines the maximum hydraulic capacity of the subsurface drainage system to drain water from a field therefore predicted macropore flow at each time step hourly is controlled by the depth of water stored on the surface greater than surface roughness macropore flow capacity and drainage coefficient the average crack width and the macropore diameter were set to be dynamic values that change over time based on the moisture conditions at the soil surface fig 3 drainmod develops a dry zone within the root depth if the upward flux is insufficient for meeting the et demand the dry zone depth was used as an indicator for the field wetness dryness conditions the model is set to increase the crack width when the dry zone depth is greater than 3 cm using a linear relationship until it reaches a user defined maximum value 5 d i 1 d m i n d i d m i n d i δ d d m i n d i d m a x d m a x d i d m a x where d i 1 is the new crack width cm d i is crack width on the previous day cm d m a x and d m i n are maximum and minimum crack widths respectively cm and δ d is daily change in crack width cm similarly if the dry zone is 3 cm or less the crack width declines until it reaches a minimum defined value can be set to zero the same equation applies for cylindrical pores maximum and minimum crack widths or pore diameter are input parameters that can be estimated based on field observations or from the literature and further adjusted during model calibration the user defines the two fixed daily values that can be added to or subtracted from the crack width based on antecedent moisture conditions in other words the user has a great control over defining the shape and dynamics of macropores tillage mixes the soil and reduces the connectivity of macropores according to the depth and intensity of tillage williams et al 2018 2016 the model simulates the tillage effect on macropore connectivity by assuming that cracks reach the minimum value after a tillage event and remains for 5 days before cracks can start to redevelop again the assumption is based on a study that showed continuous macropores can redevelop shortly after a tillage practice andreini and steenhuis 1990 3 model testing 3 1 field description the modified version of drainmod was tested using a data set collected from a privately owned field located in paulding county northwestern ohio fig 4 the study site is a part of the edge of field eof research network established at the eastern corn belt ecb of ohio and supervised by the usda agricultural research service usda ars the field is tile drained drain spacing 12 2 m 40 ft drain depth 0 6 m 2 ft and has a relatively flat slope about 2 dominant soil types based on the web soil survey are paulding clay very fine illitic nonacid mesic typic epiaquepts and roselms silty clay very fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs which are very poorly drained soils with low permeability and high clay content these soils are subjected to severe cracking during summer with crack widths typically ranging from 20 50 mm making macropore flow a significant component of field hydrology fig 5 the field is managed under a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and wheat triticum aestivum l rotation with tillage taking place usually after wheat harvest 3 2 measured data detailed description of the methods used for monitoring the field hydrology has been previously reported by king et al 2018 pease et al 2018 and williams et al 2016 briefly precipitation surface runoff and subsurface drainage are monitored continuously at the field however the delineated area contributing to surface runoff 7 3 ha is different from the area contributing to tile drainage 8 7 ha with different points of measurement fig 4 four years of measured data were available for this study between 2013 and 2016 precipitation was measured onsite every 10 min using a tipping bucket rain gauge teledyne isco 674 a standard rain gauge novalynx 260 2510 was used for backup and bulk precipitation measurement wing walls were installed to channel and route overland flow through a 0 61 m h flume tracom inc alpharetta georgia installed at the surface runoff monitoring station a compound weir insert thel mar brevard nc was installed at the tile outlet to measure tile drainage water flow was recorded on a 10 minute interval at both surface and subsurface drainage outlets using an isco 4230 bubbler flow meter 4 drainmod initialization and parameterization 4 1 drainage system drainage design parameters required by drainmod are listed in table 1 the drainage coefficient was set as the highest measured daily subsurface drainage flow rate during the 4 year study period a value of 0 51 cm was used for the effective drain radius as suggested in the drainmod reference report skaggs 1980 the maximum surface storage depth is a calibrated parameter and kirkham s depth was assumed to be half that depth the depth of the last soil layer was set as the depth to the restrictive layer initial wtd is required by drainmod for running the hydrology simulation to minimize uncertainty in this parameter we started the simulations one year earlier as management planting and harvesting dates were available for 2012 studying the water balance at the test site indicated existence of seepage therefore seepage losses were considered in the simulations we assumed the restrictive layer to be 100 cm thick with a piezometric head of 100 cm at the layer bottom to allow continuous vertical seepage 4 2 soil properties no soil input data were available for this site therefore soil related input parameters were initially obtained from the literature and adjusted later during the calibration process based on the usda nrcs web soil survey these soils have five major layers with very low hydraulic conductivity physical and hydraulic properties of paulding clay and roselms silty clay soils were previously reported for a small watershed in defiance county northwestern ohio using 34 samples from 9 soil profiles öztekin 2000 öztekin et al 2007 defiance county boarders paulding county with similar soil formation composition and behavior gunn et al 2018 conducted drainmod hydrology simulations for a paulding clay soil in defiance county they obtained soil physical properties from the ssurgo database except for saturated hydraulic conductivity that was measured onsite gunn et al 2018 we initiated the drainmod soil related parameters based on the soil properties reported in the previously mentioned studies a summary of soil physical and hydrological properties used in drainmod simulations are listed in table 2 the soil water characteristic relationships for the five soil layers were obtained from the gunn et al 2018 study for paulding clay soil saturated hydraulic conductivities table 2 and green ampt infiltration parameters table sm 1 were initialized using values presented by gunn et al 2018 and changed during calibration to improve model predictions although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first 3 8 cm h 1 and second 1 5 cm h 1 layers are relatively high in our simulations compared to the values 0 03 0 08 cm h 1 reported by gunn et al 2018 it still lies within the range 0 36 8 9 cm h 1 measured by öztekin et al 2007 and reported in the ssurgo data the higher values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the upper soil layers also reflect the impact of dead ended macropores on increasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix we initiated the wtd volume drained relationship using the curve estimated by skaggs et al 1981 for toledo silty clay soil located in north central ohio the toledo soil series is a very slowly drained soil skaggs et al 1981 with similar characteristics of the paulding soil series the wtd volume drained relationship was further adjusted during model calibration for better predictions fig sm 1 the steady state upward flux wtd relationship was set as 0 47 cm hr 1 at the soil surface and set to zero below the depth of 120 cm particle size analysis was performed for soil samples collected from the top layer at the paulding site and average values representing the sand silt and clay percentages are given in table 2 the texture of the deeper layers was estimated using the ssurgo data most of the temperature parameters were obtained from luo et al 2001 2000 and adjusted during the calibration process table sm 2 soil temperature at the bottom of the soil profile was set as the average value of the daily recorded temperatures for the whole simulation period willis et al 1961 indicated that the critical ice content for stopping infiltration can be approximated as 60 0 28 cm3 cm 3 of the field capacity 0 47 cm3 cm 3 however we increased the value to 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in order to improve model predictions during winter 4 3 weather data drainmod hourly precipitation input file was generated using the 10 min precipitation data measured onsite the hourly precipitation data were useful for accurately representing the water dynamics on the soil surface daily precipitation data obtained from noaa for a station located 13 km away from the study site were used for the year of 2012 as hourly data were not available the temperature based thornthwaite method was used for estimating daily pet values maximum and minimum daily temperature data were obtained from a station at the ohio agriculture research development center oardc weather system located approximately 72 km from the study site at hoytville wood county however the thornthwaite method is known to over estimate pet during summer growing season and under estimate pet during fall winter and spring months skaggs et al 2012 therefore monthly correction factors were used to get more reliable pet estimates we initiated reasonable estimates for the monthly pet correction factors based on previous drainmod studies that were conducted in the u s midwest region negm et al 2017 2016 2014 öztekin 2000 shedekar 2015 thorp et al 2009 wang et al 2006 adjusted pet correction factors are shown in table sm 3 annual heat index was calculated as the sum of the monthly thornthwaite heat indices and found to be 46 the value coincides with the heat index used by shedekar 2016 for a study conducted in ohio 4 4 macropore flow based on our observations of uniformly distributed cracks up to 4 cm wide between corn rows under dry conditions fig 5 we used the hagen poiseuille equation for planar cracks implemented in drainmod eq 3b in our simulations we only considered cracks that are directly connected to subsurface drains therefore our estimate of the total crack length was 1 0 m per m2 0 01 cm cm 2 with a maximum crack width of 0 5 cm as we only represent the cracks connected to tile drains table 3 the reader is referred to the following references for macroporosity estimates for different soil types and textures beven and germann 1982 buczko et al 2006 watson and luxmoore 1986 the minimum width is a calibration parameter and can be set to zero however the parameter was set to 0 0033 cm as we believe cracks at the paulding site never close completely even during the wet months dryness and wetness coefficients represent the rate of change of the crack width during the dry periods and wet periods respectively we changed these two parameters until an acceptable agreement between measured and predicted drainage values was reached 5 model calibration and validation drainmod has frequently been calibrated and validated by comparing predicted subsurface drainage to field measurements negm et al 2017 2014 thorp et al 2009 for studies with available wtd measurements the model was calibrated using both subsurface drainage and wtd youssef et al 2006 surface runoff is rarely measured and to the extent of our knowledge it has not been used for model calibration and validation before this is attributed to the difficulty of measuring surface runoff and the high level of uncertainty associated with these measurements skaggs et al 2012 suggested that at least one year of measured data is required for calibrating the drainmod model four years of data 2013 2016 were available for this study data collected during 2013 and 2014 were used for model calibration while data measured in 2015 and 2016 were used for model validation the model was calibrated using only subsurface drainage as wtd was not measured during the test period the overall goal of the model calibration was to adjust the model input parameters within reasonable ranges to minimize differences between predicted and measured values during the calibration process we first focused on adjusting the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity volume drained wtd relationship pet correction factors and maximum allowed surface storage as the model predictions were very sensitive to those parameters later we calibrated the parameters related to freezing thawing and snowmelt to improve the model predictions during the winter period finally parameters related to macropore flow including minimum crack width and dryness and wetness macropore flow factors were adjusted to improve the peak drainage predictions during large precipitation events 6 performance evaluation criteria we evaluated model performance using graphical and statistical measures we visually assessed the model s ability to capture variations in hydrologic measurements over time as affected by different weather soil and plant related factors based on common model performance measures reviewed by moriasi et al 2015 and recommended by skaggs et al 2012 the nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse and percent error pe have been selected to evaluate the agreement between measured data and model predictions on a daily monthly and annual basis the nse is a widely used statistical model performance indicator that compares model predictions to the mean of observed values nse can range from to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating a perfect fit values of nse 0 indicates that the mean of measured values is a better predictor than the model one of the disadvantages of the nse is the sensitivity to extreme values the other statistical measure pe gives values ranging from to and 0 0 being the optimal value the pe measure can sometimes be misleading if the over predictions and under predictions of the model have similar magnitudes and cancel each other however the method can generally be useful in evaluating systematic over or under predictions by the model threshold values for the goodness of fit by these statistical metrics have been previously reported moriasi et al 2015 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 skaggs et al 2012 according to skaggs et al 2012 the model performance in predicting daily or monthly drainage flow can be rated as acceptable daily nse 0 4 or monthly nse 0 5 good daily nse 0 6 or monthly nse 0 7 or excellent daily nse 0 75 or monthly nse 0 8 the same daily nse thresholds apply for evaluating wtd predictions most of the data sets used for previous drainmod applications did not include measured surface runoff as measuring this hydrologic component is difficult and has high uncertainty in the measurements therefore skaggs et al 2012 did not provide an evaluation criteria for the model performance in predicting surface runoff as the measured runoff is highly unlikely to be available in this study the nse was used to evaluate the model performance using daily and monthly values while pe is used for evaluating the error percentage of the annual predictions 7 results and discussion 7 1 field climatic conditions over the 4 year monitoring period annual precipitation ranged from 81 7 cm in 2014 to 106 3 cm in 2015 with an average of 92 3 cm based on noaa climate data the 30 year 1981 2010 average annual precipitation for paulding county is 89 9 cm arguez et al 2012 annual precipitation for the test field was close to normal in 2013 2 and 2016 0 slightly less than the long term average in 2014 9 and considerably higher than the long term average in 2015 18 the long term data show that the least monthly precipitation occurs in the winter months jan 5 3 cm feb 4 9 cm dec 6 5 cm and highest precipitation occurs in the months of may 10 6 cm june 9 1 cm and july 9 7 cm however monthly precipitation at the test site exhibited strong variation deviating from the long term monthly values for example 2015 had substantially lesser precipitation in january and february and significantly greater precipitation in may june and july in 2016 the monthly precipitation considerably deviated from long term average values in six months march june and september were wetter and may july and december were drier the long term monthly temperatures for the winter months averaged 4 7 2 9 and 2 1 c in january february and december respectively and for the summer months averaged 20 6 22 4 and 21 3 c in june july and august respectively with few exceptions conditions were generally freezing during the winter months for all years exceptions include december 2015 that was warmer 5 3 c compared to the normal conditions 2 1 c in december substantial freezing conditions existed in february 2014 8 1 c and 2015 10 6 c average temperature during january 2013 and 2016 differed by about 2 c compared to the long term average temperature temperature variations were limited during the summer period and ranged between 19 9 24 4 c for the entire simulation period the average temperature 10 1 c was comparable to the long term average for the paulding county 9 5 c however the average annual temperature for the test field was less than the long term average in 2014 8 8 c close to normal conditions in 2013 9 9 c and 2015 10 1 c and above normal conditions in 2016 11 7 c therefore the testing field exhibited high variability in weather conditions during the testing period 7 2 subsurface drainage and macropore flow predictions field measurements showed that subsurface drainage patterns did not necessarily follow precipitation patterns in all years the greatest annual subsurface drainage 22 9 cm occurred in a year with an average precipitation 2013 while the wettest year 2015 had an annual subsurface drainage of only 19 3 cm it should be noted that water draining through the soil profile is not only affected by the soil hydraulic conductivity but also by the precipitation intensity infiltration capacity antecedent soil moisture conditions and et precipitation rates greater than the soil infiltration capacity at the site resulted in accumulation of water on the soil surface that can be lost as surface runoff particularly in these poorly drained soils for instance a 6 8 cm storm event occurring over a 9 hr period on july 9th in 2015 generated only 0 6 cm of subsurface drainage while 37 2 5 cm of precipitation was lost as surface runoff over the four year simulation period the modified drainmod model predicted an average subsurface drainage of 16 5 cm and ranged from 12 3 cm in 2014 to 21 1 cm in 2015 table 4 approximately 18 of mean annual precipitation was lost through subsurface drainage represented by total flow from both soil matrix and macropores daily subsurface drainage predicted by the modified drainmod consistently followed measured values with instances of over prediction or under prediction fig 6 the statistical performance measures nse for daily and monthly predictions and pe for annual predictions assessing the agreement between measured and predicted subsurface drainage are given in table 5 subsurface drainage was under predicted during the calibration period by 26 and over predicted during the validation period by 14 over the entire simulation period the modified drainmod predicted a cumulative subsurface drainage of 65 9 cm compared to 71 5 cm of measured drainage daily nse for subsurface drainage predictions ranged from 0 56 in 2015 to 0 31 in 2016 with an average value of 0 48 according to the evaluation criteria recommended by skaggs et al 2012 the performance of the modified model for predicting subsurface drainage can be rated as good for 2015 acceptable for 2013 and 2014 and poor for 2016 macropore flow occurred during a total of 98 days during the four year simulation period the flow capacity of the macropores calculated by the hagen poiseuille s equation was exceeded in 66 of those 98 days 67 this is characterized by the number of days with both macropore flow and surface runoff as the model gives priority to macropore flow before any surface runoff takes place from a seasonal perspective macropore flow capacity was exceeded during 23 days in the spring when snowmelt occurred and during 4 days only in the fall season in summer 2015 macropore flow capacity was exceeded in 12 days as a result of the high rainfall events during this period on average the modified model predicted that macropore flow contributed 15 of annual subsurface drainage and ranged from 10 in 2016 to 18 in 2014 with few exceptions predicted macropore flow mainly occurred during late winter and early spring during snowmelt fig 7 exceptions include january 2013 and summer of 2015 during large precipitation events fig 7 in 2013 a large precipitation event 6 cm that lasted for 7 h started late jan 12th and continued to the early hours of the next day average temperature in january 2013 2 2 c was above long term average 4 7 c and on jan 12th 2013 the minimum and maximum air temperatures were 8 9 c and 15 5 c respectively consequently precipitation was in the form of rain and the model predicted that 6 0 4 cm of it was lost through macropores to subsurface drains as mentioned earlier we believe that the soil cracks at the test site do not close completely even during the winter period therefore we used a minimum crack width of 0 033 mm resulting in preferentially draining ponding water all year round 7 3 surface runoff predictions surface runoff was monitored over the entire simulation period annual measured surface runoff averaged 5 9 cm for the 4 year simulation period with a minimum of 2 1 cm in 2014 and a maximum of 15 3 cm in 2015 table 8 according to measurements about 6 of annual precipitation was lost through surface runoff however this percentage varied greatly during the study period it was relatively high during the wet year of 2015 14 and relatively low in 2014 3 and 2016 3 surface runoff is very likely to occur during high intensity precipitation events as a result of saturated soil conditions or during precipitation rates greater than the soil infiltration capacity for instance about 30 of a 5 1 cm precipitation that was received during a 1 hour storm event on june 12th 2015 was lost as surface runoff for the entire simulation period the modified drainmod model predicted substantially greater surface runoff than measured tables 4 6 and fig 8 the 4 year cumulative surface runoff predicted was 51 9 cm compared to only 23 7 cm of measured runoff predicted surface runoff widely varied among the years from 6 7 cm in 2016 to 22 5 cm in 2015 the modified model predictions indicate that about 14 of annual precipitation was lost through surface runoff table 6 year 2015 an exceptionally wet year contributed to more than 43 of cumulative surface runoff during the 4 year study period our simulations indicated that the deviation of monthly runoff predictions from measurements increased during the months with precipitation greater than the monthly noaa precipitation averages however this does not explain the extremely high surface runoff predictions our initial assumption was that the wide cracks fig 5 served as vertical channels during the summer and conducted water to adjacent fields or to the creek located northwest of the field and branching from the auglaize river fig 4 however that assumption was not valid for other cases as surface runoff was greatly over predicted during the winter months of 2013 as well as the spring season of 2014 fig 8 therefore more investigations were conducted as discussed in the following sections to study other hydrological pathways by which water could have left the field and possible source of errors and uncertainties 7 4 evapotranspiration seepage and water table depth predictions evapotranspiration is a major component by which water is removed from the soil profile at the test field average annual et predicted by the modified drainmod was approximately 57 cm table 6 this value indicates that on average 62 of precipitation was lost as et although no direct et measurements were available for the test site to validate the accuracy of the model predictions predicted average annual et was comparable to values predicted by other studies for instance et averaged 66 2 cm and represented 67 of average annual precipitation at a site located in ohio as predicted by shedekar 2016 using drainmod youssef et al 2018 conducted a regional simulation study to investigate the effect of drainage water management on field hydrology and nitrogen losses at 48 locations across the midwest region of the usa using drainmod nii seven locations in ohio were included in their study with predicted annual average et ranging from 48 4 59 3 cm for free drainage treatment and representing about 58 of average annual precipitation youssef et al 2018 predicted an average annual et of 54 7 cm at a site located in dayton oh receiving 93 cm average annual precipitation under the assumptions made for the seepage component section 4 1 the model predicted that on average 5 2 cm range 4 9 5 6 cm of water was lost through vertical seepage annually table 6 the value indicates that approximately 6 of precipitation was lost as vertical seepage in the study conducted by youssef et al 2018 vertical seepage averaged approximately 4 0 cm for the 48 midwestern sites and ranged from 3 9 to 4 1 cm for the ohio sites the wtd averaged 47 60 60 and 70 cm in 2013 through 2016 respectively according to the model predictions the site conditions were relatively wet during the growing season may september of 2015 and dry in 2014 and 2016 for the same period water table depth was not measured at the test field thus we could not validate the wtd predictions however there is a possibility that the simplified approaches used for representing dead ended macropores could have affected the wtd predictions in the modified drainmod model macropores that are not connected to drains were implicitly represented in the model by increasing the soil hydraulic conductivity as the relatively higher values represented the combined effect of macropores and soil matrix domain on soil water movement in reality cracks are distributed all over the field and draining water to depths beneath the shallow drains 60 cm deep at the site fig 1 furthermore the blocky soil structure with vertical and lateral cracks allows the waterfront to propagate faster than what is predicted by the model for homogenous domains therefore in highly dynamic soils subjected to swelling and shrinkage with large cracking during the summer period this assumption might not be totally valid 7 5 annual water budget annual water mass balance was conducted using field measurements precipitation subsurface drainage and surface runoff and model predictions et vertical seepage and change in storage the water budget was not balanced for all years with an average annual 6 4 cm lack of closure table 8 this imbalanced water budget indicates that a certain amount of precipitated water is not accounted for through different water flow pathways for the entire simulation period the cumulative water budget imbalance reached about 26 cm of missing water however more than 38 of that imbalance was in 2015 9 6 cm the imbalanced water budget highlights that inaccuracy in model predictions uncertainty in field measurements or a combination of these two resulted in the lack of water balance closure according to the study conducted by youssef et al 2018 both et and vertical seepage predicted by the modified drainmod are on the higher side for the study field therefore we doubt that these two pathways are the source of the annual water budget imbalance however as mentioned earlier there is high uncertainty in estimating the area contributing to surface runoff measurements arising from the challenges in accurately defining the area and in routing overland flow from several hectares into a specific outlet therefore surface runoff measurements might have significantly contributed to the annual water budget imbalance discrepancies between measured and predicted subsurface drainage can be partially attributed to assumptions made in drainmod for representing dead ended macropores vertical cracks at the test site reaching 2 4 cm wide and extending to a depth below the subsurface drains in summer fig 5 can store considerable amounts of water even before the deeper soil layers reaches saturation the water stored in dead ended macropores can transfer slowly into the soil matrix layers that have not reached saturation yet fig 3 at saturation soil cracks shrink in size causing changes in hydraulic properties of the soil matrix and adding another level of complexity to modeling the system although the relatively simplified approaches used for representing macropore flow in the modified drainmod might have contributed to the discrepancies between measured and predicted subsurface drainage it cannot be the only source of error for the lack of water budget closure our representation of the field hydrology was constrained by the data availability detailed data sets with accurate estimations of the area contributing to surface runoff studies of the crack geometry temporal crack dynamics with soil moisture and wtd measurements would be beneficial for future model testing 7 6 comparison to the original drainmod model apart from the new macropore component all other input parameters for both models were exactly the same the performance of the original drainmod model with no macropore flow component is summarized in table 5 the original model under predicted annual subsurface drainage for the calibration years 2013 2014 by about 32 and over predicted subsurface flow for the validation years 2015 2016 by 7 over the entire simulation period the original drainmod under predicted subsurface drainage by 14 compared to only 8 under prediction by the modified drainmod model the new macropore flow component allowed the modified model to capture peak drainage flows in most cases and improved subsurface drainage predictions of several events that were either under predicted or completely missed by the original model for instance on feb 20th in 2014 the modified model was able to predict 66 of measured subsurface drainage 0 43 cm while the original model only predicted 14 of the flow volume on jul 23rd 2016 the modified model predicted 28 of the flow event 0 45 cm occurred on that day and was completely missed by the original model results show that the modified drainmod model slightly improved daily drainage predictions compared to the original model as indicted by the increase in the average daily nse from 0 42 for the original model to 0 48 for the modified model monthly nse averaged 0 59 for both models in predicting monthly subsurface drainage and their performance was comparable on an annual basis the modified model improved the under prediction of subsurface drainage in the calibration years from 32 to 26 but increased the over prediction for the validation years from 7 to 14 over the 4 year simulation period both models predicted significant larger volumes of surface runoff than measured on average annual surface runoff represented 15 of precipitation as predicted by the original model with a cumulative value of 55 7 cm compared to 23 7 cm of measured runoff the modified drainmod model predicted less cumulative surface runoff volume 51 9 cm as part of the water was routed through macropores connected to subsurface drains et and seepage predicted by the original and modified models were comparable similarities in et and vertical seepage predicted by the original and modified drainmod models were attributed to the close wtd predictions by both models with an annual average value of 60 cm 8 conclusions the drainmod model has been modified to simulate macropore flow and tested using four years 2013 2016 of measured hydrologic data from a subsurface drained field site located at northwest ohio u s the soils at the test field site are characterized by low hydraulic conductivity and large cracking during the summer period simple approaches were used to represent flow through macropores directly connected to subsurface drains by assuming bypass flow of water ponded on the soil surface ponding depths greater than kirkham s depth to the subsurface drain without interaction with the soil matrix domain the capacity of macropores to drain water is calculated using the hagen poiseuille s equation however the effect of dead ended macropores not directly connected to the drain on accelerating drainage flow was implicitly considered by increasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix domain simulation results showed that the modified drainmod model improved daily subsurface drainage predictions compared to the original version the new macropore component enhanced daily peak flow predictions that were under estimated or completely missed by the original model both models over predicted surface runoff for the entire simulation period this was most likely due to the high uncertainty in surface runoff measurements which was evident by the lack of closure of the annual water budget surface runoff measurements are challenging because of potential errors in identifying the runoff contributing area and the transmission losses during runoff routing to the measurement point at the field edge the modification of drainmod to simulate macropore flow is considered to be an essential step towards developing drainmod p as it allows for partitioning subsurface drainage into matrix flow and macropore flow components macropores can significantly contribute to phosphorus losses in subsurface drained agricultural lands as it serves as a direct conduit connecting the soil surface to subsurface drains further model testing is needed to validate the simple empirical approaches used in drainmod for representing processes affecting macropore flow at subsurface drained agricultural fields for rigorous model testing water table depth measurements must be available in addition to subsurface drainage and surface runoff field measurement of model inputs characterizing macropore flow

10454,macropores are critical pathways through which water and pollutants can bypass the soil matrix and be rapidly transported to subsurface drains and freshwater bodies we modified the drainmod model to simulate macropore flow using a simple approach as part of developing the drainmod p model to simulate phosphorus dynamics in artificially drained agricultural lands the hagen poiseuille s law was used to estimate the flow capacity of macropores when ponding depths on the soil surface are greater than kirkham s depth water is assumed to flow through macropores directly to tile drains without interaction with the soil matrix in the modified model macropore size is adjusted based on wet or dry conditions while connectivity is altered by tillage the model was tested using a 4 year data set from a subsurface drained field in northwest ohio the soils at the field are classified as very poorly drained and are prone to desiccation cracking the modified model predicted the daily and monthly subsurface drainage with average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 respectively the cumulative drainage over the 4 year simulation period was under predicted by 8 the new macropore component was able to capture about 75 of 60 peak drainage flow events however surface runoff was over predicted for the entire study period annual water budgets using measured data precipitation subsurface drainage and surface runoff and model predictions evapotranspiration vertical seepage and change in storage were not balanced with an average annual imbalance of 6 4 cm the lack of closure in the water balance suggests that errors may have occurred in field measurements particularly surface runoff overall incorporating macropore flow into drainmod improved predictions of daily drainage peaks and enabled the model to predict subsurface drainage flux contributed by macropore flow which is critical for expanding drainmod to simulate phosphorus transport in subsurface

fertilizers pesticides toxic trace elements to ground and surface water beven and germann 1982 jarvis 2007 preferential flow is a general term that can be further divided into different forms of non equilibrium flow patterns as discussed by hendrickx and flury 2001 in this study we focus on macropore flow created by desiccation cracking and earthworm burrows wetting and drying cycles introduce shrinking and swelling stresses in the soil matrix and when cohesive forces are exceeded soil cracks form a process that is especially noticeable in clayey soils jarvis 2007 horn et al 1994 earthworms can burrow several hundred channels per m2 that are vertically continuous from the soil surface deep into the subsoil and with diameters ranging from 2 to 12 mm shipitalo and pedobiologia 1999 edwards et al 1988 found more than 14 000 pores per m2 of surface area with diameters 0 4 mm of which 160 pores were 5 mm in diameter in a silty loam soil at coshocton ohio jarvis 2007 defined macropores as pores with equivalent diameters larger than about 0 3 0 5 mm while a literature reviewed by beven and germann 1982 found minimum equivalent macropore diameters ranging from 0 03 to 3 mm macropore flow is of a particular concern in reduced till soil systems where macropores are not periodically disrupted by tillage practices thereby increasing the chance of accelerated contaminant transport through the macropore network into subsurface drainage systems williams et al 2016 studies have shown that agricultural fields with minimum or no tillage have faster subsurface water movement compared to fields under conventional tillage buczko et al 2006 cameira et al 2003 cullum 2009 schwen et al 2011 schwen et al 2011 reported that effective macropores decreased over the winter period in response to precipitation and limited biological activity and gradually increased in the spring and summer as a result of root development and dryer conditions presence of macropore flow can generally be inferred from breakthrough curves of conservative non reactive tracers that occur sooner than expected based on the advection dispersion equation gerke and köhne 2004 the effect of macropores on subsurface drainage increase with closer and or shallower drains as reported by sands et al 2008 and scott et al 1998 macropore flow can significantly contribute to phosphorus p losses through subsurface drainage by bypassing the most biologically active and chemically reactive portion of the soil profile which decreases the likelihood of p sorption to soil particles for instance eastman et al 2010 reported that more than 50 of total p tp in a clay loam soil was lost through subsurface drainage with 80 of p lost being in the particulate form high particulate p concentrations in tile drains implies that sediment bound p is most likely lost from surface layers with higher p concentrations via preferential flow bottcher et al 1981 chapman et al 2001 therefore macropore flow is an important pathway for p losses from artificially drained agricultural lands that should be represented in p models models capable of simulating macropore flow vary in the approach used and the level of details in assumptions made to represent the process the dual gerke and van genuchten 1993 and the hydrus šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 models assume that water flow is controlled by capillary and gravity forces in both the soil matrix and the macropore domains the approach represents the highest degree of complexity as the richards equation is used for modeling macropore flow with the requirement of a large number of input parameters that are often difficult to obtain a more simplified approach used in the rzwqm ahuja et al 1993 ma et al 2012 and macro larsbo et al 2005 models assumes that macropore flow moves only under gravity forces with capillarity being neglected in this approach macropores are represented as vertical pipes planes with water flowing only under gravity forces and no pressure head change with depth empirical equations have also been used that assume instantaneous routing of macropore flow and bypassing the soil matrix e g source responsive model by nimmo 2010 the cascade approach is another empirical approach that assumes downward macropore flow from each layer after reaching field capacity and simple infiltration equations such as the green ampt equation are used as reviewed by radcliffe et al 2015 interaction between macropores and the soil matrix is usually represented using a first order transfer equation e g source responsive model macro hydrus but also green ampt equation has been used in the rzwqm however models such as icecream larsson et al 2007 and apex ford et al 2017 simplify the process and assume no interaction between the macropore and the soil domains therefore water and contaminants entering the macropores can be directly routed to drains or lost into the deep aquifers previous work has been done by workman and skaggs 1991 1990 to simulate preferential flow in subsurface drained fields by developing a drainmod based model named preflo the one dimensional richards equation has been used in the preflo model to simulate water flow in the saturated and unsaturated matrix domain macropore flow was described using the hagen poiseuille s law a source term was added to the richards equation to account for the water flow from macropore to matrix domain however these modifications were not incorporated into drainmod s distribution version as they require replacing the simple water balance approach a key feature of drainmod with the richards equation the objectives of this study were to 1 modify the drainmod model to simulate macropore flow using simplified approaches as a step towards expanding the model to simulate p dynamics and transport in artificially drained lands and 2 test the modified model using four years of hydrologic data collected from a subsurface drained field in northwest ohio that is characterized by very poorly drained and cracking clayey soils describing the development and testing of the phosphorus version of drainmod namely drainmod p is beyond the scope of this paper 2 model description 2 1 drainmod model drainmod is a one dimensional field scale process based model that was originally developed in 1970 s to simulate the hydrology of poorly and or artificially drained shallow water table soils skaggs 1982 1978 1977 skaggs et al 2012 following recommendations by saraswat et al 2015 for reporting modeling studies we provided a brief description of the hydrologic component of the original model while describing in detail our approach for modifying the model to simulate macroppore flow in subsurface drained soils skaggs et al 2012 provided a detailed description of the hydrologic component of drainmod including approaches and equations for representing different hydrologic processes drainmod simulates the hydrology of an artificially drained field using two simple water balance equations one for the soil surface eq 1 and the other for a section of the soil profile eq 2 with a unit area that is located midway between two parallel drains and extends from the soil surface down to the top of a restrictive soil layer 1 p f δ s r o 2 δ v a d e t v l s f where p is precipitation cm f is matrix infiltration cm δ s is change in surface storage cm ro is surface runoff cm δ va is change in water free pore space cm d is subsurface drainage cm e t is evapotranspiration cm and vls is vertical and lateral seepage cm in the model water can pond on the soil surface filling the surface depressional storage when the precipitation rate is greater than the soil infiltration rate or the soil profile is saturated surface depressional storage must be filled before surface runoff can take place runoff is calculated using the surface water balance equation as the difference between precipitation and the summation of infiltration and change of water stored on the soil surface eq 1 infiltration is calculated using the green and ampt 1911 equation the water balance equation for the soil profile keeps track of the change in water free pore space by subtracting infiltrated water from subsurface drainage evapotranspiration et and seepage losses eq 2 for ponding depths greater than the soil surface roughness kirkham s depth when water can move freely to the vicinity of drains kirkham 1957 equation is used to calculate the drainage flux otherwise the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 is used in cold climates drainmod simulates the key processes affecting field hydrology including freezing thawing snow accumulation and snowmelt luo et al 2001 2000 under freezing conditions the model calculates ice content and modifies soil hydraulic conductivities infiltration parameters and drainage rates luo et al 2000 the heat equation is solved numerically to simulate conductive heat transport and predict soil temperature snowmelt takes place when air temperature rises above a user defined input base temperature the form of precipitation is determined based on a dividing rain snow input base temperature drainmod requires soil weather crop and drainage system related input parameters soil input data include soil water characteristic curve for each layer volume of water drained and upward flux as functions of water table depth wtd infiltration parameters for green and ampt equation and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil layer weather inputs are hourly precipitation data maximum and minimum daily temperature and when possible daily potential evapotranspiration pet values if hourly precipitation data are not available the daily records can be used and evenly distributed over four or six hours every day centered at either 6 00 a m or 6 00 p m skaggs et al 2012 pet can be calculated using the thornthwaite 1948 method or read by the model as an input file if data are available et supply is calculated using the upward flux and wtd relationship defined by the user when the maximum upward flux is not sufficient to meet the et demand water is removed from the top layers creating a dry zone that can go as deep as the rooting depth drainmod uses approaches based on darcy s law to calculate lateral and vertical seepage crop data include desired planting date growing days crop stress parameters root depth over the growing season and parameters describing field working conditions drain system parameters include drain depth and spacing effective drain radius depth to impermeable layer storage parameters and initial water table depth additionally parameters describing drain outlet settings are required if the model is set to simulate controlled drainage or subirrigation if applicable the user defines vertical and or lateral seepage parameters drainmod hydrologic predictions include infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff et vertical and lateral seepage water table depth and drained pore volume in the soil profile output summaries can be on a daily monthly and yearly basis 2 2 modeling macropore flow in drainmod compared to many hydrologic models drainmod is relatively simple and easy to parameterize in order to maintain this key feature of the model a simple approach using the hagen poiseuille s equation has been selected to simulate macropore flow in drainmod the equation considers laminar flow through macropores and has two forms according to the shape of macropores one form represents macropores as vertical cylinders and is a function of the number of macropores per unit area and the average pore radius eq 3a the other is used for planer cracks and takes into consideration the total length of cracks per unit area and the average crack width eq 3b both equations were implemented in drainmod as follows 3a q m a c p m a c ρ g r p 2 8 μ where p m a c n π r p 2 3b q m a c p m a c ρ g d 2 12 μ where p m a c l d where q m a c is macropore flow capacity cm s 1 ρ is density of water g cm 3 g is gravitational constant cm s 2 r p is average radius of cylindrical pores cm μ is dynamic viscosity of water g cm 1 s 1 p m a c is macroporosity defined as the total volume of macropores as a fraction of the soil volume cm3 cm 3 n is number of pores per unit area cm 2 l is total length of cracks per unit area cm cm 2 and d is average crack width cm according to beven and germann 1982 total macroporosity can be divided into hydraulically connected effective pores the ones conducting flow rapidly and dead ended pores that can be considered a part of the soil matrix domain fig 1 while there are no universally accepted threshold values for macroporosity beven and germann 1982 suggested that macropores generally represent only 1 5 of the total soil volume these values represent only the hydraulically effective macropores which are likely to conduct water and solutes macroporosity can be estimated experimentally using the tension infiltrometer buczko et al 2006 jarvis et al 1987 watson and luxmoore 1986 that provides an estimate of water flowing preferentially a smoke test has been proposed to manually count the number of macropores connected to subsurface drains and visually estimate the average pore radius fox et al 2012 petersen et al 2012 in our model we only simulate effective macropores that are directly connected to subsurface drains fig 1 to maintain the simplicity of the model we assume the effect of macropores that are not directly connected to drains on groundwater flow and solute transport can be reasonably represented by increasing the soil matrix hydraulic conductivity during the model calibration water enters macropores only from the soil surface when water ponding depth exceeds a user defined depth that represents the soil surface roughness kirkham s depth s1 as shown in fig 2 under these conditions water can move freely on the soil surface to the vicinity of drains and flow directly to the subsurface drains through connected macropores for simplicity water entering macropores is assumed to be directly routed to drains without interacting with the soil matrix the hagen poiseuille s equation is used to calculate the maximum allowable capacity of macropores to deliver water at each time step the daily macropore flow is computed as the summation of hourly differences between the maximum surface storage smax and kirkham s depth water amount greater than maximum surface storage and infiltration is defined as surface runoff based on this description the drainmod s water balance equation at the surface eq 1 was modified to calculate surface runoff as following 4 r o p f δ s m f where mf is macropore flow cm under the assumption of no interaction between macropore and soil matrix domains no changes were made to the soil profile water balance equation eq 2 in drainmod priority was set to water flowing through macropores then water draining from the soil matrix and both are limited by the drainage coefficient a user input parameter that defines the maximum hydraulic capacity of the subsurface drainage system to drain water from a field therefore predicted macropore flow at each time step hourly is controlled by the depth of water stored on the surface greater than surface roughness macropore flow capacity and drainage coefficient the average crack width and the macropore diameter were set to be dynamic values that change over time based on the moisture conditions at the soil surface fig 3 drainmod develops a dry zone within the root depth if the upward flux is insufficient for meeting the et demand the dry zone depth was used as an indicator for the field wetness dryness conditions the model is set to increase the crack width when the dry zone depth is greater than 3 cm using a linear relationship until it reaches a user defined maximum value 5 d i 1 d m i n d i d m i n d i δ d d m i n d i d m a x d m a x d i d m a x where d i 1 is the new crack width cm d i is crack width on the previous day cm d m a x and d m i n are maximum and minimum crack widths respectively cm and δ d is daily change in crack width cm similarly if the dry zone is 3 cm or less the crack width declines until it reaches a minimum defined value can be set to zero the same equation applies for cylindrical pores maximum and minimum crack widths or pore diameter are input parameters that can be estimated based on field observations or from the literature and further adjusted during model calibration the user defines the two fixed daily values that can be added to or subtracted from the crack width based on antecedent moisture conditions in other words the user has a great control over defining the shape and dynamics of macropores tillage mixes the soil and reduces the connectivity of macropores according to the depth and intensity of tillage williams et al 2018 2016 the model simulates the tillage effect on macropore connectivity by assuming that cracks reach the minimum value after a tillage event and remains for 5 days before cracks can start to redevelop again the assumption is based on a study that showed continuous macropores can redevelop shortly after a tillage practice andreini and steenhuis 1990 3 model testing 3 1 field description the modified version of drainmod was tested using a data set collected from a privately owned field located in paulding county northwestern ohio fig 4 the study site is a part of the edge of field eof research network established at the eastern corn belt ecb of ohio and supervised by the usda agricultural research service usda ars the field is tile drained drain spacing 12 2 m 40 ft drain depth 0 6 m 2 ft and has a relatively flat slope about 2 dominant soil types based on the web soil survey are paulding clay very fine illitic nonacid mesic typic epiaquepts and roselms silty clay very fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs which are very poorly drained soils with low permeability and high clay content these soils are subjected to severe cracking during summer with crack widths typically ranging from 20 50 mm making macropore flow a significant component of field hydrology fig 5 the field is managed under a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and wheat triticum aestivum l rotation with tillage taking place usually after wheat harvest 3 2 measured data detailed description of the methods used for monitoring the field hydrology has been previously reported by king et al 2018 pease et al 2018 and williams et al 2016 briefly precipitation surface runoff and subsurface drainage are monitored continuously at the field however the delineated area contributing to surface runoff 7 3 ha is different from the area contributing to tile drainage 8 7 ha with different points of measurement fig 4 four years of measured data were available for this study between 2013 and 2016 precipitation was measured onsite every 10 min using a tipping bucket rain gauge teledyne isco 674 a standard rain gauge novalynx 260 2510 was used for backup and bulk precipitation measurement wing walls were installed to channel and route overland flow through a 0 61 m h flume tracom inc alpharetta georgia installed at the surface runoff monitoring station a compound weir insert thel mar brevard nc was installed at the tile outlet to measure tile drainage water flow was recorded on a 10 minute interval at both surface and subsurface drainage outlets using an isco 4230 bubbler flow meter 4 drainmod initialization and parameterization 4 1 drainage system drainage design parameters required by drainmod are listed in table 1 the drainage coefficient was set as the highest measured daily subsurface drainage flow rate during the 4 year study period a value of 0 51 cm was used for the effective drain radius as suggested in the drainmod reference report skaggs 1980 the maximum surface storage depth is a calibrated parameter and kirkham s depth was assumed to be half that depth the depth of the last soil layer was set as the depth to the restrictive layer initial wtd is required by drainmod for running the hydrology simulation to minimize uncertainty in this parameter we started the simulations one year earlier as management planting and harvesting dates were available for 2012 studying the water balance at the test site indicated existence of seepage therefore seepage losses were considered in the simulations we assumed the restrictive layer to be 100 cm thick with a piezometric head of 100 cm at the layer bottom to allow continuous vertical seepage 4 2 soil properties no soil input data were available for this site therefore soil related input parameters were initially obtained from the literature and adjusted later during the calibration process based on the usda nrcs web soil survey these soils have five major layers with very low hydraulic conductivity physical and hydraulic properties of paulding clay and roselms silty clay soils were previously reported for a small watershed in defiance county northwestern ohio using 34 samples from 9 soil profiles öztekin 2000 öztekin et al 2007 defiance county boarders paulding county with similar soil formation composition and behavior gunn et al 2018 conducted drainmod hydrology simulations for a paulding clay soil in defiance county they obtained soil physical properties from the ssurgo database except for saturated hydraulic conductivity that was measured onsite gunn et al 2018 we initiated the drainmod soil related parameters based on the soil properties reported in the previously mentioned studies a summary of soil physical and hydrological properties used in drainmod simulations are listed in table 2 the soil water characteristic relationships for the five soil layers were obtained from the gunn et al 2018 study for paulding clay soil saturated hydraulic conductivities table 2 and green ampt infiltration parameters table sm 1 were initialized using values presented by gunn et al 2018 and changed during calibration to improve model predictions although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first 3 8 cm h 1 and second 1 5 cm h 1 layers are relatively high in our simulations compared to the values 0 03 0 08 cm h 1 reported by gunn et al 2018 it still lies within the range 0 36 8 9 cm h 1 measured by öztekin et al 2007 and reported in the ssurgo data the higher values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the upper soil layers also reflect the impact of dead ended macropores on increasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix we initiated the wtd volume drained relationship using the curve estimated by skaggs et al 1981 for toledo silty clay soil located in north central ohio the toledo soil series is a very slowly drained soil skaggs et al 1981 with similar characteristics of the paulding soil series the wtd volume drained relationship was further adjusted during model calibration for better predictions fig sm 1 the steady state upward flux wtd relationship was set as 0 47 cm hr 1 at the soil surface and set to zero below the depth of 120 cm particle size analysis was performed for soil samples collected from the top layer at the paulding site and average values representing the sand silt and clay percentages are given in table 2 the texture of the deeper layers was estimated using the ssurgo data most of the temperature parameters were obtained from luo et al 2001 2000 and adjusted during the calibration process table sm 2 soil temperature at the bottom of the soil profile was set as the average value of the daily recorded temperatures for the whole simulation period willis et al 1961 indicated that the critical ice content for stopping infiltration can be approximated as 60 0 28 cm3 cm 3 of the field capacity 0 47 cm3 cm 3 however we increased the value to 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in order to improve model predictions during winter 4 3 weather data drainmod hourly precipitation input file was generated using the 10 min precipitation data measured onsite the hourly precipitation data were useful for accurately representing the water dynamics on the soil surface daily precipitation data obtained from noaa for a station located 13 km away from the study site were used for the year of 2012 as hourly data were not available the temperature based thornthwaite method was used for estimating daily pet values maximum and minimum daily temperature data were obtained from a station at the ohio agriculture research development center oardc weather system located approximately 72 km from the study site at hoytville wood county however the thornthwaite method is known to over estimate pet during summer growing season and under estimate pet during fall winter and spring months skaggs et al 2012 therefore monthly correction factors were used to get more reliable pet estimates we initiated reasonable estimates for the monthly pet correction factors based on previous drainmod studies that were conducted in the u s midwest region negm et al 2017 2016 2014 öztekin 2000 shedekar 2015 thorp et al 2009 wang et al 2006 adjusted pet correction factors are shown in table sm 3 annual heat index was calculated as the sum of the monthly thornthwaite heat indices and found to be 46 the value coincides with the heat index used by shedekar 2016 for a study conducted in ohio 4 4 macropore flow based on our observations of uniformly distributed cracks up to 4 cm wide between corn rows under dry conditions fig 5 we used the hagen poiseuille equation for planar cracks implemented in drainmod eq 3b in our simulations we only considered cracks that are directly connected to subsurface drains therefore our estimate of the total crack length was 1 0 m per m2 0 01 cm cm 2 with a maximum crack width of 0 5 cm as we only represent the cracks connected to tile drains table 3 the reader is referred to the following references for macroporosity estimates for different soil types and textures beven and germann 1982 buczko et al 2006 watson and luxmoore 1986 the minimum width is a calibration parameter and can be set to zero however the parameter was set to 0 0033 cm as we believe cracks at the paulding site never close completely even during the wet months dryness and wetness coefficients represent the rate of change of the crack width during the dry periods and wet periods respectively we changed these two parameters until an acceptable agreement between measured and predicted drainage values was reached 5 model calibration and validation drainmod has frequently been calibrated and validated by comparing predicted subsurface drainage to field measurements negm et al 2017 2014 thorp et al 2009 for studies with available wtd measurements the model was calibrated using both subsurface drainage and wtd youssef et al 2006 surface runoff is rarely measured and to the extent of our knowledge it has not been used for model calibration and validation before this is attributed to the difficulty of measuring surface runoff and the high level of uncertainty associated with these measurements skaggs et al 2012 suggested that at least one year of measured data is required for calibrating the drainmod model four years of data 2013 2016 were available for this study data collected during 2013 and 2014 were used for model calibration while data measured in 2015 and 2016 were used for model validation the model was calibrated using only subsurface drainage as wtd was not measured during the test period the overall goal of the model calibration was to adjust the model input parameters within reasonable ranges to minimize differences between predicted and measured values during the calibration process we first focused on adjusting the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity volume drained wtd relationship pet correction factors and maximum allowed surface storage as the model predictions were very sensitive to those parameters later we calibrated the parameters related to freezing thawing and snowmelt to improve the model predictions during the winter period finally parameters related to macropore flow including minimum crack width and dryness and wetness macropore flow factors were adjusted to improve the peak drainage predictions during large precipitation events 6 performance evaluation criteria we evaluated model performance using graphical and statistical measures we visually assessed the model s ability to capture variations in hydrologic measurements over time as affected by different weather soil and plant related factors based on common model performance measures reviewed by moriasi et al 2015 and recommended by skaggs et al 2012 the nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse and percent error pe have been selected to evaluate the agreement between measured data and model predictions on a daily monthly and annual basis the nse is a widely used statistical model performance indicator that compares model predictions to the mean of observed values nse can range from to 1 0 with 1 0 indicating a perfect fit values of nse 0 indicates that the mean of measured values is a better predictor than the model one of the disadvantages of the nse is the sensitivity to extreme values the other statistical measure pe gives values ranging from to and 0 0 being the optimal value the pe measure can sometimes be misleading if the over predictions and under predictions of the model have similar magnitudes and cancel each other however the method can generally be useful in evaluating systematic over or under predictions by the model threshold values for the goodness of fit by these statistical metrics have been previously reported moriasi et al 2015 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 skaggs et al 2012 according to skaggs et al 2012 the model performance in predicting daily or monthly drainage flow can be rated as acceptable daily nse 0 4 or monthly nse 0 5 good daily nse 0 6 or monthly nse 0 7 or excellent daily nse 0 75 or monthly nse 0 8 the same daily nse thresholds apply for evaluating wtd predictions most of the data sets used for previous drainmod applications did not include measured surface runoff as measuring this hydrologic component is difficult and has high uncertainty in the measurements therefore skaggs et al 2012 did not provide an evaluation criteria for the model performance in predicting surface runoff as the measured runoff is highly unlikely to be available in this study the nse was used to evaluate the model performance using daily and monthly values while pe is used for evaluating the error percentage of the annual predictions 7 results and discussion 7 1 field climatic conditions over the 4 year monitoring period annual precipitation ranged from 81 7 cm in 2014 to 106 3 cm in 2015 with an average of 92 3 cm based on noaa climate data the 30 year 1981 2010 average annual precipitation for paulding county is 89 9 cm arguez et al 2012 annual precipitation for the test field was close to normal in 2013 2 and 2016 0 slightly less than the long term average in 2014 9 and considerably higher than the long term average in 2015 18 the long term data show that the least monthly precipitation occurs in the winter months jan 5 3 cm feb 4 9 cm dec 6 5 cm and highest precipitation occurs in the months of may 10 6 cm june 9 1 cm and july 9 7 cm however monthly precipitation at the test site exhibited strong variation deviating from the long term monthly values for example 2015 had substantially lesser precipitation in january and february and significantly greater precipitation in may june and july in 2016 the monthly precipitation considerably deviated from long term average values in six months march june and september were wetter and may july and december were drier the long term monthly temperatures for the winter months averaged 4 7 2 9 and 2 1 c in january february and december respectively and for the summer months averaged 20 6 22 4 and 21 3 c in june july and august respectively with few exceptions conditions were generally freezing during the winter months for all years exceptions include december 2015 that was warmer 5 3 c compared to the normal conditions 2 1 c in december substantial freezing conditions existed in february 2014 8 1 c and 2015 10 6 c average temperature during january 2013 and 2016 differed by about 2 c compared to the long term average temperature temperature variations were limited during the summer period and ranged between 19 9 24 4 c for the entire simulation period the average temperature 10 1 c was comparable to the long term average for the paulding county 9 5 c however the average annual temperature for the test field was less than the long term average in 2014 8 8 c close to normal conditions in 2013 9 9 c and 2015 10 1 c and above normal conditions in 2016 11 7 c therefore the testing field exhibited high variability in weather conditions during the testing period 7 2 subsurface drainage and macropore flow predictions field measurements showed that subsurface drainage patterns did not necessarily follow precipitation patterns in all years the greatest annual subsurface drainage 22 9 cm occurred in a year with an average precipitation 2013 while the wettest year 2015 had an annual subsurface drainage of only 19 3 cm it should be noted that water draining through the soil profile is not only affected by the soil hydraulic conductivity but also by the precipitation intensity infiltration capacity antecedent soil moisture conditions and et precipitation rates greater than the soil infiltration capacity at the site resulted in accumulation of water on the soil surface that can be lost as surface runoff particularly in these poorly drained soils for instance a 6 8 cm storm event occurring over a 9 hr period on july 9th in 2015 generated only 0 6 cm of subsurface drainage while 37 2 5 cm of precipitation was lost as surface runoff over the four year simulation period the modified drainmod model predicted an average subsurface drainage of 16 5 cm and ranged from 12 3 cm in 2014 to 21 1 cm in 2015 table 4 approximately 18 of mean annual precipitation was lost through subsurface drainage represented by total flow from both soil matrix and macropores daily subsurface drainage predicted by the modified drainmod consistently followed measured values with instances of over prediction or under prediction fig 6 the statistical performance measures nse for daily and monthly predictions and pe for annual predictions assessing the agreement between measured and predicted subsurface drainage are given in table 5 subsurface drainage was under predicted during the calibration period by 26 and over predicted during the validation period by 14 over the entire simulation period the modified drainmod predicted a cumulative subsurface drainage of 65 9 cm compared to 71 5 cm of measured drainage daily nse for subsurface drainage predictions ranged from 0 56 in 2015 to 0 31 in 2016 with an average value of 0 48 according to the evaluation criteria recommended by skaggs et al 2012 the performance of the modified model for predicting subsurface drainage can be rated as good for 2015 acceptable for 2013 and 2014 and poor for 2016 macropore flow occurred during a total of 98 days during the four year simulation period the flow capacity of the macropores calculated by the hagen poiseuille s equation was exceeded in 66 of those 98 days 67 this is characterized by the number of days with both macropore flow and surface runoff as the model gives priority to macropore flow before any surface runoff takes place from a seasonal perspective macropore flow capacity was exceeded during 23 days in the spring when snowmelt occurred and during 4 days only in the fall season in summer 2015 macropore flow capacity was exceeded in 12 days as a result of the high rainfall events during this period on average the modified model predicted that macropore flow contributed 15 of annual subsurface drainage and ranged from 10 in 2016 to 18 in 2014 with few exceptions predicted macropore flow mainly occurred during late winter and early spring during snowmelt fig 7 exceptions include january 2013 and summer of 2015 during large precipitation events fig 7 in 2013 a large precipitation event 6 cm that lasted for 7 h started late jan 12th and continued to the early hours of the next day average temperature in january 2013 2 2 c was above long term average 4 7 c and on jan 12th 2013 the minimum and maximum air temperatures were 8 9 c and 15 5 c respectively consequently precipitation was in the form of rain and the model predicted that 6 0 4 cm of it was lost through macropores to subsurface drains as mentioned earlier we believe that the soil cracks at the test site do not close completely even during the winter period therefore we used a minimum crack width of 0 033 mm resulting in preferentially draining ponding water all year round 7 3 surface runoff predictions surface runoff was monitored over the entire simulation period annual measured surface runoff averaged 5 9 cm for the 4 year simulation period with a minimum of 2 1 cm in 2014 and a maximum of 15 3 cm in 2015 table 8 according to measurements about 6 of annual precipitation was lost through surface runoff however this percentage varied greatly during the study period it was relatively high during the wet year of 2015 14 and relatively low in 2014 3 and 2016 3 surface runoff is very likely to occur during high intensity precipitation events as a result of saturated soil conditions or during precipitation rates greater than the soil infiltration capacity for instance about 30 of a 5 1 cm precipitation that was received during a 1 hour storm event on june 12th 2015 was lost as surface runoff for the entire simulation period the modified drainmod model predicted substantially greater surface runoff than measured tables 4 6 and fig 8 the 4 year cumulative surface runoff predicted was 51 9 cm compared to only 23 7 cm of measured runoff predicted surface runoff widely varied among the years from 6 7 cm in 2016 to 22 5 cm in 2015 the modified model predictions indicate that about 14 of annual precipitation was lost through surface runoff table 6 year 2015 an exceptionally wet year contributed to more than 43 of cumulative surface runoff during the 4 year study period our simulations indicated that the deviation of monthly runoff predictions from measurements increased during the months with precipitation greater than the monthly noaa precipitation averages however this does not explain the extremely high surface runoff predictions our initial assumption was that the wide cracks fig 5 served as vertical channels during the summer and conducted water to adjacent fields or to the creek located northwest of the field and branching from the auglaize river fig 4 however that assumption was not valid for other cases as surface runoff was greatly over predicted during the winter months of 2013 as well as the spring season of 2014 fig 8 therefore more investigations were conducted as discussed in the following sections to study other hydrological pathways by which water could have left the field and possible source of errors and uncertainties 7 4 evapotranspiration seepage and water table depth predictions evapotranspiration is a major component by which water is removed from the soil profile at the test field average annual et predicted by the modified drainmod was approximately 57 cm table 6 this value indicates that on average 62 of precipitation was lost as et although no direct et measurements were available for the test site to validate the accuracy of the model predictions predicted average annual et was comparable to values predicted by other studies for instance et averaged 66 2 cm and represented 67 of average annual precipitation at a site located in ohio as predicted by shedekar 2016 using drainmod youssef et al 2018 conducted a regional simulation study to investigate the effect of drainage water management on field hydrology and nitrogen losses at 48 locations across the midwest region of the usa using drainmod nii seven locations in ohio were included in their study with predicted annual average et ranging from 48 4 59 3 cm for free drainage treatment and representing about 58 of average annual precipitation youssef et al 2018 predicted an average annual et of 54 7 cm at a site located in dayton oh receiving 93 cm average annual precipitation under the assumptions made for the seepage component section 4 1 the model predicted that on average 5 2 cm range 4 9 5 6 cm of water was lost through vertical seepage annually table 6 the value indicates that approximately 6 of precipitation was lost as vertical seepage in the study conducted by youssef et al 2018 vertical seepage averaged approximately 4 0 cm for the 48 midwestern sites and ranged from 3 9 to 4 1 cm for the ohio sites the wtd averaged 47 60 60 and 70 cm in 2013 through 2016 respectively according to the model predictions the site conditions were relatively wet during the growing season may september of 2015 and dry in 2014 and 2016 for the same period water table depth was not measured at the test field thus we could not validate the wtd predictions however there is a possibility that the simplified approaches used for representing dead ended macropores could have affected the wtd predictions in the modified drainmod model macropores that are not connected to drains were implicitly represented in the model by increasing the soil hydraulic conductivity as the relatively higher values represented the combined effect of macropores and soil matrix domain on soil water movement in reality cracks are distributed all over the field and draining water to depths beneath the shallow drains 60 cm deep at the site fig 1 furthermore the blocky soil structure with vertical and lateral cracks allows the waterfront to propagate faster than what is predicted by the model for homogenous domains therefore in highly dynamic soils subjected to swelling and shrinkage with large cracking during the summer period this assumption might not be totally valid 7 5 annual water budget annual water mass balance was conducted using field measurements precipitation subsurface drainage and surface runoff and model predictions et vertical seepage and change in storage the water budget was not balanced for all years with an average annual 6 4 cm lack of closure table 8 this imbalanced water budget indicates that a certain amount of precipitated water is not accounted for through different water flow pathways for the entire simulation period the cumulative water budget imbalance reached about 26 cm of missing water however more than 38 of that imbalance was in 2015 9 6 cm the imbalanced water budget highlights that inaccuracy in model predictions uncertainty in field measurements or a combination of these two resulted in the lack of water balance closure according to the study conducted by youssef et al 2018 both et and vertical seepage predicted by the modified drainmod are on the higher side for the study field therefore we doubt that these two pathways are the source of the annual water budget imbalance however as mentioned earlier there is high uncertainty in estimating the area contributing to surface runoff measurements arising from the challenges in accurately defining the area and in routing overland flow from several hectares into a specific outlet therefore surface runoff measurements might have significantly contributed to the annual water budget imbalance discrepancies between measured and predicted subsurface drainage can be partially attributed to assumptions made in drainmod for representing dead ended macropores vertical cracks at the test site reaching 2 4 cm wide and extending to a depth below the subsurface drains in summer fig 5 can store considerable amounts of water even before the deeper soil layers reaches saturation the water stored in dead ended macropores can transfer slowly into the soil matrix layers that have not reached saturation yet fig 3 at saturation soil cracks shrink in size causing changes in hydraulic properties of the soil matrix and adding another level of complexity to modeling the system although the relatively simplified approaches used for representing macropore flow in the modified drainmod might have contributed to the discrepancies between measured and predicted subsurface drainage it cannot be the only source of error for the lack of water budget closure our representation of the field hydrology was constrained by the data availability detailed data sets with accurate estimations of the area contributing to surface runoff studies of the crack geometry temporal crack dynamics with soil moisture and wtd measurements would be beneficial for future model testing 7 6 comparison to the original drainmod model apart from the new macropore component all other input parameters for both models were exactly the same the performance of the original drainmod model with no macropore flow component is summarized in table 5 the original model under predicted annual subsurface drainage for the calibration years 2013 2014 by about 32 and over predicted subsurface flow for the validation years 2015 2016 by 7 over the entire simulation period the original drainmod under predicted subsurface drainage by 14 compared to only 8 under prediction by the modified drainmod model the new macropore flow component allowed the modified model to capture peak drainage flows in most cases and improved subsurface drainage predictions of several events that were either under predicted or completely missed by the original model for instance on feb 20th in 2014 the modified model was able to predict 66 of measured subsurface drainage 0 43 cm while the original model only predicted 14 of the flow volume on jul 23rd 2016 the modified model predicted 28 of the flow event 0 45 cm occurred on that day and was completely missed by the original model results show that the modified drainmod model slightly improved daily drainage predictions compared to the original model as indicted by the increase in the average daily nse from 0 42 for the original model to 0 48 for the modified model monthly nse averaged 0 59 for both models in predicting monthly subsurface drainage and their performance was comparable on an annual basis the modified model improved the under prediction of subsurface drainage in the calibration years from 32 to 26 but increased the over prediction for the validation years from 7 to 14 over the 4 year simulation period both models predicted significant larger volumes of surface runoff than measured on average annual surface runoff represented 15 of precipitation as predicted by the original model with a cumulative value of 55 7 cm compared to 23 7 cm of measured runoff the modified drainmod model predicted less cumulative surface runoff volume 51 9 cm as part of the water was routed through macropores connected to subsurface drains et and seepage predicted by the original and modified models were comparable similarities in et and vertical seepage predicted by the original and modified drainmod models were attributed to the close wtd predictions by both models with an annual average value of 60 cm 8 conclusions the drainmod model has been modified to simulate macropore flow and tested using four years 2013 2016 of measured hydrologic data from a subsurface drained field site located at northwest ohio u s the soils at the test field site are characterized by low hydraulic conductivity and large cracking during the summer period simple approaches were used to represent flow through macropores directly connected to subsurface drains by assuming bypass flow of water ponded on the soil surface ponding depths greater than kirkham s depth to the subsurface drain without interaction with the soil matrix domain the capacity of macropores to drain water is calculated using the hagen poiseuille s equation however the effect of dead ended macropores not directly connected to the drain on accelerating drainage flow was implicitly considered by increasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix domain simulation results showed that the modified drainmod model improved daily subsurface drainage predictions compared to the original version the new macropore component enhanced daily peak flow predictions that were under estimated or completely missed by the original model both models over predicted surface runoff for the entire simulation period this was most likely due to the high uncertainty in surface runoff measurements which was evident by the lack of closure of the annual water budget surface runoff measurements are challenging because of potential errors in identifying the runoff contributing area and the transmission losses during runoff routing to the measurement point at the field edge the modification of drainmod to simulate macropore flow is considered to be an essential step towards developing drainmod p as it allows for partitioning subsurface drainage into matrix flow and macropore flow components macropores can significantly contribute to phosphorus losses in subsurface drained agricultural lands as it serves as a direct conduit connecting the soil surface to subsurface drains further model testing is needed to validate the simple empirical approaches used in drainmod for representing processes affecting macropore flow at subsurface drained agricultural fields for rigorous model testing water table depth measurements must be available in addition to subsurface drainage and surface runoff field measurement of model inputs characterizing macropore flow
