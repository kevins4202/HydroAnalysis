25190,taylor s law tl is an empirical rule describing the approximate relationship between the variance and the mean of population density log10 variance log10 a b log10 mean although tl has been verified in various ecological systems essential questions remain unanswered why is tl so widely observed what mechanisms or processes generate tl why do most observed slopes b fall in the limited range 1 b 2 density dependent movement of individuals among populations has been proposed as a mechanism that leads to tl with slopes 1 b 2 we used the gompertz model a second order autoregressive model of the logarithm of population density to analyze the temporal tl of gray sided vole populations our extensive simulations using various combinations of model parameters for environmental variability and density dependence demonstrated that sustainable populations could obey tl in the absence of density dependent movement among populations and identified the parameter combinations that produced slopes 1 b 2 when environmental variability was low and density dependence was intermediate simulated data sets showed higher probabilities for 1 b 2 but the probability was not very high in general slopes became steeper b increased as environmental variability increased and as density dependence coefficients decreased in the gompertz model both environmental variability and density dependence cause population density to vary and on the logarithmic scale of population density those effects are symmetric above and below the equilibrium density however effects of the variability are higher above the equilibrium density on the natural scale of population density and thus the mean of population density increases with increasing population variability therefore the temporal tl can be formed when population density is measured in the natural scale in sustainable populations well described by the gompertz model the slope b can be determined by the interplay of environmental variability and density dependence keywords autoregressive time series density dependence environmental variability rodents slope taylor s law 1 introduction taylor s law tl taylor 1961 is an empirical rule describing the approximate relationship between the variance and the mean of population density it has been widely verified in various ecological systems taylor 1986 and many other fields eisler et al 2008 tippett and cohen 2016 tl asserts that the variance is approximately a power law function of the mean variance a mean b a 0 it is usually rewritten 1 log10 variance log10 a b log10 mean neither of these equations specifies the deviations from an exact relationship i e the error term in tl the mean and the variance of population density can be calculated temporally and spatially in the temporal tl the mean and the variance are calculated over observations of population density at different times in a given location while in the spatial tl the mean and the variance are calculated over observations of population density in different spatial locations at a given time the temporal mean of population density may depend primarily on habitat quality while the temporal variance of population density may be produced primarily by population dynamics in interaction with environmental variable factors which broadly include abiotic e g climatic chemical physical and biotic e g trophic parasitic allelopathic effects on a given species this study investigated the relative contributions of population dynamics and environmental variability in shaping the form and parameters of the temporal variance mean relationship many theoretical models and interpretations of tl have been proposed but none has gained widespread acceptance essential questions remain unanswered why is tl so widely observed what mechanisms or processes generate tl why do most observed slopes satisfy 1 b 2 although combined empirical and theoretical studies should be conducted to answer these questions many previous empirical studies have verified tl without testing the details of any model that leads to tl while theoretical models that lead to tl have often lacked detailed empirical verification of the processes assumed see reviews by taylor 1986 kendal 2004 eisler et al 2008 but as exceptions see cohen et al 2013 linnerud et al 2013 we found previously that the population density of the gray sided vole myodes rufocanus sundevall 1846 in hokkaido satisfied the temporal tl and the estimated slope 1 613 was in 1 b 2 cohen and saitoh 2016 moreover cohen and saitoh 2016 showed that the densities of different vole populations were not independent the gompertz model which describes well the dynamics of the logarithm of population density of those populations royama 1977 1992 stenseth 1999 stenseth et al 2003 generated time series of density on the original scale of measurement that satisfied the form of temporal tl but under the assumption that different populations were independent the slope b 2 699 of the simulated tl was significantly steeper than the slope of the empirical populations we attributed this discrepancy to the assumed independence of simulated time series in contrast to the independent simulated time series empirical populations may inhabit habitats of varying quality may be subject to correlated environmental influences the moran effect and may experience density dependent movements from a higher quality habitat to a lower quality habitat density dependent movement reduces the temporal mean and variance of populations in higher quality habitats while it enhances the temporal mean and variance of populations in lower quality habitats therefore density dependent movements could lower the temporal slope of tl as taylor and taylor 1977 and perry 1988 suggested synchrony of populations produced by the moran effect could also lower the slopes of the spatial tl reuman et al 2017 density dependent movements however seem unrealistic for the studied vole populations because the distance between the studied vole populations is far beyond the movement ability of individuals of the gray sided vole the mean geographic distance between the observed populations was 8 4 km while most natal dispersals of individuals are recorded within several hundred meters ishibashi and saitoh 2008 although some long distance movements of up to several kilometers have been reported in some arvicoline rodent populations which are highly variable see le galliard et al 2012 for a review therefore we shall test whether tl can be formed with realistic values of the slope parameter b even in the absence of demographically significant migration here we report detailed simulations of the temporal tl for the empirical populations of the gray sided vole using the gompertz model with extensive combinations of model parameters these results will shed light on the above general questions about tl in this situation modelling of population dynamics is a powerful approach to simulating observed populations analyzing effects of model parameters and considering underlying mechanisms of the temporal tl anderson et al 1982 proposed a markovian population model where chance demographic events could lead to the temporal tl by the adjustment of the relative rates governing birth death immigration and emigration perry 1988 demonstrated that models based on density dependent movement could yield the temporal tl hanski and woiwod 1993 simulated populations where the intrinsic growth rate of populations was subjected to a random component these simulated populations approximated the temporal tl all of these attempts however relied upon arbitrary approximations transformations or constraints to achieve the goal kendal 2004 in addition the models of population dynamics used by those studies were not tested to evaluate whether they could describe empirical populations well and some models were unrealistic for example anderson et al 1982 assumed a potentially infinite increase of population density and perry 1988 assumed density dependent movement that is unrealistic at least for the studied populations of the gray sided vole linnerud et al 2013 analyzed density dependence and stochastic effects on the temporal tl using empirical data on avian populations and modified logistic models they claimed that slopes of the temporal tl were influenced by interspecific variation in life history parameters adult survival and clutch size however their examined parameter space of population dynamics was limited in contrast royama 1977 1992 examined the relationship between the density dependence coefficients and the population dynamics of the gompertz model details below and identified the parameter space of density dependence coefficients where populations are sustainable mathematically speaking where the second order autoregressive model is stationary and ergodic therefore we can thoroughly analyze effects of density dependence on the temporal tl for sustainable populations using the gompertz model with fewer arbitrary approximations or assumptions here we will show first that the variability of population density derives from both environmental variability and density dependence second by extensive analyses of environmental variability and density dependence coefficients without assuming density dependent movements or environmentally caused synchrony we will show that sustainable populations satisfy the temporal tl and will identify parameter combinations that are more likely to produce slopes 1 b 2 further we will show that a driving force of the temporal tl formation is population variability but not the variation of the equilibrium density 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and data hokkaido is the northernmost island of japan 78 073 km2 the gray sided vole myodes rufocanus sundevall 1846 is the commonest species of rodents on this island kaneko et al 1998 a systematic survey of rodent populations has been carried out in hokkaido by forestry agency of japanese government the geography of hokkaido and the data collection were described previously saitoh et al 1997 1998 stenseth et al 2003 we analyzed the same data set of the gray sided vole as cohen and saitoh 2016 n 85 populations in different locations covering t 31 years 1962 1992 population density was defined as the number of voles per 150 trap nights because 50 snap traps for three consecutive nights on a 0 5 ha survey plot was a standard unit of the rodent survey the bayesian method was applied to the estimation of population density for each year and location based on a state space model by using winbugs version 1 4 3 spiegelhalter et al 2003 http www mrc bsu cam ac uk software bugs in our previous study cohen and saitoh 2016 population density was estimated assuming that the number of voles caught increased in proportion to trapping effort however there were some limitations imposed by the trapping method because the basic unit of trapping was 150 trap nights the number of catches could not exceed 150 per unit new codes for winbugs were developed taking the constraints of trapping into consideration in addition non target species of rodents apodemus argenteus a speciosus and other minor species than the target species myodes rufocanus provided some small proportion of caught rodents although the target species dominated other species saitoh and nakatsu 1997 traps occupied by other species should not be considered effective traps therefore we subtracted the number of catches with non target species from the number of trap nights the new codes for winbugs are available as appendix b in supplementary material the raw counts of voles trapped the trapping effort the total number of trap nights excluding traps occupied by non target species and the resulting bayes population estimates are available in a spreadsheet file as appendices h k although we used the natural logarithm of the number of individual voles trapped per unit of trapping effort one trap night for the analysis by winbugs we transformed the estimates back to the original scale of measurement the number of voles captured per 150 trap nights the basic unit of trapping for the following analyses of tl 2 2 temporal taylor s law the mean and the variance were calculated over observations of population density at different times in a given location and one data point log10 temporal mean log10 temporal variance was plotted for each location ordinary least squares regression ols was used to test the temporal tl by fitting eq 1 to log10 temporal mean and log10 temporal variance of the vole populations and simulated time series 2 3 gompertz model we used the second order autoregressive model the gompertz model eq 2 to describe population dynamics of the gray sided vole in this model for each population j 1 85 xt j was the natural logarithm of bayesian estimate of the observed density nt j in year t 1962 1992 x j was the temporal mean of xt j in population j and x t j x j was the centered time series on the logarithmic scale in population j the gompertz model supposes that 2 xt j x j 1 a 1 j xt 1 j x j a 2 j xt 2 j x j et j where for each population j the parameters a 1 j and a 2 j are the coefficient of density dependence for a 1 year lag and for a 2 year lag respectively the error term et j represents density independent effects environmental variability modeled as random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a variance sd j 2 fitting the gompertz model eq 2 to the centered time series x t j x j yielded bayesian estimates of a 1 j a 2 j and sd j see the winbugs codes in appendix b in supplementary material for details stenseth et al 1996 assessed the order of the autoregressive model by fitting the models to the gray sided vole populations in hokkaido and demonstrated that the second order is parsimonious in 93 of the populations second or lower order was selected as the best model population density depends on habitat quality in a higher quality habitat a population would be expected to show a higher mean population density when an equilibrium exists it can be modeled as the mean density x j in the gompertz model fig 1 a which equals the natural logarithm of the geometric mean density on the original scale of density a population may stay at its equilibrium density if no perturbation affects its population density however most environments are variable and a population may be forced to move from the equilibrium by environmental variability arrows away from the equilibrium a sustainable population never continues moving further from the equilibrium but rather displays a tendency to return to the equilibrium arrows toward the equilibrium such return tendency is defined as density dependence therefore apart from the effects of dispersal of individuals from and to other populations which we take as zero in the present study a population is limited by the equilibrium related to habitat quality is varied by environmental variability and is regulated by density dependence in general although effects of density dependence are not simple and can enhance the variability of population dynamics combined with environmental variability royama 1977 1992 used standard results from the statistical theory of second order autoregressive time series e g box and jenkins 1970 pp 58 63 to analyze the relationship between fluctuation patterns of population dynamics and the density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 fig 1b inside the triangle of fig 1b assuming sd j 0 hence no environmental variability the dynamics is either point stability or damped fluctuations fluctuations will persist if any stochasticity exists sd j 0 in general less variable populations show parameters in the upper right part i of the triangle bjørnstad et al 1995 appendix g in supplementary material gives some new mathematical analysis of taylor s law for second order autoregressive time series 2 4 simulations we carried out five simulations called fundamental simulation i fundamental simulation ii synchronized simulation parameter combination simulation i and parameter combination simulation ii we distinguish the observed values xt j in eq 2 from the simulated values yt j in eq 3 3 yt j 1 a 1 j yt 1 j x j a 2 j yt 2 j x j x j et j the initial two observed log transformed values x 1 j x 2 j were used for the first two values y 1 j x 1 j and y 2 j x 2 j of each simulated population the state variable in all simulations was the centered log transformed population density y t j x j 2 4 1 fundamental simulations i and ii in the fundamental simulation i we used the population specific estimates of a 1 j and a 2 j and sd j corresponding to the 85 observed populations and generated 85 time series spanning 31 years yt j the environmental variability et j was assumed to be uncorrelated between different years t and between any two populations for each population j separately a primary et j was given as independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance sd j 2 n t j 0 sd j 2 since the length of et j was limited to 31 years the mean and the sd of simulated environmental variability et j were accidentally higher or lower than expected to adjust the mean and the sd the primary et j was then adjusted by the following equation the adjusted et j the primary et j temporal mean the primary e j sd j temporal sd the primary e j the fundamental simulations i and ii used the adjusted et j as the simulated environmental variability one thousand data sets each of which consisted of the 85 simulated time series were generated the generated values were then transformed back by exponentiation to the original scale of population density and temporal means and variances were computed on the original scale of population density for tests of the temporal tl using the ols regression some unrealistically high values for population densities were observed in simulated time series of the fundamental simulation i a small number of simulated values 0 52 were higher than the maximum of density estimates 0 1955 on the loge scale equivalent to 123 4 per 150 trap nights in the original scale for the observed populations the lowest simulated value was very close to that for the observed populations since those unrealistically high values caused higher variances of population density in simulated time series an upper limit was set in the fundamental simulation ii when a simulated value exceeded 0 1955 that value was replaced with 0 1955 other procedures of the simulation were the same as those of the fundamental simulation i the temporal tl was tested for each of 1000 simulations of 85 populations using the ols regression 2 4 2 synchronized simulations to synchronize et we first generated a fixed baseline error time series et 0 of 31 independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance 1 then we generated 85 correlated time series et j j 1 85 of length 31 years t 1 31 using the formula primary et j ρ et 0 1 ρ2 1 2 n t j 0 sd j 2 where n t j 0 sd j 2 are independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance sd j 2 and the primary et j was rescaled as in the fundamental simulations i and ii the adjusted et j the primary et j temporal mean the primary e j sd j temporal sd the primary e j we tuned ρ to 0 69 so that the average correlation among simulated time series the range of the average correlations 0 216 0 294 closely approximated the average correlation among the observed populations average correlation 0 277 other procedures of the simulation were the same as those of the fundamental simulation ii one thousand simulations of the 85 time series were generated the generated values were then transformed back to the original scale of population density and temporal means and variances were computed on the original scale of population density for tests of the temporal tl using the ols regression 2 4 3 parameter combination simulation i we explored which combinations of the model parameters would be more likely to generate prevailing slopes 1 b 2 by using the observed mean densities x j and various combinations of model parameters in the fundamental simulation i eq 3 to each simulated set of 85 time series spanning 31 years yt j a specific set of the parameters a 1 a 2 and sd was given in parameter combination simulation i 1 a 1 ranged from 1 95 to 1 95 with the increment of 0 05 a 2 ranged from 0 975 to 0 975 with the increment of 0 05 and sd ranged from 0 05 to 2 with the increment of 0 05 the combinations of 1 a 1 and a 2 were restricted to the range in which time series were sustainable i e 1600 combinations such that each point 1 a 1 a 2 fell within the triangle in fig 1b since simulations were carried out with 40 different sds for each combination of 1 a 1 and a 2 64 000 data sets of 31 85 yt j were generated for each data set the ols regression was used to estimate the slope of the temporal tl 2 4 4 parameter combination simulation ii in all the above simulation analyses an observed mean density was given as the equilibrium density to each simulated time series to extend the generality of those analyses various hypothetical mean densities mj were given as an equilibrium density to the gompertz model in parameter combination simulation ii 4 kt j 1 a 1 j kt 1 j mj a 2 j kt 2 j mj mj et j where mj was an equilibrium density of each time series here et j was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 the following 16 values were given as standard mean densities per 150 trap nights in the original scale for mj 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 to make the equilibrium densities vary in the simulations a normally distributed random number with mean a standard mean density and sd2 1 in the logarithmic scale was given to each simulated time series as an equilibrium density the 1600 combinations of 1 a 1 and a 2 were the same as above while the range of sd was limited between 0 05 and 1 20 cases to reduce calculation load then 85 time series spanning 31 years kt j were generated for each parameter combination and 512 000 1600 16 20 sets of 31 85 kt j were obtained in total for each such set of simulated time series the ols regression was used to estimate the slope of the temporal tl 2 5 cause and factors of taylor s law simulated time series are defined by three parameters a 1 a 2 and sd and the equilibrium density m we examined how the variance and the mean of density of the simulated times series were related to those variables through multiple regression analyses with slope b of tl as a response variable and with the parameters and the equilibrium density as explanatory variables all regressions were computed using function lm in r version 3 4 3 the critical value for statistical significance was always p 0 05 we made no corrections for simultaneous inference i e multiple tests of a null hypothesis of no effect hence approximately 5 of our apparently significant results could have arisen by chance alone 3 results 3 1 temporal taylor s laws in comparison with our previous study densities estimated in this study were higher than those in cohen and saitoh 2016 in general appendix a in supplementary material although both the mean and the variance of density estimates were higher in this study the variance increased by more than the mean therefore the slope of the temporal tl eq 1

significant evidence of nonlinearity appendix a in supplementary material we focus on the linear relationship henceforth the 3570 pairs 3570 85 84 2 of vole populations had correlation coefficients of population density that ranged from a low of 0 359 to a high of 0 886 with a mean correlation of 0 277 0 211 sd the temporal tl described all 1000 data sets generated by the fundamental simulation i

estimates of the slopes a very small number of slopes 7 0 7 were lower than the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations this means that the slopes of fundamental simulation i were mostly too high when compared with the slope estimated from observations the overall mean of mean pairwise correlation coefficients of population density for 1000 data sets was 0 007 0 003 sd which was consistent with the independence between populations assumed in fundamental simulation i the temporal tl described all 1000 data sets generated by the fundamental

smaller than 10 of the estimates of the slopes a considerable number of slopes 320 32 0 fell within the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations this means that the slopes of fundamental simulation ii were closer to the slope estimated from observations than were the slopes of fundamental simulation i but more than two thirds of the slopes were still too high the overall mean of mean pairwise correlation coefficients of population density for 1000 data sets was 0 007 0 003 sd not different from that in fundamental simulation i the temporal tl described all

were smaller than 10 of the estimates of the slopes a similar proportion of slopes 32 8 were included in the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations in comparison with those in the fundamental simulation ii this means that more than two thirds of the slopes were still too high the mean of pairwise correlation coefficients of population density ranged between 0

considered as a response variable while density dependence coefficients 1 a 1 and a 2 environmental variability sd and their pairwise products were used as explanatory variables table 1 all these explanatory variables and their products contributed significantly to explain the variation of the slope and the full model showed a moderate goodness of fit r 2 0 480 summarizing the results of this analysis slopes became steeper with the increase of sd and with the decrease of a 1 and a 2 appendix e in supplementary material for each combination of 1 a 1 and a 2 and for sd between 0 05 and 0 95 the probability that slopes fell in 1 b 2 was higher near the center of the triangle fig 4 extending toward the upper right most observed populations of the gray sided vole had values of 1 a 1 and a 2

sd and their pairwise products were used as explanatory variables showed a minor contribution of equilibrium densities table 2 appendix f in supplementary material effects of equilibrium densities and related products were not significant and the selected model consisted of a 1 a 2 sd and their pairwise products without equilibrium densities and related products 4 discussion 4 1 the gompertz model the gompertz model has been known as a model that describes well the dynamics of some populations including the populations of gray sided voles in this study royama 1977 1992 stenseth 1999 stenseth et al 1996 2003 the gompertz model has frequently been used to characterize rodent populations and compare their population dynamics among localities or periods e g stenseth 1999 cornulier et al 2013 fundamental simulations i reproduced the form of the temporal tl but not the empirical slope fig 2b for some values of the simulated mean fundamental simulation i gave an unusual simulated variance that appeared to be far higher than the observed variance associated with the observed mean that matched the simulated mean the higher variances were attributed to some unusually high values for population densities in fundamental simulation i unrealistic values of density which exceeded the maximum of density estimates per 150 trap nights in the original scale 123 4 for the observed populations were observed in 0 52 of simulated densities therefore an upper limit was introduced for simulated densities in the fundamental simulation ii a simulated density that exceeded the maximum density was replaced with the maximum density as a result 32 0 of slopes in 1000 simulated data sets were included in the 95 confidence interval of slope estimates for the observed populations fig 2c the generation of unrealistically high values is a methodological limitation of this study slopes of the temporal tl in the synchronized simulations were very similar to the slopes of the temporal tl in the fundamental simulation ii the mean and the variance of slopes were similar 2 278 and 0 011 for the fundamental simulation ii 2 276 and 0 012 for the synchronized simulation and the percentage of slopes that were included in the 95 confidence interval of slope estimates for the observed populations differed little 32 0 for the fundamental simulation ii 32 8 for the synchronized simulation therefore synchrony may not have major effects on the temporal tl of the studied populations the temporal tl can arise from the combination of environmental variability and density dependence it was unnecessary to assume density dependent movements among populations for the studied populations at least such density dependent movements among populations have been considered sufficient conditions to produce the prevailing slopes of tl 1 b 2 in earlier studies taylor and taylor 1977 hanski 1982 perry 1988 the mean geographic distance between the observed populations was 8 4 km range 3 6 22 7 km the mean home range length of the gray sided vole in hokkaido is 16 3 m range 10 40 for females and 32 7 m 10 65 for males and the longest natal dispersal distance was recorded in young males n 46 with median 103 5 m inter quartile range 56 9 135 0 m ishibashi and saitoh 2008 it is therefore implausible to assume that gray sided voles frequently moved between the observed populations see also bjørnstad et al 1999 consequently we argue that the observed temporal tl may be formed by density dependence environmental variability and their interactive products however this study does not deny the effects of density dependent movements on slopes of the temporal tl in other ecological systems some reports showed density dependent dispersal and long distance reaching several kilometers in arvicoline rodents although the effects of density on dispersal are not simple more reports show negative density dependent movements than show positive density dependent movements le galliard et al 2012 in addition mobile predators that travel long distance influence features of dynamics in populations and may make a correlation among populations that do not directly interact by movements e g ims and andreassen 2000 as a result they could moderate or exaggerate the variance of population density comparative studies covering various systems are needed to test these effects 4 2 cause and processes of the temporal tl formation by giving the gompertz model various combinations of model parameters we explored causes and processes of temporal tl formation the multiple regression analysis based on parameter combination simulation i in which the slope was a response variable and density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 environmental variability sd and their products were explanatory variables showed that those variables significantly contributed to explaining the variation of the slope and that slopes became steeper with the increase of sd and with the decrease of a 1 and a 2 table 1 the effects of another variable included in the gompertz model equilibrium density were tested in parameter combination simulation ii in which equilibrium densities ranged between 2 and 500 per 150 trap nights in the natural scale although all sets of time series satisfied the form of the temporal tl equilibrium densities had no significant effects on slopes table 2 these results indicate that environmental variability sd density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 and their products sufficed to explain the slopes in the temporal tl a closed population without significant dispersal in or out is limited by habitat quality limitation is perturbed by environmental variability and is regulated by density dependence regulation in general fig 1a environmental variability is a major source for the variance of population density in our model although effects of density dependence also contribute to the variability of population density environmental variability represented by the error term et in our model moves population density away from the equilibrium density since the error term is modeled by a normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and a variance sd2 environmental variability provides symmetric effects above and below the equilibrium density on the log scale of density fig 1a therefore higher environmental variability generates higher variances of population density xt on the log scale of density without altering the mean density x on the log scale however the effects of environmental variability are asymmetric above and below the equilibrium density in the original scale of population density nt the effects of environmental variability are unlimited above the equilibrium density but are limited below the equilibrium density because nt does not take a negative value therefore higher environmental variability generates higher variability of populations and higher mean density n on the natural scale of population density and the temporal tl can be formed on the natural scale of population density our simulated environmental variability is normally distributed on the logarithmic scale or lognormally distributed on the original scale of density it is well known that the mean of a lognormal random variable increases with any increase on the logarithmic scale in either its mean or its variance or both the supplementary discussion of tippett and cohen 2016 describes several ways the lognormal distribution can generate tl with different slopes density dependence together with the interaction with environmental variability also influences the variability of populations and may contribute to the temporal tl formation through a process similar to environmental variability in our model equilibrium densities on the log scale of density do not affect the temporal variance of density although equilibrium density influences the mean density on the original scale of density taylor s law asserts that the variance in the population density is a power law function of its mean population density it implies that the variation of variances could be explained by or at least is associated with the variation of means although taylor 1961 originally advocated the spatial tl taylor and woiwod 1980 postulated a similar power law association for both the temporal and the spatial tl we further conclude that the environmental effect is primarily on mean density which in turn controls stability through behaviour i e by movement although this causal relationship is not denied by the results of this study the gompertz model shows another path that produces the temporal tl environmental variability generates the variability of populations and the asymmetric effect of population variability above and below the equilibrium density causes the change in the mean of population density on the natural scale 4 3 prevalence of the temporal tl all simulated data sets in this study satisfied the form of the temporal tl the model parameters used by those simulations covered most of the possible range of density dependence coefficients 1 a 1 and a 2 for sustainable populations conversely we conclude that most populations that obey the gompertz model are expected to satisfy the form of the temporal tl if they are sustainable unsustainable populations may be members of a metapopulation in which local populations repeat extinction and colonization since those populations may have higher variances of population density than sustainable populations their slopes of the temporal tl may be steeper than slopes of sustainable populations if they satisfy the temporal tl 4 4 range of slopes slopes of the temporal tl in data sets generated by parameter combination simulation i ranged between 0 539 and 3 529 fig 3a relatively few 7035 10 99 of the time series showed 1 b 2 slopes became lower with the decrease of environmental variability and the increase of density dependence coefficients table 1 since very negative values of density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 cause higher variability of population density royama 1992 stenseth 1999 slopes became lower in less variable populations in the least variable populations in simulated data sets for which sd j was lowest and density dependence coefficients were located on the edge of the stable region fig 4 the mean slope was 1 000 sd 0 392 n 36 in these simulations very few simulated data sets had slopes smaller than 1 0 05 the variance and the mean of population density on the original scale increase with the increase of the variability of log populations in the gompertz model but the rate of increase of the variance is higher than that of mean as a consequence slopes become steeper than one with the increase of the variability of log populations in the gompertz model the limit of the variability of populations derived from density dependence is well defined in the gompertz model but the variability of populations derived from environmental variability is theoretically unlimited therefore it is impossible to determine the steepest possible slope of the temporal tl based on the approach of this study in this study we tested effects of sd in the range between 0 05 and 2 00 the range of slopes in this simulation was between 0 539 and 3 529 fig 3a and this range was observed when sd ranged between 0 05 and 0 95 when sd was equal to or higher than 1 the slopes narrowed into the range between 1 890 and 2 894 simulations of the gompertz model could not explain why most observed slopes are lower than 2 however this study clarified which parameter combinations produced 1 b 2 fig 3 and appendix d in supplementary material when plotting that probability for each combination of a 1 and a 2 with sd between 0 05 and 1 00 a higher probability region was found near the center of the triangle fig 4 extending upper right most values of a 1 and a 2 of the observed populations were included in this high probability region in the parameter estimates based on observed population the range of 1 a 1 was 0 505 0 718 and the range of a 2 was 0 651 0 521 fig 4 conversely a low slope of the temporal tl indicates density dependent populations with density dependence coefficients in the right upper region of the triangle and with low environmental variability taylor and woiwod 1980 tested the temporal tl for many species of moths n 263 aphids n 97 and birds n 84 the mean slope range of the temporal tl was 1 55 1 05 1 98 for moths 1 99 1 06 2 51 for aphids and 1 30 0 08 1 97 for birds additionally linnerud et al 2013 reported slopes of the temporal tl for bird populations n 30 the mean slope range of the temporal tl was 1 49 0 69 2 24 samples of moths were collected in various environments of great britain and birds were observed in forests whereas aphid samples came from open agricultural land taylor et al 1980 since an agricultural ecosystem changes greatly between cultivation and non cultivation seasons populations living there may repeat extinction and colonization since aphids inhabit those habitats they may suffer higher environmental variability than moths birds and gray sided voles therefore differences in slopes of the temporal tl may reflect differences in features of population dynamics this relationship between the temporal tl and features of population dynamics supports the suggestion of linnerud et al 2013 that the interspecific differences in slopes of the temporal tl can mainly be explained by effects of life history variation because environmental variability and the degree of density dependence should reflect the life history of species 4 5 conclusions this study is the first to simulate extensively the effects of the model parameters density dependence coefficients environmental variability and equilibrium density of the gompertz model on the temporal tl based on our simulations we have reached the following conclusions 1 most closed populations that obey the gompertz model without dispersal between populations could satisfy the form of the temporal tl if they are sustainable 2 the variability of populations derived from environmental variability and density dependence on the log scale contributes to the temporal tl those factors can explain at least partially why 1 b 2 in the temporal tl without assuming the presence of density dependent movement 3 slopes of the temporal tl become steeper b increases with the increase of environmental variability sd in the gompertz model and with the decrease of density dependence coefficients when environmental variability is low and density dependence is medium the probability that tl slopes fall in 1 b 2 becomes higher but the probability is not so high according to fig 3b d the maximum probability for 1 a 1 was 0 420 and the maximum for a 2 was 0 424 when sd is lower than 1 4 the slope b may indicate features of population dynamics most populations that obey the gompertz model with slopes between 1 and 2 may experience low environmental variability and the degree of their density dependence may be intermediate 5 this study did not investigate unsustainable populations and whether they are consistent with a temporal tl theoretical and empirical research attacking this question should contribute to understanding the range of tl slopes in addition extensive model analyses on the spatial tl are also promising parallel empirical computational and mathematical analyses of other nonlinear population models such as the ricker model commonly used in fisheries would

25190,taylor s law tl is an empirical rule describing the approximate relationship between the variance and the mean of population density log10 variance log10 a b log10 mean although tl has been verified in various ecological systems essential questions remain unanswered why is tl so widely observed what mechanisms or processes generate tl why do most observed slopes b fall in the limited range 1 b 2 density dependent movement of individuals among populations has been proposed as a mechanism that leads to tl with slopes 1 b 2 we used the gompertz model a second order autoregressive model of the logarithm of population density to analyze the temporal tl of gray sided vole populations our extensive simulations using various combinations of model parameters for environmental variability and density dependence demonstrated that sustainable populations could obey tl in the absence of density dependent movement among populations and identified the parameter combinations that produced slopes 1 b 2 when environmental variability was low and density dependence was intermediate simulated data sets showed higher probabilities for 1 b 2 but the probability was not very high in general slopes became steeper b increased as environmental variability increased and as density dependence coefficients decreased in the gompertz model both environmental variability and density dependence cause population density to vary and on the logarithmic scale of population density those effects are symmetric above and below the equilibrium density however effects of the variability are higher above the equilibrium density on the natural scale of population density and thus the mean of population density increases with increasing population variability therefore the temporal tl can be formed when population density is measured in the natural scale in sustainable populations well described by the gompertz model the slope b can be determined by the interplay of environmental variability and density dependence keywords autoregressive time series density dependence environmental variability rodents slope taylor s law 1 introduction taylor s law tl taylor 1961 is an empirical rule describing the approximate relationship between the variance and the mean of population density it has been widely verified in various ecological systems taylor 1986 and many other fields eisler et al 2008 tippett and cohen 2016 tl asserts that the variance is approximately a power law function of the mean variance a mean b a 0 it is usually rewritten 1 log10 variance log10 a b log10 mean neither of these equations specifies the deviations from an exact relationship i e the error term in tl the mean and the variance of population density can be calculated temporally and spatially in the temporal tl the mean and the variance are calculated over observations of population density at different times in a given location while in the spatial tl the mean and the variance are calculated over observations of population density in different spatial locations at a given time the temporal mean of population density may depend primarily on habitat quality while the temporal variance of population density may be produced primarily by population dynamics in interaction with environmental variable factors which broadly include abiotic e g climatic chemical physical and biotic e g trophic parasitic allelopathic effects on a given species this study investigated the relative contributions of population dynamics and environmental variability in shaping the form and parameters of the temporal variance mean relationship many theoretical models and interpretations of tl have been proposed but none has gained widespread acceptance essential questions remain unanswered why is tl so widely observed what mechanisms or processes generate tl why do most observed slopes satisfy 1 b 2 although combined empirical and theoretical studies should be conducted to answer these questions many previous empirical studies have verified tl without testing the details of any model that leads to tl while theoretical models that lead to tl have often lacked detailed empirical verification of the processes assumed see reviews by taylor 1986 kendal 2004 eisler et al 2008 but as exceptions see cohen et al 2013 linnerud et al 2013 we found previously that the population density of the gray sided vole myodes rufocanus sundevall 1846 in hokkaido satisfied the temporal tl and the estimated slope 1 613 was in 1 b 2 cohen and saitoh 2016 moreover cohen and saitoh 2016 showed that the densities of different vole populations were not independent the gompertz model which describes well the dynamics of the logarithm of population density of those populations royama 1977 1992 stenseth 1999 stenseth et al 2003 generated time series of density on the original scale of measurement that satisfied the form of temporal tl but under the assumption that different populations were independent the slope b 2 699 of the simulated tl was significantly steeper than the slope of the empirical populations we attributed this discrepancy to the assumed independence of simulated time series in contrast to the independent simulated time series empirical populations may inhabit habitats of varying quality may be subject to correlated environmental influences the moran effect and may experience density dependent movements from a higher quality habitat to a lower quality habitat density dependent movement reduces the temporal mean and variance of populations in higher quality habitats while it enhances the temporal mean and variance of populations in lower quality habitats therefore density dependent movements could lower the temporal slope of tl as taylor and taylor 1977 and perry 1988 suggested synchrony of populations produced by the moran effect could also lower the slopes of the spatial tl reuman et al 2017 density dependent movements however seem unrealistic for the studied vole populations because the distance between the studied vole populations is far beyond the movement ability of individuals of the gray sided vole the mean geographic distance between the observed populations was 8 4 km while most natal dispersals of individuals are recorded within several hundred meters ishibashi and saitoh 2008 although some long distance movements of up to several kilometers have been reported in some arvicoline rodent populations which are highly variable see le galliard et al 2012 for a review therefore we shall test whether tl can be formed with realistic values of the slope parameter b even in the absence of demographically significant migration here we report detailed simulations of the temporal tl for the empirical populations of the gray sided vole using the gompertz model with extensive combinations of model parameters these results will shed light on the above general questions about tl in this situation modelling of population dynamics is a powerful approach to simulating observed populations analyzing effects of model parameters and considering underlying mechanisms of the temporal tl anderson et al 1982 proposed a markovian population model where chance demographic events could lead to the temporal tl by the adjustment of the relative rates governing birth death immigration and emigration perry 1988 demonstrated that models based on density dependent movement could yield the temporal tl hanski and woiwod 1993 simulated populations where the intrinsic growth rate of populations was subjected to a random component these simulated populations approximated the temporal tl all of these attempts however relied upon arbitrary approximations transformations or constraints to achieve the goal kendal 2004 in addition the models of population dynamics used by those studies were not tested to evaluate whether they could describe empirical populations well and some models were unrealistic for example anderson et al 1982 assumed a potentially infinite increase of population density and perry 1988 assumed density dependent movement that is unrealistic at least for the studied populations of the gray sided vole linnerud et al 2013 analyzed density dependence and stochastic effects on the temporal tl using empirical data on avian populations and modified logistic models they claimed that slopes of the temporal tl were influenced by interspecific variation in life history parameters adult survival and clutch size however their examined parameter space of population dynamics was limited in contrast royama 1977 1992 examined the relationship between the density dependence coefficients and the population dynamics of the gompertz model details below and identified the parameter space of density dependence coefficients where populations are sustainable mathematically speaking where the second order autoregressive model is stationary and ergodic therefore we can thoroughly analyze effects of density dependence on the temporal tl for sustainable populations using the gompertz model with fewer arbitrary approximations or assumptions here we will show first that the variability of population density derives from both environmental variability and density dependence second by extensive analyses of environmental variability and density dependence coefficients without assuming density dependent movements or environmentally caused synchrony we will show that sustainable populations satisfy the temporal tl and will identify parameter combinations that are more likely to produce slopes 1 b 2 further we will show that a driving force of the temporal tl formation is population variability but not the variation of the equilibrium density 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and data hokkaido is the northernmost island of japan 78 073 km2 the gray sided vole myodes rufocanus sundevall 1846 is the commonest species of rodents on this island kaneko et al 1998 a systematic survey of rodent populations has been carried out in hokkaido by forestry agency of japanese government the geography of hokkaido and the data collection were described previously saitoh et al 1997 1998 stenseth et al 2003 we analyzed the same data set of the gray sided vole as cohen and saitoh 2016 n 85 populations in different locations covering t 31 years 1962 1992 population density was defined as the number of voles per 150 trap nights because 50 snap traps for three consecutive nights on a 0 5 ha survey plot was a standard unit of the rodent survey the bayesian method was applied to the estimation of population density for each year and location based on a state space model by using winbugs version 1 4 3 spiegelhalter et al 2003 http www mrc bsu cam ac uk software bugs in our previous study cohen and saitoh 2016 population density was estimated assuming that the number of voles caught increased in proportion to trapping effort however there were some limitations imposed by the trapping method because the basic unit of trapping was 150 trap nights the number of catches could not exceed 150 per unit new codes for winbugs were developed taking the constraints of trapping into consideration in addition non target species of rodents apodemus argenteus a speciosus and other minor species than the target species myodes rufocanus provided some small proportion of caught rodents although the target species dominated other species saitoh and nakatsu 1997 traps occupied by other species should not be considered effective traps therefore we subtracted the number of catches with non target species from the number of trap nights the new codes for winbugs are available as appendix b in supplementary material the raw counts of voles trapped the trapping effort the total number of trap nights excluding traps occupied by non target species and the resulting bayes population estimates are available in a spreadsheet file as appendices h k although we used the natural logarithm of the number of individual voles trapped per unit of trapping effort one trap night for the analysis by winbugs we transformed the estimates back to the original scale of measurement the number of voles captured per 150 trap nights the basic unit of trapping for the following analyses of tl 2 2 temporal taylor s law the mean and the variance were calculated over observations of population density at different times in a given location and one data point log10 temporal mean log10 temporal variance was plotted for each location ordinary least squares regression ols was used to test the temporal tl by fitting eq 1 to log10 temporal mean and log10 temporal variance of the vole populations and simulated time series 2 3 gompertz model we used the second order autoregressive model the gompertz model eq 2 to describe population dynamics of the gray sided vole in this model for each population j 1 85 xt j was the natural logarithm of bayesian estimate of the observed density nt j in year t 1962 1992 x j was the temporal mean of xt j in population j and x t j x j was the centered time series on the logarithmic scale in population j the gompertz model supposes that 2 xt j x j 1 a 1 j xt 1 j x j a 2 j xt 2 j x j et j where for each population j the parameters a 1 j and a 2 j are the coefficient of density dependence for a 1 year lag and for a 2 year lag respectively the error term et j represents density independent effects environmental variability modeled as random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a variance sd j 2 fitting the gompertz model eq 2 to the centered time series x t j x j yielded bayesian estimates of a 1 j a 2 j and sd j see the winbugs codes in appendix b in supplementary material for details stenseth et al 1996 assessed the order of the autoregressive model by fitting the models to the gray sided vole populations in hokkaido and demonstrated that the second order is parsimonious in 93 of the populations second or lower order was selected as the best model population density depends on habitat quality in a higher quality habitat a population would be expected to show a higher mean population density when an equilibrium exists it can be modeled as the mean density x j in the gompertz model fig 1 a which equals the natural logarithm of the geometric mean density on the original scale of density a population may stay at its equilibrium density if no perturbation affects its population density however most environments are variable and a population may be forced to move from the equilibrium by environmental variability arrows away from the equilibrium a sustainable population never continues moving further from the equilibrium but rather displays a tendency to return to the equilibrium arrows toward the equilibrium such return tendency is defined as density dependence therefore apart from the effects of dispersal of individuals from and to other populations which we take as zero in the present study a population is limited by the equilibrium related to habitat quality is varied by environmental variability and is regulated by density dependence in general although effects of density dependence are not simple and can enhance the variability of population dynamics combined with environmental variability royama 1977 1992 used standard results from the statistical theory of second order autoregressive time series e g box and jenkins 1970 pp 58 63 to analyze the relationship between fluctuation patterns of population dynamics and the density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 fig 1b inside the triangle of fig 1b assuming sd j 0 hence no environmental variability the dynamics is either point stability or damped fluctuations fluctuations will persist if any stochasticity exists sd j 0 in general less variable populations show parameters in the upper right part i of the triangle bjørnstad et al 1995 appendix g in supplementary material gives some new mathematical analysis of taylor s law for second order autoregressive time series 2 4 simulations we carried out five simulations called fundamental simulation i fundamental simulation ii synchronized simulation parameter combination simulation i and parameter combination simulation ii we distinguish the observed values xt j in eq 2 from the simulated values yt j in eq 3 3 yt j 1 a 1 j yt 1 j x j a 2 j yt 2 j x j x j et j the initial two observed log transformed values x 1 j x 2 j were used for the first two values y 1 j x 1 j and y 2 j x 2 j of each simulated population the state variable in all simulations was the centered log transformed population density y t j x j 2 4 1 fundamental simulations i and ii in the fundamental simulation i we used the population specific estimates of a 1 j and a 2 j and sd j corresponding to the 85 observed populations and generated 85 time series spanning 31 years yt j the environmental variability et j was assumed to be uncorrelated between different years t and between any two populations for each population j separately a primary et j was given as independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance sd j 2 n t j 0 sd j 2 since the length of et j was limited to 31 years the mean and the sd of simulated environmental variability et j were accidentally higher or lower than expected to adjust the mean and the sd the primary et j was then adjusted by the following equation the adjusted et j the primary et j temporal mean the primary e j sd j temporal sd the primary e j the fundamental simulations i and ii used the adjusted et j as the simulated environmental variability one thousand data sets each of which consisted of the 85 simulated time series were generated the generated values were then transformed back by exponentiation to the original scale of population density and temporal means and variances were computed on the original scale of population density for tests of the temporal tl using the ols regression some unrealistically high values for population densities were observed in simulated time series of the fundamental simulation i a small number of simulated values 0 52 were higher than the maximum of density estimates 0 1955 on the loge scale equivalent to 123 4 per 150 trap nights in the original scale for the observed populations the lowest simulated value was very close to that for the observed populations since those unrealistically high values caused higher variances of population density in simulated time series an upper limit was set in the fundamental simulation ii when a simulated value exceeded 0 1955 that value was replaced with 0 1955 other procedures of the simulation were the same as those of the fundamental simulation i the temporal tl was tested for each of 1000 simulations of 85 populations using the ols regression 2 4 2 synchronized simulations to synchronize et we first generated a fixed baseline error time series et 0 of 31 independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance 1 then we generated 85 correlated time series et j j 1 85 of length 31 years t 1 31 using the formula primary et j ρ et 0 1 ρ2 1 2 n t j 0 sd j 2 where n t j 0 sd j 2 are independent and identically distributed normal random numbers with mean 0 and variance sd j 2 and the primary et j was rescaled as in the fundamental simulations i and ii the adjusted et j the primary et j temporal mean the primary e j sd j temporal sd the primary e j we tuned ρ to 0 69 so that the average correlation among simulated time series the range of the average correlations 0 216 0 294 closely approximated the average correlation among the observed populations average correlation 0 277 other procedures of the simulation were the same as those of the fundamental simulation ii one thousand simulations of the 85 time series were generated the generated values were then transformed back to the original scale of population density and temporal means and variances were computed on the original scale of population density for tests of the temporal tl using the ols regression 2 4 3 parameter combination simulation i we explored which combinations of the model parameters would be more likely to generate prevailing slopes 1 b 2 by using the observed mean densities x j and various combinations of model parameters in the fundamental simulation i eq 3 to each simulated set of 85 time series spanning 31 years yt j a specific set of the parameters a 1 a 2 and sd was given in parameter combination simulation i 1 a 1 ranged from 1 95 to 1 95 with the increment of 0 05 a 2 ranged from 0 975 to 0 975 with the increment of 0 05 and sd ranged from 0 05 to 2 with the increment of 0 05 the combinations of 1 a 1 and a 2 were restricted to the range in which time series were sustainable i e 1600 combinations such that each point 1 a 1 a 2 fell within the triangle in fig 1b since simulations were carried out with 40 different sds for each combination of 1 a 1 and a 2 64 000 data sets of 31 85 yt j were generated for each data set the ols regression was used to estimate the slope of the temporal tl 2 4 4 parameter combination simulation ii in all the above simulation analyses an observed mean density was given as the equilibrium density to each simulated time series to extend the generality of those analyses various hypothetical mean densities mj were given as an equilibrium density to the gompertz model in parameter combination simulation ii 4 kt j 1 a 1 j kt 1 j mj a 2 j kt 2 j mj mj et j where mj was an equilibrium density of each time series here et j was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 the following 16 values were given as standard mean densities per 150 trap nights in the original scale for mj 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 to make the equilibrium densities vary in the simulations a normally distributed random number with mean a standard mean density and sd2 1 in the logarithmic scale was given to each simulated time series as an equilibrium density the 1600 combinations of 1 a 1 and a 2 were the same as above while the range of sd was limited between 0 05 and 1 20 cases to reduce calculation load then 85 time series spanning 31 years kt j were generated for each parameter combination and 512 000 1600 16 20 sets of 31 85 kt j were obtained in total for each such set of simulated time series the ols regression was used to estimate the slope of the temporal tl 2 5 cause and factors of taylor s law simulated time series are defined by three parameters a 1 a 2 and sd and the equilibrium density m we examined how the variance and the mean of density of the simulated times series were related to those variables through multiple regression analyses with slope b of tl as a response variable and with the parameters and the equilibrium density as explanatory variables all regressions were computed using function lm in r version 3 4 3 the critical value for statistical significance was always p 0 05 we made no corrections for simultaneous inference i e multiple tests of a null hypothesis of no effect hence approximately 5 of our apparently significant results could have arisen by chance alone 3 results 3 1 temporal taylor s laws in comparison with our previous study densities estimated in this study were higher than those in cohen and saitoh 2016 in general appendix a in supplementary material although both the mean and the variance of density estimates were higher in this study the variance increased by more than the mean therefore the slope of the temporal tl eq 1

log10 mean the lower and upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of the current estimate of the slope were 1 659 and 2 228 respectively because a quadratic regression revealed no statistically significant evidence of nonlinearity appendix a in supplementary material we focus on the linear relationship henceforth the 3570 pairs 3570 85 84 2 of vole populations had correlation coefficients of population density that ranged from a low of 0 359 to a high of 0 886 with a mean correlation of 0 277 0 211 sd the temporal tl described all 1000 data sets generated by the fundamental simulation i reasonably well adjusted r 2 0 542 0 824 their slopes ranged between 2 145 and 3 009 mean 2 618 sd 0 144 fig 2b ses of the slopes ranged between 0 145 and 0 233 and all ses were smaller than 10 of the estimates of the slopes a very small number of slopes 7 0 7 were lower than the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations this means that the slopes of fundamental simulation i were mostly too high when compared with the slope estimated from observations the overall mean of mean pairwise correlation coefficients of population density for 1000 data sets was 0 007 0 003 sd which was consistent with the independence between populations assumed in fundamental simulation i the temporal tl described all 1000 data sets generated by the fundamental

smaller than 10 of the estimates of the slopes a considerable number of slopes 320 32 0 fell within the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations this means that the slopes of fundamental simulation ii were closer to the slope estimated from observations than were the slopes of fundamental simulation i but more than two thirds of the slopes were still too high the overall mean of mean pairwise correlation coefficients of population density for 1000 data sets was 0 007 0 003 sd not different from that in fundamental simulation i the temporal tl described all

were smaller than 10 of the estimates of the slopes a similar proportion of slopes 32 8 were included in the 95 confidence interval of the slope estimate for the observed populations in comparison with those in the fundamental simulation ii this means that more than two thirds of the slopes were still too high the mean of pairwise correlation coefficients of population density ranged between 0

considered as a response variable while density dependence coefficients 1 a 1 and a 2 environmental variability sd and their pairwise products were used as explanatory variables table 1 all these explanatory variables and their products contributed significantly to explain the variation of the slope and the full model showed a moderate goodness of fit r 2 0 480 summarizing the results of this analysis slopes became steeper with the increase of sd and with the decrease of a 1 and a 2 appendix e in supplementary material for each combination of 1 a 1 and a 2 and for sd between 0 05 and 0 95

sd and their pairwise products were used as explanatory variables showed a minor contribution of equilibrium densities table 2 appendix f in supplementary material effects of equilibrium densities and related products were not significant and the selected model consisted of a 1 a 2 sd and their pairwise products without equilibrium densities and related products 4 discussion 4 1 the gompertz model the gompertz model has been known as a model that describes well the dynamics of some populations including the populations of gray sided voles in this study royama 1977 1992 stenseth 1999 stenseth et al 1996 2003 the gompertz model has frequently been used to characterize rodent populations and compare their population dynamics among localities or periods e g stenseth 1999 cornulier et al 2013 fundamental simulations i reproduced the form of the temporal tl but not the empirical slope fig 2b for some values of the simulated mean fundamental simulation i gave an unusual simulated variance that appeared to be far higher than the observed variance associated with the observed mean that matched the simulated mean the higher variances were attributed to some unusually high values for population densities in fundamental simulation i unrealistic values of density which exceeded the maximum of density estimates per 150 trap nights in the original scale 123 4 for the observed populations were observed in 0 52 of simulated densities therefore an upper limit was introduced for simulated densities in the fundamental simulation ii a simulated density that exceeded the maximum density was replaced with the maximum density as a result 32 0 of slopes in 1000 simulated data sets were included in the 95 confidence interval of slope estimates for the observed populations fig 2c the generation of unrealistically high values is a methodological limitation of this study slopes of the temporal tl in the synchronized simulations were very similar to the slopes of the temporal tl in the fundamental simulation ii the mean and the variance of slopes were similar 2 278 and 0 011 for the fundamental simulation ii 2 276 and 0 012 for the synchronized simulation and the percentage of slopes that were included in the 95 confidence interval of slope estimates for the observed populations differed little 32 0 for the fundamental simulation ii 32 8 for the synchronized simulation therefore synchrony may not have major effects on the temporal tl of the studied populations the temporal tl can arise from the combination of environmental variability and density dependence it was unnecessary to assume density dependent movements among populations for the studied populations at least such density dependent movements among populations have been considered sufficient conditions to produce the prevailing slopes of tl 1 b 2 in earlier studies taylor and taylor 1977 hanski 1982 perry 1988 the mean geographic distance between the observed populations was 8 4 km range 3 6 22 7 km the mean home range length of the gray sided vole in hokkaido is 16 3 m range 10 40 for females and 32 7 m 10 65 for males and the longest natal dispersal distance was recorded in young males n 46 with median 103 5 m inter quartile range 56 9 135 0 m ishibashi and saitoh 2008 it is therefore implausible to assume that gray sided voles frequently moved between the observed populations see also bjørnstad et al 1999 consequently we argue that the observed temporal tl may be formed by density dependence environmental variability and their interactive products however this study does not deny the effects of density dependent movements on slopes of the temporal tl in other ecological systems some reports showed density dependent dispersal and long distance reaching several kilometers in arvicoline rodents although the effects of density on dispersal are not simple more reports show negative density dependent movements than show positive density dependent movements le galliard et al 2012 in addition mobile predators that travel long distance influence features of dynamics in populations and may make a correlation among populations that do not directly interact by movements e g ims and andreassen 2000 as a result they could moderate or exaggerate the variance of population density comparative studies covering various systems are needed to test these effects 4 2 cause and processes of the temporal tl formation by giving the gompertz model various combinations of model parameters we explored causes and processes of temporal tl formation the multiple regression analysis based on parameter combination simulation i in which the slope was a response variable and density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 environmental variability sd and their products were explanatory variables showed that those variables significantly contributed to explaining the variation of the slope and that slopes became steeper with the increase of sd and with the decrease of a 1 and a 2 table 1 the effects of another variable included in the gompertz model equilibrium density were tested in parameter combination simulation ii in which equilibrium densities ranged between 2 and 500 per 150 trap nights in the natural scale although all sets of time series satisfied the form of the temporal tl equilibrium densities had no significant effects on slopes table 2 these results indicate that environmental variability sd density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 and their products sufficed to explain the slopes in the temporal tl a closed population without significant dispersal in or out is limited by habitat quality limitation is perturbed by environmental variability and is regulated by density dependence regulation in general fig 1a environmental variability is a major source for the variance of population density in our model although effects of density dependence also contribute to the variability of population density environmental variability represented by the error term et in our model moves population density away from the equilibrium density since the error term is modeled by a normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and a variance sd2 environmental variability provides symmetric effects above and below the equilibrium density on the log scale of density fig 1a therefore higher environmental variability generates higher variances of population density xt on the log scale of density without altering the mean density x on the log scale however the effects of environmental variability are asymmetric above and below the equilibrium density in the original scale of population density nt the effects of environmental variability are unlimited above the equilibrium density but are limited below the equilibrium density because nt does not take a negative value therefore higher environmental variability generates higher variability of populations and higher mean density n on the natural scale of population density and the temporal tl can be formed on the natural scale of population density our simulated environmental variability is normally distributed on the logarithmic scale or lognormally distributed on the original scale of density it is well known that the mean of a lognormal random variable increases with any increase on the logarithmic scale in either its mean or its variance or both the supplementary discussion of tippett and cohen 2016 describes several ways the lognormal distribution can generate tl with different slopes density dependence together with the interaction with environmental variability also influences the variability of populations and may contribute to the temporal tl formation through a process similar to environmental variability in our model equilibrium densities on the log scale of density do not affect the temporal variance of density although equilibrium density influences the mean density on the original scale of density taylor s law asserts that the variance in the population density is a power law function of its mean population density it implies that the variation of variances could be explained by or at least is associated with the variation of means although taylor 1961 originally advocated the spatial tl taylor and woiwod 1980 postulated a similar power law association for both the temporal and the spatial tl we further conclude that the environmental effect is primarily on mean density which in turn controls stability through behaviour i e by movement although this causal relationship is not denied by the results of this study the gompertz model shows another path that produces the temporal tl environmental variability generates the variability of populations and the asymmetric effect of population variability above and below the equilibrium density causes the change in the mean of population density on the natural scale 4 3 prevalence of the temporal tl all simulated data sets in this study satisfied the form of the temporal tl the model parameters used by those simulations covered most of the possible range of density dependence coefficients 1 a 1 and a 2 for sustainable populations conversely we conclude that most populations that obey the gompertz model are expected to satisfy the form of the temporal tl if they are sustainable unsustainable populations may be members of a metapopulation in which local populations repeat extinction and colonization since those populations may have higher variances of population density than sustainable populations their slopes of the temporal tl may be steeper than slopes of sustainable populations if they satisfy the temporal tl 4 4 range of slopes slopes of the temporal tl in data sets generated by parameter combination simulation i ranged between 0 539 and 3 529 fig 3a relatively few 7035 10 99 of the time series showed 1 b 2 slopes became lower with the decrease of environmental variability and the increase of density dependence coefficients table 1 since very negative values of density dependence coefficients a 1 and a 2 cause higher variability of population density royama 1992 stenseth 1999 slopes became lower in less variable populations in the least variable populations in simulated data sets for which sd j was lowest and density dependence coefficients were located on the edge of the stable region fig 4 the mean slope was 1 000 sd 0 392 n 36 in these simulations very few simulated data sets had slopes smaller than 1 0 05 the variance and the mean of population density on the original scale increase with the increase of the variability of log populations in the gompertz model but the rate of increase of the variance is higher than that of mean as a consequence slopes become steeper than one with the increase of the variability of log populations in the gompertz model the limit of the variability of populations derived from density dependence is well defined in the gompertz model but the variability of populations derived from environmental variability is theoretically unlimited therefore it is impossible to determine the steepest possible slope of the temporal tl based on the approach of this study in this study we tested effects of sd in the range between 0 05 and 2 00 the range of slopes in this simulation was between 0 539 and 3 529 fig 3a and this range was observed when sd ranged between 0 05 and 0 95 when sd was equal to or higher than 1 the slopes narrowed into the range between 1 890 and 2 894 simulations of the gompertz model could not explain why most observed slopes are lower than 2 however this study clarified which parameter combinations produced 1 b 2 fig 3 and appendix d in supplementary material when plotting that probability for each combination of a 1 and a 2 with sd between 0 05 and 1 00 a higher probability region was found near the center of the triangle fig 4 extending upper right most values of a 1 and a 2 of the observed populations were included in this high probability region in the parameter estimates based on observed population the range of 1 a 1 was 0 505 0 718 and the range of a 2 was 0 651 0 521 fig 4 conversely a low slope of the temporal tl indicates density dependent populations with density dependence coefficients in the right upper region of the triangle and with low environmental variability taylor and woiwod 1980 tested the temporal tl for many species of moths n 263 aphids n 97 and birds n 84 the mean slope range of the temporal tl was 1 55 1 05 1 98 for moths 1 99 1 06 2 51 for aphids and 1 30 0 08 1 97 for birds additionally linnerud et al 2013 reported slopes of the temporal tl for bird populations n 30 the mean slope range of the temporal tl was 1 49 0 69 2 24 samples of moths were collected in various environments of great britain and birds were observed in forests whereas aphid samples came from open agricultural land taylor et al 1980 since an agricultural ecosystem changes greatly between cultivation and non cultivation seasons populations living there may repeat extinction and colonization since aphids inhabit those habitats they may suffer higher environmental variability than moths birds and gray sided voles therefore differences in slopes of the temporal tl may reflect differences in features of population dynamics this relationship between the temporal tl and features of population dynamics supports the suggestion of linnerud et al 2013 that the interspecific differences in slopes of the temporal tl can mainly be explained by effects of life history variation because environmental variability and the degree of density dependence should reflect the life history of species 4 5 conclusions this study is the first to simulate extensively the effects of the model parameters density dependence coefficients environmental variability and equilibrium density of the gompertz model on the temporal tl based on our simulations we have reached the following conclusions 1 most closed populations that obey the gompertz model without dispersal between populations could satisfy the form of the temporal tl if they are sustainable 2 the variability of populations derived from environmental variability and density dependence on the log scale contributes to the temporal tl those factors can explain at least partially why 1 b 2 in the temporal tl without assuming the presence of density dependent movement 3 slopes of the temporal tl become steeper b increases with the increase of environmental variability sd in the gompertz model and with the decrease of density dependence coefficients when environmental variability is low and density dependence is medium the probability that tl slopes fall in 1 b 2 becomes higher but the probability is not so high according to fig 3b d the maximum probability for 1 a 1 was 0 420 and the maximum for a 2 was 0 424 when sd is lower than 1 4 the slope b may indicate features of population dynamics most populations that obey the gompertz model with slopes between 1 and 2 may experience low environmental variability and the degree of their density dependence may be intermediate 5 this study did not investigate unsustainable populations and whether they are consistent with a temporal tl theoretical and empirical research attacking this question should contribute to understanding the range of tl slopes in addition extensive model analyses on the spatial tl are also promising parallel empirical computational and mathematical analyses of other nonlinear population models such as the ricker model commonly used in fisheries would

25191,collision of birds with wind turbines is an important negative effect of wind energy generation assessments of the potential numbers of bird collisions are required prior to the construction of wind farms collision rate models crms are used as a tool to estimate numbers of collision victims for wind farm initiatives in the past couple of decades various crms have been developed these models are all based on the theoretical calculation of collision probabilities theoretical models in this paper we introduce an empirical model the flux collision model fcm in which actual knowledge of species group specific collision probabilities collected in existing wind farms on land is used to calculate collision rates for planned wind farms an important quality of the fcm is that it provides a means to use empirical information to assess collision rates in environmental impact assessments eias for wind farm initiatives in addition no detailed information on bird behaviour close to the rotor is needed as this information is already incorporated in the empirical collision probability in two case studies one offshore and one on land we compare and discuss the use and performance of the empirical fcm and the theoretical soss band model for predicting collision rates of birds at wind farm initiatives to date no actual collision rates are known for the offshore situation accordingly in the fcm collision probabilities derived from wind farms on land were used nevertheless in the offshore case study the results of the fcm were comparable with those of the soss band model basic sensitivity analyses for both the fcm and the soss band model showed that purely theoretically both models are equally sensitive to changes in avoidance rates however because lower values for avoidance are applied in the fcm wind farm avoidance than in the soss band model overall avoidance in practice the effect of realistic variation in avoidance rates on the resulting collision rates is much smaller for the fcm than for the soss band model our results show that the fcm provides a valuable addition to the existing suite of theoretical crms the predictive value of the theoretical soss band model is constrained by the limited availability of knowledge on species group specific wind turbine avoidance rates which is not the case for the fcm by contrast the reliability of the empirical fcm is determined only by variation in the availability and quality of information on species group specific collision probabilities the choice of which crm to use theoretical or empirical seems not to depend on the location of the wind farm initiative as being offshore or on land but on the availability and reliability of species group specific information in existing wind farms the availability of a reliable collision probability supports the use of the fcm while the availability of information on overall avoidance rates in the absence of a species group specific collision probability supports the use of a theoretical crm like the soss band model synthesis and applications the predictive power of collision rate models relies in the first place on the quality of the input information and second on the theoretical details of the model calculations although the fcm is less dependent on measurements of avoidance rates an urgent need remains to obtain information on actual collision rates and corresponding collision probabilities as well as avoidance rates in existing wind farms both offshore and on land in order to accurately determine the impact of wind energy on bird populations keywords avoidance rate birds collision rate model sensitivity victim wind farm 1 introduction wind power has become an important source of renewable energy in the past few decades a substantial amount of large wind farms has been constructed worldwide both on land and offshore the collision of birds and bats with wind turbines is considered one of the main ecological downsides of wind power generation arnett et al 2008 drewitt and langston 2006 furness et al 2013 de lucas et al 2008 rydell et al 2010 thaxter et al 2017 generally assessments of the potential numbers of bird collisions are legally required prior to the construction of wind farms johnston et al 2014 collision rate models crms are used as a tool to predict numbers of collision victims for planned wind farms to deliver the best possible input for decision making processes regarding location and configuration of the wind farm these predictions should accurately reflect the impact of the wind farm on the environment ferrer et al 2012 over time various collision rate models have been developed masden and cook 2016 tucker 1996 most of these models are based on theoretical calculation of the collision probability using the physical characteristics of the bird and of the wind turbine theoretical models in these models the collision probability expresses the mathematical probability that a rotor blade hits a bird flying through the rotor swept zone of a specified wind turbine a widely used theoretical crm is the soss band model band 2012 due to methodological challenges empirical data on collision rates of birds at offshore wind farms are scarce collier et al 2011a desholm et al 2006 therefore theoretical models are generally used to predict collision victim numbers for offshore wind farm initiatives on land the availability of empirical data on collision rates of birds is greater than offshore drewitt and langston 2006 therefore we developed a crm the flux collision model fcm in which collision probabilities based on empirical data from research in existing wind farms the so called reference wind farms can be used to predict collision rates in planned wind farms empirical model this empirical crm includes correction factors for differences between the reference wind farm and the wind farm initiative in for instance configuration of the wind farm and size of the wind turbines we started with the development of the flux collision model fcm approximately fifteen years ago when there was a wish to use information from collision rates in existing wind farms on land to predict collision rates for future wind farms in the netherlands through the years the model has been updated and expanded several times currently the fcm is applied in most environmental impact assessments eias for dutch wind farm initiatives on land our goal is to provide an empirical addition to the existing theoretical crms as far as we know there are currently no peer reviewed empirical crms available masden and cook 2016 with the fcm we do not wish to replace the existing theoretical crms but aim to expand the available set of tools to improve the predicted collision rates for wind farms in all possible situations and settings incorporating all available information in this paper we 1 introduce the empirical flux collision model 2 compare the empirical approach flux collision model with the theoretical approach soss band model using two case studies one on land and one offshore 3 discuss the sensitivity of both models to variation in parameter values 4 provide advice on the use of theoretical and empirical collision rate models and 5 denote the issues on which future research should focus to improve the reliability of collision rate model calculations 2 methods 2 1 general design of collision rate models to provide a background to the following description of the flux collision model we first explain the general design of collision rate models simply stated crms comprise four main components 1 number of birds at risk 2 avoidance 3 encounter probability and 4 collision probability firstly the number of birds at risk can be derived from field data which can be collected in numerous ways it can be expressed as a flux through the wind farm area number of birds flying through a defined vertical plane in a specific amount of time or as a density in the wind farm area number of birds per volume air secondly avoidance takes place on different scales birds can avoid the entire wind farm or they can avoid individual wind turbines when flying through a wind farm thirdly the encounter probability refers to the probability that a bird flying through a wind farm comes across the area swept by the rotor blades lastly the collision probability is the probability that a bird flying through the rotor swept zone of a wind farm or wind turbine comes in contact with the moving rotor blades to become a collision victim 2 2 flux collision model the fcm is an empirical crm that can be used in situations where species group specific empirical information on the collision probability in an existing wind farm the reference wind farm is readily available in the fcm eq 1 the collision probability p measured at an existing wind farm is combined with the flux of birds through the wind farm initiative b h 1 a macro to predict the number of collision victims c the fcm contains correction factors for differences between the reference wind farm and the planned wind farm in turbine dimensions r r ref p cor wind farm configuration e e ref and the proportion of the flux at rotor height h cor all of which influence the collision probability see table 1 for a detailed description of all parameters 1 c b h 1 a macro h cor r r ref e e ref p cor p together the parameters b h and a macro define the bird flux through the planned wind farm the flux b is the total number of birds flying over the location where the wind farm is planned in a specific period of time year month day depending on how the flux b is measured or estimated parameters h the proportion of birds flying at turbine height and a macro wind farm avoidance rate are applied to reduce the total flux at the wind farm location to the number of birds that will likely be flying through the planned wind farm the application of parameter h is only relevant when the bird flux b is measured up to a great height above the wind farm for instance when including seasonal migration turbine height is defined as the area between ground or water level and maximum tip height often the bird flux is measured in a situation without wind turbines when the turbines are present generally part of the birds will avoid the wind farm by flying around or over it this fraction of birds avoiding the wind farm is then denoted as the parameter a macro h cor corrects for differences in the proportion of birds at rotor height between the reference wind farm and the planned wind farm to calculate h cor the fraction of the flux at rotor height in the planned wind farm is divided by the fraction of the flux at rotor height in the reference wind farm this correction factor covers both the potential difference in space underneath the rotor between the reference wind farm and the wind farm initiative as well as the potential difference in flight height of the assessed species group between both locations the combination of these factors determines the fraction of the flux at rotor height r r ref corrects for differences in the encounter probability caused by a different coverage of the vertical plane of the wind farm by the rotors both r and r ref are calculated in the same way eq 2 based on the rotor area o rotor diameter d and distance d between the turbines of the planned wind farm or the reference wind farm oref dref and dref parameters r and r ref are calculated for one turbine 2 r o d d to correct for differences in the average number of turbines encountered while flying through the planned wind farm e or the reference wind farm e ref the parameter e e ref is incorporated in the fcm the average number of turbines that a bird encounters while passing a wind farm depends on the configuration of the wind farm and the main flight direction of birds through the wind farm values for e and e ref can be estimated or calculated using a specific encounter probability model such as the bolker model bolker et al 2006 2014 with the parameter p cor the collision probability is corrected for the difference in rotor area and related rotation speed and part of the rotor area that is covered by the rotor blades between the turbines of the planned wind farm and the turbines of the reference wind farm for a large rotor with relatively slower rotation speed and wider blades the average collision probability per square metre of rotor area is lower compared to that of smaller rotors the equation to calculate the correction factor p cor eq 3 is based on the relationship between the theoretical collision probability of birds flying through the rotor and the rotor area which we derived from existing formulas for the theoretical calculation of the collision probability band 2012 3 p cor 0 9785 o oref 0 26 lastly p represents the collision probability for the specific species group as determined in the reference wind farm the collision probability refers to the entire reference wind farm and not to a single wind turbine the choice for a specific collision probability depends on the species group in question and the location and configuration of the wind farm initiative and the dimensions of the planned wind turbines in some cases several good quality collision probabilities are available for the same species group in these cases the predicted number of collision victims can be calculated using all available collision probabilities separate calculations after which the average number of collision victims can be derived including the range in outcomes see for example appendix a an important difference between the fcm and most existing theoretical crms is the scale to which the collision probability refers a single wind turbine or the entire wind farm the soss band model calculates the theoretical collision probability for birds flying through the rotor swept zone of a single wind turbine while the fcm makes use of an empirically determined collision probability for birds flying through the entire wind farm area because of this difference in calculating collision probabilities there is also a difference in the way in which avoidance is incorporated in the crms when using the soss band model the avoidance of the entire wind farm as well as the avoidance of individual wind turbines or even rotors has to be estimated and entered as an overall avoidance rate cook et al 2014 in the fcm only the avoidance of the entire wind farm needs to be estimated a macro as wind turbine avoidance is already incorporated in the applied collision probability this is because the empirical collision probability is calculated by combining the flux through the entire reference wind farm with the actual collision rate in the reference wind farm birds that avoid the individual wind turbines or rotors in the reference wind farm do not collide and are therefore not reflected in the measured collision rate this is an important advantage of the fcm avoidance of entire wind farms is less complicated to observe in the field than the avoidance of individual rotors as the latter involves complex within wind farm behaviour the level of which may be dependent on a range of factors 2 3 case studies for the comparison of crms to compare the performance of a theoretical and an empirical crm we applied our fcm and the soss band model band 2012 to two case studies one on land case 1 and one offshore case 2 the models can be applied to both on land and offshore wind farms without adaptations to the model parameterisation in the on land case study we also compared the model results with the actual number of collision victims determined in a two year field study in the wind farm in question in order to validate the accuracy of the models for case 1 we selected wind farm sabinapolder in the southwest of the netherlands the wind farm is located along a dike between lake krammer volkerak and a polder with agricultural fields and consists of six 0 85 mw turbines in a single row with a hub height of 48 1 m a rotor diameter of 52 m and an average rotation speed of 26 rpm the average distance between the turbines is 250 m the data on fluxes and flight height that were used in the model calculations were extracted from verbeek et al 2012 for case 2 we selected offshore wind farm egmond aan zee owez owez is located 10 18 km off the dutch coast in the north sea and exists of 36 turbines 3 mw placed in a more or less rectangular configuration with a hub height of 70 m and a rotor diameter of 90 m the distance between turbines within rows is 650 m and between rows 1000 m in the model calculations we used an average distance between turbines of 825 m to account for the random flight angles through the wind farm the data on fluxes and avoidance rates used in the model calculations was extracted from krijgsveld et al 2011 and poot et al 2011 2 3 1 data collection case 1 in the on land wind farm sabinapolder a field study was conducted during two consecutive years to determine the number of collision victims and the flight activity of birds verbeek et al 2012 for the species groups geese and gulls the flux was determined by using visual bird counts geese and gulls and radar observations geese fluxes were measured between october 2009 and april 2011 for gulls the visually determined flux referred to the diurnal period this diurnal flux was extrapolated to the nocturnal period based on the nocturnal flight activity of the most common gull species in the wind farm area the black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus garthe and hüppop 2004 the flux for geese was specifically determined in the winter months september february around sunrise and sunset when the birds were moving between foraging and resting grounds for both species groups the average number of collision victims per year was determined in the field which enables model validation i e comparison of the modelling results with the actual collision rate the actual number of collision victims per year was determined based on the number of victims found in carcass searches which were corrected for search efficiency the removal of carcasses by predators and the area under the wind turbines that could be searched for carcasses because both geese and gulls were easy to detect due to their size and or colour and because all carcasses remained longer than the maximum period of 14 days between search rounds the search efficiency was assumed to be 100 and carcass loss 0 for geese only the collision victims in the period september february were considered as the flux used in the model calculations specifically refers to that period the greylag goose anser anser was the most common goose species in the wind farm area case 2 in the offshore wind farm egmond aan zee owez fluxes of birds through the wind farm were measured by means of radar and visual observations combined krijgsveld et al 2011 these measurements were performed in a three year study 2007 2009 we selected four species for which we used the measured fluxes to predict the collision rate lesser black backed gull larus fuscus black headed gull brent goose branta bernicla and sandwich tern thalasseus sandvicensis for all species the applied flux refers to the measured diurnal situation for all months of the year appendix 7 in poot et al 2011 2 3 2 input flux collision model 2 3 2 1 wind farm data as the turbines in wind farm sabinapolder are aligned in a single row situated more or less perpendicular to the main flight direction of gulls and geese crossing the wind farm we assumed that birds flying through wind farm sabinapolder encountered on average one wind turbine this was supported by the results of the field observations verbeek et al 2012 in owez no main flight direction of local birds not on active migration through the wind farm was observed krijgsveld et al 2011 the configuration of owez concerns a more or less rectangular cluster of turbines see fig 3 2 in krijgsveld et al 2011 therefore the average number of turbines encountered during a single crossing 6 for all different flight directions was determined by taking the square root of the total number of turbines 2 3 2 2 collision probabilities for all species groups we selected available collision probabilities to use them in the model calculations appendix a case 1 for geese the applied collision probability was derived from a study in the wieringermeer in the netherlands fijn et al 2007 where a maximum collision probability of 0 01 was calculated for swans and geese this is the only available collision probability for geese that we can use in this case study as the other available species group specific collision probability for geese originates from the research in wind farm sabinapolder our case study data from verbeek et al 2012 fijn et al 2007 calculated the collision probability of geese and swans together by combining the flux through the two studied wind farms in a specific period of time with the maximum number of collision victims of the studied species groups in the wind farms in the same time period since the collision probability from fijn et al 2007 concerns a maximum collision probability this is likely to result in an overestimation of the number of collision victims for gulls we applied collision probabilities from three different reference wind farms appendix a one located in the western part of the netherlands prinsen et al 2013 and two in belgium everaert 2008 as 80 of the gulls in wind farm sabinapolder were black headed gulls we only used collision probabilities of this particular species case 2 for existing offshore wind farms actual collision rates are not yet available we therefore used collision probabilities determined at existing wind farms on land in combination with local bird fluxes by doing so we are able to test whether the application of collision probabilities determined on land yields results for an offshore wind farm that are comparable to those of the theoretical soss band model which has been specifically developed for offshore wind farms band 2012 for lesser black backed gull we applied collision probabilities from two adjacent reference wind farms in the western part of the netherlands wind farm slufterdam and wind farm distridam prinsen et al 2013 for black headed gull we applied collision probabilities from three different reference wind farms as was the case for wind farm sabinapolder appendix a for sandwich tern we applied two collision probabilities from the same reference wind farm determined separately over two consecutive years this reference wind farm is located in zeebrugge in belgium everaert and stienen 2007 for brent goose we applied the collision probability that was derived for geese in the study in wind farm sabinapolder data from verbeek et al 2012 for all four species the applied collision probabilities are the only species specific collision probabilities that are available for species groups with more than one available collision probability the calculations with the fcm were performed separately for each individual collision probability the resulting collision rates were averaged to obtain the final result appendix a 2 3 2 3 avoidance as the flux in wind farm sabinapolder was measured through the vertical plane of the wind farm the wind farm avoidance rate was set to 0 in the calculations for offshore wind farm egmond aan zee wind farm avoidance rates were taken from krijgsveld et al 2011 lesser black backed gull and black headed gull 0 18 brent goose 0 68 and sandwich tern 0 28 wind turbine avoidance rates are indirectly incorporated in the empirical collision probabilities that are used in the fcm 2 3 3 input soss band model 2 3 3 1 bird data flight speeds were derived from alerstam et al 2007 bruderer and boldt 2001 and wakeling and hodgson 1992 for bird length and wingspan we used the average of the species specific ranges presented by snow and perrins 1998 as we do not know species specific fluxes for wind farm sabinapolder but only fluxes for the species groups geese and gulls average values for bird length wingspan and flight speed were used for these species groups weighted by the presence of species of geese and gulls in the area appendix a 2 3 3 2 avoidance the overall avoidance rate combination of wind farm and rotor avoidance of birds is largely unknown so therefore four standard avoidance rates were applied in the model to generate four estimates of the collision rate 95 98 99 and 99 5 2 3 4 input both models for two of the main parameters for the calculation of the collision rate the input for the fcm and the soss band model is more or less the same these parameters are the flux and the proportion of the flux at rotor height 2 3 4 1 flux in both models the number of birds at risk represents the starting point for the calculation of the collision rate the difference between the crms is the way in which the number of birds at risk is expressed for the fcm the input needs to be expressed as a flux through the wind farm area in a specific amount of time absolute number of birds for the soss band model the same information needs to be expressed as a density in the wind farm area in both models the same information on the presence of birds in wind farm sabinapolder and owez was used we only transformed the data to fit the input requirements of both models 2 3 4 2 proportion of birds at rotor height in both models this parameter is entered as a fraction as there is no difference in the flux that is entered in both models there is also no difference in the proportion of the flux at rotor height the proportion of birds flying at rotor height in wind farm sabinapolder was 0 913 for geese and 0 844 for gulls for owez no species specific data on the proportion of birds flying at rotor height were available to compare the performance of the fcm and the soss band model it is not necessary to know the exact species specific proportion of birds at rotor height as long as the same proportion is used in both crms for simplicity we assumed that the flux of all discussed species was evenly distributed over the vertical plane of the wind farm between water level and maximum tip height as the rotor covers 78 3 of the vertical plane of the wind farm we assumed that this proportion of the flux of the discussed species flew at rotor height 2 4 sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of the fcm for uncertainty in parameter values we performed a basic sensitivity analysis using the calculations of case 2 owez for each of the four species we only used one collision probability and reference wind farm as the baseline collision probability does not influence the results of the sensitivity analysis the parameters referring to wind turbine dimensions and wind farm configuration r r ref e e ref and p cor which are fixed known values were excluded from the sensitivity analysis the input values for the remaining parameters which are related to the occurrence and behaviour of birds are subject to variation and uncertainty we individually changed the value of each of these remaining parameters by 10 whichever leads to a higher collision rate to test the effect on the collision rate chamberlain et al 2006 masden 2015 factors b and h both influence the flux number of birds through the wind farm area in the sensitivity analysis the effect of a 10 increase in flux combination of b and h is assessed as for owez case 2 the value for b refers to the flux through the wind farm at turbine height between water level and maximum tip height the value for h in the fcm calculations for owez is 1 as h can never exceed 1 the 10 increase in flux for the sensitivity analysis is in this case achieved by a 10 increase in parameter b because of the multiplicative character of the fcm error propagation of variation of different parameters can potentially yield large differences in outcomes therefore we also cumulatively changed the values of the selected parameters and tested the effect on the resulting collision rate we would have liked to also test the sensitivity of the fcm for a more realistic variation in the assessed parameters masden 2015 however detailed empirical information on the variation in a macro is lacking dierschke et al 2016 and data on variation in collision probabilities p and proportions of birds at rotor height influencing h cor are very scarce given the currently available information we argue that performing a sensitivity analysis based on an estimated realistic variation in parameter values will not yield valuable additional insight in the sensitivity of the fcm 3 results 3 1 case 1 on land wind farm sabinapolder for both geese and gulls the variation in the collision rates resulting from the model calculations is substantial table 2 in the soss band model minor differences in avoidance rates lead to significant variation in collision rates 23 225 victims of geese per year and 10 102 victims of gulls per year in the fcm the use of different collision probabilities for gulls renders collision rates varying from 11 up to 50 victims per year this shows that for both models slightly different input values may lead to large differences in resulting collision rates for both geese and gulls the collision rates obtained with the fcm fall within the range of the collision rates obtained with the soss band model with 95 99 5 overall avoidance rates the results of both the fcm on average 34 victims of geese and 32 victims of gulls per year and the soss band model are higher than the actual collision rate as measured in the field 3 5 geese per year and 8 5 gulls per year see also table 2 for geese an overestimation of collision victims was expected for the fcm since a maximum collision probability was applied 3 2 case 2 offshore wind farm owez for owez the actual collision rates are unknown therefore this case study can only be used to compare the output of both collision rate models again the projections of the fcm fall within the range of the results of the soss band model table 3 this means that in spite of the fact that collision probabilities used in the fcm had been determined in on land wind farms both models seem equally suitable for the offshore situation again the variation in the results of the soss band model is substantial while the variation in the results of the fcm is more confined for the lesser black backed gull the calculations with the soss band model result in 7 74 victims per year calculated with avoidance rates between 95 and 99 5 the calculations with the fcm yield 14 and 19 victims of lesser black backed gull per year obtained with species specific collision probabilities determined in respectively wind farms slufterdam and distridam prinsen et al 2013 for black headed gull the calculations with the soss band model result in 1 12 victims per year while the calculations with the fcm using three different collision rates result in 2 8 victims per year for brent goose both models predict very low mortality of 0 1 soss band model or 0 fcm victims per year also for the sandwich tern the predicted mortality is low with 0 3 victims per year resulting from the soss band model calculations and 2 3 victims per year resulting from the calculation with the fcm using two different collision probabilities from wind farm zeebrugge in belgium everaert and stienen 2007 comparing the results of the soss band model with the results of the fcm the 95 overall avoidance rate seems to be too low and is likely to lead to an overestimated collision rate at owez krijgsveld et al 2011 measured the different avoidance rates by determining the presence of birds inside and outside the wind farm wind farm avoidance and assessing bird densities at varying distance from the turbines wind turbine avoidance the resulting overall avoidance rate for gulls was 0 980 for brent goose 0 992 and for terns 0 983 krijgsveld et al 2011 using these avoidance rates the soss band model yields collision rates that are comparable to those gained with the fcm table 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis because the fcm is a linear model changes in an individual parameter result in principle in a proportional linear change in the final result as was found for all parameters except for a macro table 4 wind farm avoidance a macro in the model is a fraction our sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 10 decrease of this fraction towards the minimum ratio of 0 no wind farm avoidance for the species groups with higher wind farm avoidance brent goose the influence of a 10 change on the calculated collision rate is larger 21 increase than for species with lower wind farm avoidance for instance lesser black backed gull 2 increase in collision rate table 4 taking into account error propagation we find a 36 61 higher outcome in the number of calculated collision fatalities table 4 for the soss band model basic model option 1 masden 2015 found a 921 increase in the calculated collision rate of the black legged kittiwake rissa tridactyla resulting from a 10 decrease in overall avoidance compared to the results of our sensitivity analysis this suggests that the sensitivity of the fcm to variation in avoidance rates is much smaller than that of the soss band model just like for the fcm the sensitivity of the soss band model to variation in avoidance rates is higher for higher initial avoidance rates in both models a 10 decrease of the avoidance rate assuming an initial wind farm avoidance a macro in the fcm or overall avoidance soss band model of 99 leads to a 990 increase in the resulting collision rate likewise in both models a 10 decrease of the avoidance rate assuming an initial avoidance rate of 1 leads to a 0 1 increase in collision rate this means that purely theoretically both models are equally sensitive to variation in avoidance rates however because in the fcm only wind farm avoidance a macro has to be entered which is always a much lower value than the overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance that has to be entered in the soss band model in practice the fcm is considerably less sensitive to realistic variation in avoidance rates than the soss band model 4 discussion and conclusions the results of case 1 showed that predictions of collision rates made with both crms can approach actual collision rates of birds in a wind farm on land as long as the input information is of sufficient quality the results of both case 1 and 2 showed that both crms yield comparable collision rates for all assessed species groups both offshore and on land with that the fcm is at least a reliable addition to the existing suite of theoretical crms in both case studies and for both crms the variation in the collision rates resulting from the model calculations was substantial as a result of limited knowledge of the specific value of input parameters the sensitivity analysis showed that the fcm is less sensitive to uncertainty in a macro than the soss band model is to uncertainty in overall avoidance due to the lower values of wind farm avoidance rates compared to those of overall avoidance rates 4 1 importance of accurate collision probabilities the fcm requires a species or species group specific collision probability determined in an existing reference wind farm e g everaert and stienen 2007 fijn et al 2012 krijgsveld et al 2009 de lucas et al 2008 winkelman 1992 information on species specific collision probabilities in offshore wind farms is scarce and collision probabilities determined in existing wind farms on land are often over estimations of the actual collision probabilities due to limitations of the collected data fijn et al 2007 krijgsveld et al 2009 the quality of the collision probability largely depends on the methods used to determine the flux through the reference wind farm and the methods used to determine the actual number of collision victims in the reference wind farm including not only collision victim searches but also trials to determine the search efficiency and disappearance rate ponce et al 2010 prosser et al 2008 smallwood 2007 for some species groups like for instance birds of prey and herons empirical collision probabilities are not yet available in the literature therefore no calculations can be made with the fcm for these species groups in the soss band model the collision probability can always be calculated for all kinds of species under the condition that detailed information on the physical characteristics of the bird species and the assessed wind turbine is available although we showed that even with collision probabilities determined on land the fcm generates results comparable to the theoretical soss band model for an offshore situation better data on species specific collision probabilities will strongly improve the accuracy of predictions of collision rates derived with the fcm this underlines the importance of the development of techniques to establish actual collision rates in offshore wind farms collier et al 2011a b desholm et al 2006 dirksen 2017 to improve the quality of the predictions made with empirical crms such as the fcm more and better field data on collision probabilities of all species groups in wind farms both offshore and on land is needed while this is in progress the crms with the necessary assumptions can only be applied following a precautionary principle accordingly in environmental impact assessments it is best to show the variation in modelling results caused by variation and uncertainty in input parameters 4 2 importance of avoidance rates the results from theoretical models like the soss band model are constrained by the fact that the overall avoidance rate of birds wind farm and wind turbine avoidance combined is largely unknown band 2012 chamberlain et al 2006 cook et al 2014 fox et al 2006 given the lack of a better alternative a standard set of estimates of overall avoidance rates is commonly implemented in the soss band model generally ranging between 95 and 99 5 band 2012 smales et al 2013 since these estimates are based on very limited field measurements cook et al 2012 the reliability of these is generally uncertain therefore it should be stressed that the outcomes of theoretical collision rate models are very sensitive to small changes in avoidance rates for example chamberlain et al 2006 showed that a 10 decrease in the avoidance rate would lead to a 2 613 increase in the predicted number of collision victims for bewick s swans cygnus columbianus bewickii at little cheyne court a wind farm in the uk see also chamberlain et al 2005 scottish natural heritage snh provided species group specific guidelines for the use of avoidance rates for the calculation of collision rates for onshore wind farms snh 2017 comparison of the results of the soss band model calculations for wind farm sabinapolder with the actual number of collision victims showed that at least in some situations the soss band model can lead to substantial overestimation of the collision rate the resulting collision rate for geese obtained with an avoidance rate of 99 5 is only slightly higher than the actual collision rate table 2 this assumes that the avoidance rate of 99 8 that is proposed for several geese species by snh is appropriate for this particular situation because the flux was measured through the vertical plane of the wind farm avoidance of the entire wind farm was 0 meaning that the avoidance rate for geese and gulls applied in the soss band model refers only to wind turbine avoidance for gulls only the lowest collision rate obtained with the soss band model with an overall avoidance rate of 99 5 corresponds to the actual collision rate as measured in the field table 2 this shows that the overall avoidance rate and in this case the wind turbine avoidance rate of gulls must have been close to 99 5 which is considerably higher than the default value of 98 proposed as the overall avoidance rate for gulls by the snh in this paper comparison of the results of the theoretical soss band model and the empirical fcm in two case studies showed that uncertainty about avoidance rates specifically hampers the interpretation of the results of the soss band model where avoidance rates are largely unknown but empirically based collision probabilities are available empirical models such as the fcm can provide more reliable estimates as wind turbine avoidance is indirectly incorporated in the collision probability moreover the fcm is less sensitive to realistic variation in wind farm avoidance than the soss band model is to realistic variation in overall avoidance additionally empirical information on wind farm avoidance is easier to obtain in the field than empirical information on overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance to improve the reliability of the results of theoretical models and the applicability of the results in decision making processes empirical knowledge of avoidance rates of different bird species remains urgently needed cook et al 2012 2014 furness et al 2013 4 3 input parameters and the precision and reliability of predictions application of the soss band model requires detailed information on many different parameters due to the high level of detail and the high number of factors that are accounted for the input parameters suggest that predictions made with the soss band model are highly accurate however for many of the parameters assumptions need to be made which introduces uncertainty in the modelling process and affects the reliability of the modelling results see for instance chamberlain et al 2006 in the fcm fewer input parameters are needed consequently the fcm focuses on the most important factors and by doing so avoids the illusion of accuracy often associated with detailed theoretical models 4 4 sensitivity analysis we found that due to the linearity of the fcm for most parameters a 10 change in the input value also leads to a 10 change in the resulting collision rate except for a macro chamberlain et al 2006 and masden 2015 both assessed the sensitivity of different versions of the band model to small changes in input parameter values they both argue that the soss band model is particularly sensitive to changes in the overall avoidance rate the results of our sensitivity analysis showed that the fcm is considerably less sensitive to realistic variation in avoidance rates than the soss band model this is caused by the fact that the values for wind farm avoidance a macro that have to be entered in the fcm are always much lower than the values for overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance that have to be entered in the soss band model compare for instance the values for the lesser black backed gull in case 2 owez in the fcm the value for a macro was 0 18 leading to a relatively low sensitivity to a 10 decrease in this value 2 increase in resulting collision rate table 4 on the other hand in the soss band model the values for overall avoidance that were applied ranged between 0 95 and 0 995 which leads to a very high sensitivity to a 10 decrease in these values 190 1 990 increase in resulting collision rates consequently we can state that uncertainty about overall avoidance rates is of much higher influence on the outcomes of the soss band model than uncertainty about wind farm avoidance is on the outcomes of the fcm finally because of the multiplicative character of the fcm error propagation of variation of different parameters can potentially yield large differences in outcomes however this is also true for the soss band model although chamberlain et al 2006 and masden 2015 did not incorporate this in their sensitivity analyses 4 5 which collision rate model to use the general idea that collision probabilities determined on land cannot be used to predict collision rates for offshore wind farms is not supported by the results of our two case studies the choice of which collision rate model to use should not depend on the location of the planned wind farm but instead on the availability and quality of information concerning avoidance rates and collision probabilities in comparable existing wind farms and the sensitivity of the model to the variation in these parameters lack of knowledge on the reliability of overall avoidance rates limits the predictive power of the theoretical soss band model while lack of high quality empirically based collision probabilities for a range of situations and species limits the reliability of the empirical fcm the accuracy of both model outputs thus relies in the first place on the quality of the input information and secondly on the theoretical details of the model calculations therefore we emphasize that future research efforts should focus on determining empirical species group specific avoidance rates and collision probabilities in existing wind farms both offshore and on land in the meantime modelling results should be treated as a general guide to the potential effects of wind farms on birds and not as precise predictions certainly not at a species group level declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by rijkswaterstaat ministry of infrastructure and

25191,collision of birds with wind turbines is an important negative effect of wind energy generation assessments of the potential numbers of bird collisions are required prior to the construction of wind farms collision rate models crms are used as a tool to estimate numbers of collision victims for wind farm initiatives in the past couple of decades various crms have been developed these models are all based on the theoretical calculation of collision probabilities theoretical models in this paper we introduce an empirical model the flux collision model fcm in which actual knowledge of species group specific collision probabilities collected in existing wind farms on land is used to calculate collision rates for planned wind farms an important quality of the fcm is that it provides a means to use empirical information to assess collision rates in environmental impact assessments eias for wind farm initiatives in addition no detailed information on bird behaviour close to the rotor is needed as this information is already incorporated in the empirical collision probability in two case studies one offshore and one on land we compare and discuss the use and performance of the empirical fcm and the theoretical soss band model for predicting collision rates of birds at wind farm initiatives to date no actual collision rates are known for the offshore situation accordingly in the fcm collision probabilities derived from wind farms on land were used nevertheless in the offshore case study the results of the fcm were comparable with those of the soss band model basic sensitivity analyses for both the fcm and the soss band model showed that purely theoretically both models are equally sensitive to changes in avoidance rates however because lower values for avoidance are applied in the fcm wind farm avoidance than in the soss band model overall avoidance in practice the effect of realistic variation in avoidance rates on the resulting collision rates is much smaller for the fcm than for the soss band model our results show that the fcm provides a valuable addition to the existing suite of theoretical crms the predictive value of the theoretical soss band model is constrained by the limited availability of knowledge on species group specific wind turbine avoidance rates which is not the case for the fcm by contrast the reliability of the empirical fcm is determined only by variation in the availability and quality of information on species group specific collision probabilities the choice of which crm to use theoretical or empirical seems not to depend on the location of the wind farm initiative as being offshore or on land but on the availability and reliability of species group specific information in existing wind farms the availability of a reliable collision probability supports the use of the fcm while the availability of information on overall avoidance rates in the absence of a species group specific collision probability supports the use of a theoretical crm like the soss band model synthesis and applications the predictive power of collision rate models relies in the first place on the quality of the input information and second on the theoretical details of the model calculations although the fcm is less dependent on measurements of avoidance rates an urgent need remains to obtain information on actual collision rates and corresponding collision probabilities as well as avoidance rates in existing wind farms both offshore and on land in order to accurately determine the impact of wind energy on bird populations keywords avoidance rate birds collision rate model sensitivity victim wind farm 1 introduction wind power has become an important source of renewable energy in the past few decades a substantial amount of large wind farms has been constructed worldwide both on land and offshore the collision of birds and bats with wind turbines is considered one of the main ecological downsides of wind power generation arnett et al 2008 drewitt and langston 2006 furness et al 2013 de lucas et al 2008 rydell et al 2010 thaxter et al 2017 generally assessments of the potential numbers of bird collisions are legally required prior to the construction of wind farms johnston et al 2014 collision rate models crms are used as a tool to predict numbers of collision victims for planned wind farms to deliver the best possible input for decision making processes regarding location and configuration of the wind farm these predictions should accurately reflect the impact of the wind farm on the environment ferrer et al 2012 over time various collision rate models have been developed masden and cook 2016 tucker 1996 most of these models are based on theoretical calculation of the collision probability using the physical characteristics of the bird and of the wind turbine theoretical models in these models the collision probability expresses the mathematical probability that a rotor blade hits a bird flying through the rotor swept zone of a specified wind turbine a widely used theoretical crm is the soss band model band 2012 due to methodological challenges empirical data on collision rates of birds at offshore wind farms are scarce collier et al 2011a desholm et al 2006 therefore theoretical models are generally used to predict collision victim numbers for offshore wind farm initiatives on land the availability of empirical data on collision rates of birds is greater than offshore drewitt and langston 2006 therefore we developed a crm the flux collision model fcm in which collision probabilities based on empirical data from research in existing wind farms the so called reference wind farms can be used to predict collision rates in planned wind farms empirical model this empirical crm includes correction factors for differences between the reference wind farm and the wind farm initiative in for instance configuration of the wind farm and size of the wind turbines we started with the development of the flux collision model fcm approximately fifteen years ago when there was a wish to use information from collision rates in existing wind farms on land to predict collision rates for future wind farms in the netherlands through the years the model has been updated and expanded several times currently the fcm is applied in most environmental impact assessments eias for dutch wind farm initiatives on land our goal is to provide an empirical addition to the existing theoretical crms as far as we know there are currently no peer reviewed empirical crms available masden and cook 2016 with the fcm we do not wish to replace the existing theoretical crms but aim to expand the available set of tools to improve the predicted collision rates for wind farms in all possible situations and settings incorporating all available information in this paper we 1 introduce the empirical flux collision model 2 compare the empirical approach flux collision model with the theoretical approach soss band model using two case studies one on land and one offshore 3 discuss the sensitivity of both models to variation in parameter values 4 provide advice on the use of theoretical and empirical collision rate models and 5 denote the issues on which future research should focus to improve the reliability of collision rate model calculations 2 methods 2 1 general design of collision rate models to provide a background to the following description of the flux collision model we first explain the general design of collision rate models simply stated crms comprise four main components 1 number of birds at risk 2 avoidance 3 encounter probability and 4 collision probability firstly the number of birds at risk can be derived from field data which can be collected in numerous ways it can be expressed as a flux through the wind farm area number of birds flying through a defined vertical plane in a specific amount of time or as a density in the wind farm area number of birds per volume air secondly avoidance takes place on different scales birds can avoid the entire wind farm or they can avoid individual wind turbines when flying through a wind farm thirdly the encounter probability refers to the probability that a bird flying through a wind farm comes across the area swept by the rotor blades lastly the collision probability is the probability that a bird flying through the rotor swept zone of a wind farm or wind turbine comes in contact with the moving rotor blades to become a collision victim 2 2 flux collision model the fcm is an empirical crm that can be used in situations where species group specific empirical information on the collision probability in an existing wind farm the reference wind farm is readily available in the fcm eq 1 the collision probability p measured at an existing wind farm is combined with the flux of birds through the wind farm initiative b h 1 a macro to predict the number of collision victims c the fcm contains correction factors for differences between the reference wind farm and the planned wind farm in turbine dimensions r r ref p cor wind farm configuration e e ref and the proportion of the flux at rotor height h cor all of which influence the collision probability see table 1 for a detailed description of all parameters 1 c b h 1 a macro h cor r r ref e e ref p cor p together the parameters b h and a macro define the bird flux through the planned wind farm the flux b is the total number of birds flying over the location where the wind farm is planned in a specific period of time year month day depending on how the flux b is measured or estimated parameters h the proportion of birds flying at turbine height and a macro wind farm avoidance rate are applied to reduce the total flux at the wind farm location to the number of birds that will likely be flying through the planned wind farm the application of parameter h is only relevant when the bird flux b is measured up to a great height above the wind farm for instance when including seasonal migration turbine height is defined as the area between ground or water level and maximum tip height often the bird flux is measured in a situation without wind turbines when the turbines are present generally part of the birds will avoid the wind farm by flying around or over it this fraction of birds avoiding the wind farm is then denoted as the parameter a macro h cor corrects for differences in the proportion of birds at rotor height between the reference wind farm and the planned wind farm to calculate h cor the fraction of the flux at rotor height in the planned wind farm is divided by the fraction of the flux at rotor height in the reference wind farm this correction factor covers both the potential difference in space underneath the rotor between the reference wind farm and the wind farm initiative as well as the potential difference in flight height of the assessed species group between both locations the combination of these factors determines the fraction of the flux at rotor height r r ref corrects for differences in the encounter probability caused by a different coverage of the vertical plane of the wind farm by the rotors both r and r ref are calculated in the same way eq 2 based on the rotor area o rotor diameter d and distance d between the turbines of the planned wind farm or the reference wind farm oref dref and dref parameters r and r ref are calculated for one turbine 2 r o d d to correct for differences in the average number of turbines encountered while flying through the planned wind farm e or the reference wind farm e ref the parameter e e ref is incorporated in the fcm the average number of turbines that a bird encounters while passing a wind farm depends on the configuration of the wind farm and the main flight direction of birds through the wind farm values for e and e ref can be estimated or calculated using a specific encounter probability model such as the bolker model bolker et al 2006 2014 with the parameter p cor the collision probability is corrected for the difference in rotor area and related rotation speed and part of the rotor area that is covered by the rotor blades between the turbines of the planned wind farm and the turbines of the reference wind farm for a large rotor with relatively slower rotation speed and wider blades the average collision probability per square metre of rotor area is lower compared to that of smaller rotors the equation to calculate the correction factor p cor eq 3 is based on the relationship between the theoretical collision probability of birds flying through the rotor and the rotor area which we derived from existing formulas for the theoretical calculation of the collision probability band 2012 3 p cor 0 9785 o oref 0 26 lastly p represents the collision probability for the specific species group as determined in the reference wind farm the collision probability refers to the entire reference wind farm and not to a single wind turbine the choice for a specific collision probability depends on the species group in question and the location and configuration of the wind farm initiative and the dimensions of the planned wind turbines in some cases several good quality collision probabilities are available for the same species group in these cases the predicted number of collision victims can be calculated using all available collision probabilities separate calculations after which the average number of collision victims can be derived including the range in outcomes see for example appendix a an important difference between the fcm and most existing theoretical crms is the scale to which the collision probability refers a single wind turbine or the entire wind farm the soss band model calculates the theoretical collision probability for birds flying through the rotor swept zone of a single wind turbine while the fcm makes use of an empirically determined collision probability for birds flying through the entire wind farm area because of this difference in calculating collision probabilities there is also a difference in the way in which avoidance is incorporated in the crms when using the soss band model the avoidance of the entire wind farm as well as the avoidance of individual wind turbines or even rotors has to be estimated and entered as an overall avoidance rate cook et al 2014 in the fcm only the avoidance of the entire wind farm needs to be estimated a macro as wind turbine avoidance is already incorporated in the applied collision probability this is because the empirical collision probability is calculated by combining the flux through the entire reference wind farm with the actual collision rate in the reference wind farm birds that avoid the individual wind turbines or rotors in the reference wind farm do not collide and are therefore not reflected in the measured collision rate this is an important advantage of the fcm avoidance of entire wind farms is less complicated to observe in the field than the avoidance of individual rotors as the latter involves complex within wind farm behaviour the level of which may be dependent on a range of factors 2 3 case studies for the comparison of crms to compare the performance of a theoretical and an empirical crm we applied our fcm and the soss band model band 2012 to two case studies one on land case 1 and one offshore case 2 the models can be applied to both on land and offshore wind farms without adaptations to the model parameterisation in the on land case study we also compared the model results with the actual number of collision victims determined in a two year field study in the wind farm in question in order to validate the accuracy of the models for case 1 we selected wind farm sabinapolder in the southwest of the netherlands the wind farm is located along a dike between lake krammer volkerak and a polder with agricultural fields and consists of six 0 85 mw turbines in a single row with a hub height of 48 1 m a rotor diameter of 52 m and an average rotation speed of 26 rpm the average distance between the turbines is 250 m the data on fluxes and flight height that were used in the model calculations were extracted from verbeek et al 2012 for case 2 we selected offshore wind farm egmond aan zee owez owez is located 10 18 km off the dutch coast in the north sea and exists of 36 turbines 3 mw placed in a more or less rectangular configuration with a hub height of 70 m and a rotor diameter of 90 m the distance between turbines within rows is 650 m and between rows 1000 m in the model calculations we used an average distance between turbines of 825 m to account for the random flight angles through the wind farm the data on fluxes and avoidance rates used in the model calculations was extracted from krijgsveld et al 2011 and poot et al 2011 2 3 1 data collection case 1 in the on land wind farm sabinapolder a field study was conducted during two consecutive years to determine the number of collision victims and the flight activity of birds verbeek et al 2012 for the species groups geese and gulls the flux was determined by using visual bird counts geese and gulls and radar observations geese fluxes were measured between october 2009 and april 2011 for gulls the visually determined flux referred to the diurnal period this diurnal flux was extrapolated to the nocturnal period based on the nocturnal flight activity of the most common gull species in the wind farm area the black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus garthe and hüppop 2004 the flux for geese was specifically determined in the winter months september february around sunrise and sunset when the birds were moving between foraging and resting grounds for both species groups the average number of collision victims per year was determined in the field which enables model validation i e comparison of the modelling results with the actual collision rate the actual number of collision victims per year was determined based on the number of victims found in carcass searches which were corrected for search efficiency the removal of carcasses by predators and the area under the wind turbines that could be searched for carcasses because both geese and gulls were easy to detect due to their size and or colour and because all carcasses remained longer than the maximum period of 14 days between search rounds the search efficiency was assumed to be 100 and carcass loss 0 for geese only the collision victims in the period september february were considered as the flux used in the model calculations specifically refers to that period the greylag goose anser anser was the most common goose species in the wind farm area case 2 in the offshore wind farm egmond aan zee owez fluxes of birds through the wind farm were measured by means of radar and visual observations combined krijgsveld et al 2011 these measurements were performed in a three year study 2007 2009 we selected four species for which we used the measured fluxes to predict the collision rate lesser black backed gull larus fuscus black headed gull brent goose branta bernicla and sandwich tern thalasseus sandvicensis for all species the applied flux refers to the measured diurnal situation for all months of the year appendix 7 in poot et al 2011 2 3 2 input flux collision model 2 3 2 1 wind farm data as the turbines in wind farm sabinapolder are aligned in a single row situated more or less perpendicular to the main flight direction of gulls and geese crossing the wind farm we assumed that birds flying through wind farm sabinapolder encountered on average one wind turbine this was supported by the results of the field observations verbeek et al 2012 in owez no main flight direction of local birds not on active migration through the wind farm was observed krijgsveld et al 2011 the configuration of owez concerns a more or less rectangular cluster of turbines see fig 3 2 in krijgsveld et al 2011 therefore the average number of turbines encountered during a single crossing 6 for all different flight directions was determined by taking the square root of the total number of turbines 2 3 2 2 collision probabilities for all species groups we selected available collision probabilities to use them in the model calculations appendix a case 1 for geese the applied collision probability was derived from a study in the wieringermeer in the netherlands fijn et al 2007 where a maximum collision probability of 0 01 was calculated for swans and geese this is the only available collision probability for geese that we can use in this case study as the other available species group specific collision probability for geese originates from the research in wind farm sabinapolder our case study data from verbeek et al 2012 fijn et al 2007 calculated the collision probability of geese and swans together by combining the flux through the two studied wind farms in a specific period of time with the maximum number of collision victims of the studied species groups in the wind farms in the same time period since the collision probability from fijn et al 2007 concerns a maximum collision probability this is likely to result in an overestimation of the number of collision victims for gulls we applied collision probabilities from three different reference wind farms appendix a one located in the western part of the netherlands prinsen et al 2013 and two in belgium everaert 2008 as 80 of the gulls in wind farm sabinapolder were black headed gulls we only used collision probabilities of this particular species case 2 for existing offshore wind farms actual collision rates are not yet available we therefore used collision probabilities determined at existing wind farms on land in combination with local bird fluxes by doing so we are able to test whether the application of collision probabilities determined on land yields results for an offshore wind farm that are comparable to those of the theoretical soss band model which has been specifically developed for offshore wind farms band 2012 for lesser black backed gull we applied collision probabilities from two adjacent reference wind farms in the western part of the netherlands wind farm slufterdam and wind farm distridam prinsen et al 2013 for black headed gull we applied collision probabilities from three different reference wind farms as was the case for wind farm sabinapolder appendix a for sandwich tern we applied two collision probabilities from the same reference wind farm determined separately over two consecutive years this reference wind farm is located in zeebrugge in belgium everaert and stienen 2007 for brent goose we applied the collision probability that was derived for geese in the study in wind farm sabinapolder data from verbeek et al 2012 for all four species the applied collision probabilities are the only species specific collision probabilities that are available for species groups with more than one available collision probability the calculations with the fcm were performed separately for each individual collision probability the resulting collision rates were averaged to obtain the final result appendix a 2 3 2 3 avoidance as the flux in wind farm sabinapolder was measured through the vertical plane of the wind farm the wind farm avoidance rate was set to 0 in the calculations for offshore wind farm egmond aan zee wind farm avoidance rates were taken from krijgsveld et al 2011 lesser black backed gull and black headed gull 0 18 brent goose 0 68 and sandwich tern 0 28 wind turbine avoidance rates are indirectly incorporated in the empirical collision probabilities that are used in the fcm 2 3 3 input soss band model 2 3 3 1 bird data flight speeds were derived from alerstam et al 2007 bruderer and boldt 2001 and wakeling and hodgson 1992 for bird length and wingspan we used the average of the species specific ranges presented by snow and perrins 1998 as we do not know species specific fluxes for wind farm sabinapolder but only fluxes for the species groups geese and gulls average values for bird length wingspan and flight speed were used for these species groups weighted by the presence of species of geese and gulls in the area appendix a 2 3 3 2 avoidance the overall avoidance rate combination of wind farm and rotor avoidance of birds is largely unknown so therefore four standard avoidance rates were applied in the model to generate four estimates of the collision rate 95 98 99 and 99 5 2 3 4 input both models for two of the main parameters for the calculation of the collision rate the input for the fcm and the soss band model is more or less the same these parameters are the flux and the proportion of the flux at rotor height 2 3 4 1 flux in both models the number of birds at risk represents the starting point for the calculation of the collision rate the difference between the crms is the way in which the number of birds at risk is expressed for the fcm the input needs to be expressed as a flux through the wind farm area in a specific amount of time absolute number of birds for the soss band model the same information needs to be expressed as a density in the wind farm area in both models the same information on the presence of birds in wind farm sabinapolder and owez was used we only transformed the data to fit the input requirements of both models 2 3 4 2 proportion of birds at rotor height in both models this parameter is entered as a fraction as there is no difference in the flux that is entered in both models there is also no difference in the proportion of the flux at rotor height the proportion of birds flying at rotor height in wind farm sabinapolder was 0 913 for geese and 0 844 for gulls for owez no species specific data on the proportion of birds flying at rotor height were available to compare the performance of the fcm and the soss band model it is not necessary to know the exact species specific proportion of birds at rotor height as long as the same proportion is used in both crms for simplicity we assumed that the flux of all discussed species was evenly distributed over the vertical plane of the wind farm between water level and maximum tip height as the rotor covers 78 3 of the vertical plane of the wind farm we assumed that this proportion of the flux of the discussed species flew at rotor height 2 4 sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of the fcm for uncertainty in parameter values we performed a basic sensitivity analysis using the calculations of case 2 owez for each of the four species we only used one collision probability and reference wind farm as the baseline collision probability does not influence the results of the sensitivity analysis the parameters referring to wind turbine dimensions and wind farm configuration r r ref e e ref and p cor which are fixed known values were excluded from the sensitivity analysis the input values for the remaining parameters which are related to the occurrence and behaviour of birds are subject to variation and uncertainty we individually changed the value of each of these remaining parameters by 10 whichever leads to a higher collision rate to test the effect on the collision rate chamberlain et al 2006 masden 2015 factors b and h both influence the flux number of birds through the wind farm area in the sensitivity analysis the effect of a 10 increase in flux combination of b and h is assessed as for owez case 2 the value for b refers to the flux through the wind farm at turbine height between water level and maximum tip height the value for h in the fcm calculations for owez is 1 as h can never exceed 1 the 10 increase in flux for the sensitivity analysis is in this case achieved by a 10 increase in parameter b because of the multiplicative character of the fcm error propagation of variation of different parameters can potentially yield large differences in outcomes therefore we also cumulatively changed the values of the selected parameters and tested the effect on the resulting collision rate we would have liked to also test the sensitivity of the fcm for a more realistic variation in the assessed parameters masden 2015 however detailed empirical information on the variation in a macro is lacking dierschke et al 2016 and data on variation in collision probabilities p and proportions of birds at rotor height influencing h cor are very scarce given the currently available information we argue that performing a sensitivity analysis based on an estimated realistic variation in parameter values will not yield valuable additional insight in the sensitivity of the fcm 3 results 3 1 case 1 on land wind farm sabinapolder for both geese and gulls the variation in the collision rates resulting from the model calculations is substantial table 2 in the soss band model minor differences in avoidance rates lead to significant variation in collision rates 23 225 victims of geese per year and 10 102 victims of gulls per year in the fcm the use of different collision probabilities for gulls renders collision rates varying from 11 up to 50 victims per year this shows that for both models slightly different input values may lead to large differences in resulting collision rates for both geese and gulls the collision rates obtained with the fcm fall within the range of the collision rates obtained with the soss band model with 95 99 5 overall avoidance rates the results of both the fcm on average 34 victims of geese and 32 victims of gulls per year and the soss band model are higher than the actual collision rate as measured in the field 3 5 geese per year and 8 5 gulls per year see also table 2 for geese an overestimation of collision victims was expected for the fcm since a maximum collision probability was applied 3 2 case 2 offshore wind farm owez for owez the actual collision rates are unknown therefore this case study can only be used to compare the output of both collision rate models again the projections of the fcm fall within the range of the results of the soss band model table 3 this means that in spite of the fact that collision probabilities used in the fcm had been determined in on land wind farms both models seem equally suitable for the offshore situation again the variation in the results of the soss band model is substantial while the variation in the results of the fcm is more confined for the lesser black backed gull the calculations with the soss band model result in 7 74 victims per year calculated with avoidance rates between 95 and 99 5 the calculations with the fcm yield 14 and 19 victims of lesser black backed gull per year obtained with species specific collision probabilities determined in respectively wind farms slufterdam and distridam prinsen et al 2013 for black headed gull the calculations with the soss band model result in 1 12 victims per year while the calculations with the fcm using three different collision rates result in 2 8 victims per year for brent goose both models predict very low mortality of 0 1 soss band model or 0 fcm victims per year also for the sandwich tern the predicted mortality is low with 0 3 victims per year resulting from the soss band model calculations and 2 3 victims per year resulting from the calculation with the fcm using two different collision probabilities from wind farm zeebrugge in belgium everaert and stienen 2007 comparing the results of the soss band model with the results of the fcm the 95 overall avoidance rate seems to be too low and is likely to lead to an overestimated collision rate at owez krijgsveld et al 2011 measured the different avoidance rates by determining the presence of birds inside and outside the wind farm wind farm avoidance and assessing bird densities at varying distance from the turbines wind turbine avoidance the resulting overall avoidance rate for gulls was 0 980 for brent goose 0 992 and for terns 0 983 krijgsveld et al 2011 using these avoidance rates the soss band model yields collision rates that are comparable to those gained with the fcm table 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis because the fcm is a linear model changes in an individual parameter result in principle in a proportional linear change in the final result as was found for all parameters except for a macro table 4 wind farm avoidance a macro in the model is a fraction our sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 10 decrease of this fraction towards the minimum ratio of 0 no wind farm avoidance for the species groups with higher wind farm avoidance brent goose the influence of a 10 change on the calculated collision rate is larger 21 increase than for species with lower wind farm avoidance for instance lesser black backed gull 2 increase in collision rate table 4 taking into account error propagation we find a 36 61 higher outcome in the number of calculated collision fatalities table 4 for the soss band model basic model option 1 masden 2015 found a 921 increase in the calculated collision rate of the black legged kittiwake rissa tridactyla resulting from a 10 decrease in overall avoidance compared to the results of our sensitivity analysis this suggests that the sensitivity of the fcm to variation in avoidance rates is much smaller than that of the soss band model just like for the fcm the sensitivity of the soss band model to variation in avoidance rates is higher for higher initial avoidance rates in both models a 10 decrease of the avoidance rate assuming an initial wind farm avoidance a macro in the fcm or overall avoidance soss band model of 99 leads to a 990 increase in the resulting collision rate likewise in both models a 10 decrease of the avoidance rate assuming an initial avoidance rate of 1 leads to a 0 1 increase in collision rate this means that purely theoretically both models are equally sensitive to variation in avoidance rates however because in the fcm only wind farm avoidance a macro has to be entered which is always a much lower value than the overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance that has to be entered in the soss band model in practice the fcm is considerably less sensitive to realistic variation in avoidance rates than the soss band model 4 discussion and conclusions the results of case 1 showed that predictions of collision rates made with both crms can approach actual collision rates of birds in a wind farm on land as long as the input information is of sufficient quality the results of both case 1 and 2 showed that both crms yield comparable collision rates for all assessed species groups both offshore and on land with that the fcm is at least a reliable addition to the existing suite of theoretical crms in both case studies and for both crms the variation in the collision rates resulting from the model calculations was substantial as a result of limited knowledge of the specific value of input parameters the sensitivity analysis showed that the fcm is less sensitive to uncertainty in a macro than the soss band model is to uncertainty in overall avoidance due to the lower values of wind farm avoidance rates compared to those of overall avoidance rates 4 1 importance of accurate collision probabilities the fcm requires a species or species group specific collision probability determined in an existing reference wind farm e g everaert and stienen 2007 fijn et al 2012 krijgsveld et al 2009 de lucas et al 2008 winkelman 1992 information on species specific collision probabilities in offshore wind farms is scarce and collision probabilities determined in existing wind farms on land are often over estimations of the actual collision probabilities due to limitations of the collected data fijn et al 2007 krijgsveld et al 2009 the quality of the collision probability largely depends on the methods used to determine the flux through the reference wind farm and the methods used to determine the actual number of collision victims in the reference wind farm including not only collision victim searches but also trials to determine the search efficiency and disappearance rate ponce et al 2010 prosser et al 2008 smallwood 2007 for some species groups like for instance birds of prey and herons empirical collision probabilities are not yet available in the literature therefore no calculations can be made with the fcm for these species groups in the soss band model the collision probability can always be calculated for all kinds of species under the condition that detailed information on the physical characteristics of the bird species and the assessed wind turbine is available although we showed that even with collision probabilities determined on land the fcm generates results comparable to the theoretical soss band model for an offshore situation better data on species specific collision probabilities will strongly improve the accuracy of predictions of collision rates derived with the fcm this underlines the importance of the development of techniques to establish actual collision rates in offshore wind farms collier et al 2011a b desholm et al 2006 dirksen 2017 to improve the quality of the predictions made with empirical crms such as the fcm more and better field data on collision probabilities of all species groups in wind farms both offshore and on land is needed while this is in progress the crms with the necessary assumptions can only be applied following a precautionary principle accordingly in environmental impact assessments it is best to show the variation in modelling results caused by variation and uncertainty in input parameters 4 2 importance of avoidance rates the results from theoretical models like the soss band model are constrained by the fact that the overall avoidance rate of birds wind farm and wind turbine avoidance combined is largely unknown band 2012 chamberlain et al 2006 cook et al 2014 fox et al 2006 given the lack of a better alternative a standard set of estimates of overall avoidance rates is commonly implemented in the soss band model generally ranging between 95 and 99 5 band 2012 smales et al 2013 since these estimates are based on very limited field measurements cook et al 2012 the reliability of these is generally uncertain therefore it should be stressed that the outcomes of theoretical collision rate models are very sensitive to small changes in avoidance rates for example chamberlain et al 2006 showed that a 10 decrease in the avoidance rate would lead to a 2 613 increase in the predicted number of collision victims for bewick s swans cygnus columbianus bewickii at little cheyne court a wind farm in the uk see also chamberlain et al 2005 scottish natural heritage snh provided species group specific guidelines for the use of avoidance rates for the calculation of collision rates for onshore wind farms snh 2017 comparison of the results of the soss band model calculations for wind farm sabinapolder with the actual number of collision victims showed that at least in some situations the soss band model can lead to substantial overestimation of the collision rate the resulting collision rate for geese obtained with an avoidance rate of 99 5 is only slightly higher than the actual collision rate table 2 this assumes that the avoidance rate of 99 8 that is proposed for several geese species by snh is appropriate for this particular situation because the flux was measured through the vertical plane of the wind farm avoidance of the entire wind farm was 0 meaning that the avoidance rate for geese and gulls applied in the soss band model refers only to wind turbine avoidance for gulls only the lowest collision rate obtained with the soss band model with an overall avoidance rate of 99 5 corresponds to the actual collision rate as measured in the field table 2 this shows that the overall avoidance rate and in this case the wind turbine avoidance rate of gulls must have been close to 99 5 which is considerably higher than the default value of 98 proposed as the overall avoidance rate for gulls by the snh in this paper comparison of the results of the theoretical soss band model and the empirical fcm in two case studies showed that uncertainty about avoidance rates specifically hampers the interpretation of the results of the soss band model where avoidance rates are largely unknown but empirically based collision probabilities are available empirical models such as the fcm can provide more reliable estimates as wind turbine avoidance is indirectly incorporated in the collision probability moreover the fcm is less sensitive to realistic variation in wind farm avoidance than the soss band model is to realistic variation in overall avoidance additionally empirical information on wind farm avoidance is easier to obtain in the field than empirical information on overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance to improve the reliability of the results of theoretical models and the applicability of the results in decision making processes empirical knowledge of avoidance rates of different bird species remains urgently needed cook et al 2012 2014 furness et al 2013 4 3 input parameters and the precision and reliability of predictions application of the soss band model requires detailed information on many different parameters due to the high level of detail and the high number of factors that are accounted for the input parameters suggest that predictions made with the soss band model are highly accurate however for many of the parameters assumptions need to be made which introduces uncertainty in the modelling process and affects the reliability of the modelling results see for instance chamberlain et al 2006 in the fcm fewer input parameters are needed consequently the fcm focuses on the most important factors and by doing so avoids the illusion of accuracy often associated with detailed theoretical models 4 4 sensitivity analysis we found that due to the linearity of the fcm for most parameters a 10 change in the input value also leads to a 10 change in the resulting collision rate except for a macro chamberlain et al 2006 and masden 2015 both assessed the sensitivity of different versions of the band model to small changes in input parameter values they both argue that the soss band model is particularly sensitive to changes in the overall avoidance rate the results of our sensitivity analysis showed that the fcm is considerably less sensitive to realistic variation in avoidance rates than the soss band model this is caused by the fact that the values for wind farm avoidance a macro that have to be entered in the fcm are always much lower than the values for overall avoidance including wind turbine avoidance that have to be entered in the soss band model compare for instance the values for the lesser black backed gull in case 2 owez in the fcm the value for a macro was 0 18 leading to a relatively low sensitivity to a 10 decrease in this value 2 increase in resulting collision rate table 4 on the other hand in the soss band model the values for overall avoidance that were applied ranged between 0 95 and 0 995 which leads to a very high sensitivity to a 10 decrease in these values 190 1 990 increase in resulting collision rates consequently we can state that uncertainty about overall avoidance rates is of much higher influence on the outcomes of the soss band model than uncertainty about wind farm avoidance is on the outcomes of the fcm finally because of the multiplicative character of the fcm error propagation of variation of different parameters can potentially yield large differences in outcomes however this is also true for the soss band model although chamberlain et al 2006 and masden 2015 did not incorporate this in their sensitivity analyses 4 5 which collision rate model to use the general idea that collision probabilities determined on land cannot be used to predict collision rates for offshore wind farms is not supported by the results of our two case studies the choice of which collision rate model to use should not depend on the location of the planned wind farm but instead on the availability and quality of information concerning avoidance rates and collision probabilities in comparable existing wind farms and the sensitivity of the model to the variation in these parameters lack of knowledge on the reliability of overall avoidance rates limits the predictive power of the theoretical soss band model while lack of high quality empirically based collision probabilities for a range of situations and species limits the reliability of the empirical fcm the accuracy of both model outputs thus relies in the first place on the quality of the input information and secondly on the theoretical details of the model calculations therefore we emphasize that future research efforts should focus on determining empirical species group specific avoidance rates and collision probabilities in existing wind farms both offshore and on land in the meantime modelling results should be treated as a general guide to the potential effects of wind farms on birds and not as precise predictions certainly not at a species group level declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by rijkswaterstaat ministry of infrastructure and

25192,the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve constitute the simplest theoretical framework for ecological communities involving different kinds of interspecific interactions e g competition facilitation these equations have been often criticized as being too simple to model real systems this study has two main goals first to test the lglve as a quantitative tool for describing explaining predicting the equilibrium species abundances that is how accurately the lglve predict the yields of s interacting species second to show analyze which quantitative predictions are possible with an incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters with this aim i compiled from the literature 33 experiments most of them for plants which measured species yields in monoculture biculture and in mixtures of s 2 species i found that by obtaining the lglve parameters from the yields in monoculture and biculture experiments the lglve can accurately predict the majority of the equilibrium species yields in the mixtures of s 2 species for most of the experiments however in many natural communities e g tropical forests or plankton s can be of the order of hundreds and estimating all the model parameters from empirical data is unfeasible but by estimating the mean interaction coefficient from the yields of an incomplete set of monoculture and biculture experiments the lglve still can make accurate predictions firstly it is possible to derive simple formulas which are able to predict the relative yield total and mean relative yield secondly when we are interested in the fate or performance of a particular species we can use a more refined approximation to predict the yield of this focal species with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve keywords prediction of species abundances generalized lotka volterra model quantitative ecology community matrix accuracy indices community ecology 1 introduction ecology can be defined as the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms andrewartha 1961 or more precisely as the scientific study of the interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms krebs 1978 abundance is a far better measure of the effects a species has on its local ecosystem than simply whether it is present ehrlén and morris 2015 and is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions andrewartha and birch 1954 krebs 1978 gaston 1994 for species of value to humans estimates of future abundance will be essential for regulating current and future harvests in addition for species of conservation concern their future numbers will be an important determinant of their extinction risk for instance mathematical methods commonly employed to forecast the yield and production of agricultural crops have been mostly linear statistical models nass smb 2012 however the interest in descriptive or phenomenological modelling of biomass production and yield of crops has increased recently marcelis et al 1998 kirwan et al 2009 halty et al 2017 descriptive models have in general a short computing time and they usually contain few state variables making them helpful tools for reliable predictions the most popular mathematical models for describing the species abundances in terms of their interactions are based on the lotka volterra equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 lotka and volterra derived two different sets of equations one set applies to situations involving competition for food or space and the other set to the predator prey situation lotka volterra models are descriptive or phenomenological models i e they describe how the abundance of one species affects the abundance of another without specifically including a particular mechanism for such interaction morin 2011 for example in the case of the competition model the particular competition mechanism such as depletion of a shared resource or territorial interference competition is not specified rather competition coefficients summarizing the effects of one species on another are used the generalized lotka volterra equations are a set of equations which are more general than either the competitive or predator prey examples of lotka volterra types hofbauer and sigmund 1998 pastor 2008 and thus can accommodate the different kinds of interactions that generally occur among species e g competition facilitation this theory in its simplest formulation consists in a set of linear equations for the per capita growth rates these linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve can be thought as the first order or linear approximation in a taylor series expansion of the per capita growth rates of species about the equilibrium points of a more complex and general theory volterra 1926 1931 the lglve for s interacting species within a single trophic level can be written as 1 1 y i d y i d t r i 1 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s where yi is a variable denoting the yield like the biomass density or a proxy of it like the biovolume or the number of individuals of species i ri its intrinsic growth rate ki its equilibrium yield in monoculture or carrying capacity and αij is an interaction coefficient quantifying the direct effect of species j on species i through their pairwise interaction which can be either negative competition positive facilitation or zero the intraspecific interaction coefficients are taken as αii 1 for all i in such a way to recover the logistic equation for a single species the linear lotka volterra equations have been often criticized as being too simple for modelling real systems for example the s 2 species model is valid only to the extent that higher order interactions are null or negligible compared to pairwise interactions simberloff 1982 another criticism is that model predictions in general assume that the community is at equilibrium in the strict mathematical sense a community is at equilibrium only when the rate of change for all species i e the left hand side of eq 1 is zero but this theoretical ideal is rarely achieved in natural communities wiens 1984 roxburgh and wilson 2000 in fact the focus of lotka volterra theory has been mostly on qualitative general issues like community stability and species coexistence rather than on making quantitative predictions to be tested against experimental data like the species abundances in equilibrium hubbel 2002 these equilibrium abundances predicted by eq 1 verify 2 y i k i j 1 s α y i j j 0 i 1 s where the stars denote quantities at equilibrium a main difficulty for obtaining from the set of eq 2 the equilibrium species yields yi is how to get the set of parameters ki α ij a straightforward procedure is to perform during sufficiently long enough periods in order the equilibrium state is reached a the s single species or monoculture experiments and from each of them to estimate ki as the yield of the species i b the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments and for each of them obtain the pair of the biculture pairwise experiments yields y i j e x and y j i e x the superscript ex is for denoting experimentally measured quantities to distinguish them from the theoretical ones and the subscripts i j and j i stand for the relative yield of species i in presence of species j and vice versa using a and b αij and αji can be obtained by solving eq 2 for s 2 as pastor 2008 3 α i j y i j e x k i y j i e x α j i y j i e x k j y i j e x therefore if the yield of species i in biculture with species j is ki ki then αij 0 0 and the interaction of j on i is facilitative competitive this is the kind of approach followed by vandermeer 1969 in a pioneering experimental study with protozoa here i want to push the lglve to their limits as quantitative tools for describing explaining predicting the outcome of experiments assuming a state of equilibrium was reached therefore our first goal is to answer the following three questions 1 can lglve accurately predict the species yields in a community of interacting species 2 in the cases in which the lglve fail at predicting with reasonable accuracy at least one of the species yields with relatively slight modifications of few interaction coefficients within their confidence intervals can they accurately reproduce ex post all the species yields 1 1 notice that this is different than the ex ante prediction 1 since it uses the information of the empirical values of yi ex to modify some of interaction parameters α ij in order to improve the accuracy of the corresponding theoretical relative yields additionally if the confidence intervals are very large one may wonder if a simpler purely random method can do equally better that is 3 how does the lglve method compare with random sampling methods for example considering a random sampling of interaction matrices a limitation of the experimental procedure described above of performing all the monoculture and biculture treatments the principal one is that it is feasible provided s is not too large since the number of required experiments grows as s 2 thus for large values of s only a fraction of these experiments is commonly carried out and consequently we have an incomplete knowledge of the s 2 parameters required to compute the equilibrium yields from the lglve hence our second goal is predicting with incomplete information and answering these couple of additional questions 1 what global or aggregate quantities can be quantitatively predicted when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete 2 what about predicting the performance of a given particular species when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete all these questions are important since depending on their answers either lglve can be accurate enough as a quantitative modelling tool or more complex modelling involving additional parameters would be required to answer questions 1 3 i compiled from the literature a set of experiments designed to measure the effects of intra and interspecific interactions in single trophic communities with s 2 species the empirical yi ex of all species were compared for each experiment against the values obtained from the lglve 2 2 actually in few experiments there were temporal series that would allow going beyond the single equilibrium point for example in vandermeer 1969 the abundances of species were measured at 32 different times and this permitted him to draw the entire dynamical curve by eye through the observed data points nevertheless this was not the case for the vast majority of the experiments considered here rather the species yields were measured for few different times and were not enough to obtain the time evolution of such yields and fitting and additional set of parameters the species intrinsic growth rates it is worth remarking that as mentioned the approach followed to answer questions 1 and 2 is not novel as it was already used by vandermeer for protozoa 1969 the main novelty is to test this approach against an extensive database covering many experiments with different species richness and across distinct taxonomic groups another novelty is the proposal of a set of indices some of them customarily used in the atmospheric and hydrologic sciences see materials and methods to quantitative assess the degree to which the lglve match the observations in the case of an incomplete knowledge of the parameters ɑij to answer question 4 i refer to a recently proposed mean field approximation to predict aggregate or mean variables computed in terms of relative yields fort 2018a and to answer question 5 i introduce a novel more refined approximation which i will call the focal species approximation develop some cases and show the corresponding results a full analysis of this method will be presented in fort 2018b 2 materials and methods 2 1 data set each of the experiments selected in this study to answer questions 1 2 involved a multispecies community s 2 with species belonging to the same taxonomic group plants algae etc the experiments also verified that all the species yields biomass density in most of the cases but also biovolume and number of individuals in one experiment vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values thus in what follows since we always assume an equilibrium or quasi equilibrium state we will omit the for all yields in the understanding that they are yields in equilibrium in addition the experiments were such that they included measurements of all the yields for the treatments listed below i i the yields of the s coexisting species one treatment ii the yields of species in monoculture s treatments iii the yields of species in bicultures s s 1 2 treatments the polyculture yields y i e x and monoculture yields ki as well as their se are obtained respectively by taking averages over replicas of i and ii similarly the biculture yields y i j e x and y j i e x and their se are obtained from replicas of iii the interaction coefficient between species i and j can in turn be computed from y i j e x and y j i e x by using 3 a total of 33 experiments verifying the above requirements were compiled from the literature some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions they included mostly plants but also algae crustacean and protozoa see table 1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references 2 2 obtaining the theoretical yields linear algebra solutions and simulations the straightforward way of obtaining the yi is by solving the eq 2 for the given set of empirically determined parameters ki αij the equilibrium state in which all the s species coexist verifies 2 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s or in matrix form ay k where a denotes the s s interaction matrix αij thereafter y and k are column vectors of s entries with respectively the yields yi and the carrying capacities and then by inverting this matrix relationship we obtain the column vector y with the s yields however for 21 of the 33 interaction matrices inverting 2 produces at least one negative value this means that the interaction matrix obtained by eq 3 is not fully consistent with the equilibrium in which all the species coexist i e this equilibrium is unfeasible and thus yl 0 for some species l therefore rather than 2 we have to consider 2 and instead of a single equilibrium the system of equations has multiple equilibria in which at least one species extinguishes this theoretical equilibrium with yl 0 would still be consistent with the experimental one provided the corresponding empirically measured y l e x is small enough so that yl 0 falls within the 95 confidence interval around y l e x to find among this set of possible equilibria the one towards which the system converges i simulated the dynamical eq 1 starting from a random set of initial values yi for more details see suppl mat 2 3 accuracy measures to quantitative evaluate the performance of the lglve how well a model fits the observed data usually is determined by comparing model predicted values with observations frequently evaluations of model performance utilize statistics based on the familiar pearson s correlation coefficient r or its square the coefficient of determination r 2 unfortunately these two statistics describe the degree of collinearity between the observed and model predicted values but suffer from limitations that make them poor measures of model performance willmott 1984 in fact by their very definition both indices are insensitive to additive and proportional differences between the model predictions and observations willmott 1984 for further discussion on why r and r 2 are incorrect measures of predictive accuracy see li 2017 and reference there in here to quantitative assess the degree to which the lglve match the observations i use the metrics summarized in table 2 all the above metrics are in terms of the absolute value instead of the square of differences this is because it was noticed that absolute values are preferable over squares since by using absolute values errors and differences are given a more appropriate weighting not inflated by their squared values willmott 1981 squaring in statistics is useful because squares are easier to manipulate mathematically than are absolute values but use of squares forces an arbitrarily greater influence on the statistic by way of the larger values legates and mccabe 1999 the relative mean absolute error rmae is obtained from dividing the mean absolute error mae between the mean of the species yields mae and the similar root mean square error rmse are two commonly used measures for assessing the predictive accuracy in the environmental sciences li and heap 2008 to avoid any dependence of mae on s we will use the relative metric rmae in order to quantify the accuracy we need to introduce some reference point actually error measures like rmae are not accuracy measures so they can only tell which model produce less error but there are unable to tell how accurate a model is li 2017 at any event a possible very general and tolerant measure of model goodness is rmae 100 i e every quantity is measured with an error smaller than the size of the quantity itself hence we will consider in addition to this threshold the more stringent one of rmae 50 p95 measures the percentage of predictions which fall within the confidence intervals of 1 96σ within the error bars shown in fig 2 p95 100 0 means that all none of the yields predicted by the model fall within the error bars around the corresponding experimental values for p95 we will consider two thresholds its maximum possible value of 100 and the arbitrary 66 7 so that p95 66 7 indicates the model does a decent job e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is a modified version of the coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined by e 1 mse σ 2 mse mean square error but in terms of absolute differences rather than square differences it ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement and e 1 1 indicating perfect match between model and experimental data for example if the absolute differences between the model and the observation is as large as the variability in the observed data measured by i 1 s y i e x y e x then e 1 0 0 and if it exceeds it then e 1 0 0 i e the observed mean is a better predictor than yi thus a value of zero for e 1 indicates that the observed mean y e x is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model wilcox et al 1990 d 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is similar to e 1 an advantage over the modified efficiency is that it is bounded i e it varies from 0 0 to 1 0 again with higher values indicating better agreement between the model and observation by the same token it loses the meaningful reference point of 0 0 for the coefficient of efficiency which serves to assess when the model is a better predictor than the observed mean however it is possible to introduce a reference point for d 1 by observing that for two completely uncorrelated random vectors drawn from a uniform distribution d 1 is on average 1 3 see suppl mat therefore if d 1 1 3 we conclude that the model is a poor predictor both the efficiency and the index of agreement are customarily used in the atmospheric and hydrologic sciences 2 4 the predictions of lglve compared with those from random sampling if the confidence intervals are very large would not this be almost equal to sampling randomly an interaction matrix that is how do predictions of species yields using interaction matrices fitted from experimental measures compare with those using randomly sampled interaction matrices to answer this question we will use a simple test for each of the 33 experimental treatments i generate 200 different matrices with off diagonal coefficients uniformly randomly distributed between 1 and 0 the elements along the diagonal corresponding to intrasepecific competition are always held equal to 1 and measure the corresponding p95 notice that taking off diagonal coefficients always non positive means that we are assuming facilitation is absent or negligible which is not the case for several of the experimental treatments therefore a second complementary test was considered for assessing whether or not lglve predictions for a community of s species outperform random sampling even when there is facilitation an advantage of this procedure is that it allows an analytical derivation of the p95 accuracy index this second procedure consists of sampling randomly s yields one for each species from a uniform distribution for a given species i the probability pi that a random number drawn from a uniform distribution falls inside the 95 confidence interval around the experimentally measured yield yi ex is roughly equal to the size of the error bar i e 2εi divided by ki see suppl mat that is we have a binomial distribution for each species with a different probability pi and it is simple to obtain the expected value of p95 as see suppl mat p 95 r a n d i 1 s p i s 100 furthermore the above expression actually provides an upper bound for the expected value of p95rand when besides interspecific competition there are facilitative interspecific interactions this is because in this case the species yields yi can be greater than ki and so the denominator of probabilities pi may be larger hence in presence of facilitative interspecific interactions the expected value of p95 for randomly drawn yields will be smaller than the value given by the above expression 2 5 working with an incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters as expected the number of published experimental studies that measured all the yields i iii decreases quickly as s grows and for s 7 i couldn t find an experiment in which the totality of the s s 1 2 treatments was carried out but only a percentage fe of the them nevertheless in such cases with fe 100 it is still possible to make quantitative predictions provided we work with relative yields ri yi ki i e the species yield in mixture normalized by its yield in monoculture rather than yields yi and use an approximate expression for the interaction matrix the interaction matrix in terms of these relative yields yi can be rewritten as aij αijkj ki see suppl mat notice thus that the diagonal terms of the matrix aij corresponding to intra specific competition remain equal to 1 since aii αiiki ki αii 1 an equation similar to 2 for the equilibrium in which all species coexist can be written as see suppl mat 4 j 1 s a r i j j 1 i 1 s or in matrix form a i j r 1 where r and 1 are column vectors of s entries with respectively relative yields ri and ones next we will consider two different approximations for aij which allow making predictions about the yields in cases with incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters 2 5 1 mean field approximation a method capable of accurately predicting aggregate or mean quantities expressed in terms of relative yields has been recently proposed fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 these quantities are the relative yield total de wit 1970 5 r y t i 1 s r i and the mean relative yield 6 m r y r y t s i 1 s r i s both these indices allow comparing community productivity on a relative basis for instance in agriculture science the ryt is often used to quantify the overyielding of diverse plant mixtures relative to plant monocultures in studies of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function a ryt 1 implies that the yield performance will be better in polyculture than in monoculture a phenomenon termed as overyielding vandermeer 1989 the idea then is to replace the full unknown interaction matrix aij by a mean field competition matrix i e a competition matrix in which the off diagonal elements corresponding to interspecific competition are replaced by their average value over the sample of available interspecific competition coefficients 7 a a i j in such a way we get a mean field matrix 8 a m f a i j m f 1 a a a a 1 a a a a a 1 this matrix is used to predict the ryt and mry as simple functions of a and s fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 9 r y t a s s 1 s 1 a 10 m r y a s 1 1 s 1 a a caveat of the method is that if facilitation is the dominant interspecific interaction so that a 0 the denominator of eqs 9 and 10 could become negative for a or s sufficiently large since the ryt and mry must be positive quantities a requirement for this approximation to work properly is that facilitation is not too large 2 5 2 focal species approximation let us suppose we are interested in the performance of a particular or focal species that coexists with other species imagine for instance a crop that coexists with several species of weeds thus in order to make more accurate specific predictions for this focal species than just the mry one possibility is to measure the interaction coefficients for this species k with all the others and use an interaction matrix in terms of relative yields of the form 11 a k a i j k 1 a a 1 k a a a 1 a 2 k a a a k 1 a k 2 1 a k s 1 a k s a a a s 1 k 1 a a a a s k a 1 with a equal to the mean over the available off diagonal interaction coefficients i e those of row k and column k in the matrix 11 excluding the intraspecific coefficient akk 1 that is 12 a a k j a i k notice that the parameter a can be either negative or positive depending on whether competitive or facilitative interactions dominate for the focal species the interaction matrix a k represents a step further respect to a mf since it includes all the interaction coefficients involving the focal species while treating the remaining species as a mean field in which the focal species is immersed the recipe is then to use matrix 11 to solve equation 4 by inverting it or by simulation of the dynamical equations and only take into account the relative yield for the focal species r k k while neglecting the values r j k for j k that is from a matrix of the form 11 we obtain just one relative yield for the focal species r k k i will call this approximation which represents and improvement of the mean field one the focal species approximation for further details the reader is referred to suppl mat and fort 2018b 3 results and answers to questions the data for the 33 experimental studies of table 1 including interaction matrices a yi ex and yi as well as the contribution of each species to the four metrics used for estimating error accuracy appear in the supplementary table s1 table 1 as well as fig 1 summarize this information and show the four error accuracy metrics that emerge from the data for each experiment 3 1 can lglve accurately predict species yields in fig 1 these 33 experiments were ordered from smaller to larger rmae as expected when the rmae increases the three accuracy metrics decrease thus qualitatively we see to naked eye that the lglve do a good job in predicting yields up to the 25th experiment more quantitatively all the 33 have rmae 100 25 of them rmae 50 and simultaneously d 1 1 3 22 have p95 66 67 and 28 have e 1 0 furthermore two thirds of the 33 experiments simultaneously verify the four above inequalities with rmae 50 and p95 66 7 this number reduces to 10 experiments when the maximum p95 100 is required answer i found that obtaining the generalized lotka volterra parameters as mean values over samples of biculture and monoculture experiments the lglve can accurately predict ex ante not all but the majority of the species yields for most of the experiments 3 2 can lglve reproduce ex post the species yields in cases in which they failed ex ante due to the variability of yields among replicas in experiments the yi have in general confidence intervals or error bars which are not small it turns out that in all but five of the 23 experiments with p95 100 by modifying the interaction coefficients only few of them in most of the cases as can be seen in table s1 within their confidence intervals 3 3 the confidence intervals for the interaction coefficients are obtained from the confidence intervals of the biculture yields bi by using standard error propagation formulas this as well as the procedure used for varying these coefficients is described in the suppl mat allow for accommodating all the theoretically predicted yields within the error bars of their corresponding experimental values fig 2 shows four examples in which a simple modification of one or two of the interaction coefficients allows all the theoretical yields to fall within the error bars for the corresponding experimentally measured yields two of these experiments involve plants one algae and one protozoa and thus different measures of the yield were used biomass for plants biovol for algae and the number of individuals for protozoa therefore just to make easier the comparison among these experiments we will use the non dimensional relative yields yi yi ki which additionally in general are 1 and rarely 2 particularly impressive is the improvement in the accuracy of predicted yields for the experiment of roxburgh and wilson 2000 in which just by reducing the a 14 coefficient by 9 changes p95 from 28 6 two out of seven of the predicted species yields within the error bars around the experimental values to 85 7 all but one of the predicted species yields within the error bars around the experimental values answer lglve can strikingly reproduce ex post with accuracy all the species yields for the great majority of the experiments 18 out of 23 3 3 how does the performance of lglve using interaction matrices estimated from experiments compare with random sampling methods table 1 shows that in 30 out of the 33 experimental treatments the lglve performance is better larger p95 or much better much larger p95 than randomly sampling interaction matrices or yields 4 4 actually both procedures produce similar values of p95 confirming their robustness interestingly two of the three experimental treatments for which the random sampling outperforms predictions from lglve also exhibit i very low negative values of e 1 and ii large error bars spanning on average more than 35 of the corresponding carrying capacities answer lglve outperform predictions from randomly sampling either interaction matrices or species yields 3 4 what global or aggregate quantities can be quantitatively predicted when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete suppose we only know a subset of the interspecific interaction coefficients and all these interactions correspond to competition thus we can use the mean field competition matrix 8 and the resulting approximate expressions 9 and 10 for respectively the aggregated ryt and the mry as a functions of a and s the relative absolute errors of the ryt and mry obtained when using formulas 9 and 10 in the case of experiments with incomplete knowledge of model parameters range between 0 8 and 24 mean 12 4 4 6 and are not significantly greater than those obtained by just solving the entire set of lglve which was possible for experiments in which all the model parameters were available fort 2018a furthermore in general the rmae is proportional to the size of the experimental error bar and thus the failure of eqs 9 and 10 can be mostly explained by a large variance among experimental replicas or by a low experimental precision answer provided only competition interactions exist or at least they dominate among species we still can predict aggregate ryt or mean mry relative competition indices with an accuracy inversely proportional to the experimental variance of the experimental measurements 3 5 what about predicting the performance of a given species when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete as mentioned the focal species approximation is useful when we are interested in predicting the yield of a given particular species and the knowledge of the model parameters is incomplete provided we know all the interaction coefficients involving this particular or focal species fig 3 compares the results of using this approximation open big circles with those when using the full set of lglve filled small circles for the same four experiments shown in fig 2 in each panel of fig 3 each open big circle was obtained from an interaction matrix of like the one of eq 11 to illustrate how the approximation works let us consider the experiment of four algal species of huisman et al 1999 if we consider that the focal species is for example k ap then a 0 754 and we obtain a focal matrix a ap aij ap producing a theoretical relative yield r ˆ a p 0 00 see suppl mat which differs in 1 respect to the experimental relative rap 0 01 if we consider that the focal species is k ch then a 0 548 and we obtain another focal matrix a ch aij ch which leads to r ˆ c h 1 00 see suppl mat now differing in 10 respect to the experimental rch 0 912 and so on so forth notice that the accuracy with which the focal species approximation predicts the focal species is comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve actually the same holds in general for all the 33 experiments considered in this paper and in other additional experiments fort 2018b answer it is possible to predict the yield of a given particular species when we just know the interaction coefficients involving this focal species by means of the focal species approximation with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve 4 discussion the linear lotka volterra equations constitute the simplest mathematical model for a community of s interacting species the minimality of the lglve often raises doubts on their ability to make quantitative predictions like species abundances which are more regarded as a qualitative than a quantitative tool in population or community ecology brown et al 2001 more complex theories e g equations involving non linear response functions vandermeer and goldberg 2013 and higher order interactions abrams 1983 implying non additive effects morin 2011 are often preferred because they are perceived as more reliable although they can be as intractable as the real systems they aim to model furthermore this is done at the price of including additional parameters which are hard to measure since the available empirical data to test mathematical models are often scarce and the precision of the measurements is in most of the cases low they generally don t allow distinguishing between the accuracy of predictions from simpler and less demanding models from those that are more complex and demanding this precludes falsification of such more elaborate models given this situation i believed that it was necessary first of all to measure the accuracy of lglve in order to assess whether or not they serve to make quantitative predictions on species yields at any event the lglve can provide a benchmark against which the performance of more complex models can be evaluated therefore in this study i first addressed the task of quantifying the accuracy with which the lglve predict species yields with this aim i assembled a data set of experiments that measured the yields of different species in monoculture biculture and in a community or mixture of s s 2 species so that we can obtain the model parameters from mean values over samples of biculture and monoculture experiments i found that the lglve can accurately predict not all but the majority of the species yields in the mixtures of s species for most of the experiments this seems to be an important result regarding possible applications like estimating the effect of removing existing species or adding foreign species to an existing community also using the lglve as quantitative tools has shown to be helpful in fields like agrosciences e g by predicting optimal combinations of perennial crop mixtures halty et al 2017 or for designing rational weed management practices to enhance the competitive ability of crops and simultaneously avoiding environmental damage with the use of herbicides guglielmini et al 2017 moreover i have shown that by modifying few interaction coefficients within their confidence intervals allows to improve the accuracy of lglve equations so that they can reproduce ex post with strikingly accuracy all the species yields for the great majority of the experiments one may wonder about the usefulness of tuning the model parameters in order to reproduce experimental results but firstly this enables a further check on the performance of the lglve in providing an accurate description of species abundances additionally once we have the model working properly predicting accurately the present species yields at one place we can use it for predicting future species yields in a new equilibrium state that results from perturbing the system or for extrapolating its results to other places as mentioned the number of necessary parameters for modelling an ecological community of s species is at least equal to s 2 since in many natural communities like tropical forests plankton or mutualistic networks where s is of the order of hundreds estimating all these parameters from empirical data is an unfeasible task so we have to deal with an incomplete knowledge of the model parameters however in these cases the lglve still can make quite accurate predictions i have shown that a mean field approximation by estimating the mean competition coefficient from the yields for just a subset of monoculture and biculture experiments leads to a couple of simple formulas which are able to predict the ryt and mean relative yield of a community of s species likewise when we are interested in the yield of a particular species rather than on aggregate or mean quantities we can use the focal species approximation to predict the focal species yield with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve an interesting question is how the predictive accuracy depends on the species richness s on the one hand we only have the whole interaction matrix for just three different values of species richness s 3 4 and 7 and only enough statistics for the two first values of s just two experiments for s 7 this is insufficient to extract any clear cut pattern between the error size and species richness on the other hand when working with incomplete knowledge of the interaction matrix approximated predictions on aggregated or average indices like the ryt and mry actually improve with the species richness s fort 2018a b moreover as s increases the fraction fe of the s s 1 2 experiments required to estimate the experimental quantities decreases for example in the case of 32 species polycultures in switzerland framed in the biodepth experiments for grassland plant communities across different countries in europe hector et al 2010 528 experimental treatments 32 monoculture and 32 31 2 496 biculture would be required to fit the lglve parameters of course for practical reasons only few of these experiments were carried out 10 monoculture and 7 biculture experiments i e fe 10 7 528 or 3 2 however the ryt can be predicted with an error of only 11 5 fort 2018a b 5 conclusion we have shown that lglve can be used as a quantitative tool i e producing reasonable accurate predictions for species yields in a community either artificial or natural at three different levels ordered by increasing level in the knowledge of the model parameters we have first when we only know a fraction of the model parameters the mean field approximation allows making reliable predictions on aggregate or average quantities second for cases in which all the interaction parameters involving a particular species are available we have the focal species approximation for predicting the yield of this focal species third when all the model parameters are known the full set of lglve allows in general to predict the yields of all species making up the community in question with quite reasonable accuracy more elaborate models may be necessary for some particularly complex communities brown et al 2001 but this analysis seems to confirm that they are more the exception than the rule data accessibility statement the data used is fully available in a

25192,the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve constitute the simplest theoretical framework for ecological communities involving different kinds of interspecific interactions e g competition facilitation these equations have been often criticized as being too simple to model real systems this study has two main goals first to test the lglve as a quantitative tool for describing explaining predicting the equilibrium species abundances that is how accurately the lglve predict the yields of s interacting species second to show analyze which quantitative predictions are possible with an incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters with this aim i compiled from the literature 33 experiments most of them for plants which measured species yields in monoculture biculture and in mixtures of s 2 species i found that by obtaining the lglve parameters from the yields in monoculture and biculture experiments the lglve can accurately predict the majority of the equilibrium species yields in the mixtures of s 2 species for most of the experiments however in many natural communities e g tropical forests or plankton s can be of the order of hundreds and estimating all the model parameters from empirical data is unfeasible but by estimating the mean interaction coefficient from the yields of an incomplete set of monoculture and biculture experiments the lglve still can make accurate predictions firstly it is possible to derive simple formulas which are able to predict the relative yield total and mean relative yield secondly when we are interested in the fate or performance of a particular species we can use a more refined approximation to predict the yield of this focal species with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve keywords prediction of species abundances generalized lotka volterra model quantitative ecology community matrix accuracy indices community ecology 1 introduction ecology can be defined as the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms andrewartha 1961 or more precisely as the scientific study of the interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms krebs 1978 abundance is a far better measure of the effects a species has on its local ecosystem than simply whether it is present ehrlén and morris 2015 and is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions andrewartha and birch 1954 krebs 1978 gaston 1994 for species of value to humans estimates of future abundance will be essential for regulating current and future harvests in addition for species of conservation concern their future numbers will be an important determinant of their extinction risk for instance mathematical methods commonly employed to forecast the yield and production of agricultural crops have been mostly linear statistical models nass smb 2012 however the interest in descriptive or phenomenological modelling of biomass production and yield of crops has increased recently marcelis et al 1998 kirwan et al 2009 halty et al 2017 descriptive models have in general a short computing time and they usually contain few state variables making them helpful tools for reliable predictions the most popular mathematical models for describing the species abundances in terms of their interactions are based on the lotka volterra equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 lotka and volterra derived two different sets of equations one set applies to situations involving competition for food or space and the other set to the predator prey situation lotka volterra models are descriptive or phenomenological models i e they describe how the abundance of one species affects the abundance of another without specifically including a particular mechanism for such interaction morin 2011 for example in the case of the competition model the particular competition mechanism such as depletion of a shared resource or territorial interference competition is not specified rather competition coefficients summarizing the effects of one species on another are used the generalized lotka volterra equations are a set of equations which are more general than either the competitive or predator prey examples of lotka volterra types hofbauer and sigmund 1998 pastor 2008 and thus can accommodate the different kinds of interactions that generally occur among species e g competition facilitation this theory in its simplest formulation consists in a set of linear equations for the per capita growth rates these linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve can be thought as the first order or linear approximation in a taylor series expansion of the per capita growth rates of species about the equilibrium points of a more complex and general theory volterra 1926 1931 the lglve for s interacting species within a single trophic level can be written as 1 1 y i d y i d t r i 1 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s where yi is a variable denoting the yield like the biomass density or a proxy of it like the biovolume or the number of individuals of species i ri its intrinsic growth rate ki its equilibrium yield in monoculture or carrying capacity and αij is an interaction coefficient quantifying the direct effect of species j on species i through their pairwise interaction which can be either negative competition positive facilitation or zero the intraspecific interaction coefficients are taken as αii 1 for all i in such a way to recover the logistic equation for a single species the linear lotka volterra equations have been often criticized as being too simple for modelling real systems for example the s 2 species model is valid only to the extent that higher order interactions are null or negligible compared to pairwise interactions simberloff 1982 another criticism is that model predictions in general assume that the community is at equilibrium in the strict mathematical sense a community is at equilibrium only when the rate of change for all species i e the left hand side of eq 1 is zero but this theoretical ideal is rarely achieved in natural communities wiens 1984 roxburgh and wilson 2000 in fact the focus of lotka volterra theory has been mostly on qualitative general issues like community stability and species coexistence rather than on making quantitative predictions to be tested against experimental data like the species abundances in equilibrium hubbel 2002 these equilibrium abundances predicted by eq 1 verify 2 y i k i j 1 s α y i j j 0 i 1 s where the stars denote quantities at equilibrium a main difficulty for obtaining from the set of eq 2 the equilibrium species yields yi is how to get the set of parameters ki α ij a straightforward procedure is to perform during sufficiently long enough periods in order the equilibrium state is reached a the s single species or monoculture experiments and from each of them to estimate ki as the yield of the species i b the s s 1 2 pairwise experiments and for each of them obtain the pair of the biculture pairwise experiments yields y i j e x and y j i e x the superscript ex is for denoting experimentally measured quantities to distinguish them from the theoretical ones and the subscripts i j and j i stand for the relative yield of species i in presence of species j and vice versa using a and b αij and αji can be obtained by solving eq 2 for s 2 as pastor 2008 3 α i j y i j e x k i y j i e x α j i y j i e x k j y i j e x therefore if the yield of species i in biculture with species j is ki ki then αij 0 0 and the interaction of j on i is facilitative competitive this is the kind of approach followed by vandermeer 1969 in a pioneering experimental study with protozoa here i want to push the lglve to their limits as quantitative tools for describing explaining predicting the outcome of experiments assuming a state of equilibrium was reached therefore our first goal is to answer the following three questions 1 can lglve accurately predict the species yields in a community of interacting species 2 in the cases in which the lglve fail at predicting with reasonable accuracy at least one of the species yields with relatively slight modifications of few interaction coefficients within their confidence intervals can they accurately reproduce ex post all the species yields 1 1 notice that this is different than the ex ante prediction 1 since it uses the information of the empirical values of yi ex to modify some of interaction parameters α ij in order to improve the accuracy of the corresponding theoretical relative yields additionally if the confidence intervals are very large one may wonder if a simpler purely random method can do equally better that is 3 how does the lglve method compare with random sampling methods for example considering a random sampling of interaction matrices a limitation of the experimental procedure described above of performing all the monoculture and biculture treatments the principal one is that it is feasible provided s is not too large since the number of required experiments grows as s 2 thus for large values of s only a fraction of these experiments is commonly carried out and consequently we have an incomplete knowledge of the s 2 parameters required to compute the equilibrium yields from the lglve hence our second goal is predicting with incomplete information and answering these couple of additional questions 1 what global or aggregate quantities can be quantitatively predicted when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete 2 what about predicting the performance of a given particular species when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete all these questions are important since depending on their answers either lglve can be accurate enough as a quantitative modelling tool or more complex modelling involving additional parameters would be required to answer questions 1 3 i compiled from the literature a set of experiments designed to measure the effects of intra and interspecific interactions in single trophic communities with s 2 species the empirical yi ex of all species were compared for each experiment against the values obtained from the lglve 2 2 actually in few experiments there were temporal series that would allow going beyond the single equilibrium point for example in vandermeer 1969 the abundances of species were measured at 32 different times and this permitted him to draw the entire dynamical curve by eye through the observed data points nevertheless this was not the case for the vast majority of the experiments considered here rather the species yields were measured for few different times and were not enough to obtain the time evolution of such yields and fitting and additional set of parameters the species intrinsic growth rates it is worth remarking that as mentioned the approach followed to answer questions 1 and 2 is not novel as it was already used by vandermeer for protozoa 1969 the main novelty is to test this approach against an extensive database covering many experiments with different species richness and across distinct taxonomic groups another novelty is the proposal of a set of indices some of them customarily used in the atmospheric and hydrologic sciences see materials and methods to quantitative assess the degree to which the lglve match the observations in the case of an incomplete knowledge of the parameters ɑij to answer question 4 i refer to a recently proposed mean field approximation to predict aggregate or mean variables computed in terms of relative yields fort 2018a and to answer question 5 i introduce a novel more refined approximation which i will call the focal species approximation develop some cases and show the corresponding results a full analysis of this method will be presented in fort 2018b 2 materials and methods 2 1 data set each of the experiments selected in this study to answer questions 1 2 involved a multispecies community s 2 with species belonging to the same taxonomic group plants algae etc the experiments also verified that all the species yields biomass density in most of the cases but also biovolume and number of individuals in one experiment vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values thus in what follows since we always assume an equilibrium or quasi equilibrium state we will omit the for all yields in the understanding that they are yields in equilibrium in addition the experiments were such that they included measurements of all the yields for the treatments listed below i i the yields of the s coexisting species one treatment ii the yields of species in monoculture s treatments iii the yields of species in bicultures s s 1 2 treatments the polyculture yields y i e x and monoculture yields ki as well as their se are obtained respectively by taking averages over replicas of i and ii similarly the biculture yields y i j e x and y j i e x and their se are obtained from replicas of iii the interaction coefficient between species i and j can in turn be computed from y i j e x and y j i e x by using 3 a total of 33 experiments verifying the above requirements were compiled from the literature some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions they included mostly plants but also algae crustacean and protozoa see table 1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references 2 2 obtaining the theoretical yields linear algebra solutions and simulations the straightforward way of obtaining the yi is by solving the eq 2 for the given set of empirically determined parameters ki αij the equilibrium state in which all the s species coexist verifies 2 j 1 s α y i j j k i i 1 s or in matrix form ay k where a denotes the s s interaction matrix αij thereafter y and k are column vectors of s entries with respectively the yields yi and the carrying capacities and then by inverting this matrix relationship we obtain the column vector y with the s yields however for 21 of the 33 interaction matrices inverting 2 produces at least one negative value this means that the interaction matrix obtained by eq 3 is not fully consistent with the equilibrium in which all the species coexist i e this equilibrium is unfeasible and thus yl 0 for some species l therefore rather than 2 we have to consider 2 and instead of a single equilibrium the system of equations has multiple equilibria in which at least one species extinguishes this theoretical equilibrium with yl 0 would still be consistent with the experimental one provided the corresponding empirically measured y l e x is small enough so that yl 0 falls within the 95 confidence interval around y l e x to find among this set of possible equilibria the one towards which the system converges i simulated the dynamical eq 1 starting from a random set of initial values yi for more details see suppl mat 2 3 accuracy measures to quantitative evaluate the performance of the lglve how well a model fits the observed data usually is determined by comparing model predicted values with observations frequently evaluations of model performance utilize statistics based on the familiar pearson s correlation coefficient r or its square the coefficient of determination r 2 unfortunately these two statistics describe the degree of collinearity between the observed and model predicted values but suffer from limitations that make them poor measures of model performance willmott 1984 in fact by their very definition both indices are insensitive to additive and proportional differences between the model predictions and observations willmott 1984 for further discussion on why r and r 2 are incorrect measures of predictive accuracy see li 2017 and reference there in here to quantitative assess the degree to which the lglve match the observations i use the metrics summarized in table 2 all the above metrics are in terms of the absolute value instead of the square of differences this is because it was noticed that absolute values are preferable over squares since by using absolute values errors and differences are given a more appropriate weighting not inflated by their squared values willmott 1981 squaring in statistics is useful because squares are easier to manipulate mathematically than are absolute values but use of squares forces an arbitrarily greater influence on the statistic by way of the larger values legates and mccabe 1999 the relative mean absolute error rmae is obtained from dividing the mean absolute error mae between the mean of the species yields mae and the similar root mean square error rmse are two commonly used measures for assessing the predictive accuracy in the environmental sciences li and heap 2008 to avoid any dependence of mae on s we will use the relative metric rmae in order to quantify the accuracy we need to introduce some reference point actually error measures like rmae are not accuracy measures so they can only tell which model produce less error but there are unable to tell how accurate a model is li 2017 at any event a possible very general and tolerant measure of model goodness is rmae 100 i e every quantity is measured with an error smaller than the size of the quantity itself hence we will consider in addition to this threshold the more stringent one of rmae 50 p95 measures the percentage of predictions which fall within the confidence intervals of 1 96σ within the error bars shown in fig 2 p95 100 0 means that all none of the yields predicted by the model fall within the error bars around the corresponding experimental values for p95 we will consider two thresholds its maximum possible value of 100 and the arbitrary 66 7 so that p95 66 7 indicates the model does a decent job e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is a modified version of the coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined by e 1 mse σ 2 mse mean square error but in terms of absolute differences rather than square differences it ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement and e 1 1 indicating perfect match between model and experimental data for example if the absolute differences between the model and the observation is as large as the variability in the observed data measured by i 1 s y i e x y e x then e 1 0 0 and if it exceeds it then e 1 0 0 i e the observed mean is a better predictor than yi thus a value of zero for e 1 indicates that the observed mean y e x is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model wilcox et al 1990 d 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is similar to e 1 an advantage over the modified efficiency is that it is bounded i e it varies from 0 0 to 1 0 again with higher values indicating better agreement between the model and observation by the same token it loses the meaningful reference point of 0 0 for the coefficient of efficiency which serves to assess when the model is a better predictor than the observed mean however it is possible to introduce a reference point for d 1 by observing that for two completely uncorrelated random vectors drawn from a uniform distribution d 1 is on average 1 3 see suppl mat therefore if d 1 1 3 we conclude that the model is a poor predictor both the efficiency and the index of agreement are customarily used in the atmospheric and hydrologic sciences 2 4 the predictions of lglve compared with those from random sampling if the confidence intervals are very large would not this be almost equal to sampling randomly an interaction matrix that is how do predictions of species yields using interaction matrices fitted from experimental measures compare with those using randomly sampled interaction matrices to answer this question we will use a simple test for each of the 33 experimental treatments i generate 200 different matrices with off diagonal coefficients uniformly randomly distributed between 1 and 0 the elements along the diagonal corresponding to intrasepecific competition are always held equal to 1 and measure the corresponding p95 notice that taking off diagonal coefficients always non positive means that we are assuming facilitation is absent or negligible which is not the case for several of the experimental treatments therefore a second complementary test was considered for assessing whether or not lglve predictions for a community of s species outperform random sampling even when there is facilitation an advantage of this procedure is that it allows an analytical derivation of the p95 accuracy index this second procedure consists of sampling randomly s yields one for each species from a uniform distribution for a given species i the probability pi that a random number drawn from a uniform distribution falls inside the 95 confidence interval around the experimentally measured yield yi ex is roughly equal to the size of the error bar i e 2εi divided by ki see suppl mat that is we have a binomial distribution for each species with a different probability pi and it is simple to obtain the expected value of p95 as see suppl mat p 95 r a n d i 1 s p i s 100 furthermore the above expression actually provides an upper bound for the expected value of p95rand when besides interspecific competition there are facilitative interspecific interactions this is because in this case the species yields yi can be greater than ki and so the denominator of probabilities pi may be larger hence in presence of facilitative interspecific interactions the expected value of p95 for randomly drawn yields will be smaller than the value given by the above expression 2 5 working with an incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters as expected the number of published experimental studies that measured all the yields i iii decreases quickly as s grows and for s 7 i couldn t find an experiment in which the totality of the s s 1 2 treatments was carried out but only a percentage fe of the them nevertheless in such cases with fe 100 it is still possible to make quantitative predictions provided we work with relative yields ri yi ki i e the species yield in mixture normalized by its yield in monoculture rather than yields yi and use an approximate expression for the interaction matrix the interaction matrix in terms of these relative yields yi can be rewritten as aij αijkj ki see suppl mat notice thus that the diagonal terms of the matrix aij corresponding to intra specific competition remain equal to 1 since aii αiiki ki αii 1 an equation similar to 2 for the equilibrium in which all species coexist can be written as see suppl mat 4 j 1 s a r i j j 1 i 1 s or in matrix form a i j r 1 where r and 1 are column vectors of s entries with respectively relative yields ri and ones next we will consider two different approximations for aij which allow making predictions about the yields in cases with incomplete knowledge of the lglve parameters 2 5 1 mean field approximation a method capable of accurately predicting aggregate or mean quantities expressed in terms of relative yields has been recently proposed fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 these quantities are the relative yield total de wit 1970 5 r y t i 1 s r i and the mean relative yield 6 m r y r y t s i 1 s r i s both these indices allow comparing community productivity on a relative basis for instance in agriculture science the ryt is often used to quantify the overyielding of diverse plant mixtures relative to plant monocultures in studies of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function a ryt 1 implies that the yield performance will be better in polyculture than in monoculture a phenomenon termed as overyielding vandermeer 1989 the idea then is to replace the full unknown interaction matrix aij by a mean field competition matrix i e a competition matrix in which the off diagonal elements corresponding to interspecific competition are replaced by their average value over the sample of available interspecific competition coefficients 7 a a i j in such a way we get a mean field matrix 8 a m f a i j m f 1 a a a a 1 a a a a a 1 this matrix is used to predict the ryt and mry as simple functions of a and s fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 9 r y t a s s 1 s 1 a 10 m r y a s 1 1 s 1 a a caveat of the method is that if facilitation is the dominant interspecific interaction so that a 0 the denominator of eqs 9 and 10 could become negative for a or s sufficiently large since the ryt and mry must be positive quantities a requirement for this approximation to work properly is that facilitation is not too large 2 5 2 focal species approximation let us suppose we are interested in the performance of a particular or focal species that coexists with other species imagine for instance a crop that coexists with several species of weeds thus in order to make more accurate specific predictions for this focal species than just the mry one possibility is to measure the interaction coefficients for this species k with all the others and use an interaction matrix in terms of relative yields of the form 11 a k a i j k 1 a a 1 k a a a 1 a 2 k a a a k 1 a k 2 1 a k s 1 a k s a a a s 1 k 1 a a a a s k a 1 with a equal to the mean over the available off diagonal interaction coefficients i e those of row k and column k in the matrix 11 excluding the intraspecific coefficient akk 1 that is 12 a a k j a i k notice that the parameter a can be either negative or positive depending on whether competitive or facilitative interactions dominate for the focal species the interaction matrix a k represents a step further respect to a mf since it includes all the interaction coefficients involving the focal species while treating the remaining species as a mean field in which the focal species is immersed the recipe is then to use matrix 11 to solve equation 4 by inverting it or by simulation of the dynamical equations and only take into account the relative yield for the focal species r k k while neglecting the values r j k for j k that is from a matrix of the form 11 we obtain just one relative yield for the focal species r k k i will call this approximation which represents and improvement of the mean field one the focal species approximation for further details the reader is referred to suppl mat and fort 2018b 3 results and answers to questions the data for the 33 experimental studies of table 1 including interaction matrices a yi ex and yi as well as the contribution of each species to the four metrics used for estimating error accuracy appear in the supplementary table s1 table 1 as well as fig 1 summarize this information and show the four error accuracy metrics that emerge from the data for each experiment 3 1 can lglve accurately predict species yields in fig 1 these 33 experiments were ordered from smaller to larger rmae as expected when the rmae increases the three accuracy metrics decrease thus qualitatively we see to naked eye that the lglve do a good job in predicting yields up to the 25th experiment more quantitatively all the 33 have rmae 100 25 of them rmae 50 and simultaneously d 1 1 3 22 have p95 66 67 and 28 have e 1 0 furthermore two thirds of the 33 experiments simultaneously verify the four above inequalities with rmae 50 and p95 66 7 this number reduces to 10 experiments when the maximum p95 100 is required answer i found that obtaining the generalized lotka volterra parameters as mean values over samples of biculture and monoculture experiments the lglve can accurately predict ex ante not all but the majority of the species yields for most of the experiments 3 2 can lglve reproduce ex post the species yields in cases in which they failed ex ante due to the variability of yields among replicas in experiments the yi have in general confidence intervals or error bars which are not small it turns out that in all but five of the 23 experiments with p95 100 by modifying the interaction coefficients only few of them in most of the cases as can be seen in table s1 within their confidence intervals 3 3 the confidence intervals for the interaction coefficients are obtained from the confidence intervals of the biculture yields bi by using standard error propagation formulas this as well as the procedure used for varying these coefficients is described in the suppl mat allow for accommodating all the theoretically predicted yields within the error bars of their corresponding experimental values fig 2 shows four examples in which a simple modification of one or two of the interaction coefficients allows all the theoretical yields to fall within the error bars for the corresponding experimentally measured yields two of these experiments involve plants one algae and one protozoa and thus different measures of the yield were used biomass for plants biovol for algae and the number of individuals for protozoa therefore just to make easier the comparison among these experiments we will use the non dimensional relative yields yi yi ki which additionally in general are 1 and rarely 2 particularly impressive is the improvement in the accuracy of predicted yields for the experiment of roxburgh and wilson 2000 in which just by reducing the a 14 coefficient by 9 changes p95 from 28 6 two out of seven of the predicted species yields within the error bars around the experimental values to 85 7 all but one of the predicted species yields within the error bars around the experimental values answer lglve can strikingly reproduce ex post with accuracy all the species yields for the great majority of the experiments 18 out of 23 3 3 how does the performance of lglve using interaction matrices estimated from experiments compare with random sampling methods table 1 shows that in 30 out of the 33 experimental treatments the lglve performance is better larger p95 or much better much larger p95 than randomly sampling interaction matrices or yields 4 4 actually both procedures produce similar values of p95 confirming their robustness interestingly two of the three experimental treatments for which the random sampling outperforms predictions from lglve also exhibit i very low negative values of e 1 and ii large error bars spanning on average more than 35 of the corresponding carrying capacities answer lglve outperform predictions from randomly sampling either interaction matrices or species yields 3 4 what global or aggregate quantities can be quantitatively predicted when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete suppose we only know a subset of the interspecific interaction coefficients and all these interactions correspond to competition thus we can use the mean field competition matrix 8 and the resulting approximate expressions 9 and 10 for respectively the aggregated ryt and the mry as a functions of a and s the relative absolute errors of the ryt and mry obtained when using formulas 9 and 10 in the case of experiments with incomplete knowledge of model parameters range between 0 8 and 24 mean 12 4 4 6 and are not significantly greater than those obtained by just solving the entire set of lglve which was possible for experiments in which all the model parameters were available fort 2018a furthermore in general the rmae is proportional to the size of the experimental error bar and thus the failure of eqs 9 and 10 can be mostly explained by a large variance among experimental replicas or by a low experimental precision answer provided only competition interactions exist or at least they dominate among species we still can predict aggregate ryt or mean mry relative competition indices with an accuracy inversely proportional to the experimental variance of the experimental measurements 3 5 what about predicting the performance of a given species when our knowledge on the set of lglve parameters is incomplete as mentioned the focal species approximation is useful when we are interested in predicting the yield of a given particular species and the knowledge of the model parameters is incomplete provided we know all the interaction coefficients involving this particular or focal species fig 3 compares the results of using this approximation open big circles with those when using the full set of lglve filled small circles for the same four experiments shown in fig 2 in each panel of fig 3 each open big circle was obtained from an interaction matrix of like the one of eq 11 to illustrate how the approximation works let us consider the experiment of four algal species of huisman et al 1999 if we consider that the focal species is for example k ap then a 0 754 and we obtain a focal matrix a ap aij ap producing a theoretical relative yield r ˆ a p 0 00 see suppl mat which differs in 1 respect to the experimental relative rap 0 01 if we consider that the focal species is k ch then a 0 548 and we obtain another focal matrix a ch aij ch which leads to r ˆ c h 1 00 see suppl mat now differing in 10 respect to the experimental rch 0 912 and so on so forth notice that the accuracy with which the focal species approximation predicts the focal species is comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve actually the same holds in general for all the 33 experiments considered in this paper and in other additional experiments fort 2018b answer it is possible to predict the yield of a given particular species when we just know the interaction coefficients involving this focal species by means of the focal species approximation with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve 4 discussion the linear lotka volterra equations constitute the simplest mathematical model for a community of s interacting species the minimality of the lglve often raises doubts on their ability to make quantitative predictions like species abundances which are more regarded as a qualitative than a quantitative tool in population or community ecology brown et al 2001 more complex theories e g equations involving non linear response functions vandermeer and goldberg 2013 and higher order interactions abrams 1983 implying non additive effects morin 2011 are often preferred because they are perceived as more reliable although they can be as intractable as the real systems they aim to model furthermore this is done at the price of including additional parameters which are hard to measure since the available empirical data to test mathematical models are often scarce and the precision of the measurements is in most of the cases low they generally don t allow distinguishing between the accuracy of predictions from simpler and less demanding models from those that are more complex and demanding this precludes falsification of such more elaborate models given this situation i believed that it was necessary first of all to measure the accuracy of lglve in order to assess whether or not they serve to make quantitative predictions on species yields at any event the lglve can provide a benchmark against which the performance of more complex models can be evaluated therefore in this study i first addressed the task of quantifying the accuracy with which the lglve predict species yields with this aim i assembled a data set of experiments that measured the yields of different species in monoculture biculture and in a community or mixture of s s 2 species so that we can obtain the model parameters from mean values over samples of biculture and monoculture experiments i found that the lglve can accurately predict not all but the majority of the species yields in the mixtures of s species for most of the experiments this seems to be an important result regarding possible applications like estimating the effect of removing existing species or adding foreign species to an existing community also using the lglve as quantitative tools has shown to be helpful in fields like agrosciences e g by predicting optimal combinations of perennial crop mixtures halty et al 2017 or for designing rational weed management practices to enhance the competitive ability of crops and simultaneously avoiding environmental damage with the use of herbicides guglielmini et al 2017 moreover i have shown that by modifying few interaction coefficients within their confidence intervals allows to improve the accuracy of lglve equations so that they can reproduce ex post with strikingly accuracy all the species yields for the great majority of the experiments one may wonder about the usefulness of tuning the model parameters in order to reproduce experimental results but firstly this enables a further check on the performance of the lglve in providing an accurate description of species abundances additionally once we have the model working properly predicting accurately the present species yields at one place we can use it for predicting future species yields in a new equilibrium state that results from perturbing the system or for extrapolating its results to other places as mentioned the number of necessary parameters for modelling an ecological community of s species is at least equal to s 2 since in many natural communities like tropical forests plankton or mutualistic networks where s is of the order of hundreds estimating all these parameters from empirical data is an unfeasible task so we have to deal with an incomplete knowledge of the model parameters however in these cases the lglve still can make quite accurate predictions i have shown that a mean field approximation by estimating the mean competition coefficient from the yields for just a subset of monoculture and biculture experiments leads to a couple of simple formulas which are able to predict the ryt and mean relative yield of a community of s species likewise when we are interested in the yield of a particular species rather than on aggregate or mean quantities we can use the focal species approximation to predict the focal species yield with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of lglve an interesting question is how the predictive accuracy depends on the species richness s on the one hand we only have the whole interaction matrix for just three different values of species richness s 3 4 and 7 and only enough statistics for the two first values of s just two experiments for s 7 this is insufficient to extract any clear cut pattern between the error size and species richness on the other hand when working with incomplete knowledge of the interaction matrix approximated predictions on aggregated or average indices like the ryt and mry actually improve with the species richness s fort 2018a b moreover as s increases the fraction fe of the s s 1 2 experiments required to estimate the experimental quantities decreases for example in the case of 32 species polycultures in switzerland framed in the biodepth experiments for grassland plant communities across different countries in europe hector et al 2010 528 experimental treatments 32 monoculture and 32 31 2 496 biculture would be required to fit the lglve parameters of course for practical reasons only few of these experiments were carried out 10 monoculture and 7 biculture experiments i e fe 10 7 528 or 3 2 however the ryt can be predicted with an error of only 11 5 fort 2018a b 5 conclusion we have shown that lglve can be used as a quantitative tool i e producing reasonable accurate predictions for species yields in a community either artificial or natural at three different levels ordered by increasing level in the knowledge of the model parameters we have first when we only know a fraction of the model parameters the mean field approximation allows making reliable predictions on aggregate or average quantities second for cases in which all the interaction parameters involving a particular species are available we have the focal species approximation for predicting the yield of this focal species third when all the model parameters are known the full set of lglve allows in general to predict the yields of all species making up the community in question with quite reasonable accuracy more elaborate models may be necessary for some particularly complex communities brown et al 2001 but this analysis seems to confirm that they are more the exception than the rule data accessibility statement the data used is fully available in a

25193,natural resource managers and ecologists often desire an understanding of spatial dynamics such as migration dispersion and meta population dynamics network node models can capture these salient features additionally the state variable used with many species may be appropriately modeled as a continuous variable e g length and management activities sometimes can only target individuals of certain sizes integral projection models ipms can capture this life history characteristic and allow for the examination of size specific management we combined an ipm with a network node model to capture both of these salient features we then demonstrated how this model could be used to understand and manage populations of invasive species focusing on grass carp as an example grass carp disrupt ecosystems outside of their native range and have spread around much of the world including north america the impacts of grass carp include adversely changing aquatic plant communities which in turn affect a wide range of endpoints ranging from water quality to waterfowl recruitment we specifically examined two theoretical systems using parameters from the literature first we modeled a lake with two tributaries and examined how modified sterile males could be used as a control tool we found that modified sterile males may be a feasible control tool to limit population growth second we modeled a series of river pools and examined how harvest and deterrents could be used to decrease the risk of expanding grass carp s range within a river system within this system we also compared the impacts of size specific harvest and uniform harvest across all sizes we found that targeting the largest spawning populations may be more important than targeting the populations close to the invasion front for reducing the risk of spreading grass carp we also demonstrate that size of harvested fish was important for controlling populations keywords fisheries management invasion ecology population dynamics network node spatial model 1 introduction understanding both size specific demographics i e how the size distribution of individuals within a population impacts the population s dynamics easterling 1998 and spatial dynamics i e the movement and migration of organisms between habitats bowlin et al 2010 can be important for both basic ecology and conservation management in the past two decades advances have been made in population ecology to better understand both size specific and spatial dynamics specifically integral projection models ipms have emerged as an approach for modeling organisms with continuous state variables e g organism size in contrast to discrete state variables e g using life stages such as juveniles and adults easterling 1998 ellner and rees 2006 and network node based full annual cycle fac models have emerged as an approach for modeling spatially discrete populations taylor and norris 2010 hostetler et al 2015 we merged both of these approaches to model an invasive species grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella and then compare invasive species management scenarios in the remainder of the introduction we provide an overview of how grass carp represent other aquatic invasive species as well as describe how ipms may be combined with network node based fac models to capture the biology and management of grass carp grass carp have many traits and an introduction history that make them representative of other aquatic invasive species natural resource managers initially introduced the species in north america specifically to control vegetation in aquaculture facilities wastewater treatment facilities and energy production centers swingle 1957 shireman and smith 1983 bain 1993 mitchell and kelly 2006 after the initial release flooding combined with additional stocking and reproduction in the wild allowed the species to spread to both the great lakes chapman et al 2013 and the mississippi river basin bain 1993 fig 1 like many other invasive species grass carp cause large scale economic and ecological damage outside of their native range and concern exists about range expansion in north america kolar and lodge 2002 cuddington et al 2014 lodge et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 specific impacts of grass carp include altering aquatic vegetation and plankton communities and reducing water quality which ultimately displace native fishes vegetation waterfowl and disrupt their interconnected community structure and assemblage kolar and lodge 2002 irons et al 2007 sass et al 2014 lodge et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the ecology and life history of grass carp can be described using a network node fac modeling framework populations of grass carp such as those in lake erie exhibit seasonal migration between the lake and its tributaries with spawning occurring in the tributaries and the fish spending most of their life in the lake chapman et al 2013 this seasonal migration makes capturing the fac across discrete habitats important for modeling efforts populations such as those in the mississippi river basin can only spawn in certain pools of the rivers because fertilized eggs must remain suspended until the larvae develop the ability to independently swim shireman and smith 1983 this different use of discrete habitats makes consideration of metapopualtion dynamics important something network node models can capture well the ecology and life history of grass carp can be described using an ipm framework as well many species of fish grow throughout their life with growth slowing down asymptotically as fish increase in size isely and brabowski 2007 including grass carp shireman and smith 1983 furthermore grass carp demographic vital rates change as a function of size and larger carp are less likely to die and more likely to spawn shireman and smith 1983 in fact we previously used an integral projection erickson et al 2017b to capture these salient growth features but did not include any spatial structure as part of that model to reduce the impact and spread of grass carp researchers and managers are actively attempting to develop new control methods proposed control efforts include applying acoustical conditioning e g sloan et al 2013 developing new carp specific piscicides e g putnam et al 2017 harvesting by commercial fishers e g colvin et al 2012 poisoning with carbon dioxide under ice e g cupp et al 2017 slowing dispersal with carbon dioxide barriers e g cupp et al 2016 donaldson et al 2016 releasing yy males that only produce male offspring e g gutierrez and teem 2006 teem and gutierrez 2011 schill et al 2016 erickson et al 2017b and releasing genetically modified males that produce non viable offspring similar to mosquito releases described by benedict and robinson 2003 the last two options are the most theoretical and have yet to be developed for grass carp yy males fish can be produced by using conventional technology such as feminizing xy males and then breeding them with normal xy males schill et al 2016 sterile males can be created using synthetics biology using tools such as gene knockouts or gene additions benedict and robinson 2003 additional demographic attributes of these resulting organisms could in theory be modified for example one could increase the chance of modified fish spawning compared to non modified organisms or decrease the lifespan of modified fish compared to non modified organisms many of these management tools are either size specific which fit well into ipm based models or spatially explicit which tie into an fac network node based modeling approach for example the barrier deterrents could be used to either limit spread of invasive species or disrupt the connectivity of existing subpopulations the barriers hold potential in river systems such as the upper mississippi river basin that are fragmented by locks and dams chick et al 2006 conversely understanding the fac is important in deciding when where and how much of other management actions need to be done for example when and where should harvest be done and how much harvest is necessary to control a species many of these management actions are also size specific commercial harvest often can only target fish of certain sizes colvin et al 2012 and toxicants can often vary in toxicity based upon the size of targeted individuals the use of modified organisms through synthetic biology could also have size specific considerations we developed this model because resource managers are concerned about the impact of grass carp if the population increases in size or expands its range furthermore resource managers would like to be able to evaluate management scenarios and control tools for the species and other demographically similar species of invasive carps within this paper we developed and presented a spatially discrete meta population based ipm using parameter values from the literature to both advance ecological theory and provide managers with a tool to better understand the size specific and spatial dynamics of invasive grass carp we included two case studies the first explored the use of sterile males as a control tool in a lake system with two spawning tributaries the second explored the use of barrier deterrents and size specific harvest as integrated pest management tools of grass carp 2 methods first we described a generic network node ipm that accounted for the fac of carps this extends erickson et al 2017b who presented a non spatial ipm to explore the release of yy males as a control method for grass carps the model presented here also allow included size specific mortality from management e g harvest or piscicide sterile male introductions and spatially explicit dynamics e g reductions in connectivity between populations second we applied the model to two generic north american case studies for invasive grass carp we selected these case studies based upon management needs in north america by federal state and provincial management agencies p m kocovsky and d c glover personal observations we used the same parameter values as erickson et al 2017b which were further justified described and explained in our transparent and comprehensive model evaludation trace documentation schmolke et al 2010 augusiak et al 2014 grimm et al 2014 supplemental materials 2 1 mathematical model and numerical methods broadly our model had two components a spatial model i e network node system and a population model nested within the nodes we first described the population model and then placed it within a spatial context last we provide an overview of our numerical methods we coded an object orientated oo based model using python because the oo framework allowed us to create a generalized model that also avoids explicit indexing lutz 2013 2 1 1 population dynamics model within node dynamics we modeled the life history of carp using an ipm based upon previous work by erickson et al 2017b and we included a summary of the model used within this paper in this section complete details are found in our supplemental trace document for readers who are unfamiliar with ipms recent overviews introductions and tutorials of integral projection models exist e g ellner and rees 2006 ramula et al 2009 ellner et al 2010 merow et al 2014 the underlying premise of ipms is that the size distribution of individuals can be modeled as a continuous variable in our case z for a population that is modeled through discrete time t modeling the size distribution of species such as asian carp can be important because management sometimes can only target certain sized individuals and this can have important impacts on the population dynamics of the species tsehaye et al 2013 continuous length distribution of individuals within a population forms the basic foundations of our model fig 2 we used the term groups rather than the more conventional class e g sex class or age class caswell 2001 because class has a different and specific meaning in oo programing and we wanted our model description to match our code as much as possible groups allow for the modeling of individual sex e g normal male or females as well as modified organisms e g yy males sterile males modified organisms for a population with sex explicitly modeled there would be two fixed population sex groups within the model females p f z t and males p m z t of size z at time t our model includes the option to add additional sex groups such as yy males erickson et al 2017b or genetically modified sterile individuals similar to those described in knols et al 2006 conversely sex structure can be ignored if the model does not require it we included two models within this paper one with sex structure and one without generically each group within our model had an integral kernel that we integrated over i e we integrated the kernel over the fish lengths to project our model from one time step to the next k z z to calculate the population size through time p z t 1 ω k z z p z t dz for each time t with this formulation if z was the current length at time t then z was the length at time t 1 the kernel often can be split into two kernels a kernel for recruitment fecundity and a kernel for growth and maturation ellner and rees 2006 additionally we included immigration i z and emigration e z kernels modeling connections among subpopulation as a function of fish size these kernels included both movement and survival i e they indicate the probability of a fish both moving between nodes and surviving the move non moving fish had a different survival function the growth and maturation kernel m modeled how fish grow in length as a function of time and included both survival s z and growth g z z our fecundity recruitment kernel f was a function of the probability of an egg transitioning to become a recruit e t the probability of females surviving from the previous year s z the probability of females spawning p r z the number of eggs produced per female egg z and the initial recruit length distribution j z these functions were described in both erickson et al 2017b and our supplemental trace documentation our model made important assumptions about grass carp and the impacts of sex first we assumed that grass carp had xx female and xy male chromosomal structure although questions remain about the exact chromosomal sex determination of grass carp hu and chen 2015 our model assumed that xy males and females survive grow and reproduce at the same rate we made these assumptions because data do not exist for the growth and survival of each sex individually 2 1 2 network node mode inter node dynamics dynamic population network node models exist in the ecological literature e g taylor and norris 2010 and these have been adapted to include time and age stage sex structure as matrix or difference equations models e g erickson et al 2014 2016 wiederholt et al 2013 as a brief overview the network node framework describes nodes i e discrete habitat patches that are connected by edges to form a network the framework follows the path i e the set of all nodes and edges a group of individuals use through time the network model assumed groups do not change paths allowing paths to go extinct but not be re populated this simplifying assumption followed taylor and norris 2010 and allowing groups to change paths e g re colonize new patches or change migratory routes would require stochastic movement probabilities furthermore modeling this relationship would be more appropriate for other modeling approaches that consider small populations and their associated demographic stochasticity such as individual based models or branching processes models taylor and norris 2010 originally considered species with forced migration e g migratory birds with non overlapping summer and winter habitat but their framework readily generalizes to includes partial migration e g some groups do not migrate and no migration e g the model does not impose migratory dynamics erickson et al 2017a within this paper we expand the network node framework to model the growth of individuals as a continuous variable using ipm rather than a matrix model within each node thus rather than being limited to discrete sized groups our network node model included continuous size distributions this merged the benefits of ipms and network node models together in addition to allowing one to model size specific spatially explicit management one could also model size specific migration probabilities e g larger organisms might have a higher migration probability or size specific meta population dynamics e g quinn and peterson 1996 lastly our code can readily include time periods such as seasons e g summer winter or other within year discretizations of time that previous models could not readily handle e g erickson et al 2014 2016 wiederholt et al 2013 these time periods do not need to be the same duration e g time period 1 could be 2 months and time period 2 could be 10 months but the units within each time period must have consistent units e g events per 2 months for all parameter in time period 1 2 1 3 numerical methods we programmed our model using python 2 7 python software foundation 2017 using an oo based approach see supplemental figure 1 for a universal modeling language diagram lutz 2013 our lowest level of organization were groups each group corresponded to sex groups e g males females sterile males etc within these groups the code could move individuals or project populations through time we used the midpoint rule to project our populations through time carefully choosing the number of points to avoid numerical errors such as losing individuals through rounding loss or eviction williams et al 2012 groups occurred within nodes for the model nodes occurred within networks networks also contained paths connecting nodes we created wrapper functions to populate the model from csv files containing model parameters we exported our simulation results and plotted with ggplot2 in r wickham 2009 we used unit testing to ensure that our code was implemented correctly martin 2009 and version control to track our changes we have released our code on a github repository https github com rerickson usgs networknodeipm the repository also contains a tutorial for using our code and the trace documentation 2 2 case study 1 a lake and tributary model with sterile males some grass carp exhibit seasonal migration with the main population residing in a large body of water such as a lake and seasonally moving up rivers to spawn chapman et al 2013 this arrangement created a spoke and hub or spoke and wheel network with one central population connecting to other populations fig 3 for example a grass carp population currently resides in lake erie north america chapman et al 2013 within this population two known spawning populations exist embke et al 2016 but other tributaries could allow spawning kocovsky et al 2012 and spawning is likely occurring within these tributaries p m kocovsky expert judgment erickson et al 2017b used a population model for this species to evaluate the use of a yy male release strategy in this system but ignored spatial structure of the population additionally erickson et al 2017b found that yy males would not be a feasible control tool but did not explore other control methods we developed a spoke and hub network node model to compare control scenarios on this system and to better understand the importance of considering meta population dynamics this case study also highlights how our model could be used to describe a system with forced migration where all individuals leave some sites during portions of their annual cycle reliable population estimates and population distributions of grass carp in lake erie do not exist p m kocovsky expert judgment we built the model using 3 nodes across 2 seasons lake winter lake summer both node 1 and tributaries 1 and 2 both only used during summer nodes 2 and 3 we assumed most spawning individuals used tributary 1 but others used tributary 2 table 1 we used this system to examine if stocking sterile grass carp could be used to cause a population collapse the release of modified invasive carp has been discussed similar to the release of modified mosquitoes benedict and robinson 2003 broadly the idea is that if enough sterile males are released a population will collapse because too little recruitment will occur we compared the release of two types of modified sterile males sterile males that had the same survival as non modified males and sterile males with decreased survival compared to non modified males for both scenarios we scaled the model to begin with 250 000 carp and ran the model 30 years to allow transient dynamics to dissipate the model was then run out a further 70 years during which we simulated management activities we compared the continual stocking of three levels of sterile males for 20 years low 10 000 per year mid 100 000 per year and high 200 000 per year we stocked the grass carp in tributary 1 the known and major spawning tributary we assumed sterile males behaved and were demographically identical to normal males for both simulations however we decreased the maximum survival rate of sterile males in the second scenario by half i e using 0 45 rather than 0 90 to explore the impact of decreasing the survival of sterile males on the system dynamics we explored stocking durations and presented the results from 20 years of stocking because this allowed the model to reach a new equilibrium during stocking we did not examine harvest in the lake system because catching grass carp can be extremely difficult in large lakes additionally researchers have observed telemetry marked grass carp swimming past nets in large bodies of water p k kocovsky personal observation 2 3 case study 2 river system with grass carps with harvest and barrier deterrents invasive carp including grass carp occur in the upper mississippi river basin and its tributaries the upper mississippi river is a a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial navigation system to the united states of america 33u s c 652 1983 and grass carp threaten this system these two management considerations intertwine with invasive carps in the river system the navigation system fragments the river system and prior to the arrival of invasive fishes managers were concerned about the impact of this fragmentation on native fishes specifically concern existed that high head dams can fragment pools and separate fish populations chick et al 2006 after the arrival of invasive fishes the series of locks and dams fragmenting the river have been viewed more positively as an opportunity to limit or even halt the spread of invasive species through movement deterrents e g cupp et al 2016 furthermore at one extreme an act of the united states congress allowed the complete closure of lock and dam number 1 on the mississippi river to prevent the spread of invasive carps 79fr75794 2014 however most locks and dams may not be closed because they are important for river navigation in contrast to a large lake system invasive carp can be successfully harvested in the upper mississippi river basin contract commercial fishing operations currently operate in some of these waters as part of ongoing management e g the illinois river colvin et al 2012 tsehaye et al 2013 given these two considerations we constructed a hypothetical system of 4 river pools to compare management strategies these pools would be portions of the river that are broken up by a series of dams similar to the illinois river or upper mississippi river the dams limit movement between pools by limiting where fish may swim between pools and creating deterrents that directly limit movement some movement between pools would be possible through locks and dams either with regular boat traffic or during high flow periods when dams do not limit movement pool 1 was the farthest downriver and pool 4 was farthest upriver spawning only occurred in pools 1 and 2 which also means pools 3 and 4 only have fish due to immigration from these pools additionally movement parameters were selected such that pools 1 and 2 would have the largest populations and pool 4 would have the smallest population the pools were only directly connected to the adjoining pools e g pool 2 was only connected to pools 1 and 3 but transitions that passed through multiple pools were allowed because fish could move among multiple pools during the course of an annual time step we based our transition probabilities upon expert opinion of the authors given the difficulty in estimating carp transition probabilities in river systems table 2 within this system we were most interested in the population in pool 4 because this could represent the invasion front next to a resource that managers seek to protect i e fish in pool 4 would be most likely to become propagules into the resources that managers are trying to protect such as pools upriver tributaries or another watershed this objective was motivated by situations currently facing managers for example resource managers are trying to keep invasive carp from spreading via the illinois river system to lake michigan as another example resource managers are trying to limit the spread of invasive carp up the upper mississippi river including the state waters of minnesota and iowa additionally managers are interested in managing populations of invasive carps in the ohio river system which could be similar to our theoretical system as well unlike our simulated lake system our simulated river system did not have any time periods within years e g seasons we used the system described in the previous paragraph to compare two management approaches harvest and decreased connectivity to pool 4 we examined three harvest levels 25 50 and 75 of the total population for the three harvest levels we also examined uniform harvest and harvest that only targeted large fish that were longer than 80 cm this was done by modeling harvest mortality using a logistic curve with an inflection point of 80 cm slope of 20 minimum harvest of zero and maximum harvest that corresponded to levels described previously in this paragraph we simulated these harvest levels in both the lower pools pools 1 and 2 or both the upper pools pools 3 and 4 to examine where harvest might be more effective we ran the river simulations for 15 years prior to starting harvest we continued harvest for 30 years and then ran the simulations until model year 100 besides harvest we also examined decreasing pool connectivity to pool 4 we decreased movement in and out of pool 4 to be 0 5 and 0 1 of baseline conditions this could reflect the installation of a deterrent at the lock and dam between pools 3 and 4 this impacts both the transition probabilities into and out of pool 4 for example a carbon dioxide deterrent such as the one proposed by cupp et al 2016 would not only limit the movement of fish into a pool but also potentially limit their ability to leave the pool 3 results broadly we demonstrated how a spatially explicit ipm may be used to model population dynamics and applied to resource management we demonstrated the ability of our model to include many variations including time periods e g seasons within years harvest or direct mortality deterrents sex groups and the stocking of modified sterile males we also illustrated how our model could be applied to compare management scenarios and to guide the development of new control technologies more specifically we examined two scenarios of interest to research managers 3 1 case study 1 a lake tributary model with sterile males for a simulated spoke and wheel system e g a lake and tributary system we examined the management of an invasive species using sterile males fig 4 we found that one would have to release about the same number of sterile males per year as the total wild population both males and females for the method to be effective for the scenarios with the decreased survival sterile males approximately the same number of sterile males as number of individuals in the total wild population would need to be released each year for the scenarios with the normal survival sterile males approximately half the number would be required to be released releasing the sterile males with normal survival required increasing the total population of grass carp by factors of 2 to 4 of the reference equilibrium value in contrast releasing the sterile males with decreased survival rates initially doubled the total population but quickly declined to approximately 110 of reference levels for both release types the population rebounded once stocking stopped although a numerical artifact of the model numerically extinction could only occur if floating point zero was reached this recovery also demonstrates that the zero equilibrium was unstable biologically this unstable equilibrium means a reintroduction of carp either through release or wild dispersion from another population would cause the population to rebound our model exhibited strong transient dynamics at the start of the simulation and following cessation of stocking of sterile males during the start of the simulation the growing population rapidly overshot its equilibrium value dipped slightly below the equilibrium value and then gradually returned to equilibrium similar results occurred with the sterile male stocking scenarios these results were most pronounced and actually larger in magnitude than the initial transient dynamics for the shorter life span sterile male scenarios conversely the transient dynamics for the normal lifespan sterile males were dampened 3 2 case study 2 river system with grass carps with harvest and barrier deterrents for a simulated system of nodes connected in serial e g a system of pools on a river we examined how harvest and deterrents could be used to limit the upriver spread of an invasive fish fig 5 we found that we were able to decrease the population in the upper most pool pool 4 using both movement deterrents and harvest counter intuitively harvesting the lower pools had a larger impact than harvesting in the upper pools these harvest impacts were most pronounced at higher harvest levels the size of harvested individuals i e only large fish compared to uniform harvest was important under low harvest scenarios for small populations e g pool 4 in low harvest simulations we also observed that barriers and deterrents could be helpful in controlling the spread of invasive fish species transient dynamics occurred within the river system as well however the dynamics were less pronounced than the lake system and mainly occurred in pool 2 specifically pool 2 initially overshot its carrying capacity and then decreased down to the equilibrium value for the no harvest scenarios pool 2 also exhibited transient dynamics after harvest started with the population size in pool 2 not monotonically approaching the new equilibrium under the low harvest scenario the population sharply decreased once harvest started and then gradually increased to a new equilibrium under the medium harvest scenario the population sharply decreased then increased before decreasing again to a new equilibrium 4 discussion we examined the management of an invasive fish species in two situations for our simulated lake tributary system we explored the use of sterile males as a control tool compared to yy males in a similar system erickson et al 2017b releasing sterile males may hold more promise because fewer individuals may need to be released to have an impact on total population size additionally there may be methods for creating sterile males or other modified fish that are more effective at controlling populations and have less impacts on the release system for example fish could be modified to produce sterile offspring rather than simply being sterile themselves which could allow the sterile genes to spread more quickly throughout the population and more efficiently cause the population to crash to further enhance the modified fish technologies such as gene drives could used to increase the reproductive success of the modified fish however the extent that modified organisms can be used for control currently remains an open research question from both scientific and policy perspectives knols et al 2006 adalja et al 2016 regardless of what types of organisms can be created deploying these methods would benefit from population level modeling to guide their development our simulations with the river system demonstrated how existing control tools could be used to limit the spread of grass carp we found that barriers could be used as deterrents to help limit the spread of species when combined with harvest counter intuitively we found that harvesting in the downriver pools had a greater impact on the population in pool 4 than harvesting directly in pools 3 and 4 at similar harvest rates this reflects two artifacts of the systems first pools 1 and 2 the lower pools had larger populations second pools 1 and 2 both had spawning whereas the upper pools did not hence from a carp recruitment perspective these pools are more important than the other two pools this observation from our simulations also demonstrates the importance of considering both source sink theory e g runge et al 2006 and network dynamics e g taylor and norris 2010 for natural resource management furthermore our source sink harvest results are similar to results produced by ongoing modeling efforts used by the u s fish and wildlife service usfws to model bighead and silver carp in the illinois river system d c glover and j l kallis usfws personal observation hence both models which were developed independently from each other lend support to the finding by independently reaching the same conclusion much like a weights of evidence approach e g dagnino et al 2008 our simulations also demonstrated that the size of fish harvested can be important under some situations we did not consider the source population for pool 1 in our model for example several basins e g the upper mississippi river the missouri river ohio river and illinois river in north america are connected to the lower mississippi river our simulated system would be similar to one of these systems and ignored the main source population different methods could be used to model the origin source population the most ambitious of these would require a continental level model that includes the other basins however parameter estimates for such a system do not exist although parameterization efforts are underway monitoring and response workgroup 2017 simpler options could include either modeling the most downriver node as the source population and scaling it as such e g a node with a large population but low connectivity to the rest of the system or including a boundary condition on the most down river node that models the immigration and emigration of fish into the system the river simulations also demonstrated the utility of integrated pest management specifically our simulations with two stressors reduced the population in pool 4 more than the single stressors alone however preventing the spread of grass carp would likely be more effective with multiple stressors beyond the two included in our simulations for example the sea lamprey control program in the great lakes has used a combination of barriers sterile males pheromones and lampricides to manage lamprey populations and protect fish populations christie and goddard 2003 although the effectiveness of sterile males has be difficult to assess bravener and twohey 2016 besides examining two specific scenarios we developed and presented a spatially explicit ipm and demonstrated how it may be applied to resource management we designed our model to be flexible and readily adaptable to other life histories movement and migration patterns and control techniques for example our model readily allowed the inclusion of a new type of fish to be used as a control technique as well as the inclusion of traditional control tools such as harvest or deterrents although applied to fish species our model would also be readily adaptable to other species and management situations existing ipms could be placed into a spatial context examples include a model of trait distributions in wolves coulson et al 2011 an oyster model moore et al 2016 a plant seedbed model eager et al 2013 a dynamics energy budget model schreiber and ross 2016 a perennial herbs model ramula et al 2009 and a nile crocodile model wallace et al 2013 additionally we focused on applying our system to the control invasive species but our model could just as easily be applied to the conservation of declining species or management of game or fisheries species like many of the current applications of network node or fac models e g taylor and norris 2010 hostetler et al 2015 our model also demonstrated known behavior for network node models betini et al 2015 described a knock on effect where nodes not directly connected still impact other nodes in the system despite a connection only through the lake our lake model directly demonstrated this effect with management on one tributary affecting the other tributary the river pools case study also demonstrated the knock on effect because harvesting the lower pools were more effective at controlling the upper pool rather than directly harvesting the upper pools both of our systems also exhibited strong transient dynamics at the start of the simulations and after stocking stopped in the lake system these may be important if other stressors are used on the system or if our model did not capture important transient dynamics correctly ezard et al 2010 transient dynamics are important if other stressors are used because the other stressors may cause non linear impacts to the system in some systems where carp comprise a majority of the biomass e g irons et al 2007 releases from intraspecific competition could have major impacts on the system another reason transient dynamics could be important is that they can give managers the wrong feedback for example bains et al 2014 found that treating american chestnut trees likely causes a temporary demographic bump to the population due to transient dynamics but does not change the long term decline of the species hence the managers still need to be concerned about the species decline invasive carp managers might get similar confusing feedback from the system after treatment due to transient dynamics last our model highlights the possibility that complex network dynamics can cause unintended impacts elsewhere within the system being managed 5 conclusion we demonstrated the importance of size based models and source sink theory to invasive species modeling we specifically illustrated that harvesting source populations can be more important than those closet to the invasion front furthermore we also observed that size specific harvest can be important under some situations thus our findings demonstrate that when applying population modelings to guide integrated pest management both source sink theory and individual size distributions within populations can be important considerations author contributions rae programmed the model developed the network model and wrote the initial draft of

25193,natural resource managers and ecologists often desire an understanding of spatial dynamics such as migration dispersion and meta population dynamics network node models can capture these salient features additionally the state variable used with many species may be appropriately modeled as a continuous variable e g length and management activities sometimes can only target individuals of certain sizes integral projection models ipms can capture this life history characteristic and allow for the examination of size specific management we combined an ipm with a network node model to capture both of these salient features we then demonstrated how this model could be used to understand and manage populations of invasive species focusing on grass carp as an example grass carp disrupt ecosystems outside of their native range and have spread around much of the world including north america the impacts of grass carp include adversely changing aquatic plant communities which in turn affect a wide range of endpoints ranging from water quality to waterfowl recruitment we specifically examined two theoretical systems using parameters from the literature first we modeled a lake with two tributaries and examined how modified sterile males could be used as a control tool we found that modified sterile males may be a feasible control tool to limit population growth second we modeled a series of river pools and examined how harvest and deterrents could be used to decrease the risk of expanding grass carp s range within a river system within this system we also compared the impacts of size specific harvest and uniform harvest across all sizes we found that targeting the largest spawning populations may be more important than targeting the populations close to the invasion front for reducing the risk of spreading grass carp we also demonstrate that size of harvested fish was important for controlling populations keywords fisheries management invasion ecology population dynamics network node spatial model 1 introduction understanding both size specific demographics i e how the size distribution of individuals within a population impacts the population s dynamics easterling 1998 and spatial dynamics i e the movement and migration of organisms between habitats bowlin et al 2010 can be important for both basic ecology and conservation management in the past two decades advances have been made in population ecology to better understand both size specific and spatial dynamics specifically integral projection models ipms have emerged as an approach for modeling organisms with continuous state variables e g organism size in contrast to discrete state variables e g using life stages such as juveniles and adults easterling 1998 ellner and rees 2006 and network node based full annual cycle fac models have emerged as an approach for modeling spatially discrete populations taylor and norris 2010 hostetler et al 2015 we merged both of these approaches to model an invasive species grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella and then compare invasive species management scenarios in the remainder of the introduction we provide an overview of how grass carp represent other aquatic invasive species as well as describe how ipms may be combined with network node based fac models to capture the biology and management of grass carp grass carp have many traits and an introduction history that make them representative of other aquatic invasive species natural resource managers initially introduced the species in north america specifically to control vegetation in aquaculture facilities wastewater treatment facilities and energy production centers swingle 1957 shireman and smith 1983 bain 1993 mitchell and kelly 2006 after the initial release flooding combined with additional stocking and reproduction in the wild allowed the species to spread to both the great lakes chapman et al 2013 and the mississippi river basin bain 1993 fig 1 like many other invasive species grass carp cause large scale economic and ecological damage outside of their native range and concern exists about range expansion in north america kolar and lodge 2002 cuddington et al 2014 lodge et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 specific impacts of grass carp include altering aquatic vegetation and plankton communities and reducing water quality which ultimately displace native fishes vegetation waterfowl and disrupt their interconnected community structure and assemblage kolar and lodge 2002 irons et al 2007 sass et al 2014 lodge et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the ecology and life history of grass carp can be described using a network node fac modeling framework populations of grass carp such as those in lake erie exhibit seasonal migration between the lake and its tributaries with spawning occurring in the tributaries and the fish spending most of their life in the lake chapman et al 2013 this seasonal migration makes capturing the fac across discrete habitats important for modeling efforts populations such as those in the mississippi river basin can only spawn in certain pools of the rivers because fertilized eggs must remain suspended until the larvae develop the ability to independently swim shireman and smith 1983 this different use of discrete habitats makes consideration of metapopualtion dynamics important something network node models can capture well the ecology and life history of grass carp can be described using an ipm framework as well many species of fish grow throughout their life with growth slowing down asymptotically as fish increase in size isely and brabowski 2007 including grass carp shireman and smith 1983 furthermore grass carp demographic vital rates change as a function of size and larger carp are less likely to die and more likely to spawn shireman and smith 1983 in fact we previously used an integral projection erickson et al 2017b to capture these salient growth features but did not include any spatial structure as part of that model to reduce the impact and spread of grass carp researchers and managers are actively attempting to develop new control methods proposed control efforts include applying acoustical conditioning e g sloan et al 2013 developing new carp specific piscicides e g putnam et al 2017 harvesting by commercial fishers e g colvin et al 2012 poisoning with carbon dioxide under ice e g cupp et al 2017 slowing dispersal with carbon dioxide barriers e g cupp et al 2016 donaldson et al 2016 releasing yy males that only produce male offspring e g gutierrez and teem 2006 teem and gutierrez 2011 schill et al 2016 erickson et al 2017b and releasing genetically modified males that produce non viable offspring similar to mosquito releases described by benedict and robinson 2003 the last two options are the most theoretical and have yet to be developed for grass carp yy males fish can be produced by using conventional technology such as feminizing xy males and then breeding them with normal xy males schill et al 2016 sterile males can be created using synthetics biology using tools such as gene knockouts or gene additions benedict and robinson 2003 additional demographic attributes of these resulting organisms could in theory be modified for example one could increase the chance of modified fish spawning compared to non modified organisms or decrease the lifespan of modified fish compared to non modified organisms many of these management tools are either size specific which fit well into ipm based models or spatially explicit which tie into an fac network node based modeling approach for example the barrier deterrents could be used to either limit spread of invasive species or disrupt the connectivity of existing subpopulations the barriers hold potential in river systems such as the upper mississippi river basin that are fragmented by locks and dams chick et al 2006 conversely understanding the fac is important in deciding when where and how much of other management actions need to be done for example when and where should harvest be done and how much harvest is necessary to control a species many of these management actions are also size specific commercial harvest often can only target fish of certain sizes colvin et al 2012 and toxicants can often vary in toxicity based upon the size of targeted individuals the use of modified organisms through synthetic biology could also have size specific considerations we developed this model because resource managers are concerned about the impact of grass carp if the population increases in size or expands its range furthermore resource managers would like to be able to evaluate management scenarios and control tools for the species and other demographically similar species of invasive carps within this paper we developed and presented a spatially discrete meta population based ipm using parameter values from the literature to both advance ecological theory and provide managers with a tool to better understand the size specific and spatial dynamics of invasive grass carp we included two case studies the first explored the use of sterile males as a control tool in a lake system with two spawning tributaries the second explored the use of barrier deterrents and size specific harvest as integrated pest management tools of grass carp 2 methods first we described a generic network node ipm that accounted for the fac of carps this extends erickson et al 2017b who presented a non spatial ipm to explore the release of yy males as a control method for grass carps the model presented here also allow included size specific mortality from management e g harvest or piscicide sterile male introductions and spatially explicit dynamics e g reductions in connectivity between populations second we applied the model to two generic north american case studies for invasive grass carp we selected these case studies based upon management needs in north america by federal state and provincial management agencies p m kocovsky and d c glover personal observations we used the same parameter values as erickson et al 2017b which were further justified described and explained in our transparent and comprehensive model evaludation trace documentation schmolke et al 2010 augusiak et al 2014 grimm et al 2014 supplemental materials 2 1 mathematical model and numerical methods broadly our model had two components a spatial model i e network node system and a population model nested within the nodes we first described the population model and then placed it within a spatial context last we provide an overview of our numerical methods we coded an object orientated oo based model using python because the oo framework allowed us to create a generalized model that also avoids explicit indexing lutz 2013 2 1 1 population dynamics model within node dynamics we modeled the life history of carp using an ipm based upon previous work by erickson et al 2017b and we included a summary of the model used within this paper in this section complete details are found in our supplemental trace document for readers who are unfamiliar with ipms recent overviews introductions and tutorials of integral projection models exist e g ellner and rees 2006 ramula et al 2009 ellner et al 2010 merow et al 2014 the underlying premise of ipms is that the size distribution of individuals can be modeled as a continuous variable in our case z for a population that is modeled through discrete time t modeling the size distribution of species such as asian carp can be important because management sometimes can only target certain sized individuals and this can have important impacts on the population dynamics of the species tsehaye et al 2013 continuous length distribution of individuals within a population forms the basic foundations of our model fig 2 we used the term groups rather than the more conventional class e g sex class or age class caswell 2001 because class has a different and specific meaning in oo programing and we wanted our model description to match our code as much as possible groups allow for the modeling of individual sex e g normal male or females as well as modified organisms e g yy males sterile males modified organisms for a population with sex explicitly modeled there would be two fixed population sex groups within the model females p f z t and males p m z t of size z at time t our model includes the option to add additional sex groups such as yy males erickson et al 2017b or genetically modified sterile individuals similar to those described in knols et al 2006 conversely sex structure can be ignored if the model does not require it we included two models within this paper one with sex structure and one without generically each group within our model had an integral kernel that we integrated over i e we integrated the kernel over the fish lengths to project our model from one time step to the next k z z to calculate the population size through time p z t 1 ω k z z p z t dz for each time t with this formulation if z was the current length at time t then z was the length at time t 1 the kernel often can be split into two kernels a kernel for recruitment fecundity and a kernel for growth and maturation ellner and rees 2006 additionally we included immigration i z and emigration e z kernels modeling connections among subpopulation as a function of fish size these kernels included both movement and survival i e they indicate the probability of a fish both moving between nodes and surviving the move non moving fish had a different survival function the growth and maturation kernel m modeled how fish grow in length as a function of time and included both survival s z and growth g z z our fecundity recruitment kernel f was a function of the probability of an egg transitioning to become a recruit e t the probability of females surviving from the previous year s z the probability of females spawning p r z the number of eggs produced per female egg z and the initial recruit length distribution j z these functions were described in both erickson et al 2017b and our supplemental trace documentation our model made important assumptions about grass carp and the impacts of sex first we assumed that grass carp had xx female and xy male chromosomal structure although questions remain about the exact chromosomal sex determination of grass carp hu and chen 2015 our model assumed that xy males and females survive grow and reproduce at the same rate we made these assumptions because data do not exist for the growth and survival of each sex individually 2 1 2 network node mode inter node dynamics dynamic population network node models exist in the ecological literature e g taylor and norris 2010 and these have been adapted to include time and age stage sex structure as matrix or difference equations models e g erickson et al 2014 2016 wiederholt et al 2013 as a brief overview the network node framework describes nodes i e discrete habitat patches that are connected by edges to form a network the framework follows the path i e the set of all nodes and edges a group of individuals use through time the network model assumed groups do not change paths allowing paths to go extinct but not be re populated this simplifying assumption followed taylor and norris 2010 and allowing groups to change paths e g re colonize new patches or change migratory routes would require stochastic movement probabilities furthermore modeling this relationship would be more appropriate for other modeling approaches that consider small populations and their associated demographic stochasticity such as individual based models or branching processes models taylor and norris 2010 originally considered species with forced migration e g migratory birds with non overlapping summer and winter habitat but their framework readily generalizes to includes partial migration e g some groups do not migrate and no migration e g the model does not impose migratory dynamics erickson et al 2017a within this paper we expand the network node framework to model the growth of individuals as a continuous variable using ipm rather than a matrix model within each node thus rather than being limited to discrete sized groups our network node model included continuous size distributions this merged the benefits of ipms and network node models together in addition to allowing one to model size specific spatially explicit management one could also model size specific migration probabilities e g larger organisms might have a higher migration probability or size specific meta population dynamics e g quinn and peterson 1996 lastly our code can readily include time periods such as seasons e g summer winter or other within year discretizations of time that previous models could not readily handle e g erickson et al 2014 2016 wiederholt et al 2013 these time periods do not need to be the same duration e g time period 1 could be 2 months and time period 2 could be 10 months but the units within each time period must have consistent units e g events per 2 months for all parameter in time period 1 2 1 3 numerical methods we programmed our model using python 2 7 python software foundation 2017 using an oo based approach see supplemental figure 1 for a universal modeling language diagram lutz 2013 our lowest level of organization were groups each group corresponded to sex groups e g males females sterile males etc within these groups the code could move individuals or project populations through time we used the midpoint rule to project our populations through time carefully choosing the number of points to avoid numerical errors such as losing individuals through rounding loss or eviction williams et al 2012 groups occurred within nodes for the model nodes occurred within networks networks also contained paths connecting nodes we created wrapper functions to populate the model from csv files containing model parameters we exported our simulation results and plotted with ggplot2 in r wickham 2009 we used unit testing to ensure that our code was implemented correctly martin 2009 and version control to track our changes we have released our code on a github repository https github com rerickson usgs networknodeipm the repository also contains a tutorial for using our code and the trace documentation 2 2 case study 1 a lake and tributary model with sterile males some grass carp exhibit seasonal migration with the main population residing in a large body of water such as a lake and seasonally moving up rivers to spawn chapman et al 2013 this arrangement created a spoke and hub or spoke and wheel network with one central population connecting to other populations fig 3 for example a grass carp population currently resides in lake erie north america chapman et al 2013 within this population two known spawning populations exist embke et al 2016 but other tributaries could allow spawning kocovsky et al 2012 and spawning is likely occurring within these tributaries p m kocovsky expert judgment erickson et al 2017b used a population model for this species to evaluate the use of a yy male release strategy in this system but ignored spatial structure of the population additionally erickson et al 2017b found that yy males would not be a feasible control tool but did not explore other control methods we developed a spoke and hub network node model to compare control scenarios on this system and to better understand the importance of considering meta population dynamics this case study also highlights how our model could be used to describe a system with forced migration where all individuals leave some sites during portions of their annual cycle reliable population estimates and population distributions of grass carp in lake erie do not exist p m kocovsky expert judgment we built the model using 3 nodes across 2 seasons lake winter lake summer both node 1 and tributaries 1 and 2 both only used during summer nodes 2 and 3 we assumed most spawning individuals used tributary 1 but others used tributary 2 table 1 we used this system to examine if stocking sterile grass carp could be used to cause a population collapse the release of modified invasive carp has been discussed similar to the release of modified mosquitoes benedict and robinson 2003 broadly the idea is that if enough sterile males are released a population will collapse because too little recruitment will occur we compared the release of two types of modified sterile males sterile males that had the same survival as non modified males and sterile males with decreased survival compared to non modified males for both scenarios we scaled the model to begin with 250 000 carp and ran the model 30 years to allow transient dynamics to dissipate the model was then run out a further 70 years during which we simulated management activities we compared the continual stocking of three levels of sterile males for 20 years low 10 000 per year mid 100 000 per year and high 200 000 per year we stocked the grass carp in tributary 1 the known and major spawning tributary we assumed sterile males behaved and were demographically identical to normal males for both simulations however we decreased the maximum survival rate of sterile males in the second scenario by half i e using 0 45 rather than 0 90 to explore the impact of decreasing the survival of sterile males on the system dynamics we explored stocking durations and presented the results from 20 years of stocking because this allowed the model to reach a new equilibrium during stocking we did not examine harvest in the lake system because catching grass carp can be extremely difficult in large lakes additionally researchers have observed telemetry marked grass carp swimming past nets in large bodies of water p k kocovsky personal observation 2 3 case study 2 river system with grass carps with harvest and barrier deterrents invasive carp including grass carp occur in the upper mississippi river basin and its tributaries the upper mississippi river is a a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial navigation system to the united states of america 33u s c 652 1983 and grass carp threaten this system these two management considerations intertwine with invasive carps in the river system the navigation system fragments the river system and prior to the arrival of invasive fishes managers were concerned about the impact of this fragmentation on native fishes specifically concern existed that high head dams can fragment pools and separate fish populations chick et al 2006 after the arrival of invasive fishes the series of locks and dams fragmenting the river have been viewed more positively as an opportunity to limit or even halt the spread of invasive species through movement deterrents e g cupp et al 2016 furthermore at one extreme an act of the united states congress allowed the complete closure of lock and dam number 1 on the mississippi river to prevent the spread of invasive carps 79fr75794 2014 however most locks and dams may not be closed because they are important for river navigation in contrast to a large lake system invasive carp can be successfully harvested in the upper mississippi river basin contract commercial fishing operations currently operate in some of these waters as part of ongoing management e g the illinois river colvin et al 2012 tsehaye et al 2013 given these two considerations we constructed a hypothetical system of 4 river pools to compare management strategies these pools would be portions of the river that are broken up by a series of dams similar to the illinois river or upper mississippi river the dams limit movement between pools by limiting where fish may swim between pools and creating deterrents that directly limit movement some movement between pools would be possible through locks and dams either with regular boat traffic or during high flow periods when dams do not limit movement pool 1 was the farthest downriver and pool 4 was farthest upriver spawning only occurred in pools 1 and 2 which also means pools 3 and 4 only have fish due to immigration from these pools additionally movement parameters were selected such that pools 1 and 2 would have the largest populations and pool 4 would have the smallest population the pools were only directly connected to the adjoining pools e g pool 2 was only connected to pools 1 and 3 but transitions that passed through multiple pools were allowed because fish could move among multiple pools during the course of an annual time step we based our transition probabilities upon expert opinion of the authors given the difficulty in estimating carp transition probabilities in river systems table 2 within this system we were most interested in the population in pool 4 because this could represent the invasion front next to a resource that managers seek to protect i e fish in pool 4 would be most likely to become propagules into the resources that managers are trying to protect such as pools upriver tributaries or another watershed this objective was motivated by situations currently facing managers for example resource managers are trying to keep invasive carp from spreading via the illinois river system to lake michigan as another example resource managers are trying to limit the spread of invasive carp up the upper mississippi river including the state waters of minnesota and iowa additionally managers are interested in managing populations of invasive carps in the ohio river system which could be similar to our theoretical system as well unlike our simulated lake system our simulated river system did not have any time periods within years e g seasons we used the system described in the previous paragraph to compare two management approaches harvest and decreased connectivity to pool 4 we examined three harvest levels 25 50 and 75 of the total population for the three harvest levels we also examined uniform harvest and harvest that only targeted large fish that were longer than 80 cm this was done by modeling harvest mortality using a logistic curve with an inflection point of 80 cm slope of 20 minimum harvest of zero and maximum harvest that corresponded to levels described previously in this paragraph we simulated these harvest levels in both the lower pools pools 1 and 2 or both the upper pools pools 3 and 4 to examine where harvest might be more effective we ran the river simulations for 15 years prior to starting harvest we continued harvest for 30 years and then ran the simulations until model year 100 besides harvest we also examined decreasing pool connectivity to pool 4 we decreased movement in and out of pool 4 to be 0 5 and 0 1 of baseline conditions this could reflect the installation of a deterrent at the lock and dam between pools 3 and 4 this impacts both the transition probabilities into and out of pool 4 for example a carbon dioxide deterrent such as the one proposed by cupp et al 2016 would not only limit the movement of fish into a pool but also potentially limit their ability to leave the pool 3 results broadly we demonstrated how a spatially explicit ipm may be used to model population dynamics and applied to resource management we demonstrated the ability of our model to include many variations including time periods e g seasons within years harvest or direct mortality deterrents sex groups and the stocking of modified sterile males we also illustrated how our model could be applied to compare management scenarios and to guide the development of new control technologies more specifically we examined two scenarios of interest to research managers 3 1 case study 1 a lake tributary model with sterile males for a simulated spoke and wheel system e g a lake and tributary system we examined the management of an invasive species using sterile males fig 4 we found that one would have to release about the same number of sterile males per year as the total wild population both males and females for the method to be effective for the scenarios with the decreased survival sterile males approximately the same number of sterile males as number of individuals in the total wild population would need to be released each year for the scenarios with the normal survival sterile males approximately half the number would be required to be released releasing the sterile males with normal survival required increasing the total population of grass carp by factors of 2 to 4 of the reference equilibrium value in contrast releasing the sterile males with decreased survival rates initially doubled the total population but quickly declined to approximately 110 of reference levels for both release types the population rebounded once stocking stopped although a numerical artifact of the model numerically extinction could only occur if floating point zero was reached this recovery also demonstrates that the zero equilibrium was unstable biologically this unstable equilibrium means a reintroduction of carp either through release or wild dispersion from another population would cause the population to rebound our model exhibited strong transient dynamics at the start of the simulation and following cessation of stocking of sterile males during the start of the simulation the growing population rapidly overshot its equilibrium value dipped slightly below the equilibrium value and then gradually returned to equilibrium similar results occurred with the sterile male stocking scenarios these results were most pronounced and actually larger in magnitude than the initial transient dynamics for the shorter life span sterile male scenarios conversely the transient dynamics for the normal lifespan sterile males were dampened 3 2 case study 2 river system with grass carps with harvest and barrier deterrents for a simulated system of nodes connected in serial e g a system of pools on a river we examined how harvest and deterrents could be used to limit the upriver spread of an invasive fish fig 5 we found that we were able to decrease the population in the upper most pool pool 4 using both movement deterrents and harvest counter intuitively harvesting the lower pools had a larger impact than harvesting in the upper pools these harvest impacts were most pronounced at higher harvest levels the size of harvested individuals i e only large fish compared to uniform harvest was important under low harvest scenarios for small populations e g pool 4 in low harvest simulations we also observed that barriers and deterrents could be helpful in controlling the spread of invasive fish species transient dynamics occurred within the river system as well however the dynamics were less pronounced than the lake system and mainly occurred in pool 2 specifically pool 2 initially overshot its carrying capacity and then decreased down to the equilibrium value for the no harvest scenarios pool 2 also exhibited transient dynamics after harvest started with the population size in pool 2 not monotonically approaching the new equilibrium under the low harvest scenario the population sharply decreased once harvest started and then gradually increased to a new equilibrium under the medium harvest scenario the population sharply decreased then increased before decreasing again to a new equilibrium 4 discussion we examined the management of an invasive fish species in two situations for our simulated lake tributary system we explored the use of sterile males as a control tool compared to yy males in a similar system erickson et al 2017b releasing sterile males may hold more promise because fewer individuals may need to be released to have an impact on total population size additionally there may be methods for creating sterile males or other modified fish that are more effective at controlling populations and have less impacts on the release system for example fish could be modified to produce sterile offspring rather than simply being sterile themselves which could allow the sterile genes to spread more quickly throughout the population and more efficiently cause the population to crash to further enhance the modified fish technologies such as gene drives could used to increase the reproductive success of the modified fish however the extent that modified organisms can be used for control currently remains an open research question from both scientific and policy perspectives knols et al 2006 adalja et al 2016 regardless of what types of organisms can be created deploying these methods would benefit from population level modeling to guide their development our simulations with the river system demonstrated how existing control tools could be used to limit the spread of grass carp we found that barriers could be used as deterrents to help limit the spread of species when combined with harvest counter intuitively we found that harvesting in the downriver pools had a greater impact on the population in pool 4 than harvesting directly in pools 3 and 4 at similar harvest rates this reflects two artifacts of the systems first pools 1 and 2 the lower pools had larger populations second pools 1 and 2 both had spawning whereas the upper pools did not hence from a carp recruitment perspective these pools are more important than the other two pools this observation from our simulations also demonstrates the importance of considering both source sink theory e g runge et al 2006 and network dynamics e g taylor and norris 2010 for natural resource management furthermore our source sink harvest results are similar to results produced by ongoing modeling efforts used by the u s fish and wildlife service usfws to model bighead and silver carp in the illinois river system d c glover and j l kallis usfws personal observation hence both models which were developed independently from each other lend support to the finding by independently reaching the same conclusion much like a weights of evidence approach e g dagnino et al 2008 our simulations also demonstrated that the size of fish harvested can be important under some situations we did not consider the source population for pool 1 in our model for example several basins e g the upper mississippi river the missouri river ohio river and illinois river in north america are connected to the lower mississippi river our simulated system would be similar to one of these systems and ignored the main source population different methods could be used to model the origin source population the most ambitious of these would require a continental level model that includes the other basins however parameter estimates for such a system do not exist although parameterization efforts are underway monitoring and response workgroup 2017 simpler options could include either modeling the most downriver node as the source population and scaling it as such e g a node with a large population but low connectivity to the rest of the system or including a boundary condition on the most down river node that models the immigration and emigration of fish into the system the river simulations also demonstrated the utility of integrated pest management specifically our simulations with two stressors reduced the population in pool 4 more than the single stressors alone however preventing the spread of grass carp would likely be more effective with multiple stressors beyond the two included in our simulations for example the sea lamprey control program in the great lakes has used a combination of barriers sterile males pheromones and lampricides to manage lamprey populations and protect fish populations christie and goddard 2003 although the effectiveness of sterile males has be difficult to assess bravener and twohey 2016 besides examining two specific scenarios we developed and presented a spatially explicit ipm and demonstrated how it may be applied to resource management we designed our model to be flexible and readily adaptable to other life histories movement and migration patterns and control techniques for example our model readily allowed the inclusion of a new type of fish to be used as a control technique as well as the inclusion of traditional control tools such as harvest or deterrents although applied to fish species our model would also be readily adaptable to other species and management situations existing ipms could be placed into a spatial context examples include a model of trait distributions in wolves coulson et al 2011 an oyster model moore et al 2016 a plant seedbed model eager et al 2013 a dynamics energy budget model schreiber and ross 2016 a perennial herbs model ramula et al 2009 and a nile crocodile model wallace et al 2013 additionally we focused on applying our system to the control invasive species but our model could just as easily be applied to the conservation of declining species or management of game or fisheries species like many of the current applications of network node or fac models e g taylor and norris 2010 hostetler et al 2015 our model also demonstrated known behavior for network node models betini et al 2015 described a knock on effect where nodes not directly connected still impact other nodes in the system despite a connection only through the lake our lake model directly demonstrated this effect with management on one tributary affecting the other tributary the river pools case study also demonstrated the knock on effect because harvesting the lower pools were more effective at controlling the upper pool rather than directly harvesting the upper pools both of our systems also exhibited strong transient dynamics at the start of the simulations and after stocking stopped in the lake system these may be important if other stressors are used on the system or if our model did not capture important transient dynamics correctly ezard et al 2010 transient dynamics are important if other stressors are used because the other stressors may cause non linear impacts to the system in some systems where carp comprise a majority of the biomass e g irons et al 2007 releases from intraspecific competition could have major impacts on the system another reason transient dynamics could be important is that they can give managers the wrong feedback for example bains et al 2014 found that treating american chestnut trees likely causes a temporary demographic bump to the population due to transient dynamics but does not change the long term decline of the species hence the managers still need to be concerned about the species decline invasive carp managers might get similar confusing feedback from the system after treatment due to transient dynamics last our model highlights the possibility that complex network dynamics can cause unintended impacts elsewhere within the system being managed 5 conclusion we demonstrated the importance of size based models and source sink theory to invasive species modeling we specifically illustrated that harvesting source populations can be more important than those closet to the invasion front furthermore we also observed that size specific harvest can be important under some situations thus our findings demonstrate that when applying population modelings to guide integrated pest management both source sink theory and individual size distributions within populations can be important considerations author contributions rae programmed the model developed the network model and wrote the initial draft of

25194,recent research suggests that reservoirs might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere that is often unaccounted for in carbon cycle the authors developed an advanced model coupling eco hydrology with biogeochemical cycle nice bgc the model incorporates complex coupling of hydrologic carbon cycle in terrestrial aquatic linkages in this study nice bgc was further extended to apply to river basins to include the effect of 82 major reservoirs created by dams on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the model result showed the differences in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and vertical fluxes co2 evasion 76 6 tgc yr and carbon burial 45 0 tgc yr in presence of the reservoirs the model also calculated co2 evasion and carbon burial in global 82 reservoirs were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr further the result showed that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr these results are great improvements from previous research based on only field measurement because field measurements only accounted for emissions directly from the reservoirs and didn t evaluate total carbon cycle the model calculates the emission from the river downstream from the reservoirs in addition to the emission directly from the reservoirs therefore the total simulated co2 evasion increased not only in rivers with reservoirs but also in rivers downstream from reservoirs which implies the need to include field observations of emissions from rivers downstream from reservoirs to quantify the total emissions due to reservoirs in the future this finding provides valuable insights for re evaluation of carbon cycle change of the biosphere in reservoirs keywords reservoirs biogeochemical cycle eco hydrology coupling model 1 introduction previous studies about the carbon cycle have suggested that variability and uncertainty in the biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial ecosystems are larger than those in the atmosphere and ocean le quere et al 2009 and that the terrestrial biosphere absorbs more co2 by sequestration than the ocean but the largest component of the carbon dioxide co2 emissions stays in the atmosphere raupach 2011 some recent studies have pointed out that inland waters including rivers lakes and groundwater may act as a gigantic transport pathway for both water and dissolved substances and play a globally significant role in continental biogeochemical cycling the so called boundless carbon cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 a comprehensive analysis has revealed a global co2 evasion degassing rate of 2 1 pgc year from inland waters rivers and lakes raymond et al 2013 which is much higher than previous estimates of 1 2 pgc year aufdenkampe et al 2011 and 1 4 pgc year tranvik et al 2009 and also predicted global hotspots in which 70 per cent of the flux occurs over just 20 per cent of the land surface recently lauerwald et al 2015 also reported a global distribution of co2 evasion similar to that reported by raymond et al 2013 while the partial pressure of co2 and methane ch4 in water pco2 and pch4 are necessary for evaluation of co2 and ch4 flux to the atmosphere evasion dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and particulate organic carbon poc are also important for evaluation of co2 flux to the ocean 0 9 pgc year and sediment storage 0 6 pgc year in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 in spite of these previous studies the contribution of inland waters to continental scale carbon cycling has remained uncertain because it is generally more difficult to measure and the available data for global aquatic ecosystems are fewer and more locally site specific than those for terrestrial ecosystems cole et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 in particular inland waters may play a significant role in the sequestration transport and mineralization of carbon battin et al 2009 which would be further complicated by surface groundwater interactions around wetland and riparian areas where complex water movement drives carbon storage and flux furthermore because the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon are tightly coupled with each other owing to the metabolic needs of organisms for these two elements co2 ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o amount to 80 of the total radiative forcing from well mixed greenhouse gases ghgs ciais et al 2013 settele et al 2014 these previous studies have indicated that estimates of emissions are variable or biased and sometimes increased or reduced depending on various conditions related to nutrients water depth doc chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen from this viewpoint it is very important to develop a process oriented model that is conserved in water heat carbon nitrogen and phosphorus budgets this would help to clarify the mechanism of the carbon cycle in more detail particularly the interplay between inorganic and organic carbon and its relationship to nitrogen and phosphorus and biogeochemical processes the vast majority of co2 and ch4 emissions are usually related to natural cycles but changes in land use hydraulic modifications anthropogenic emissions and climatic change also have significant effects on the carbon cycle through water pollution hydrologic change and co2 concentration in the atmosphere etc regnier et al 2013 in particular some recent research has suggested that reservoirs created by dams fig 1 lehner and döll 2004 might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere in addition to providing a variety of services such as hydropower flood control navigation irrigation recreation and water supply and negative impacts on fish migration and other riverine biota st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 barros et al 2011 estimated that hydroelectric reservoirs emit about 48 tgc yr as co2 and 3 tgc yr as ch4 corresponding to 4 of global carbon emissions from inland waters these values are similar to those estimated by deemer et al 2016 36 8 tgc yr as co2 and hertwich 2013 76 tgc yr as co2 whereas they are much smaller than those estimated by cole et al 2007 280 tgc yr as co2 and st louis et al 2000 270 tgc yr as co2 sediment processes in reservoirs are also important in the carbon cycle including burial 90 4 tgc yr as well as the emission of ch4 mendonça et al 2012 some other studies also showed this carbon burial has a range of 100 300 tgc yr depending on the reservoir age type and water temperature etc mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 cole et al 2007 clow et al 2015 except some scattering values estimated by maavara et al 2017 26 2 tgc yr and st louis et al 2000 600 tgc yr nakayama 2014 2015 developed the national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model which takes into account complex interactions between the forest canopy surface water the unsaturated zone aquifers lakes and rivers nice incorporates a three dimensional groundwater sub model and is able to simulate lateral transport of groundwater in addition to surface runoff nice was further developed to couple it with five biogeochemical cycle models including those for terrestrial ecosystems those for water quality in aquatic ecosystems and those for carbon weathering the revised nice model nice bgc incorporates the connectivity of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles accompanied by the hydrologic cycle between surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions nakayama 2016 2017a the model simulates both horizontal transport to the ocean and vertical fluxes and includes aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together in major rivers without the presence of reservoirs which is a potential improvement from the previous studies cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 in this study nice bgc was further extended to apply to river basins including the effect of control structures on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles there are three basic science questions as follows i how do reservoirs influence land carbon sink dynamics and carbon dynamics in inland waters ii how do reservoirs change the relative importance of land ocean interactions to land atmosphere interactions i e the land carbon sink on global carbon dynamics and iii how do reservoirs change the composition of carbon i e doc dic poc exported to oceans from land the model result could show the presence of dams affected the changes in horizontal carbon transport and vertical fluxes separately whereas previous research was generally based on only field measurements only accounted for emissions directly from the reservoirs and didn t evaluate total carbon cycle in each component in this way a benefit of process based model is that changes in carbon fluxes can be related to changes in the rates of various simulated ecosystem processes to provide reasons for the simulated changes in carbon fluxes based on the model assumptions and potentially provide new useful insights because the number of large hydroelectric dams is expected to double in the next 15 20 years except some cases of dam decommissioning in the united states deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 it is urgently necessary to quantify the impact of river damming on the carbon cycle change by using a robust hybrid modeling from the view point of carbon linkage between land and aquatic systems this coupled simulation approach is also important for re evaluation of the biosphere greenhouse gas budget quantification of hot spots in the biogeochemical cycle associated with hydraulic modifications and bridging the gap between the top down satellite data and atmospheric inverse modeling and bottom up site level observations and process based modeling approaches cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 frei et al 2012 regnier et al 2013 kiel and cardenas 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 process based nice model the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2014 2015 surface hydrology submodel land surface submodel including urban and crop processes groundwater submodel regional atmospheric submodel mass transport submodel for constituents in sediment and water and vegetation succession submodel the model also includes surface groundwater interactions assimilating land surface processes to describe variations of leaf area index lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar derived from satellite data lai and fpar are important parameters for evaluating vegetation growth nakayama and watanabe 2004 2 2 coupling nice with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc in order to fill the gap in the current eco hydrology nakayama 2016 2017a has recently coupled the original nice framework with various biogeochemical cycle models including those for terrestrial ecosystems such as lpjwhyme lund potsdam jena wetland hydrology and methane wania et al 2010 those for water quality in aquatic ecosystems such as qual2kw pelletier et al 2006 and swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 those for carbon weathering such as rokgem rock geochemical model colbourn et al 2013 and co2sys co2 system calculations lewis and wallance 1998 fig 2 and appendix a in the modified nice model nice bgc all submodels were coupled together with the original nice to conserve the carbon budget nakayama 2016 2017a each submodel offers iterative simulation in the most efficient way by combining on line and off line modes the newly coupled model incorporates the connectivity of the biogeochemical cycle and the hydrologic cycle for surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions fig 2 and appendix a nakayama 2017a including several modifications of the original versions of the submodels 1 1 the original model lpjwhyme v1 3 1 was modified to input more accurately the results for groundwater level surface runoff and evapotranspiration simulated by the original nice at every time step swat swat2012 rev 637 was used only to simulate diffuse sources of hydrologic and pollutant loads from the upland watershed and groundwater qual2kw qual2kw60b06a01 xlsm for streams water quality modeling as described in the following the original model rokgem v0 9 was modified to input more accurate results for land temperature and runoff simulated by nice and for npp net primary production simulated by the revised lpjwhyme respectively at every time step the revised rokgem simulates alkalinity and dic in relatively deep groundwater of other terrestrial ecosystems where the soil type is not organic and these values are also automatically converted to pco2 and ph using the revised co2sys the original qual2kw was modified to input automatically a time series of lateral sources from hillslope runoff and groundwater simulated by the revised versions of lpjwhyme swat rokgem and co2sys v2 1 in each channel these modifications improved the accuracy of the simulated weathering fluxes of alkalinity and dic which were input to the revised co2sys simulation as described in the following the integration of submodels enables the nice bgc to be a process oriented biogeochemical cycle model of human nature coupled phenomena including mechanisms of transport mineralization sequestration of carbon in terrestrial aquatic linkages interplay between inorganic and organic carbon doc poc dic pco2 etc and its relationship to nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus chemical weathering food chains in aquatic ecosystems photosynthesis and respiration of phytoplankton bottom algae and detritus degassing of supersaturated co2 particularly in lakes and the upstream stretches of rivers ch4 emission to the atmosphere sensitively affected by groundwater level in wetlands and paddy fields fertilizer application to agricultural fields pollutant loading from urban areas co2 and ch4 emissions from reservoirs and bottom sediments and doc poc and dic efflux to the ocean therefore the nice bgc framework is able to separate more clearly the carbon sources of inland waters from the terrestrial carbon sink nakayama 2017a b whereas most previous research on conventional carbon cycling has generally overestimated the accumulation of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and underestimated the potential for lateral export of carbon from land to rivers raupach 2011 2 3 effect of control structures on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles control structures such as weirs dams reservoirs locks and waterfalls affect the change in hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the major changes to the source and sink terms for organic and inorganic carbon due to control structures are the following i increased uptake of co2 for increased production of organic carbon by phytoplankton due to decreased water velocity and longer hydraulic residence times in reservoirs compared with free flowing rivers ii increased sequestration of organic carbon due to increased deep burial of organic carbon deposited in reservoirs compared with free flowing rivers this might be the main reason why reservoirs lead to greater net loss of carbon from the air and water compartments iii increased mass transfer of co2 between air and water due to entrainment with the drop in water surface elevation at the control structure leading to increased dic in river reaches located downstream from reservoirs iv the longer residence times in reservoirs would lead to increased oxidation of ch4 respiration leading to increased dic in the water column of the reservoirs in particular co2 gas transfer in streams is influenced by the presence of control structures and the following formula holds similarly to dissolved oxygen pelletier et al 2006 1 r d 1 0 38 a d b d h d 1 0 11 h d 1 0 046 t w a t e r

sources and sinks of the constituent due to reactions and mass transfer mechanisms g m3 d or mg m3 d co2 s i 1 the saturation concentration of carbon dioxide mole l and α0 α1 α2 the fraction of total inorganic carbon in dissolved co2 bicarbonate and carbonate about the rationale for influence of reservoirs on doc poc and nutrients etc whether reservoirs would increase or decrease organic carbon is more complicated than inorganic carbon it is difficult to generalize whether reservoirs would either increase or decrease poc or doc because each reservoir would be different in the balance of factors that would change the doc and poc concentrations so the authors used the same partial differential equations for the derivatives either with or without the reservoirs except for the extra reaeration effect of the dams after solving dic concentration as mass balance in eqs 1 3 so these sets of partial differential equations include implicitly the effect of reservoirs on both organic and inorganic carbon and nutrients these modifications mean primary production in reservoirs consumes inorganic carbon and available forms of nutrients no3 and srp and produces organic carbon in algae cells when algae die they contribute to detrital poc when algae and detritus settle to the bottom a portion of the settled organic carbon is sequestered by deep burial some of the poc is converted to doc and oxidized through heterotrophic respiration releasing dic the above equations also mean that hydrologic and carbon cycle change by the effect of control structures such as reservoirs fig 2 2 4 model input data and boundary conditions six hour re analyzed data for downward radiation precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature air humidity wind speed cloud cover fpar and lai were input to the original nice after interpolation of the ecmwf reanalysis interim product era interim european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf 2013 in inverse proportion to the distance back calculated in each grid these meteorological data were used to calculate daily averaged values and then input to nice bgc in addition to land temperature evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater level simulated by nice fig 2 the input data for the global simulation were prepared and arranged by using arcgis v10 1 software table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type river networks lakes and wetlands reservoir types and storage and geological structures were categorized on the basis of the global digital elevation model dem gtopo30 u s geological survey 1996a

kump 1994 respectively in particular nice bgc simulated only the major rivers in the world 153 basins watersheds 325 river channels some of which 82 major dams were located fig 1 by inputting the information about dam location height width and type etc of grand lehner et al 2011 fig 2 and table 1 agricultural regions of glc2000 were subdivided into 17 major crops of 26 crop classes for both irrigated and rain fed crops in mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 corresponding to the crop commodity classifications and definitions reported previously leff et al 2004 global map of irrigation areas gmia fao 2016 were applied to decide the irrigation type surface water groundwater and other and global crop water model gcwm siebert and döll 2010 to decide irrigation water use total fertilizer consumptions nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for earth stat mueller et al 2012 were used to calculate the average fertilizer consumptions for each crop by using arcgis software to merge it with mirca2000 in each 5 arc minute grid 10 km furthermore the anisotropy ratio α and hydraulic conductivity kh m h were based on soil texture class and the ranges in these parameters were α 2 48 and kh 0 088 1 267 m h respectively permeability was assumed to decrease exponentially with the ratio of depth to e folding length a function of the slope fan et al 2013 which means higher permeability was assumed in thicker soil on a shallower slope 2 5 running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction for the hillslope hydrology flow depth discharge and other water concentrations on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation in order to calculate these boundaries the author firstly used gtopo30 to calculate each basin boundary at 1 km 1 km resolution and then calculated 1 1 grid by using arcgis v10 1 software for the model simulation water temperature in the uppermost boundary of each river was calculated as an exponential function of daily averaged air temperature yearsley 2012 inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads at the sea boundary a constant head was set at 0 m details are described in the previous papers nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama 2015 nice simulation of eco hydrological process was performed at 1 x1 resolution in the horizontal direction and into 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner at the upper layer to thicker at the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 5 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m from the sea surface the model simulates river network among elements and terrestrial ecosystem in grid cells then the contribution of river on grid cell was estimated by calculating area ratio of river multiplication of river width and length in each grid so the model is conserved in water heat carbon nitrogen and phosphorus budgets details about the models set up and sensitivity analysis are described in the author s previous papers nakayama 2014 2015 though the model simulated only the major rivers 322 rivers in the world the hydrologic and carbon cycles were simulated within the range of previous observed data nakayama 2016 2017a nakayama 2017b simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1998 1999 after a 1 year warm up period until a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated in terms of hydrologic geomorphic and ecological aspects as detailed in nakayama 2014 2015 nice bgc simulation for terrestrial ecosystem was conducted at the same spatial resolution with a time step of δt 1 day for the same period by inputting some of the results land temperature surface runoff and groundwater level simulated by nice iteratively after calculating the daily averaged data from 6 hourly data then nice bgc simulation for aquatic ecosystem was conducted with more smaller time step between δt 0 044 min and 0 70 min for the stability of the model in particular spin up in the revised rokgem was conducted for much longer periods of 20 000 years under control conditions no emissions to allow complete equilibration of silicate weathering versus co2 outgassing and carbon isotopes being much longer than the periods used in other submodels such as 1000 years in the revised lpjwhyme wania et al 2010 and 6 months in the revised swat and qual2kw the author s previous papers nakayama 2016 2017a have already showed a reasonable agreement within the range of previous observed data in annual averaged river discharge horizontal carbon fluxes toc doc poc and dic and vertical flux co2 evasion and sediment storage in the global major rivers without the presence of reservoirs details about the nice bgc set up and calibration validation processes are described in the author s previous papers nakayama 2016 2017a further the author conducted the long term simulation during 1980 2010 without the presence of reservoirs for a few river basins to compare with available data in glorich database hartman et al 2014 as much as possible table 2 indicates statistical values of r 2 rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns to show quantitative measures of model performance with regard to reproducing the seasonality and inter annual variability in carbon fluxes the table showed statistical values in rivers with ten or more of measured data before the construction of reservoirs in order to guarantee the reliability of the data the statistical values show the model can reproduce the seasonality and inter annual variability of carbon fluxes for some river basins with a relatively high performance based on these verification processes in the global major rivers without reservoirs the author conducted a simulation with the presence of reservoirs fig 1 and table 1 through calibration validation processes below in this study 3 results 3 1 effect of reservoirs on differences in horizontal carbon transports nakayama 2017a showed that nice bgc could simulate both horizontal transports export from land to inland water of 2 01 1 98 pgc yr and export to the ocean of 1 13 0 50 pgc yr and vertical fluxes degassing 0 79 0 38 pgc yr and sediment storage 0 20 0 09 pgc yr in major rivers without the presence of reservoirs in good agreement with previous research table 3 fig 3 shows spatial distribution of simulated horizontal carbon flux differences downstream of a river in each basin with and without the presence of reservoirs shown in fig 1 the simulated results show the global difference with and without dams in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and indicate that horizontal carbon flux into the ocean generally decreases in the presence of reservoir correlated with height of the reservoir beusen et al 2005 estimated global river export of sediments total suspended solids tss and organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus transported as particulate matter poc pn and pp associated with sediments by using a multiple linear regression model in particular they showed poc export changes from 226 tgc yr to 197 tgc yr without and with sediment trapping in regulated basins the presence of dam affects a decrease in horizontal carbon transport simulated by the model 1 00 0 40 pgc yr table 3 and this was also supported by their previous study fig 4 shows difference between simulated horizontal carbon fluxes without and with reservoirs because the reservoir storage amount becomes greater as the discharge increases due to the effectiveness of hydropower flood control navigation and water supply the transported carbon flux decreases with the increase of both the discharge and the reservoir height dic and poc fluxes are smaller variable ratio 0 826 and 0 847 with reservoirs than toc and doc variable ratio 0 972 and 0 974 because more carbon is trapped in the sediment of reservoirs this result shows reservoirs cause the transformation of carbon among the components of doc poc and dic maavara et al 2017 that decreased water velocity and longer hydraulic residence times in reservoirs might promote an increased uptake of co2 for increased production of organic carbon by phytoplankton and that increased deep burial of organic carbon deposited in reservoirs might accelerate an increased sequestration of organic carbon total phosphorus concentration might also increase greatly by being trapped in the sediment at the reservoirs which could contribute to eutrophication harrison et al 2010 the model result showed that consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of total horizontal carbon flux at river mouths in comparison with field measurements at these locations table 3 3 2 effect of reservoirs on differences in co2 evasion and carbon burial fig 5 shows simulated vertical flux of co2 evasion and sediment storage without and with reservoirs the vertical flux generally increases in the presence of reservoir affected by the magnitude height of reservoir fig 5a b in an opposite way compared with the horizontal carbon transports toc doc poc and dic flux in figs 3 and 4 the difference can be seen more clearly in the comparison of vertical flux in the same rivers in fig 5c d which implies the flux increases not only in a river with a reservoir but also in a river downstream of reservoir this effect is more pronounced in co2 evasion than in sediment storage and it can be seen that co2 evasion increases even in a river downstream of reservoir as observed by previous studies guérin et al 2006 yang et al 2014 simulated global differences in co2 evasion and carbon burial in the presence of reservoir were 76 6 tgc yr about 9 6 change as a percentage median value 42 4 tgc yr the 25th percentile 2 2 tgc yr and the 75th percentile 132 3 tgc yr and 45 0 tgc yr about 22 5 change median value 26 0 tgc yr the 25th percentile 3 2 tgc yr and the 75th percentile 78 1 tgc yr which implies the vertical flux increases are global in scale the model result showed that consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of sediment storage somewhat in comparison with field measurements 0 24 0 13 pgc yr but co2 evasion was over estimated with the presence of reservoirs 0 87 0 47 pgc yr table 3 because the above changes were different from the carbon fluxes in the reservoirs carbon fluxes at major 82 reservoirs were estimated by multiplying the simulated carbon flux per unit area by the surface area of grand database lehner et al 2011 fig 6 shows a comparison of co2 evasion in the major reservoirs created by dams between previous studies barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 and the nice bgc simulation the spatial distribution of co2 evasion is relatively similar compared with previous studies particularly the relatively large flux in south america fig 6a b fig 6c shows that the simulated flux agrees well compared with the observed data from the same locations in previous studies with high correlation cor 0 846 barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 though the observed value is more heterogeneously affected by the local conditions e g seasonality surface area reservoir age latitude water temperature and water quality table 4 shows a comparison of co2 evasion and carbon burial in global reservoirs between simulated values compared with previous studies mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 raymond et al 2013 yang et al 2014 clow et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 the simulated results of total co2 evasion and carbon burial were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr which were generally in the range of 21 8 280 tgc yr and 26 2 600 tgc yr from human made freshwater systems in the previous compiled data 4 discussion 4 1 impact of reservoirs on carbon cycle changes the result showed consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of global carbon flux in comparison with previous studies table 3 horizontal carbon transport generally decreased in the presence of reservoir correlated with discharge and dam height figs 3 and 4 more carbon is trapped in some regions such as the ganges nile zambezi parana columbia ob and yenisei rivers actually whether reservoirs would increase or decrease organic c is more complicated than the decrease in inorganic c as described in the eqs 1 3 figs 3 and 4 some reservoirs could result in a net increase in organic c because the increased production by phytoplankton could exceed the increased sedimentation rate other reservoirs could result in net decrease in organic c if the net of increased settling exceeds the increased production so each reservoir would be different in the balance of factors that would change the doc and poc concentrations this carbon transport is also related to land use soil and geological structures although the vertical carbon flux of co2 evasion and carbon burial simulated by nice bgc agreed well with the range of previous data in global scale table 4 mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 the simulated results were rather scattered in some regions in regional scale fig 6 and table 4 co2 evasion and carbon burial estimated by some studies mulholland and elwood 1982 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 were over estimated because they included the flux from not only hydroelectric reservoirs but also lakes and other human made freshwater systems e g energy generation irrigation and water supply systems the vertical flux also depends on local conditions e g seasonal water elevation and temperature surface area of reservoirs reservoir age and trophic state barros et al 2011 and more importantly the model result showed the horizontal fluxes decreased and conversely the vertical flux increased with dams which is supported by the fact that the model is conserved in carbon budget figs 3 and 4 in particular the model result showed co2 evasion was only about 5 2 but carbon burial was about 36 1 of those in river without dam which implies the importance of the effect of dam on sediment storage change table 4 it is necessary to improve the spatial coverage of flux measurements from many regions including south america africa eurasia and australia et al in order to verify the simulated results in global scale deemer et al 2016 it is also important to provide some temporal trends of carbon cycle for long term periods such as 20 50 years with the presence of reservoirs the previous study showed the carbon cycle changes depending on the reservoir age barros et al 2011 because nice bgc is a too complicated modeling system it takes a huge time to simulate for long term periods it is a future work to evaluate temporal trends of carbon cycle for long term periods the model simulated global net land flux with the presence of reservoirs and compared with previous data table 5 simulated value without the presence of reservoirs in the author s previous paper nakayama 2017a was also shown nice bgc conserves carbon budget strictly and the model simulates photosynthetic uptake of co2 groundwater with co2 rich flowing to the stream and ch4 uptake sensitive to soil temperature and moisture etc whether co2 and ch4 become uptake or emission depends on the difference of pco2 and pch4 between water and air so the model includes explicitly the effect of inland water on land carbon flux with and without the presence of reservoirs which provides potential new insights the result shows that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr nakayama 2017a while most previous studies estimated co2 ch4 and n2o emissions within the reservoirs upstream of dams there are several other emission pathways e g drawdown emissions downstream emissions emissions from decomposing wood and emissions from dam spillways and turbines abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 2011 wehrli 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 the difference of carbon flux simulated by nice bgc includes not only co2 emission within the reservoirs but also downstream emissions implicitly fig 5 because the ratio of the deficit above and below the dam is calculated as the function of the drop in water elevation over the control structures in the eqs 1 3 guérin et al 2006 estimated rivers downstream of dams accounted for a significant fraction of the emissions 9 33 for ch4 and 7 25 for co2 across the reservoir surfaces in three tropical reservoirs because rivers downstream of dams are significantly enriched in ch4 and co2 originating from the hypolimnion of reservoirs yang et al 2014 also summarized the previous studies of diffusive flux bubbling flux degassing and downstream river fluxes and showed the relative importance of downstream emissions in some tropical reservoirs it is important to consider all emission pathways not only the processes within the reservoirs in order to clarify the mechanisms of biogeochemical cycling and to quantify the total emissions from the reservoirs anyway the simulated result in the present paper is supported by previous studies indicating that the terrestrial co2 sink might become further smaller than thought so far as the models incorporates the effect of reservoirs cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 it is further necessary to include all emission pathways and various types of reservoirs in the model and evaluate not only co2 but also ch4 and n2o in the future st louis et al 2000 abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2006 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 maeck et al 2013 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 4 2 effect of water quality on carbon cycle changes harrison et al 2010 evaluated the effect of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip yields on carbon cycle change and showed the dip yield with dams is over threefold higher than the global average dip yield it is possible that a large number of reservoirs in the world are highly productive nutrient rich and support high ch4 emission rates deemer et al 2016 fig 7 shows water quality in the presence of reservoirs simulated by nice bgc with a comparison of water temperature and dip yield in the major reservoirs from previous studies harrison et al 2010 deemer et al 2016 and nice bgc simulation though the model assumes that dams release depth averaged water and concentrations as described in the eqs 1 3 we can see a reasonable correlation between nice bgc results and previous studies for water temperature cor 0 613 figs 7a b and e the model simulated depth averaged and annually averaged temperature whereas most of previous observations reported surface water temperature data collection during the limited sampling day usually only in the daytime and non flood season this means that the current model can t simulate the dam release water from the hypolimnion of reservoirs which often contain waters with cooler temperatures and larger concentrations of co2 and ch4 guérin et al 2006 and that it is a future work to decrease the uncertainty of water temperature to simulate the vertical distribution of water temperature in the reservoir there was also a linear relation between nice bgc and previous studies for dip yield though the correlation was relatively low cor 0 137 fig 7c d and f this result implies that the total phosphorus concentration increases greatly in the presence of reservoir due to sediment trapping in reservoirs and that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the simulated result in the vertical direction in addition to gathering more observation data the previous data about co2 evasion and carbon burial are in the broad range and imply the uncertainties are large table 4 the is also related to the difference of definitions in each paper the extrapolation from some local point data to global budget and their analyses are usually not conserved in carbon budget the simulated result in this paper also shows the uncertainties are large table 4 in comparison with the author s previous paper without considering the influence of reservoirs on inland water carbon dynamics nakayama 2017a this implies the effect of reservoirs on even the direction of changes in carbon fluxes vary from basin to basin across the globe as influenced by various factors such as land use soil and geological structures etc there it is a future work to conduct and compile detailed field observations of carbon cycle change in the flow direction in the entire river basin including the different types of reservoirs in order to reduce the uncertainties of the model as much as possible the present model didn t include the areal reduction of upland vegetation by the creation of reservoirs because the area of reservoirs is much smaller than the land area and this is in the range of uncertainty in the simulation of 1 1 grid so this study assumed that the land carbon sink and the terrestrial loading of doc dic and poc to inland waters were same with and without reservoirs didn t simulate the difference of carbon stored on land between with and without the presence of reservoirs and only evaluated the difference in carbon burial co2 evasion and the export of transported doc dic and poc to oceans with and without reservoirs table 3 however the result implied the changes in ecosystem processes such as instream photosynthesis consumption decomposition and burial of particulate organic carbon poc the uptake and release of carbon dioxide oxygen and methane along with its distribution in the water column and dissolved organic carbon doc dynamics it is necessary to include the effects of changes in terrestrial loading on inland water and carbon dynamics by using the finer resolution or in the regional study further this study does not present all of the sources and sinks that are computed though nice bgc conserves carbon budget strictly the authors discussed about the vertical fluxes of only co2 evasion and deposition of organic c the vertical carbon fluxes are conserved as the sum of ch4 gas bubble gaseous co2 and ch4 burial flux of poc etc in addition to co2 evasion and sediment storage from this viewpoint these other terms are missing for the analysis in this paper however it is reasonable to assume these are minor contributions for carbon budget as the first approximation it would be a lot of additional work and the future direction to present a complete budget of all of the computed sources and sinks of organic and inorganic carbon in order to improve the simulated results of the carbon cycle in reservoirs figs 6 and 7 and table 4 we also need to compare model predictions not only with high quality measurements of the carbon budget on the regional local scale particularly in zero order and first order streams lynch et al 2010 but also with data from global monitoring programmes for assessment of environmental conditions and changes melack 2011 use of this improved model would also help to clarify more robustly the partitioning between natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes in freshwater systems ciais et al 2013 5 conclusions the new process based model nice bgc was extended to apply to river basins to include the effect of 82 major reservoirs created by dams on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the model simulated both horizontal transport to the ocean and vertical fluxes in the extension of the author s previous work and included aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together in major rivers which was a potential improvement from previous studies the comparisons of global carbon flux in major basins vertical flux in major reservoirs and net flux in lands showed nice bgc agreed with reality within the scope of the limited data the model results showed the differences in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and vertical fluxes co2 evasion 76 6 tgc yr and carbon burial 45 0 tgc yr in the presence of reservoirs on a global scale the model also calculated co2 evasion and carbon burial in global 82 reservoirs were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr which was generally in the range of previous compiled data describing human made freshwater systems further the result showed that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr these results are great improvements from the previous studies of the emission from the reservoirs based on only a field measurement because the model calculated not only the emission within the reservoirs but also downstream emissions implicitly it is reasonable that the total simulated co2 evasion was over estimated with the presence of reservoirs the result also implies the need to include field observations of emissions from rivers downstream from reservoirs in order to quantify the total emissions due to reservoirs as the future work this finding indicated that reservoirs might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and might help to reduce the uncertainty ranges of the carbon cycle in inland waters by

25194,recent research suggests that reservoirs might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere that is often unaccounted for in carbon cycle the authors developed an advanced model coupling eco hydrology with biogeochemical cycle nice bgc the model incorporates complex coupling of hydrologic carbon cycle in terrestrial aquatic linkages in this study nice bgc was further extended to apply to river basins to include the effect of 82 major reservoirs created by dams on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the model result showed the differences in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and vertical fluxes co2 evasion 76 6 tgc yr and carbon burial 45 0 tgc yr in presence of the reservoirs the model also calculated co2 evasion and carbon burial in global 82 reservoirs were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr further the result showed that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr these results are great improvements from previous research based on only field measurement because field measurements only accounted for emissions directly from the reservoirs and didn t evaluate total carbon cycle the model calculates the emission from the river downstream from the reservoirs in addition to the emission directly from the reservoirs therefore the total simulated co2 evasion increased not only in rivers with reservoirs but also in rivers downstream from reservoirs which implies the need to include field observations of emissions from rivers downstream from reservoirs to quantify the total emissions due to reservoirs in the future this finding provides valuable insights for re evaluation of carbon cycle change of the biosphere in reservoirs keywords reservoirs biogeochemical cycle eco hydrology coupling model 1 introduction previous studies about the carbon cycle have suggested that variability and uncertainty in the biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial ecosystems are larger than those in the atmosphere and ocean le quere et al 2009 and that the terrestrial biosphere absorbs more co2 by sequestration than the ocean but the largest component of the carbon dioxide co2 emissions stays in the atmosphere raupach 2011 some recent studies have pointed out that inland waters including rivers lakes and groundwater may act as a gigantic transport pathway for both water and dissolved substances and play a globally significant role in continental biogeochemical cycling the so called boundless carbon cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 a comprehensive analysis has revealed a global co2 evasion degassing rate of 2 1 pgc year from inland waters rivers and lakes raymond et al 2013 which is much higher than previous estimates of 1 2 pgc year aufdenkampe et al 2011 and 1 4 pgc year tranvik et al 2009 and also predicted global hotspots in which 70 per cent of the flux occurs over just 20 per cent of the land surface recently lauerwald et al 2015 also reported a global distribution of co2 evasion similar to that reported by raymond et al 2013 while the partial pressure of co2 and methane ch4 in water pco2 and pch4 are necessary for evaluation of co2 and ch4 flux to the atmosphere evasion dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and particulate organic carbon poc are also important for evaluation of co2 flux to the ocean 0 9 pgc year and sediment storage 0 6 pgc year in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 in spite of these previous studies the contribution of inland waters to continental scale carbon cycling has remained uncertain because it is generally more difficult to measure and the available data for global aquatic ecosystems are fewer and more locally site specific than those for terrestrial ecosystems cole et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 in particular inland waters may play a significant role in the sequestration transport and mineralization of carbon battin et al 2009 which would be further complicated by surface groundwater interactions around wetland and riparian areas where complex water movement drives carbon storage and flux furthermore because the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon are tightly coupled with each other owing to the metabolic needs of organisms for these two elements co2 ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o amount to 80 of the total radiative forcing from well mixed greenhouse gases ghgs ciais et al 2013 settele et al 2014 these previous studies have indicated that estimates of emissions are variable or biased and sometimes increased or reduced depending on various conditions related to nutrients water depth doc chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen from this viewpoint it is very important to develop a process oriented model that is conserved in water heat carbon nitrogen and phosphorus budgets this would help to clarify the mechanism of the carbon cycle in more detail particularly the interplay between inorganic and organic carbon and its relationship to nitrogen and phosphorus and biogeochemical processes the vast majority of co2 and ch4 emissions are usually related to natural cycles but changes in land use hydraulic modifications anthropogenic emissions and climatic change also have significant effects on the carbon cycle through water pollution hydrologic change and co2 concentration in the atmosphere etc regnier et al 2013 in particular some recent research has suggested that reservoirs created by dams fig 1 lehner and döll 2004 might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere in addition to providing a variety of services such as hydropower flood control navigation irrigation recreation and water supply and negative impacts on fish migration and other riverine biota st louis et al 2000 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 barros et al 2011 estimated that hydroelectric reservoirs emit about 48 tgc yr as co2 and 3 tgc yr as ch4 corresponding to 4 of global carbon emissions from inland waters these values are similar to those estimated by deemer et al 2016 36 8 tgc yr as co2 and hertwich 2013 76 tgc yr as co2 whereas they are much smaller than those estimated by cole et al 2007 280 tgc yr as co2 and st louis et al 2000 270 tgc yr as co2 sediment processes in reservoirs are also important in the carbon cycle including burial 90 4 tgc yr as well as the emission of ch4 mendonça et al 2012 some other studies also showed this carbon burial has a range of 100 300 tgc yr depending on the reservoir age type and water temperature etc mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 cole et al 2007 clow et al 2015 except some scattering values estimated by maavara et al 2017 26 2 tgc yr and st louis et al 2000 600 tgc yr nakayama 2014 2015 developed the national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model which takes into account complex interactions between the forest canopy surface water the unsaturated zone aquifers lakes and rivers nice incorporates a three dimensional groundwater sub model and is able to simulate lateral transport of groundwater in addition to surface runoff nice was further developed to couple it with five biogeochemical cycle models including those for terrestrial ecosystems those for water quality in aquatic ecosystems and those for carbon weathering the revised nice model nice bgc incorporates the connectivity of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles accompanied by the hydrologic cycle between surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions nakayama 2016 2017a the model simulates both horizontal transport to the ocean and vertical fluxes and includes aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together in major rivers without the presence of reservoirs which is a potential improvement from the previous studies cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 in this study nice bgc was further extended to apply to river basins including the effect of control structures on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles there are three basic science questions as follows i how do reservoirs influence land carbon sink dynamics and carbon dynamics in inland waters ii how do reservoirs change the relative importance of land ocean interactions to land atmosphere interactions i e the land carbon sink on global carbon dynamics and iii how do reservoirs change the composition of carbon i e doc dic poc exported to oceans from land the model result could show the presence of dams affected the changes in horizontal carbon transport and vertical fluxes separately whereas previous research was generally based on only field measurements only accounted for emissions directly from the reservoirs and didn t evaluate total carbon cycle in each component in this way a benefit of process based model is that changes in carbon fluxes can be related to changes in the rates of various simulated ecosystem processes to provide reasons for the simulated changes in carbon fluxes based on the model assumptions and potentially provide new useful insights because the number of large hydroelectric dams is expected to double in the next 15 20 years except some cases of dam decommissioning in the united states deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 it is urgently necessary to quantify the impact of river damming on the carbon cycle change by using a robust hybrid modeling from the view point of carbon linkage between land and aquatic systems this coupled simulation approach is also important for re evaluation of the biosphere greenhouse gas budget quantification of hot spots in the biogeochemical cycle associated with hydraulic modifications and bridging the gap between the top down satellite data and atmospheric inverse modeling and bottom up site level observations and process based modeling approaches cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 frei et al 2012 regnier et al 2013 kiel and cardenas 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 process based nice model the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2014

biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc in order to fill the gap in the current eco hydrology nakayama 2016 2017a has recently coupled the original nice framework with various biogeochemical cycle models including those for terrestrial ecosystems such as lpjwhyme lund potsdam jena wetland hydrology and methane wania et al 2010 those for water quality in aquatic ecosystems such as qual2kw pelletier et al 2006 and swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 those for carbon weathering such as rokgem rock geochemical model colbourn et al 2013 and co2sys co2 system calculations lewis and wallance 1998 fig 2 and appendix a in the modified nice model nice bgc all submodels were coupled together with the original nice to conserve the carbon budget nakayama 2016 2017a each submodel offers iterative simulation in the most efficient way by combining on line and off line modes the newly coupled model incorporates the connectivity of the biogeochemical cycle and the hydrologic cycle for surface water and groundwater hillslopes and river networks and other intermediate regions fig 2 and appendix a nakayama 2017a including several modifications of the original versions of the submodels 1 1 the original model lpjwhyme v1 3 1 was modified to input more accurately the results for groundwater level surface runoff and evapotranspiration simulated by the original nice at every time step swat swat2012 rev 637 was used only to simulate diffuse sources of hydrologic and pollutant loads from the upland watershed and groundwater qual2kw qual2kw60b06a01 xlsm for streams water quality modeling as described in the following the original model rokgem v0 9 was modified to input more accurate results for land temperature and runoff simulated by nice and for npp net primary production simulated by the revised lpjwhyme respectively at every time step the revised rokgem simulates alkalinity and dic in relatively deep groundwater of other terrestrial ecosystems where the soil type is not organic and these values are also automatically converted to pco2 and ph using the revised co2sys the original qual2kw was modified to input automatically a time series of lateral sources from hillslope runoff and groundwater simulated by the revised versions of lpjwhyme swat rokgem and co2sys v2 1 in each channel these modifications improved the accuracy of the simulated weathering fluxes of alkalinity and dic which were input to the revised co2sys simulation as described in the following the integration of submodels enables the nice bgc to be a process oriented biogeochemical cycle model of human nature coupled phenomena including mechanisms of transport mineralization sequestration of carbon in terrestrial aquatic linkages interplay between inorganic and organic carbon doc poc dic pco2 etc and its relationship to nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus chemical weathering food chains in aquatic ecosystems photosynthesis and respiration of phytoplankton bottom algae and detritus degassing of supersaturated co2 particularly in lakes and the upstream stretches of rivers ch4 emission to the atmosphere sensitively affected by groundwater level in wetlands and paddy fields fertilizer application to agricultural fields pollutant loading from urban areas co2 and ch4 emissions from reservoirs and bottom sediments and doc poc and dic efflux to the ocean therefore the nice bgc framework is able to separate more clearly the carbon sources of inland waters from the terrestrial carbon sink nakayama 2017a b whereas most previous research on conventional carbon cycling has generally overestimated the accumulation of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and underestimated the potential for lateral export of carbon from land to rivers raupach 2011 2 3 effect of control structures on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles control structures such as weirs dams reservoirs locks and waterfalls affect the change in hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the major changes to the source and sink terms for organic and inorganic carbon due to control structures are the following i increased uptake of co2 for increased production of organic carbon by phytoplankton due to decreased water velocity and longer hydraulic residence times in reservoirs compared with free flowing rivers ii increased sequestration of organic carbon due to increased deep burial of organic carbon deposited in reservoirs compared with free flowing rivers this might be the main reason why reservoirs lead to greater net loss of carbon from the air and water compartments iii increased mass transfer of co2 between air and water due to entrainment with the drop in water surface elevation at the control structure leading to increased dic in river reaches located downstream from reservoirs iv the longer residence times in reservoirs would lead to increased oxidation of ch4 respiration leading to increased dic in the water column of the reservoirs in particular co2 gas transfer in streams is influenced by the presence of control structures and the following formula holds similarly to dissolved oxygen pelletier et al 2006 1 r d 1 0 38 a d b d h d 1 0 11 h d 1 0 046 t w a t e r

more complicated than inorganic carbon it is difficult to generalize whether reservoirs would either increase or decrease poc or doc because each reservoir would be different in the balance of factors that would change the doc and poc concentrations so the authors used the same partial differential equations for the derivatives either with or without the reservoirs except for the extra reaeration effect of the dams after solving dic concentration as mass balance in eqs 1 3 so these sets of partial differential equations include implicitly the effect of reservoirs on both organic and inorganic carbon and nutrients these modifications mean primary production in reservoirs consumes inorganic carbon and available forms of nutrients no3 and srp and produces organic carbon in algae cells when algae die they contribute to detrital poc when algae and detritus settle to the bottom a portion of the settled organic carbon is sequestered by deep burial some of the poc is converted to doc and oxidized through heterotrophic respiration releasing dic the above equations also mean that hydrologic and carbon cycle change by the effect of control structures such as reservoirs fig 2 2 4 model

groundwater level simulated by nice fig 2 the input data for the global simulation were prepared and arranged by using arcgis v10 1 software table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type

kump 1994 respectively in particular nice bgc simulated only the major rivers in the world 153 basins watersheds 325 river channels some of which 82 major dams were located fig 1 by inputting the information about dam location height width and type etc of grand lehner et al 2011 fig 2 and table 1 agricultural regions of glc2000 were subdivided into 17 major crops of 26 crop classes for both irrigated and rain fed crops in mirca2000 portmann et al 2010 corresponding to the crop commodity classifications and definitions reported previously leff et al 2004 global map of irrigation areas gmia fao 2016 were applied to decide the irrigation type surface water groundwater and other and global crop water model gcwm siebert and döll 2010 to decide irrigation water use total fertilizer consumptions nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for earth stat mueller et al 2012 were used to calculate the average fertilizer consumptions for each crop by using arcgis software to merge it with mirca2000 in each 5 arc minute grid 10 km furthermore the anisotropy ratio α and hydraulic conductivity kh m h were based on soil texture class and the ranges in these parameters were α 2 48 and kh 0 088 1 267 m h respectively permeability was assumed to decrease exponentially with the ratio of depth to e folding length a function of the slope fan et al 2013 which means higher permeability was assumed in thicker soil on a shallower slope 2 5 running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction for the hillslope hydrology flow depth discharge and other water concentrations on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation in order to calculate these boundaries the author firstly used gtopo30 to calculate each basin boundary at 1 km 1 km resolution and then calculated 1 1 grid by using arcgis v10 1 software for the model simulation water temperature in the uppermost boundary of each river was calculated as an exponential function of daily averaged air temperature yearsley 2012 inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads at the sea boundary a constant head was set at 0 m details are described in the previous papers nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama 2015 nice simulation of eco hydrological process was performed at 1 x1 resolution in the horizontal direction and into 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner at the upper layer to thicker at the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 5 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m from the sea surface the model simulates river network among elements and terrestrial ecosystem in grid cells then the contribution of river on grid cell was estimated by calculating area ratio of river multiplication of river width and length in each grid so the model is conserved in water heat carbon nitrogen and phosphorus budgets details about the models set up and sensitivity analysis are described in the author s previous papers nakayama 2014 2015 though the model simulated only the major rivers 322 rivers in the world the hydrologic and carbon cycles were simulated within the range of previous observed data nakayama 2016 2017a nakayama 2017b simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1998 1999 after a 1 year warm up period until a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated in terms of hydrologic geomorphic and ecological aspects as detailed in nakayama 2014 2015 nice bgc simulation for terrestrial ecosystem was conducted at the same spatial resolution with a time step of δt 1 day for the same period by inputting some of the results land temperature surface runoff and groundwater level simulated by nice iteratively after calculating the daily averaged data from 6 hourly data then nice bgc simulation for aquatic ecosystem was conducted with more smaller time step between δt 0 044 min and 0 70 min for the stability of the model in particular spin up in the revised rokgem was conducted for much longer periods of 20 000 years under control conditions no emissions to allow complete equilibration of silicate weathering versus co2 outgassing and carbon isotopes being much longer than the periods used in other submodels such as 1000 years in the revised lpjwhyme wania et al 2010 and 6 months in the revised swat and qual2kw the author s previous papers nakayama 2016 2017a have already showed a reasonable agreement within the range of previous observed data in annual averaged river discharge horizontal carbon fluxes toc doc poc and dic and vertical flux co2 evasion and sediment storage in the global major rivers without the presence of reservoirs details about the nice bgc set up and calibration validation processes are described in the author s previous papers nakayama 2016 2017a further the author conducted the long term simulation during 1980 2010 without the presence of reservoirs for a few river basins to compare with available data in glorich database hartman et al 2014 as much as possible table 2 indicates statistical values of r 2 rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns to show quantitative measures of model performance with regard to reproducing the seasonality and inter annual variability in carbon fluxes the table showed statistical values in rivers with ten or more of measured data before the construction of reservoirs in order to guarantee the reliability of the data the statistical values show the model can reproduce the seasonality and inter annual variability of carbon fluxes for some river basins with a relatively high performance based on these verification processes in the global major rivers without reservoirs the author conducted a simulation with the presence of reservoirs fig 1 and table 1 through calibration validation processes below in this study 3 results 3 1 effect of reservoirs on differences in horizontal carbon transports nakayama 2017a showed that nice bgc could simulate both horizontal transports export from land to inland water of 2 01 1 98 pgc yr and export to the ocean of 1 13 0 50 pgc yr and vertical fluxes degassing 0 79 0 38 pgc yr and sediment storage 0 20 0 09 pgc yr in major rivers without the presence of reservoirs in good agreement with previous research table 3 fig 3 shows spatial distribution of simulated horizontal carbon flux differences downstream of a river in each basin with and without the presence of reservoirs shown in fig 1 the simulated results show the global difference with and without dams in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and indicate that horizontal carbon flux into the ocean generally decreases in the presence of reservoir correlated with height of the reservoir beusen et al 2005 estimated global river export of sediments total suspended solids tss and organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus transported as particulate matter poc pn and pp associated with sediments by using a multiple linear regression model in particular they showed poc export changes from 226 tgc yr to 197 tgc yr without and with sediment trapping in regulated basins the presence of dam affects a decrease in horizontal carbon transport simulated by the model 1 00 0 40 pgc yr table 3 and this was also supported by their previous study fig 4 shows difference between simulated horizontal carbon fluxes without and with reservoirs because the reservoir storage amount becomes greater as the discharge increases due to the effectiveness of hydropower flood control navigation and water supply the transported carbon flux decreases with the increase of both the discharge and the reservoir height dic and poc fluxes are smaller variable ratio 0 826 and 0 847 with reservoirs than toc and doc variable ratio 0 972 and 0 974 because more carbon is trapped in the sediment of reservoirs this result shows reservoirs cause the transformation of carbon among the components of doc poc and dic maavara et al 2017 that decreased water velocity and longer hydraulic residence times in reservoirs might promote an increased uptake of co2 for increased production of organic carbon by phytoplankton and that increased deep burial of organic carbon deposited in reservoirs might accelerate an increased sequestration of organic carbon total phosphorus concentration might also increase greatly by being trapped in the sediment at the reservoirs which could contribute to eutrophication harrison et al 2010 the model result showed that consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of total horizontal carbon flux at river mouths in comparison with field measurements at these locations table 3 3 2 effect of reservoirs on differences in co2 evasion and carbon burial fig 5 shows simulated vertical flux of co2 evasion and sediment storage without and with reservoirs the vertical flux generally increases in the presence of reservoir affected by the magnitude height of reservoir fig 5a b in an opposite way compared with the horizontal carbon transports toc doc poc and dic flux in figs 3 and 4 the difference can be seen more clearly in the comparison of vertical flux in the same rivers in fig 5c d which implies the flux increases not only in a river with a reservoir but also in a river downstream of reservoir this effect is more pronounced in co2 evasion than in sediment storage and it can be seen that co2 evasion increases even in a river downstream of reservoir as observed by previous studies guérin et al 2006 yang et al 2014 simulated global differences in co2 evasion and carbon burial in the presence of reservoir were 76 6 tgc yr about 9 6 change as a percentage median value 42 4 tgc yr the 25th percentile 2 2 tgc yr and the 75th percentile 132 3 tgc yr and 45 0 tgc yr about 22 5 change median value 26 0 tgc yr the 25th percentile 3 2 tgc yr and the 75th percentile 78 1 tgc yr which implies the vertical flux increases are global in scale the model result showed that consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of sediment storage somewhat in comparison with field measurements 0 24 0 13 pgc yr but co2 evasion was over estimated with the presence of reservoirs 0 87 0 47 pgc yr table 3 because the above changes were different from the carbon fluxes in the reservoirs carbon fluxes at major 82 reservoirs were estimated by multiplying the simulated carbon flux per unit area by the surface area of grand database lehner et al 2011 fig 6 shows a comparison of co2 evasion in the major reservoirs created by dams between previous studies barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 and the nice bgc simulation the spatial distribution of co2 evasion is relatively similar compared with previous studies particularly the relatively large flux in south america fig 6a b fig 6c shows that the simulated flux agrees well compared with the observed data from the same locations in previous studies with high correlation cor 0 846 barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 though the observed value is more heterogeneously affected by the local conditions e g seasonality surface area reservoir age latitude water temperature and water quality table 4 shows a comparison of co2 evasion and carbon burial in global reservoirs between simulated values compared with previous studies mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 raymond et al 2013 yang et al 2014 clow et al 2015 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 the simulated results of total co2 evasion and carbon burial were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr which were generally in the range of 21 8 280 tgc yr and 26 2 600 tgc yr from human made freshwater systems in the previous compiled data 4 discussion 4 1 impact of reservoirs on carbon cycle changes the result showed consideration of the presence of reservoirs improved the model estimate of global carbon flux in comparison with previous studies table 3 horizontal carbon transport generally decreased in the presence of reservoir correlated with discharge and dam height figs 3 and 4 more carbon is trapped in some regions such as the ganges nile zambezi parana columbia ob and yenisei rivers actually whether reservoirs would increase or decrease organic c is more complicated than the decrease in inorganic c as described in the eqs 1 3 figs 3 and 4 some reservoirs could result in a net increase in organic c because the increased production by phytoplankton could exceed the increased sedimentation rate other reservoirs could result in net decrease in organic c if the net of increased settling exceeds the increased production so each reservoir would be different in the balance of factors that would change the doc and poc concentrations this carbon transport is also related to land use soil and geological structures although the vertical carbon flux of co2 evasion and carbon burial simulated by nice bgc agreed well with the range of previous data in global scale table 4 mulholland and elwood 1982 downing et al 1993 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 the simulated results were rather scattered in some regions in regional scale fig 6 and table 4 co2 evasion and carbon burial estimated by some studies mulholland and elwood 1982 dean and gorham 1998 stallard 1998 st louis et al 2000 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 were over estimated because they included the flux from not only hydroelectric reservoirs but also lakes and other human made freshwater systems e g energy generation irrigation and water supply systems the vertical flux also depends on local conditions e g seasonal water elevation and temperature surface area of reservoirs reservoir age and trophic state barros et al 2011 and more importantly the model result showed the horizontal fluxes decreased and conversely the vertical flux increased with dams which is supported by the fact that the model is conserved in carbon budget figs 3 and 4 in particular the model result showed co2 evasion was only about 5 2 but carbon burial was about 36 1 of those in river without dam which implies the importance of the effect of dam on sediment storage change table 4 it is necessary to improve the spatial coverage of flux measurements from many regions including south america africa eurasia and australia et al in order to verify the simulated results in global scale deemer et al 2016 it is also important to provide some temporal trends of carbon cycle for long term periods such as 20 50 years with the presence of reservoirs the previous study showed the carbon cycle changes depending on the reservoir age barros et al 2011 because nice bgc is a too complicated modeling system it takes a huge time to simulate for long term periods it is a future work to evaluate temporal trends of carbon cycle for long term periods the model simulated global net land flux with the presence of reservoirs and compared with previous data table 5 simulated value without the presence of reservoirs in the author s previous paper nakayama 2017a was also shown nice bgc conserves carbon budget strictly and the model simulates photosynthetic uptake of co2 groundwater with co2 rich flowing to the stream and ch4 uptake sensitive to soil temperature and moisture etc whether co2 and ch4 become uptake or emission depends on the difference of pco2 and pch4 between water and air so the model includes explicitly the effect of inland water on land carbon flux with and without the presence of reservoirs which provides potential new insights the result shows that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr nakayama 2017a while most previous studies estimated co2 ch4 and n2o emissions within the reservoirs upstream of dams there are several other emission pathways e g drawdown emissions downstream emissions emissions from decomposing wood and emissions from dam spillways and turbines abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 2011 wehrli 2011 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 the difference of carbon flux simulated by nice bgc includes not only co2 emission within the reservoirs but also downstream emissions implicitly fig 5 because the ratio of the deficit above and below the dam is calculated as the function of the drop in water elevation over the control structures in the eqs 1 3 guérin et al 2006 estimated rivers downstream of dams accounted for a significant fraction of the emissions 9 33 for ch4 and 7 25 for co2 across the reservoir surfaces in three tropical reservoirs because rivers downstream of dams are significantly enriched in ch4 and co2 originating from the hypolimnion of reservoirs yang et al 2014 also summarized the previous studies of diffusive flux bubbling flux degassing and downstream river fluxes and showed the relative importance of downstream emissions in some tropical reservoirs it is important to consider all emission pathways not only the processes within the reservoirs in order to clarify the mechanisms of biogeochemical cycling and to quantify the total emissions from the reservoirs anyway the simulated result in the present paper is supported by previous studies indicating that the terrestrial co2 sink might become further smaller than thought so far as the models incorporates the effect of reservoirs cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 it is further necessary to include all emission pathways and various types of reservoirs in the model and evaluate not only co2 but also ch4 and n2o in the future st louis et al 2000 abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2006 barros et al 2011 mendonça et al 2012 hertwich 2013 maeck et al 2013 yang et al 2014 deemer et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 4 2 effect of water quality on carbon cycle changes harrison et al 2010 evaluated the effect of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip yields on carbon cycle change and showed the dip yield with dams is over threefold higher than the global average dip yield it is possible that a large number of reservoirs in the world are highly productive nutrient rich and support high ch4 emission rates deemer et al 2016 fig 7 shows water quality in the presence of reservoirs simulated by nice bgc with a comparison of water temperature and dip yield in the major reservoirs from previous studies harrison et al 2010 deemer et al 2016 and nice bgc simulation though the model assumes that dams release depth averaged water and concentrations as described in the eqs 1 3 we can see a reasonable correlation between nice bgc results and previous studies for water temperature cor 0 613 figs 7a b and e the model simulated depth averaged and annually averaged temperature whereas most of previous observations reported surface water temperature data collection during the limited sampling day usually only in the daytime and non flood season this means that the current model can t simulate the dam release water from the hypolimnion of reservoirs which often contain waters with cooler temperatures and larger concentrations of co2 and ch4 guérin et al 2006 and that it is a future work to decrease the uncertainty of water temperature to simulate the vertical distribution of water temperature in the reservoir there was also a linear relation between nice bgc and previous studies for dip yield though the correlation was relatively low cor 0 137 fig 7c d and f this result implies that the total phosphorus concentration increases greatly in the presence of reservoir due to sediment trapping in reservoirs and that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of the simulated result in the vertical direction in addition to gathering more observation data the previous data about co2 evasion and carbon burial are in the broad range and imply the uncertainties are large table 4 the is also related to the difference of definitions in each paper the extrapolation from some local point data to global budget and their analyses are usually not conserved in carbon budget the simulated result in this paper also shows the uncertainties are large table 4 in comparison with the author s previous paper without considering the influence of reservoirs on inland water carbon dynamics nakayama 2017a this implies the effect of reservoirs on even the direction of changes in carbon fluxes vary from basin to basin across the globe as influenced by various factors such as land use soil and geological structures etc there it is a future work to conduct and compile detailed field observations of carbon cycle change in the flow direction in the entire river basin including the different types of reservoirs in order to reduce the uncertainties of the model as much as possible the present model didn t include the areal reduction of upland vegetation by the creation of reservoirs because the area of reservoirs is much smaller than the land area and this is in the range of uncertainty in the simulation of 1 1 grid so this study assumed that the land carbon sink and the terrestrial loading of doc dic and poc to inland waters were same with and without reservoirs didn t simulate the difference of carbon stored on land between with and without the presence of reservoirs and only evaluated the difference in carbon burial co2 evasion and the export of transported doc dic and poc to oceans with and without reservoirs table 3 however the result implied the changes in ecosystem processes such as instream photosynthesis consumption decomposition and burial of particulate organic carbon poc the uptake and release of carbon dioxide oxygen and methane along with its distribution in the water column and dissolved organic carbon doc dynamics it is necessary to include the effects of changes in terrestrial loading on inland water and carbon dynamics by using the finer resolution or in the regional study further this study does not present all of the sources and sinks that are computed though nice bgc conserves carbon budget strictly the authors discussed about the vertical fluxes of only co2 evasion and deposition of organic c the vertical carbon fluxes are conserved as the sum of ch4 gas bubble gaseous co2 and ch4 burial flux of poc etc in addition to co2 evasion and sediment storage from this viewpoint these other terms are missing for the analysis in this paper however it is reasonable to assume these are minor contributions for carbon budget as the first approximation it would be a lot of additional work and the future direction to present a complete budget of all of the computed sources and sinks of organic and inorganic carbon in order to improve the simulated results of the carbon cycle in reservoirs figs 6 and 7 and table 4 we also need to compare model predictions not only with high quality measurements of the carbon budget on the regional local scale particularly in zero order and first order streams lynch et al 2010 but also with data from global monitoring programmes for assessment of environmental conditions and changes melack 2011 use of this improved model would also help to clarify more robustly the partitioning between natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes in freshwater systems ciais et al 2013 5 conclusions the new process based model nice bgc was extended to apply to river basins to include the effect of 82 major reservoirs created by dams on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles the model simulated both horizontal transport to the ocean and vertical fluxes in the extension of the author s previous work and included aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together in major rivers which was a potential improvement from previous studies the comparisons of global carbon flux in major basins vertical flux in major reservoirs and net flux in lands showed nice bgc agreed with reality within the scope of the limited data the model results showed the differences in horizontal carbon transport doc flux 66 4 tgc yr poc flux 11 8 tgc yr and dic flux 43 5 tgc yr and vertical fluxes co2 evasion 76 6 tgc yr and carbon burial 45 0 tgc yr in the presence of reservoirs on a global scale the model also calculated co2 evasion and carbon burial in global 82 reservoirs were 66 5 35 9 tgc yr and 54 7 29 1 tgc yr which was generally in the range of previous compiled data describing human made freshwater systems further the result showed that the land carbon sink decreases more with the presence of reservoirs 0 97 0 61 pgc yr than without the presence of reservoirs 1 05 0 62 pgc yr these results are great improvements from the previous studies of the emission from the reservoirs based on only a field measurement because the model calculated not only the emission within the reservoirs but also downstream emissions implicitly it is reasonable that the total simulated co2 evasion was over estimated with the presence of reservoirs the result also implies the need to include field observations of emissions from rivers downstream from reservoirs in order to quantify the total emissions due to reservoirs as the future work this finding indicated that reservoirs might be a potentially important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and might help to reduce the uncertainty ranges of the carbon cycle in inland waters by

original nice to conserve the carbon budget nakayama 2017a in particular nice bgc generates carbon output from land to river systems and then uses the land carbon as input table a1 shows a list of parameters from terrestrial ecosystems that were input to the revised qual2kw the author assumed some parameters to be constant and the units for input values were converted for input to the revised qual2kw simulation each sub model offers iterative simulation in the most efficient way by combining on line and off line modes on line data input output through i o memory off line data input output
