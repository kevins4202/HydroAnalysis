16505,the direct biological treatment of antibiotics containing wastewater brings about a potential risk of antibiotic resistance genes args spread although advanced oxidation technologies based on photocatalysis generally appear effective at degrading antibiotics in wastewater the fate of args in succeeding biological treatment system is still unknown herein a filter membrane like carbon cloth immobilized fe2o3 g c3n4 photocatalyst is fabricated through immersion calcination method peroxydisulfate coupled photocatalysis system is developed to degrade tetracycline tc an emerging refractory antibiotic pollutant the system can produce energetic active species oh so4 h o2 and 1o2 exhibiting a superior performance towards tc degradation in static and continuous flow processes under visible light irradiation the pretreatment can eliminate the antibacterial activity of antibiotics wastewater and the chemical oxygen demand removal is greatly enhanced in subsequent anaerobic or aerobic process the microbial diversity and richness in activated sludge for pretreated water sample are significantly higher than those for the water sample without pretreatment meanwhile the pretreatment can decrease the relative abundance of potential hosts of args and reduce the emergence as well as dissemination risk of args this study uncovers the effect of pretreatment of antibiotics containing wastewater using advanced oxidation technologies on the treatment efficacy and antibiotic resistome fate in biological treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation photocatalysis biological treatment microbial community antibiotic resistance genes 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used to treat bacterial diseases in human and livestock bagheri et al 2017 zheng et al 2018a most of the antibiotics are nonmetabolizable and will be excreted via urine and feces oberoi et al 2019 antibiotics from a variety of sources such as pharmaceutical industries livestock farms aquaculture farms household use and hospital are finally gathered in wastewater treatment plants wwtps oberoi et al 2019 however it is difficult to effectively treat antibiotics containing wastewater using conventional biological treatment process in wwtps chen et al 2019 residual antibiotics causes the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args ma et al 2019 thus wwtps become the hot spots for the release exchange and spread of args ding et al 2021 tetracycline tc as the most widely used veterinary antibiotic is the most representative antibiotic there are many reports of args contamination from tc residues rysz et al 2013 sun et al 2018 therefore it is highly recommended to perform a proper pretreatment to detoxify antibiotics in wastewater before biological treatment advanced oxidation processes aops are regarded as effective technologies in organic wastewater treatment liu et al 2018 2019 in particular photocatalysis garners significant attention due to the strongly oxidative destruction of organic pollutants allowing for potential solar applications loeb et al 2019 great efforts have been made in photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic wastewater wu et al 2020 xing et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 however its actual uses particularly continuous flow use are hindered by the low effectiveness of photocatalytic processes due to the low quantum yield for oxidative radical production and the rapid recombination of electrons and holes a simple method by coupling photocatalysis with oxidizing agents such as h2o2 su et al 2012 and peroxydisulfate pds chen et al 2012 offers a more practical method for promoting photocatalysis forward the introduction of oxidizing agent can serve as electron acceptors to facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs chen et al 2012 improving photocatalytic efficiencies meanwhile the oxidizer can be activated by electrons to produce more reactive oxygen species ros compared to h2o2 pds is easier to store and transport can produce a wide variety of ros such as so4 oh o2 and 1o2 and can be operated over a wide ph range pds 2 8 vs h2o2 3 6 hu and long 2016 lutze et al 2015 oh et al 2016 aops are usually used as a pretreatment technology followed by biological process for organic wastewater treatment ganzenko et al 2014 oller et al 2011 however these studies pay too much attention to the removal efficiency of target pollutants but the elimination of target pollutant does not mean the reduction of ecological toxicity though some conventional aops can degrade antibiotics higher ecological toxicity is found for their degradation products homem and santos 2011 li et al 2008 wang and zhuan 2020 therefore it s very important to understand the impact of degradation products on the destiny of microbial community in succeeding biological treatment system moreover it is well known that the presence of antibiotics can induce args but can degradation products after aops pretreatment also induce args unfortunately very little research has been done on this topic herein a filter membrane like carbon cloth immobilized fe2o3 g c3n4 photocatalyst is fabricated through immersion calcination method the filter membrane like photocatalyst has a trapping effect on pollutants and easy to recycle after used the pds coupled photocatalytic system was used to treat antibiotics containing wastewater comparing with other transition metal oxides fe2o3 not only is a visible light response photocatalyst but also as a transition metal oxide can activate pds in addition g c3n4 shows here multiple functions g c3n4 is a stable visible light response photocatalyst ong et al 2016 wang et al 2012 2009a g c3n4 sheets can stabilize fe2o3 by forming metal inclusion with rich nitrogen containing functional groups as strong lewis s base sites wang et al 2009a zhang et al 2016 and the transfer of photogenerated electrons of g c3n4 to fe2o3 can promote the recycling of fe2 fe3 for eternally activating pds finally the effect of pretreatment by pds coupled photocatalysis on the fate of microbial community and args in the subsequent treatment system was further investigated this study analyses the effect of pretreatment of antibiotics containing wastewater using advanced oxidation technologies based on photocatalysis on the treatment efficacy and the fate of args in biological treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials carbon cloth cc was bought from hesen co ltd china and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone ethyl alcohol and deionized water respectively each treatment lasted 30 min the cleaned cc was dried at 60 c in oven overnight urea acetone ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ethyl alcohol etoh tetracycline tc sodium persulfate pds 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo methanol meoh tert butanol tba benzoquinone bq 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and sodium azide nan3 were obtained from china sinopharm 2 2 synthesis of fe2o3 g c3n4 composite on cc the g c3n4 was synthesized through thermal polymerization typically 10 g of urea was added to a closed alumina crucible and heated at 550 c for 3 h under air atmosphere the growth of fe2o3 g c3n4 composite on cc was realized by dip coating and thermal treatment typically right amount of g c3n4 was ultrasonically dispersed in 100 ml ethyl alcohol for 30 min and the mixture was further ultrasonicated for 30 min after adding 5 mmol fecl3 and 15 mmol nh4hco3 subsequently cc 5 5 cm2 were immersed into the solutions for 30 min and dried at 60 c for 2 h the immersion drying step was repeated for 3 times then the as coated cc were calcined at 350 c for 2 h under air atmosphere the samples were ultrasonically washed in water for 30 s to remove loosely bound powder from cc surface finally the samples were dried at 60 c for 2 h as shown in fig s1 supporting information the best degradation efficiency of tc could be achieved using the fe2o3 g c3n4 composite prepared under the optimized ratio of 1 g c3n4 5 mmol fecl3 and 15 mmol nh4hco3 then the loading of fe2o3 g c3n4 onto cc was controlled by changing the immersion drying time 1 3 or 5 times under the optimal precursor ratio the as obtained samples were labeled as fecn 1 fecn 3 and fecn 5 for 1 3 and 5 times of immersion drying respectively for comparison g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were prepared by the similar method without adding fecl3 or g c3n4 2 3 characterizations the details of the morphology structure characterizations chemical composition and photoelectrochemical properties of the samples were described in text s1 2 4 experimental setup tc degradation was conducted in a two compartment reactor with a quartz window 5 5 cm2 each compartment was 2 cm thick effective volume of 50 ml the as prepared material 5 5 cm2 was sandwiched between the two compartments fig s2 a xenon lamp source pls sxe300d 300duv beijing perfectlight with an uv cut off filter λ 420 nm was used as the visible light source 1 ml water sample was taken and immediately quenched with 20 μl of 0 5 m sodium thiosulfate to measure tc concentration on a uv vis spectrophotometer at 357 nm the maximum absorption wavelength of tc the continuous flow experiment was carried out in the same reactor under the same conditions and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 45 min according to the toxicity assessment of tc solution after different pretreatment time 2 5 biodegradation inhibition experiment the biodegradation inhibition experiments were conducted in glass serum bottles in a thermostatic air bath shaker 160 rpm 30 c under both anaerobic an and aerobic ae conditions the experimental details were described in text s2 2 6 analysis 2 6 1 chemical analysis and substances identification the antibacterial activities of tc and its degradation products with different degradation time only using deionized water as the blank control group were evaluated by gram negative bacterium e coli tang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the details for cultivate process are described in text s3 high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer hplc ms agilent was used to identify the transformation products of tc the operating details were listed in text s4 total organic carbon toc was analyzed by shimadzu vcsh asi toc analyzer cod concentrations were detected according to fast digestion spectrophotometric method and the standard curves were shown in fig s3 fe ion concentrations were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 8900 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer jes fa200 was used to detect oh so4 and o2 radicals using dmpo as the spin trap agent and 1o2 using temp as the spin trap agent 2 6 2 microbial community analysis after 30 days of cultivation the genomic dna of the activated sludge was extracted the regions v3 v4 of the 16s rrna gene were amplified with primer pairs 515f gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat and then high throughput sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq pe300 platform novaseq pe250 platform according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 6 3 args analysis by quantitative pcr qualitative pcr assays were performed to detect args resistance gene tetc teta and 16s rrna gene in the active sludge samples table s1 were quantified using the applied biosystems viia 7 real time pcr system and analyzed with the smartchip qpcr software 197 v2 7 0 1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization from the sem images fig 1 bare cc had a smooth surface the surface of g c3n4 cc became rough and the surface of fe2o3 cc was covered with particles for fecn samples the loaded particles increased with the dip coating time after five dip coating times the particles aggregated seriously in addition the particles in fecn are coated by a thin transparent layer the xrd pattern suggests that the particles in fe2o3 cc and fecn are α fe2o3 jcpds no 33 0664 she et al 2017 fig s4 both g c3n4 cc and fecn showed the characteristic peak at 27 4 for 002 plane of g c3n4 li et al 2016 wang et al 2009b fig s4 the tem and hrtem images further confirmed the presence of fe2o3 and g c3n4 sheets fig s5 the fe2o3 particles are coated in g c3n4 layer protecting fe from leaching the xps survey pattern showed the existence of fe o c and n elements in fecn 3 fig s6a the fe 2p spectra indicate the coexistence of fe ii and fe iii fig s6b the o 1 s peaks at 533 2 531 8 530 8 and 529 8 ev respond to co co feoc and α fe2o3 respectively fig s6c wu et al 2018 the presence of feoc indicates a strong mutual effect between α fe2o3 and c greatly facilitating electron transfer qian et al 2017 both c 1 s and n 1 s peaks display representative framework characteristic of g c3n4 fig s6 d e yuan et al 2019 it s worth noting that the fe and o binding energies of fecn 3 are smaller than those for fe2o3 cc meaning an enhanced electron cloud density of fe and o by comparison the c and n binding energies in fecn 3 are greater than those for g c3n4 cc resultantly fe ii content increased from 43 09 for fe2o3 cc to 80 49 for fecn 3 the higher fe ii content of fecn 3 would avail pds activation the light absorption property of the as prepared materials was investigated by uv vis drs spectra fig 2 a the adsorption edge of g c3n4 cc is about 445 nm the fecn samples present a stronger visible light absorption compared to g c3n4 cc then the corresponding tauc plots of g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were evaluated according to drs spectra and the equation of αhν 1 2 a hν eg shown in text s5 yi et al 2020 the band gaps eg were approximately 2 63 and 2 09 ev fig s7a and the valence bands evb were 1 72 and 2 31 ev for g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc fig s7b respectively yuan et al 2018 according to the conduction band ecb evb eg zhang et al 2019 the ecb values of g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were 0 91 and 0 22 ev respectively pl spectra can reflect the electro hole separation efficiency fig 2b fecn showed lower pl intensities than g c3n4 cc indicating a better separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes photoelectrochemical measurements transient photocurrent and eis were used to further evaluate the electron transfer performance and photogenerated charge separation the photocurrents of fecn are higher than that for g c3n4 cc fig 2c meaning a lowered recombination of photoinduced electro hole pairs li et al 2019 the eis spectra of the as prepared composite are shown in fig 2d the fecn samples possess much smaller semicircle than g c3n4 cc indicating lower charge transfer resistance of fecn li et al 2019 among fecn fecn 3 showed the best photoelectrochemical properties probably due to the synergetic effect of moderate amount of g c3n4 and fe2o3 3 2 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performances of the as prepared materials were studied through the degradation of tc under visible light irradiation with pds addition fig 3 a the tc removal through only adsorption by cc was very limited in addition fecn catalyst showed higher tc degradation efficiency than g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc further indicating the synergetic effect of g c3n4 and fe2o3 on the tc degradation among the fecn catalysts fecn 3 showed the best photocatalytic performance with almost 100 tc degradation efficiency within 30 min and the toc removal efficiency achieved 100 in 3 h fig s8 obviously low catalyst loading on cc could only provide limited oxidative active species while excessive catalysts would lead to the aggregation of catalysts resulting in the decline of catalytic activity tonda et al 2014 therefore fecn 3 would be further investigated fig 3b shows the tc degradation using different processes the tc degradation was negligible when using pds alone whether under visible light or in the dark noticeably the degradation efficiency of tc for pds fecn 3 in the dark is almost equal to that for fecn 3 under visible light irradiation the results indicate that pds could be activated by fecn to produce oxidative species for tc degradation thus the combination of pds and fecn 3 under visible light irradiation showed the highest degradation efficiency of tc although the addition of pds could promote tc degradation higher pds concentration did not mean higher degradation efficiency of tc fig 3c excessive s2o8 2 will consume so4 radicals li et al 2019 the effect of initial ph on tc degradation by pds coupled photocatalytic system was studied in the range of 3 11 as revealed in fig 3d when ph0 was from 3 to 7 the system showed good degradation efficiency of tc when ph0 was increased to 9 the degradation efficiency of tc decreased however when further increasing ph0 to 11 the degradation efficiency of tc increased again this phenomenon can be explained by the ph change of the solution after the addition of pds and the phpzc of fecn 3 determined by the mass titration method when ph0 is from 3 to 7 the solution ph drops to 2 87 3 34 after adding 1 mm pds when ph0 is 9 and 11 the solution ph decreases to 6 83 and 10 17 after adding 1 mm pds respectively table s2 the phpzc of fecn 3 is 6 31 fig s9a when the solution ph is below 6 31 for the ph0 below 7 fecn 3 surface is positively charged which is conducive to attracting negatively charged pds i e s2o8 2 thus promoting tc degradation at ph0 9 the solution ph is above 6 31 so the negatively charged fecn 3 surface will repel s2o8 2 showing a decreased tc degradation efficiency tc can be degraded by pds alone under alkaline conditions fig s9b because the alkaline solution can activate pds hu et al 2020 electrical energy consumption is very important economical parameter in wastewater treatment process in this work specific energy consumption sec at the optimized conditions of pds coupled photocatalytic system was 3 75 kwh m3 text s6 compared with the sec consumption of other systems 2 7 40 8 kwh m3 the sec consumption of this system was relatively low khataee et al 2011 rezaei vahidian et al 2017 sarafraz et al 2020 the stability and practical application of the as prepared material are discussed by cyclic experiment and continuous flow experiment as shown in fig 4 a after five cycles of experiments the tc removal efficiency of fe2o3 cc decreased obviously while fecn 3 remained a very stable tc removal efficiency serious fe leaching for fe2o3 cc and low fe leaching for fecn 3 occurred at different ph fig s10 the continuous flow experiment showed that the concentration of tc decreased rapidly once triggering the reaction and reached a stable removal efficiency of 86 after 1 h fig 4b the toc removal efficiency remained 79 after 3 h fig 4c the time to reach equilibrium in the continuous flow experiment is slower than that in the static experiment which may be caused by the continuous entry of new pollutants in the continuous flow experiment moreover after 15 h of continuous flow experiment fe leaching for fecn 3 was low fig s11 showing a good structure stability fig s12 3 3 mechanism of pds coupled photocatalytic system reactive oxygen species ros for tc degradation in the pds coupled photocatalytic system were identified through quenching experiments meoh 500 mm was used to capture both oh k 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and tba 500 mm was used to capture oh because the reaction rate of oh with tba k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 is much faster than that of so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 zhu et al 2020 further edta 2na bq and nan3 were used to capture photogenerated holes h o2 and 1o2 respectively as shown in fig 5 a tc degradation is significantly inhibited by the addition of meoh and tba which suggest that oh and so4 are the major reactive species at the same time the addition of edta 2na bq and nan3 also led to a certain decrease in tc degradation indicating the existence of h o2 and 1o2 epr technique was used to further demonstrate ros using dmpo or temp as radical spin trapping agent as shown in fig 5b the characteristic peaks with a relative intensity of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the dmpo oh adducts and dmpo so4 adducts are also observed especially under irradiation the change of oh concentration was detected using coumarin as the probe molecule fig s13 the peak intensity become higher with prolonging reaction time indicating an increased concentration of oh in addition the characteristic peaks of dmpoo2 fig 5c and temp 1o2 fig 5d were observed according to these results the possible mechanism for tc degradation was proposed in scheme 1 both g c3n4 and fe2o3 absorbed visible light to generate e h pairs according to the energy band levels the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band cb of g c3n4 can be transferred to the cb of fe2o3 the electrons in the cb of g c3n4 can also react with o2 to generate o2 which can be further transferred into 1o2 li et al 2019 the electrons in the cb of fe2o3 can be captured by pds to produce so4 li et al 2019 meanwhile fe iii can capture electrons to form fe ii for further activating pds to generate so4 which can react with h2o to form oh in summary so4 oh o2 1o2 and h concurrently contributed to the degradation of tc in pds coupled photocatalytic system 3 4 intermediates determination hplc ms was used to detect the degradation products of tc fig s14 ten major products were detected table s3 through our calculation results in previous research tang et al 2020 oh and o2 are more likely to attack the positions of o24 c25 o29 c20 c21 and o43 in tc fig s15 therefore the following degradation pathways were deduced fig 6 first of all the products of p1 p4 and p7 were formed after being attacked by oh then p2 and p5 were obtained through cn bonds break p3 1 p3 2 and p6 were procured by decarbonylation of tc and p8 appeared through hydroxylation of p6 p9 was obtained via demethylation and ring opening of p8 these intermediates could be further degraded into small molecules or even mineralized 3 5 toxicity evaluation and effect of pretreatment on biodegradation efficiency the toxicity of the degradation products of tc were detected by evaluating the growth of gram negative bacterium e coli as shown in fig 7 a the growth of e coli was nearly entirely suppressed in the presence of tc without pretreatment with the prolongation of pretreatment time the toxicity of products to e coli become lower and lower the growth curve of e coli in the tc solution after pretreatment for 45 min is nearly equal with the blank group albeit the toc removal was only 51 9 fig s8 the pretreated or untreated wastewater containing tc was collected for anaerobic an and aerobic ae activated sludge experiments to explore the influence of pretreatment on subsequent biological treatment for both in an fig 7b and ae fig 7c process untreated tc wastewater noticeably inhibited the biological treatment capacity especially in an process after 45 min of pretreatment the inhibition was greatly alleviated in the two processes and the cod removal was equivalent to blank therefore the developed pretreatment approach is very efficient for enhancing biological treatment capacity of wastewater containing antibiotics 3 6 effects of pretreatment on microbial community the effects of pretreatment on microbial community of an and ae systems were analyzed through high throughput sequencing the observed otus chao1 and ace estimators show that the richness of the untreated samples in the two systems is the lowest table 1 shannon s indices also show that the untreated samples have the lowest diversity the less richness and diversity of the community may cause the imbalance in the system zheng et al 2018b the richness and the diversity of the pretreated samples in the two systems are close to those of the blank group the results indicate that the biodiversity and richness are maintained after photocatalytic pretreatment bacterial community composition analysis is a very important tool for understanding the biological treatment capacity of the system jiang et al 2016 the metabolic potential of specific functional microorganisms plays a vital role in pollutant removal in some special environments kormas et al 2015 therefore the bacterial community structure composition at different classification levels was studied fig 8 a d the results show that the main phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidota chloroflexi actinobacteriota spirochaetota firmicutes and acidobacteriota for all the systems the other phyla in the six samples are less than 3 fig 8a and b the most abundant phylum in all the samples is proteobacteria which can remove organic matter miura et al 2007 and promote the cycle of carbon nitrogen and sulfur ansola et al 2014 liu et al 2016 in both an and ae system the bacterial community composition of the pretreatment group is close to that of the blank group while the unpretreated group is significantly different from them specifically the proportion of bacteroidota decreased while firmicutes increased in the unpretreated group compared with the blank and pretreatment groups bacteroidota are closely associated with the transformation of organic substances cottrell and kirchman 2000 the inhibition of bacteroidota led to low cod removal in the unpretreated group the bacterial community structure was investigated at genus level fig 8c and d in an system genus thauera blvii28 wastewater sludge group and propioniciclava are sensitive to tc and their relative abundance decreases significantly at the presence of tc without pretreatment on the contrary the abundances of zoogloea trichococcus and desulfobacterium catecholicum group increase sharply indicating a strong resistance to tc in ae system rhodobacter rhodococcus and hyphomonas are sensitive to tc while trichococcus is resistant to tc the results suggest that the pretreatment can regulate the bacterial community structure and bacterial activity thus affecting the treatment efficiency principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the otu abundance table can reflect the distance between samples obtaining bacterial community difference fig 8e and f in both an and ae system the distance between an pre ae pre and an b ae b is short indicating a similar bacterial community the unpretreated group an un ae un is far away from the blank and pretreated group indicating a greatly diverged bacterial community the results indicate that the degradation products of tc after pretreatment had a negligible effect on bacterial community 3 7 effect of pretreatment on args in order to understand the relative abundance of args in the an and ae systems tetc and teta genes were selected based on their high detection frequency in tc resistance genes rysz et al 2013 sun et al 2018 as shown in fig 9 tetc has much higher relative abundance than teta probably due to the different susceptibility of bacterial species to tc ma et al 2019 in both an and ae system the relative abundance of tetc and teta for untreated samples are much higher than that for pretreated and blank samples thus the pds coupled photocatalytic pretreatment is feasible for the reduction of args 3 8 association between microbial community and args the possible host bacteria of args are displayed in fig 10 the main potential hosts of tetc and teta are almost the same in an system both of them was highly significant relevance with lentimicrobiaceae unclassified f rhodocyclaceae and zoogloea in addition teta also showed significant relevance with desulfobacterium catecholicum griup these potential hosts are abundant in the untreated group but almost absent in the pretreated and blank groups fig 8c and fig 10a in ae system the main potential hosts of tetc and teta are highly significant relevance with micrococcales and tetc also has a highly significant relevance with comamonadaceae and significant relevance with trichococcus micrococcales and comamonadaceae are dominant species in the untreated group but are significantly reduced in the pretreated and blank groups trichococcus is abundant in the untreated group but almost absent in the pretreated and blank groups fig 8d and fig 10b these results indicate that the pds coupled photocatalytic pretreatment of antibiotic wastewater could decrease the relative abundance of potential hosts of args thus reducing the emergence and dissemination risk of args 4 conclusion a flexible filter membrane shaped pds coupled photocatalytic system was developed to highly efficiently pretreat wastewater containing antibiotics the system can produce energetic active species oh so4 h o2 and 1o2 exhibiting a superior performance towards tc degradation in static and continuous flow process under visible light irradiation the pretreatment greatly eliminated the antibacterial activity of antibiotics wastewater resulting in significantly enhanced cod removal in subsequent anaerobic or aerobic process moreover the microbial diversity and richness in activated sludge for pretreated water sample were significantly higher than those for the water sample without pretreatment meanwhile the pretreatment could decrease the relative abundance of potential hosts of args and reduce the emergence as well as dissemination risk of args this study uncovers the effect of photocatalysis based advanced oxidation pretreatment of antibiotics containing wastewater on the treatment efficacy and antibiotic resistome fate in biological treatment system finally it should be noted that strong adsorption capacity of photocatalysts towards low concentration organic pollutants is required for the scale up application of this technology used in continuous flowing treatment

fate of args in biological treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials carbon cloth cc was bought from hesen co ltd china and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone ethyl alcohol and deionized water respectively each treatment lasted 30 min the cleaned cc was dried at 60 c in oven overnight urea acetone ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ethyl alcohol etoh tetracycline tc sodium persulfate pds 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo methanol meoh tert butanol tba benzoquinone bq 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp and sodium azide nan3 were obtained from china sinopharm 2 2 synthesis of fe2o3 g c3n4 composite on cc the g c3n4 was synthesized through thermal polymerization typically 10 g of urea was added to a closed alumina crucible and heated at 550 c for 3 h under air atmosphere the growth of fe2o3 g c3n4 composite on cc was realized by dip coating and thermal treatment typically right amount of g c3n4 was ultrasonically dispersed in 100 ml ethyl alcohol for 30 min and the mixture was further ultrasonicated for 30 min after adding 5 mmol fecl3 and 15 mmol nh4hco3 subsequently cc 5 5 cm2 were immersed into the solutions for 30 min and dried at 60 c for 2 h the immersion drying step was repeated for 3 times then the as coated cc were calcined at 350 c for 2 h under air atmosphere the samples were ultrasonically washed in water for 30 s to remove loosely bound powder from cc surface finally the samples were dried at 60 c for 2 h as shown in fig s1 supporting information the best degradation efficiency of tc could be achieved using the fe2o3 g c3n4 composite prepared under the optimized ratio of 1 g c3n4 5 mmol fecl3 and 15 mmol nh4hco3 then the loading of fe2o3 g c3n4 onto cc was controlled by changing the immersion drying time 1 3 or 5 times under the optimal precursor ratio the as obtained samples were labeled as fecn 1 fecn 3 and fecn 5 for 1 3 and 5 times of immersion drying respectively for comparison g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were prepared by the similar method without adding fecl3 or g c3n4 2 3 characterizations the details of the morphology structure characterizations chemical composition and photoelectrochemical properties of the samples were described in text s1 2 4 experimental setup tc degradation was conducted in a two compartment reactor with a quartz window 5 5 cm2 each compartment was 2 cm thick effective volume of 50 ml the as prepared material 5 5 cm2 was sandwiched between the two compartments fig s2 a xenon lamp source pls sxe300d 300duv beijing perfectlight with an uv cut off filter λ 420 nm was used as the visible light source 1 ml water sample was taken and immediately quenched with 20 μl of 0 5 m sodium thiosulfate to measure tc concentration on a uv vis spectrophotometer at 357 nm the maximum absorption wavelength of tc the continuous flow experiment was carried out in the same reactor under the same conditions and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 45 min according to the toxicity assessment of tc solution after different pretreatment time 2 5 biodegradation inhibition experiment the biodegradation inhibition experiments were conducted in glass serum bottles in a thermostatic air bath shaker 160 rpm 30 c under both anaerobic an and aerobic ae conditions the experimental details were described in text s2 2 6 analysis 2 6 1 chemical analysis and substances identification the antibacterial activities of tc and its degradation products with different degradation time only using deionized water as the blank control group were evaluated by gram negative bacterium e coli tang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 the details for cultivate process are described in text s3 high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer hplc ms agilent was used to identify the transformation products of tc the operating details were listed in text s4 total organic carbon toc was analyzed by shimadzu vcsh asi toc analyzer cod concentrations were detected according to fast digestion spectrophotometric method and the standard curves were shown in fig s3 fe ion concentrations were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 8900 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer jes fa200 was used to detect oh so4 and o2 radicals using dmpo as the spin trap agent and 1o2 using temp as the spin trap agent 2 6 2 microbial community analysis after 30 days of cultivation the genomic dna of the activated sludge was extracted the regions v3 v4 of the 16s rrna gene were amplified with primer pairs 515f gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat and then high throughput sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq pe300 platform novaseq pe250 platform according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 6 3 args analysis by quantitative pcr qualitative pcr assays were performed to detect args resistance gene tetc teta and 16s rrna gene in the active sludge samples table s1 were quantified using the applied biosystems viia 7 real time pcr system and analyzed with the smartchip qpcr software 197 v2 7 0 1 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization from the sem images fig 1 bare cc had a smooth surface the surface of g c3n4 cc became rough and the surface of fe2o3 cc was covered with particles for fecn samples the loaded particles increased with the dip coating time after five dip coating times the particles aggregated seriously in addition the particles in fecn are coated by a thin transparent layer the xrd pattern suggests that the particles in fe2o3 cc and fecn are α fe2o3 jcpds no 33 0664 she et al 2017 fig s4 both g c3n4 cc and fecn showed the characteristic peak at 27 4 for 002 plane of g c3n4 li et al 2016 wang et al 2009b fig s4 the tem and hrtem images further confirmed the presence of fe2o3 and g c3n4 sheets fig s5 the fe2o3 particles are coated in g c3n4 layer protecting fe from leaching the xps survey pattern showed the existence of fe o c and n elements in fecn 3 fig s6a the fe 2p spectra indicate the coexistence of fe ii and fe iii fig s6b the o 1 s peaks at 533 2 531 8 530 8 and 529 8 ev respond to co co feoc and α fe2o3 respectively fig s6c wu et al 2018 the presence of feoc indicates a strong mutual effect between α fe2o3 and c greatly facilitating electron transfer qian et al 2017 both c 1 s and n 1 s peaks display representative framework characteristic of g c3n4 fig s6 d e yuan et al 2019 it s worth noting that the fe and o binding energies of fecn 3 are smaller than those for fe2o3 cc meaning an enhanced electron cloud density of fe and o by comparison the c and n binding energies in fecn 3 are greater than those for g c3n4 cc resultantly fe ii content increased from 43 09 for fe2o3 cc to 80 49 for fecn 3 the higher fe ii content of fecn 3 would avail pds activation the light absorption property of the as prepared materials was investigated by uv vis drs spectra fig 2 a the adsorption edge of g c3n4 cc is about 445 nm the fecn samples present a stronger visible light absorption compared to g c3n4 cc then the corresponding tauc plots of g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were evaluated according to drs spectra and the equation of αhν 1 2 a hν eg shown in text s5 yi et al 2020 the band gaps eg were approximately 2 63 and 2 09 ev fig s7a and the valence bands evb were 1 72 and 2 31 ev for g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc fig s7b respectively yuan et al 2018 according to the conduction band ecb evb eg zhang et al 2019 the ecb values of g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc were 0 91 and 0 22 ev respectively pl spectra can reflect the electro hole separation efficiency fig 2b fecn showed lower pl intensities than g c3n4 cc indicating a better separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes photoelectrochemical measurements transient photocurrent and eis were used to further evaluate the electron transfer performance and photogenerated charge separation the photocurrents of fecn are higher than that for g c3n4 cc fig 2c meaning a lowered recombination of photoinduced electro hole pairs li et al 2019 the eis spectra of the as prepared composite are shown in fig 2d the fecn samples possess much smaller semicircle than g c3n4 cc indicating lower charge transfer resistance of fecn li et al 2019 among fecn fecn 3 showed the best photoelectrochemical properties probably due to the synergetic effect of moderate amount of g c3n4 and fe2o3 3 2 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performances of the as prepared materials were studied through the degradation of tc under visible light irradiation with pds addition fig 3 a the tc removal through only adsorption by cc was very limited in addition fecn catalyst showed higher tc degradation efficiency than g c3n4 cc and fe2o3 cc further indicating the synergetic effect of g c3n4 and fe2o3 on the tc degradation among the fecn catalysts fecn 3 showed the best photocatalytic performance with almost 100 tc degradation efficiency within 30 min and the toc removal efficiency achieved 100 in 3 h fig s8 obviously low catalyst loading on cc could only provide limited oxidative active species while excessive catalysts would lead to the aggregation of catalysts resulting in the decline of catalytic activity tonda et al 2014 therefore fecn 3 would be further investigated fig 3b shows the tc degradation using different processes the tc degradation was negligible when using pds alone whether under visible light or in the dark noticeably the degradation efficiency of tc for pds fecn 3 in the dark is almost equal to that for fecn 3 under visible light irradiation the results indicate that pds could be activated by fecn to produce oxidative species for tc degradation thus the combination of pds and fecn 3 under visible light irradiation showed the highest degradation efficiency of tc although the addition of pds could promote tc degradation higher pds concentration did not mean higher degradation efficiency of tc fig 3c excessive s2o8 2 will consume so4 radicals li et al 2019 the effect of initial ph on tc degradation by pds coupled photocatalytic system was studied in the range of 3 11 as revealed in fig 3d when ph0 was from 3 to 7 the system showed good degradation efficiency of tc when ph0 was increased to 9 the degradation efficiency of tc decreased however when further increasing ph0 to 11 the degradation efficiency of tc increased again this phenomenon can be explained by the ph change of the solution after the addition of pds and the phpzc of fecn 3 determined by the mass titration method when ph0 is from 3 to 7 the solution ph drops to 2 87 3 34 after adding 1 mm pds when ph0 is 9 and 11 the solution ph decreases to 6 83 and 10 17 after adding 1 mm pds respectively table s2 the phpzc of fecn 3 is 6 31 fig s9a when the solution ph is below 6 31 for the ph0 below 7 fecn 3 surface is positively charged which is conducive to attracting negatively charged pds i e s2o8 2 thus promoting tc degradation at ph0 9 the solution ph is above 6 31 so the negatively charged fecn 3 surface will repel s2o8 2 showing a decreased tc degradation efficiency tc can be degraded by pds alone under alkaline conditions fig s9b because the alkaline solution can activate pds hu et al 2020 electrical energy consumption is very important economical parameter in wastewater treatment process in this work specific energy consumption sec at the optimized conditions of pds coupled photocatalytic system was 3 75 kwh m3 text s6 compared with the sec consumption of other systems 2 7 40 8 kwh m3 the sec consumption of this system was relatively low khataee et al 2011 rezaei vahidian et al 2017 sarafraz et al 2020 the stability and practical application of the as prepared material are discussed by cyclic experiment and continuous flow experiment as shown in fig 4 a after five cycles of experiments the tc removal efficiency of fe2o3 cc decreased obviously while fecn 3 remained a very stable tc removal efficiency serious fe leaching for fe2o3 cc and low fe leaching for fecn 3 occurred at different ph fig s10 the continuous flow experiment showed that the concentration of tc decreased rapidly once triggering the reaction and reached a stable removal efficiency of 86 after 1 h fig 4b the toc removal efficiency remained 79 after 3 h fig 4c the time to reach equilibrium in the continuous flow experiment is slower than that in the static experiment which may be caused by the continuous entry of new pollutants in the continuous flow experiment moreover after 15 h of continuous flow experiment fe leaching for fecn 3 was low fig s11 showing a good structure stability fig s12 3 3 mechanism of pds coupled photocatalytic system reactive oxygen species ros for tc degradation in the pds coupled photocatalytic system were identified through quenching experiments meoh 500 mm was used to capture both oh k 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 and tba 500 mm was used to capture oh because the reaction rate of oh with tba k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 is much faster than that of so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 zhu et al 2020 further edta 2na bq and nan3 were used to capture photogenerated holes h o2 and 1o2 respectively as shown in fig 5 a tc degradation is significantly inhibited by the addition of meoh and tba which suggest that oh and so4 are the major reactive species at the same time the addition of edta 2na bq and nan3 also led to a certain decrease in tc degradation indicating the existence of h o2 and 1o2 epr technique was used to further demonstrate ros using dmpo or temp as radical spin trapping agent as shown in fig 5b the characteristic peaks with a relative intensity of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the dmpo oh adducts and dmpo so4 adducts are also observed especially under irradiation the change of oh concentration was detected using coumarin as the probe molecule fig s13 the peak intensity become higher with prolonging reaction time indicating an increased concentration of oh in addition the characteristic peaks of dmpoo2 fig 5c and temp 1o2 fig 5d were observed according to these results the possible mechanism for tc degradation was proposed in scheme 1 both g c3n4 and fe2o3 absorbed visible light to generate e h pairs according to the energy band levels the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band cb of g c3n4 can be transferred to the cb of fe2o3 the electrons in the cb of g c3n4 can also react with o2 to generate o2 which can be further transferred into 1o2 li et al 2019 the electrons in the cb of fe2o3 can be captured by pds to produce so4 li et al 2019 meanwhile fe iii can capture electrons to form fe ii for further activating pds to generate so4 which can react with h2o to form oh in summary so4 oh o2 1o2 and h concurrently contributed to the degradation of tc in pds coupled photocatalytic system 3 4 intermediates determination hplc ms was used to detect the degradation products of tc fig s14 ten major products were detected table s3 through our calculation results in previous research tang et al 2020 oh and o2 are more likely to attack the positions of o24 c25 o29 c20 c21 and o43 in tc fig s15 therefore the following degradation pathways were deduced fig 6 first of all the products of p1 p4 and p7 were formed after being attacked by oh then p2 and p5 were obtained through cn bonds break p3 1 p3 2 and p6 were procured by decarbonylation of tc and p8 appeared through hydroxylation of p6 p9 was obtained via demethylation and ring opening of p8 these intermediates could be further degraded into small molecules or even mineralized 3 5 toxicity evaluation and effect of pretreatment on biodegradation efficiency the toxicity of the degradation products of tc were detected by evaluating the growth of gram negative bacterium e coli as shown in fig 7 a the growth of e coli was nearly entirely suppressed in the presence of tc without pretreatment with the prolongation of pretreatment time the toxicity of products to e coli become lower and lower the growth curve of e coli in the tc solution after pretreatment for 45 min is nearly equal with the blank group albeit the toc removal was only 51 9 fig s8 the pretreated or untreated wastewater containing tc was collected for anaerobic an and aerobic ae activated sludge experiments to explore the influence of pretreatment on subsequent biological treatment for both in an fig 7b and ae fig 7c process untreated tc wastewater noticeably inhibited the biological treatment capacity especially in an process after 45 min of pretreatment the inhibition was greatly alleviated in the two processes and the cod removal was equivalent to blank therefore the developed pretreatment approach is very efficient for enhancing biological treatment capacity of wastewater containing antibiotics 3 6 effects of pretreatment on microbial community the effects of pretreatment on microbial community of an and ae systems were analyzed through high throughput sequencing the observed otus chao1 and ace estimators show that the richness of the untreated samples in the two systems is the lowest table 1 shannon s indices also show that the untreated samples have the lowest diversity the less richness and diversity of the community may cause the imbalance in the system zheng et al 2018b the richness and the diversity of the pretreated samples in the two systems are close to those of the blank group the results indicate that the biodiversity and richness are maintained after photocatalytic pretreatment bacterial community composition analysis is a very important tool for understanding the biological treatment capacity of the system jiang et al 2016 the metabolic potential of specific functional microorganisms plays a vital role in pollutant removal in some special environments kormas et al 2015 therefore the bacterial community structure composition at different classification levels was studied fig 8 a d the results show that the main phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidota chloroflexi actinobacteriota spirochaetota firmicutes and acidobacteriota for all the systems the other phyla in the six samples are less than 3 fig 8a and b the most abundant phylum in all the samples is proteobacteria which can remove organic matter miura et al 2007 and promote the cycle of carbon nitrogen and sulfur ansola et al 2014 liu et al 2016 in both an and ae system the bacterial community composition of the pretreatment group is close to that of the blank group while the unpretreated group is significantly different from them specifically the proportion of bacteroidota decreased while firmicutes increased in the unpretreated group compared with the blank and pretreatment groups bacteroidota are closely associated with the transformation of organic substances cottrell and kirchman 2000 the inhibition of bacteroidota led to low cod removal in the unpretreated group the bacterial community structure was investigated at genus level fig 8c and d in an system genus thauera blvii28 wastewater sludge group and propioniciclava are sensitive to tc and their relative abundance decreases significantly at the presence of tc without pretreatment on the contrary the abundances of zoogloea trichococcus and desulfobacterium catecholicum group increase sharply indicating a strong resistance to tc in ae system rhodobacter rhodococcus and hyphomonas are sensitive to tc while trichococcus is resistant to tc the results suggest that the pretreatment can regulate the bacterial community structure and bacterial activity thus affecting the treatment efficiency principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the otu abundance table can reflect the distance between samples obtaining bacterial community difference fig 8e and f in both an and ae system the distance between an pre ae pre and an b ae b is short indicating a similar bacterial community the unpretreated group an un ae un is far away from the blank and pretreated group indicating a greatly diverged bacterial community the results indicate that the degradation products of tc after pretreatment had a negligible effect on bacterial community 3 7 effect of pretreatment on args in order to understand the relative abundance of args in the an and ae systems tetc and teta genes were selected based on their high detection frequency in tc resistance genes rysz et al 2013 sun et al 2018 as shown in fig 9 tetc has much higher relative abundance than teta probably due to the different susceptibility of bacterial species to tc ma et al 2019 in both an and ae system the relative abundance of tetc and teta for untreated samples are much higher than that for pretreated and blank samples thus the pds coupled photocatalytic pretreatment is feasible for the reduction of args 3 8 association between microbial community and args the possible host bacteria of args are displayed in fig 10 the main potential hosts of tetc and teta are almost the same in an system both of them was highly significant relevance with lentimicrobiaceae unclassified f rhodocyclaceae and zoogloea in addition teta also showed significant relevance with desulfobacterium catecholicum griup these potential hosts are abundant in the untreated group but almost absent in the pretreated and blank groups fig 8c and fig 10a in ae system the main potential hosts of tetc and teta are highly significant relevance with micrococcales and tetc also has a highly significant relevance with comamonadaceae and significant relevance with trichococcus micrococcales and comamonadaceae are dominant species in the untreated group but are significantly reduced in the pretreated and blank groups trichococcus is abundant in the untreated group but almost absent in the pretreated and blank groups fig 8d and fig 10b these results indicate that the pds coupled photocatalytic pretreatment of antibiotic wastewater could decrease the relative abundance of potential hosts of args thus reducing the emergence and dissemination risk of args 4 conclusion a flexible filter membrane shaped pds coupled photocatalytic system was developed to highly efficiently pretreat wastewater containing antibiotics the system can produce energetic active species oh so4 h o2 and 1o2 exhibiting a superior performance towards tc degradation in static and continuous flow process under visible light irradiation the pretreatment greatly eliminated the antibacterial activity of antibiotics wastewater resulting in significantly enhanced cod removal in subsequent anaerobic or aerobic process moreover the microbial diversity and richness in activated sludge for pretreated water sample were significantly higher than those for the water sample without pretreatment meanwhile the pretreatment could decrease the relative abundance of potential hosts of args and reduce the emergence as well as dissemination risk of args this study uncovers the effect of photocatalysis based advanced oxidation pretreatment of antibiotics containing wastewater on the treatment efficacy and antibiotic resistome fate in biological treatment system finally it should be noted that strong adsorption capacity of photocatalysts towards low concentration organic pollutants is required for the scale up application of this technology used in continuous flowing treatment

16506,as a byproduct of desalination plants brine is increasingly becoming a threat to the environment and the design of zero liquid discharge zld systems is gaining increasing attention existing zld systems are limited by a high energy intensity and high plant costs of their crystallizers this study proposes a novel crystallization method based on the humidification dehumidification hdh process which exhibits the advantages of a low energy consumption low component costs and a reduced scaling and fouling potential a simple experimental setup is first designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system brine concentration and salt crystallization are successfully achieved with air heated to 40 c as the heat source afterwards a thermo economic analysis is conducted for the whole system the specific thermal energy and electricity consumption levels are found to range from 700 900 and 5 11 kj respectively per kg of feed brine the energy consumption is 56 lower than that of a conventional evaporative crystallizer and the initial plant cost is reduced by 58 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zero liquid discharge desalination crystallization

water 1 introduction with the increase in supply demand for freshwater the global desalination capacity has rapidly grown over the past few decades with an overall production capacity of more than 100 million m3 day virgili pankratz and gasson 2016 desalination has become a reliable source of potable water the above high global desalination capacity is associated with brine treatment challenges this occurs because most of the existing desalination techniques including reverse osmosis ro multi stage flash desalination msf and multi effect distillation med only recover a certain portion 50 of freshwater from the feed stream shahzad burhan and ng 2017 tang et al 2018 the remaining stream containing most of the dissolved solids of the feed stream as well as pretreatment additives is disposed of as brine conventional brine management methods directly discharge brine into the environment e g oceans surface water and deep water without any treatment giwa dufour al marzooqi al kaabi and hasan 2017 subramani and jacangelo 2014 these methods are convenient and cost effective but they create serious environmental issues such as increasing the salinity of receiving water bodies impacting local marine life and affecting soil quality missimer and maliva 2018 petersen et al 2018 with increasingly stricter government legislation direct disposal methods may not be feasible in the near future therefore zero liquid discharge zld is receiving increasing attention at both the research and industrial levels zld is a treatment process that processes brine into purified water and solid dry salt thus eliminating the need for wastewater disposal panagopoulos 2021 a regular zld system for brine treatment consists of brine concentrators and crystallizers the former concentrates desalination brine to a higher salinity e g from 70 g l to higher than 200 g l and the latter separates salts from liquids through crystallization brine concentration can be achieved using energy efficient processes like med panagopoulos 2021 or osmotically assisted reverse osmosis oaro bartholomew mey arena siefert and mauter 2017 c z liang askari choong and chung 2021 the crystallization process although only recovering a small portion of water consumes more energy than brine concentration and is the bottleneck of the zld system chen et al 2021 since the major salt component in desalination brine i e nacl exhibits a flat solubility curve evaporative crystallization is the most suitable brine treatment method lewis et al 2015 several evaporative crystallizers have been reported in the literature xu et al xu h 2010 proposed a multi effect evaporation crystallization meec system for wastewater treatment the system comprised three effects with the first two effects achieving brine concentration and the third effect functioning as a crystallizer this system produced salt with a 99 9 purity and the liquid exhibited a concentration of 0 5 mg l han et al han et al 2009 analyzed an evaporative crystallizer hybridized with mechanical vapor recompression mvrc the steam produced during evaporation was recompressed and reused as a heat source thus reducing energy consumption zhou et al zhou shi and dong 2014 developed a mathematical model suitable for mvrc systems based on heat and mass balances as well as heat transfer calculations the model attained a good agreement with experimental data retrieved from a laboratory plant with a capacity of 20 kg h analytical results revealed that the specific compressor power could be reduced when lowering the operation temperature difference liang et al liang and han 2011 liang han ma and peng 2013 designed a two effect mvrc system compared to single effect systems both energy consumption and operating costs were notably reduced despite extensive research efforts evaporative crystallizers are not widely employed in the desalination industry the reasons include a high initial plant cost high design and operation complexity and lack of long term operation experience lu et al 2017 however with recent advances in membrane distillation md membrane distillation crystallization mdc has emerged as an alternative solution for brine treatment md systems possess several promising features including high salt rejection low operation pressure and temperature and high system compactness chen ja li and chua 2018 chen muhammad et al 2020 it is expected that these merits could also be extended to mdc systems therefore mdc has become the subject of much research interest over the past few years edwie and chung edwie and chung 2013 proposed a simultaneous membrane distillation crystallization smdc system for the treatment of saturated brine the system consisted of a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd module and a cooling crystallization module the salt crystallization rate increased from 7 5 to 34 kg per m3 of feed when the feed temperature was increased from 40 to 70 c while the average crystallizer size decreased from 87 40 to 48 82 µm lu et al lu cheng chang luo and chung 2019 designed a zld system combining freeze desalination dcmd and freeze crystallization modules under the optimal operating conditions the specific energy consumption was reported to range from 2000 2500 kwh m3 nakoa et al nakoa rahaoui date and akbarzadeh 2016 combined dcmd and solar ponds for zld desalination purposes to improve the solar pond performance the dcmd intake was supplied from the nonconvective zone of the solar pond while the discharge was directed to the lower convective zone the system achieved a daily productivity of 52 l per m2 of membrane area guo et al guo ali and hassanzadeh 2016 analytically analyzed a zld system combining air gap membrane distillation agmd and evaporative crystallization the overall energy consumption was reported to range from 1700 2200 kj kg h2o guan et al guan wang wicaksana yang and fane 2012 studied an mdc system via aspen flowsheet simulation the results revealed that crystallizer integration imposed a negligible effect on the overall energy consumption as most of the heat input occurred in the md heater a key challenge of mdc systems is their high scaling and fouling potential under extreme feed concentrations which leads to a notable decrease in membrane flux edwie and chung 2013 julian meng li ye and chen 2016 or even complete membrane blockage nariyoshi pantoja and seckler 2016 therefore frequent cleaning and replacement of membranes are required this issue hinders the wider application of mdc in brine treatment to increase the zld feasibility novel techniques for salt crystallization are urgently needed a novel crystallization method is proposed in this paper similar to the humidification dehumidification hdh cycle air is employed as a carrier of heat and mass transfer brine is concentrated to supersaturation conditions via direct contact with hot and dry air thereafter salt crystallizes from the desalination brine while vapor is carried to the condenser for the recovery of distillate and condensation heat the merits of this process include component design simplicity low scaling and fouling potential and reduced heat input ghofrani and moosavi ghofrani and moosavi 2020a 2020b have reported similar ideas to use hdh for brine treatment however their studies focus on the hybridization of hdh with other processes i e med and heat pump to achieve higher thermodynamic and economic performances and little attention was paid to the crystallization process to demonstrate the feasibility of using the hdh process for brine treatment an experimental setup is built to characterize the evaporation and crystallization processes subsequently the thermodynamic performance of the hdh based crystallizer is evaluated via mathematical modeling a comparison to the evaporative crystallizer is also performed to highlight the merits of the proposed system the derived results are useful for the future design and operation of novel crystallization systems 2 system description fig 1 shows a schematic of the proposed crystallization system consisting of two direct spray humidifiers a dehumidifier condenser an air heater and a salt brine separator the operation of the system contains one closed water loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 one closed air loop 7 8 9 7 and one open air loop 10 11 brine 1 obtained from a desalination plant is mixed with the recirculation stream 6 and mixture 2 is passed through the condenser coil to obtain preheating the preheated brine 3 is then sprayed into humidifier 1 where the brine spray comes into direct contact with dry air 7 and partially evaporates the wet air 8 leaving humidifier 1 is heated and directed to the condenser where its water content is condensed to form distillate 13 the concentrated brine 4 leaving humidifier 1 is sprayed into humidifier 2 where further evaporation is induced during direct contact with outdoor air 10 at the bottom of humidifier 2 the brine concentration exceeds the solubility limit and salt crystals are formed brine slurry 5 flows to the salt separator where suspended salt particles and liquid brine are separated salt particles 12 are collected as the product and brine 6 is mixed with feed 1 for further circulation the various states of the brine are plotted in a temperature solubility diagram in fig 2 compared to existing crystallization processes the proposed system yields several merits first brine evaporates at the brine air interface and there is no metallic surface for heat and mass transfer this configuration helps to eliminate the issues of scaling and fouling which are severe when treating high concentration solutions second instead of directly heating the brine heat is added to the system through the air which greatly reduces the brine temperature a lower brine temperature further reduces the potential of scaling and fouling third the employment of air as a heat and mass transfer medium allows for the recovery of condensation heat thus reducing thermal energy consumption finally the system operates under ambient conditions and the corresponding initial and operational costs are much lower than those of vacuum systems 3 methodology the performance of the proposed crystallization process is evaluated experimentally and analytically a humidifier is first built and tested to characterize the evaporation and crystallization processes thereafter the thermodynamic performance of the whole system is determined via mathematical simulation 3 1 experimental design fig 3 a shows a schematic of the experimental setup consisting of an evaporation chamber a circulation pump an external swirl nozzle and several sensors seawater is charged into the chamber and sprayed from the top via a nozzle moreover hot and dry air is supplied from the side to evaporate the seawater spray temperature and conductivity sensors are installed at the bottom of the chamber to monitor the seawater state while air supply and exhaust lines are equipped with humidity and temperature sensors the whole setup is placed on a weighing scale to measure its weight in real time as shown in fig 3 b sensor outputs are recorded with an agilent data logger for further analysis table 1 summarizes the details of the sensors and data logging unit in the experiments seawater was continuously sprayed into the chamber from the top and air at a constant temperature and humidity was supplied from the bottom inside the chamber seawater was heated by the provided air and partially evaporated leading to an increase in salinity the states of seawater temperature mass and conductivity and air temperature and humidity ratio were recorded at an interval of 30 seconds after a certain period the seawater salinity exceeded the solubility limit and salt crystallization occurred suspended salt particles were separated via vacuum filtration and then dried at 90 c for 12 hours to remove moisture afterwards the dry particles were observed and analyzed via scanning electronic microscopy sem 3 2 mathematical model since the proposed system is based on hdh processes the mathematical model is similar to that developed for a regular hdh desalination system chen burhan et al 2020 the model is derived based on heat and mass conservation a major difference from the regular hdh model is that the conservation of salt is also considered as the salt concentration is of great importance in the crystallization process the assumptions made for the mathematical model include 1 the system occurs under steady state conditions 2 heat loss to the ambient environment is negligible 3 there is no droplet carry over in the humidifier 4 the properties of moist air are determined based on the temperature and humidity ratio herrmann kretzschmar and gatley 2009 while seawater properties are calculated based on the temperature and salinity sharqawy lienhard and zubair 2010 sparrow 2003 wagner and kretzschmar 2008 the model is summarized in table 2 eqs 1 3 describe the mixing of the feed brine and recirculation stream eqs 4 7 capture the dehumidification process in the condenser with the heat and mass transfer model and eqs 8 11 and 15 18 define the humidification processes in humidifiers 1 and 2 respectively eqs 12 14 represent the heat input under the assumption of a heat exchanger effectiveness of ε h e x the crystallization process is modeled by assuming that a certain superheat portion r 0 100 is released as expressed in eqs 19 21 finally eqs 22 25 determine the parameters that measure the system performance including the salt and distillate productivity and energy heat and electricity consumption the developed model is validated using the data published in the literature we compare the air and seawater temperatures and the energy efficiencies calculated using the current model with the literature data the model prediction agrees well with the literature with marginal discrepancies detailed comparison results are provided in the appendix 4 results and discussion this section presents the performance of the proposed crystallization system experimental results are first analyzed to characterize the evaporation and crystallization process subsequently the productivity and energy consumption of the system are evaluated under given design and operating conditions finally a comparison to evaporative crystallizers is presented to highlight the thermodynamic and economic benefits of the proposed system 4 1 experiment several experiments were conducted to characterize the evaporation and crystallization processes in each experiment raw seawater from the red sea was charged into the humidifier chamber the seawater was circulated at a flowrate of 1 8 l min lpm and hot air 38 c and 10 g kg was supplied at a flowrate of 73 m3 hr 1 45 kg min fig 4 a shows the change in mass and conductivity in one of the tests the seawater has an initial concentration of 40 6 g kg however considering the concentration range that is of significance in brine treatment we present only the data when the solution concentration exceeded 110 g kg at the early stage the brine mass decreases linearly due to a constant evaporation rate since only water evaporates the salt concentration in the brine increases leading to an increase in electrical conductivity after approximately 25000 seconds the brine becomes supersaturated and crystallization is initiated with the formation and growth of salt crystals the brine visibly becomes milky moreover the brine concentration and conductivity start to decrease fig 4 b shows the temperature of air and brine during direct contact with brine droplets air heats up the brine and supplies energy for evaporation therefore the air temperature drops while the brine temperature rises initially the exhaust air temperature is 10 c lower than the supply air temperature as the experiment progresses the air temperature reduction becomes less notable because the brine is heated when crystallization starts at 25000 seconds the increase in brine temperature becomes more obvious which is attributed to the release of crystallization heat fig 4 c shows the humidity ratio of air entering and leaving the humidifier the humidity ratio is increased by 5 5 g kg when air leaves the system with the use of a condenser the increased moisture content can be recovered as distillate fig 5 shows an sem image of the salt crystals they comprise a mixture of single and polycrystalline particles with parallelepiped shapes the width of the particles ranges from 2 5 μm and the length ranges from 2 30 μm the size is much smaller than that of nacl crystals reported in the literature edwie and chung 2013 luo chang and chung 2017 this is largely attributed to the very short residence time for crystal growth moreover crystal breakage occurs when the suspended solution is circulated through the humidifier if a larger crystal size is desired the supersaturated solution may be suspended in an additional container to allow sufficient crystal growth 4 2 simulation due to the limitations of the experimental setup only the humidifier performance is experimentally investigated to overcome this restriction the potential of the whole system is evaluated in this section with the developed model considering optimal operation conditions in actual plants the heat source temperature is assumed to be 80 c and the heat exchanger effectiveness for the air heater is 70 in addition the humidifiers are considered to be properly designed to achieve a high effectiveness of 70 and the air is fully saturated when leaving the humidifier another important modification entails that the feed brine concentration is set to 250 g kg in the simulations in practical applications brine retrieved from regular desalination plants can be concentrated to this value with a more energy efficient system before being supplied to the crystallizer this arrangement reduces the energy consumption of brine treatment the values of the other parameters are provided in table 3 table 4 provides the states of the air and brine at the different locations in the system 1 kg s of brine is supplied to the system at a salinity of 250 g kg to achieve the zld status an evaporation rate of 0 75 kg s is required while the crystallization rate is 250 g s to meet these requirements the recirculation flow rate is set to 24 74 kg s the circulation brine is first preheated to 59 34 c in the condenser the preheated brine is then directed into humidifier 1 and partially evaporates the concentrated brine is then sprayed into humidifier 2 for further evaporation the evaporation rates in humidifiers 1 and 2 reach 0 43 and 0 32 kg s respectively the vapor produced in humidifier 1 is condensed in the condenser and collected as distillate while that produced in humidifier 2 is exhausted into the ambient environment at the bottom of humidifier 2 the brine salinity reaches 277 17 g kg 90 of the supersaturation state is released to achieve a crystallization rate of 250 g s and the brine concentration decreases to 269 55 g kg after salt separation a key parameter of the crystallization process is the boiling point elevation bpe which diminishes the driving force for brine evaporation when the temperature difference required for heat and mass transfer is smaller than the bpe the design is infeasible to assess the feasible range for design and operation purposes the temperature difference between the air and brine is compared with the bpe under different conditions as shown in fig 6 here the values in humidifier 2 are presented since humidifier 1 operates at a larger temperature difference as shown in fig 6 a the operation temperature difference is larger than the bpe when the water air mass flowrate ratio is lower than 1 05 after which the bpe dominates the temperature difference consequently the maximum allowable water air flowrate ratio is 1 05 to overcome the bpe similarly the maximum humidifier effectiveness to be achieved is 72 and the heat source temperature must be 78 c as shown in fig 6 b and fig 6 c respectively the required heat input can be provided by different renewable energy sources such as solar thermal energy geothermal energy and industrial waste heat another design consideration is the maximum brine temperature in the system a higher brine temperature results in a higher scaling and fouling potential therefore the brine temperature is usually limited to below 70 c fig 7 shows the brine temperature when leaving the dehumidifier which represents the maximum brine temperature in the system its value is always below 65 c even when the heat source temperature is as high as 90 c this occurs because the current system employs an air heater instead of a brine heater to input heat this arrangement helps to minimize the issues of scaling and fouling thus reducing the maintenance requirements after obtaining the feasible operation range the productivity and energy efficiency of the proposed system are analyzed fig 8 a b shows the effect of the feed brine salinity on the system performance the heat source temperature and humidifier effectiveness are set to 80 c and 70 respectively when the feed salinity is lower more water must be evaporated to achieve the complete separation of salt and water therefore more distillate is collected as shown in fig 8 a the recirculation flow rate also increases at lower salinities to evaporate more water consequently more heat and a higher electricity input are required for brine heating and recirculation as shown in fig 8 b in practical operations it is always favorable to concentrate brine as much as possible i e to the solubility limit in the previous process before feeding into the crystallizer fig 8 c d shows the effect of the water air mass flowrate ratio on the system performance the flowrate ratio ranges from 0 6 to 1 5 for the sake of completeness and the infeasible region where the minimum temperature difference is smaller than the bpe is indicated by the dashed line when more brine is supplied a higher evaporation rate is needed leading to a higher recirculation rate as shown in fig 8 c consequently the electricity consumption increases due to the need for more pumping power in contrast there exists an optimal mass flowrate ratio that maximizes the distillate production rate while minimizing thermal energy consumption this observation is similar to what has been observed for a regular hdh desalination cycle hermosillo arancibia bulnes and estrada 2012 sharqawy antar zubair and elbashir 2014 yuan wang li and li 2011 this can be explained as follows if the brine flowrate is too low air cannot be fully humidified when leaving the humidifiers however when flowrate ratio is too high additional heat is consumed to heat the excess brine an optimal flowrate ratio guarantees that an exact amount of brine is supplied to humidify the air fig 8 e f shows the effect of the humidifier effectiveness as defined above the humidifier effectiveness indicates the completion level of heat and mass transfer in the humidifiers therefore a higher effectiveness indicates enhanced evaporation leading to a higher distillate productivity and energy efficiency at the highest possible effectiveness level of 70 the distillate production rate and thermal energy consumption are 0 43 kg kgfeed and 718 kj kgfeed respectively due to the enhanced evaporation the recirculation flowrate and pumping power are also reduced at a higher humidifier effectiveness when the humidifier effectiveness increases from 50 to 70 the recirculation flowrate decreases from 35 to 24 7 kg kgfeed and the determined electricity consumption decreases from 10 to 7 76 kj kgfeed fig 8 g h shows the effect of the heat source temperature on the system performance as expected a higher heat source temperature provides a higher driving force for heat and mass transfer which promotes the productivity lowers the recirculation flowrate and reduces the heat and electricity consumption levels therefore the system performance distillate production recirculation flowrate heat consumption and electricity consumption changes monotonically with the heat source temperature during actual operations a higher heating temperature is always desirable although this depends on the availability of heat sources table 5 compares the performance of the proposed crystallizer to that of an evaporative crystallizer performance and economic data of the evaporative crystallizer are obtained from our previous study chen et al 2021 and the cost of the current system is calculated based on the data reported in kabeel abou elmaaty and el said 2013 as indicated in the table the proposed crystallizer requires a lower recirculation rate as it employs hot and dry air to promote evaporation in contrast the evaporation rate in the evaporative crystallizer is limited by the temperature difference between the brine and surrounding vapor a lower recirculation rate leads to a 56 reduction in pumping power for the proposed crystallizer the heat input of the proposed crystallizer is also lower than that of the evaporative crystallizer this occurs because evaporation heat is partially recovered in the dehumidifier to preheat the brine another source of energy savings originates from humidifier 2 which applies the evaporative potential between the hot brine and dry ambient air the reduced heat and electricity consumption will lower the energy costs regardless of the type of heat source in addition to lower energy costs the current system also exhibits a lower component cost as it operates under ambient conditions and does not require any vacuum components as a result of lower system costs and energy costs the proposed system will be economically profitable in treating desalination brine and other high concentration wastewater 5 conclusions a novel crystallization system is proposed based on the hdh process the feasibility of the system is first experimentally evaluated and its thermodynamic performance is then analyzed via simulations the key findings in this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed system concentrates brine to supersaturation conditions and achieves crystallization with hot air as the heat source salt crystals are parallelepiped in shape with characteristic sizes ranging from 2 30 μm 2 due to the limitation of the bpe the heat source temperature must exceed 78 c while the maximum humidifier effectiveness and water air mass flowrate ratio are 72 and 1 05 respectively 3 the specific thermal energy and electricity consumption levels are 700 900 and 5 11 kj respectively per kg of feed brine energy consumption can be reduced by increasing the feed salinity improving the heat source temperature and promoting the humidifier effectiveness 4 compared to the evaporative crystallizer the proposed process reduces the heat and electricity consumption levels by 59 and 56 respectively and the plant cost is 58 lower the derived results provide useful information for the design and operation of the proposed crystallization system to achieve a higher technical readiness level the next

center wdrc king abdullah university of science and technology kaust appendix a model validation the developed model is validated using the data published in the literature firstly we compare the predicted air and water temperatures in the humidifier and the dehumidifier with the data published by narayan et al narayan et al 2012 in their study the inlet air and water temperatures were 30 and 56 4 c respectively in the dehumidifier and the values were 47 and 38 5 c in the humidifier as shown in table a1 the air was fully saturated and the seawater flowrate was the same as the air flowrate the same conditions were employed in the developed model to calculate the outlet temperatures of the air and seawater the calculated values are almost the same as the data provided by narayan et al and the deviations are 1 in addition to the temperatures we also validate the calculated energy efficiency which is expressed as the gain output ratio gor with the data reported by sharqawy et al

16506,as a byproduct of desalination plants brine is increasingly becoming a threat to the environment and the design of zero liquid discharge zld systems is gaining increasing attention existing zld systems are limited by a high energy intensity and high plant costs of their crystallizers this study proposes a novel crystallization method based on the humidification dehumidification hdh process which exhibits the advantages of a low energy consumption low component costs and a reduced scaling and fouling potential a simple experimental setup is first designed to demonstrate the feasibility

water 1 introduction with the increase in supply demand for freshwater the global desalination capacity has rapidly grown over the past few decades with an overall production capacity of more than 100 million m3 day virgili pankratz and gasson 2016 desalination has become a reliable source of potable water the above high global desalination capacity is associated with brine treatment challenges this occurs because most of the existing desalination techniques including reverse osmosis ro multi stage flash desalination msf and multi effect distillation med only recover a certain portion 50 of freshwater from the feed stream shahzad burhan and ng 2017 tang et al 2018 the remaining stream containing most of the dissolved solids of the feed stream as well as pretreatment additives is disposed of as brine conventional brine management methods directly discharge brine into the environment e g oceans surface water and deep water without any treatment giwa dufour al marzooqi al kaabi and hasan 2017 subramani and jacangelo 2014 these methods are convenient and cost effective but they create serious environmental issues such as increasing the salinity of receiving water bodies impacting local marine life and affecting soil quality missimer and maliva 2018 petersen et al 2018 with increasingly stricter government legislation direct disposal methods may not be feasible in the near future therefore zero liquid discharge zld is receiving increasing attention at both the research and industrial levels zld is a treatment process that processes brine into purified water and solid dry salt thus eliminating the need for wastewater disposal panagopoulos 2021 a regular zld system for brine treatment consists of brine concentrators and crystallizers the former concentrates desalination brine to a higher salinity e g from 70 g l to higher than 200 g l and the latter separates salts from liquids through crystallization brine concentration can be achieved using energy efficient

although only recovering a small portion of water consumes more energy than brine concentration and is the bottleneck of the zld system chen et al 2021 since the major salt component in desalination brine i e nacl exhibits a flat solubility curve evaporative crystallization is the most suitable brine treatment method lewis et al 2015 several evaporative crystallizers have been reported in the literature xu et al xu h 2010 proposed a multi effect evaporation crystallization meec system for wastewater treatment the system comprised three effects with the first two effects achieving brine

evaporative crystallizer hybridized with mechanical vapor recompression mvrc the steam produced during evaporation was recompressed and reused as a heat source thus reducing energy consumption zhou et al zhou shi and dong 2014 developed a mathematical model suitable for mvrc systems based on heat and mass balances as well as heat transfer calculations the model attained a good agreement with experimental data retrieved from a laboratory plant with a capacity of 20 kg h analytical results revealed that the specific compressor power could be reduced when lowering the operation temperature difference liang et al liang and han 2011 liang han ma and peng 2013 designed a two effect mvrc system compared to single effect systems both energy consumption and operating costs were notably reduced despite extensive research efforts evaporative crystallizers are not widely employed in the desalination industry the reasons include a high initial plant cost high design and operation complexity and lack of long term operation experience lu et al 2017 however with recent advances in membrane distillation md membrane distillation crystallization mdc has emerged as an alternative solution for brine treatment md systems possess several promising features including high salt rejection low operation pressure and temperature and high system compactness chen ja li and chua 2018 chen muhammad et al 2020 it is expected that these merits could also be extended to mdc systems therefore mdc has become the subject of much research interest over the past few years edwie and chung edwie and chung 2013 proposed a simultaneous membrane distillation crystallization smdc system for the treatment of saturated brine the system consisted of a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd module and a cooling crystallization module the salt crystallization rate increased from 7 5 to 34 kg per m3 of feed when the feed temperature was increased from 40 to 70 c while the average crystallizer size decreased from 87 40 to 48 82 µm lu et al lu cheng chang luo and chung 2019 designed a zld system combining freeze desalination dcmd and freeze crystallization modules under the optimal operating conditions the specific energy consumption was reported to range from 2000 2500 kwh m3 nakoa et al nakoa rahaoui date and akbarzadeh 2016 combined dcmd and solar ponds for zld desalination purposes to improve the solar pond performance the dcmd intake was supplied from the nonconvective zone of the solar pond while the discharge was directed to the lower convective zone the system achieved a daily productivity of 52 l per m2 of membrane area guo et al guo ali and hassanzadeh 2016 analytically analyzed a zld system combining air gap membrane distillation agmd and evaporative crystallization the overall energy consumption was reported to range from 1700 2200 kj kg h2o guan et al guan wang wicaksana yang and fane 2012 studied an mdc system via aspen flowsheet simulation the results revealed that crystallizer integration imposed a negligible effect on the overall energy consumption as most of the heat input occurred in the md heater a key challenge of mdc systems is their high scaling and fouling potential under extreme feed concentrations which leads to a notable decrease in membrane flux edwie and chung 2013 julian meng li ye and chen 2016 or even complete membrane blockage nariyoshi pantoja and seckler 2016 therefore frequent cleaning and replacement of membranes are required this issue hinders the wider application of mdc in brine treatment to increase the zld feasibility novel techniques for salt crystallization are urgently needed a novel crystallization method is proposed in this paper similar to the humidification dehumidification hdh cycle air is employed as a carrier of heat and mass transfer brine is concentrated to supersaturation conditions via direct contact with hot and dry air thereafter salt crystallizes from the desalination brine while vapor is carried to the condenser for the recovery of distillate and condensation heat the merits of this process include component design simplicity low scaling and fouling potential and reduced heat input ghofrani and moosavi ghofrani and moosavi 2020a 2020b have reported similar ideas to use hdh for brine treatment however their studies focus on the hybridization of hdh with other processes i e med and heat pump to achieve higher thermodynamic and economic performances and little attention was paid to the crystallization process to demonstrate the feasibility of using the hdh process for brine treatment an experimental setup is built to characterize the evaporation and crystallization processes subsequently the thermodynamic performance of the hdh based crystallizer is evaluated via mathematical modeling a comparison to the evaporative crystallizer is also performed to highlight the merits of the proposed system the derived results are useful for the future design and operation of novel crystallization systems 2 system description fig 1 shows a schematic of the proposed crystallization system consisting of two direct spray humidifiers a dehumidifier condenser an air heater and a salt brine separator the operation of the system contains one closed water loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 one closed air loop 7 8 9 7 and one open air loop 10 11 brine 1 obtained from a desalination plant is mixed with the recirculation stream 6 and mixture 2 is passed through the condenser coil to obtain preheating the preheated brine 3 is then sprayed into humidifier 1 where the brine spray comes into direct contact with dry air 7 and partially evaporates the wet air 8 leaving humidifier 1 is heated and directed to the condenser where its water content is condensed to form distillate 13 the concentrated brine 4 leaving humidifier 1 is sprayed into humidifier 2 where further evaporation is induced during direct contact with outdoor air 10 at the bottom of humidifier 2 the brine concentration exceeds the solubility limit and salt crystals are formed brine slurry 5 flows to the salt separator where suspended salt particles and liquid brine are separated salt particles 12 are collected as the product and brine 6 is mixed with feed 1 for further circulation the various states of the brine are plotted in a temperature solubility diagram in fig 2 compared to existing crystallization processes the proposed system yields several merits first brine evaporates at the brine air interface and there is no metallic surface for heat and mass transfer this configuration helps to eliminate the issues of scaling and fouling which are severe when treating high concentration solutions second instead of directly heating the brine heat is added to the system through the air which greatly reduces the brine temperature a lower brine temperature further reduces the potential of scaling and fouling third the employment of air as a heat and mass transfer medium allows for the recovery of condensation heat thus reducing thermal energy consumption finally the system operates under ambient conditions and the corresponding initial and operational costs are much lower than those of vacuum systems 3 methodology the performance of the proposed crystallization process is evaluated experimentally and analytically a humidifier is first built and

difference required for heat and mass transfer is smaller than the bpe the design is infeasible to assess the feasible range for design and operation purposes the temperature difference between the air and brine is compared with the bpe under different conditions as shown in fig 6 here the values in humidifier 2 are presented since humidifier 1 operates at a larger temperature difference as shown in fig 6 a the operation temperature difference is larger than the bpe when the water air mass flowrate ratio is lower than 1 05 after which the bpe dominates the temperature difference consequently the maximum allowable water air flowrate ratio is 1 05 to overcome the bpe similarly the maximum humidifier effectiveness to be achieved is 72 and the heat source temperature must be 78 c as shown in fig 6 b and fig 6 c respectively the required heat input can be provided by different renewable energy sources such as solar thermal energy geothermal energy and industrial waste heat another design consideration is the maximum brine temperature in the system a higher brine temperature results in a higher scaling and fouling potential therefore the brine temperature is usually limited to below 70 c fig 7 shows the brine temperature when leaving the dehumidifier which represents the maximum brine temperature in the system its value is always below 65 c even when the heat source temperature is as high as 90 c this occurs because the current system employs an air heater instead of a brine heater to input heat this arrangement helps to minimize the issues of scaling and fouling thus reducing the maintenance requirements after obtaining the feasible operation range the productivity and energy efficiency of the proposed system are analyzed fig 8 a b shows the effect of the feed brine salinity on the system performance the heat source temperature and humidifier effectiveness are set to 80 c and 70 respectively when the feed salinity is lower more water must be evaporated to achieve the complete separation of salt and water therefore more distillate is collected as shown in fig 8 a the recirculation flow rate also increases at lower salinities to evaporate more water consequently more heat and a higher electricity input are required for brine heating and recirculation as shown in fig 8 b in practical operations it is always favorable to concentrate brine as much as possible i e to the solubility limit in the previous process before feeding into the crystallizer fig 8 c d shows the effect of the water air mass flowrate ratio on the system performance the flowrate ratio ranges from 0 6 to 1 5 for the sake of completeness and the infeasible region where the minimum temperature difference is smaller than the bpe is indicated by the dashed line when more brine is supplied a higher evaporation rate is needed leading to a higher recirculation rate as shown in fig 8 c consequently the electricity consumption increases due to the need for more pumping power in contrast there exists an optimal mass flowrate ratio that maximizes the distillate production rate while minimizing thermal energy consumption this observation is similar to what has been observed for a regular hdh desalination cycle hermosillo arancibia bulnes and estrada 2012 sharqawy antar zubair and elbashir 2014 yuan wang li and li 2011 this can be explained as follows if the brine flowrate is too low air cannot be fully humidified when leaving the humidifiers however when flowrate ratio is too high additional heat is consumed to heat the excess brine an optimal flowrate ratio guarantees that an exact amount of brine is supplied to humidify the air fig 8 e f shows the effect of the humidifier effectiveness as defined above the humidifier effectiveness indicates the completion level of heat and mass transfer in the humidifiers therefore a higher effectiveness indicates enhanced evaporation leading to a higher distillate productivity and energy efficiency at the highest possible effectiveness level of 70 the distillate production rate and thermal energy consumption are 0 43 kg kgfeed and 718 kj kgfeed respectively due to the enhanced evaporation the recirculation flowrate and pumping power are also reduced at a higher humidifier effectiveness when the humidifier effectiveness increases from 50 to 70 the recirculation flowrate decreases from 35 to 24 7 kg kgfeed and the determined electricity consumption decreases from 10 to 7 76 kj kgfeed fig 8 g h shows the effect of the heat source temperature on the system performance as expected a higher heat source temperature provides a higher driving force for heat and mass transfer which promotes the productivity lowers the recirculation flowrate and reduces the heat and electricity consumption levels therefore the system performance distillate production recirculation flowrate heat consumption and electricity consumption changes monotonically with the heat source temperature during actual operations a higher heating temperature is always desirable although this depends on the availability of heat sources table 5 compares the performance of the proposed crystallizer to that of an evaporative crystallizer performance and economic data of the evaporative crystallizer are obtained from our previous study chen et al 2021 and the cost of the current system is calculated based on the data reported in kabeel abou elmaaty and el said 2013 as indicated in the table the proposed crystallizer requires a lower recirculation rate as it employs hot and dry air to promote evaporation in contrast the evaporation rate in the evaporative crystallizer is limited by the temperature difference between the brine and surrounding vapor a lower recirculation rate leads to a 56 reduction in pumping power for the proposed crystallizer the heat input of the proposed crystallizer is also lower than that of the evaporative crystallizer this occurs because evaporation heat is partially recovered in the dehumidifier to preheat the brine another source of energy savings originates from humidifier 2 which applies the evaporative potential between the hot brine and dry ambient air the reduced heat and electricity consumption will lower the energy costs regardless of the type of heat source in addition to lower energy costs the current system also exhibits a lower component cost as it operates under ambient conditions and does not require any vacuum components as a result of lower system costs and energy costs the proposed system will be economically profitable in treating desalination brine and other high concentration wastewater 5 conclusions a novel crystallization system is proposed based on the hdh process the feasibility of the system is first experimentally evaluated and its thermodynamic performance is then analyzed via simulations the key findings in this study are summarized as follows 1 the proposed system concentrates brine to supersaturation conditions and achieves crystallization with hot air as the heat source salt crystals are parallelepiped in shape with characteristic sizes ranging from 2 30 μm 2 due to the limitation of the bpe the heat source temperature must exceed 78 c while the maximum humidifier effectiveness and water air mass flowrate ratio are 72 and 1 05 respectively 3 the specific thermal energy and electricity consumption levels are 700 900 and 5 11 kj respectively per kg of feed brine energy consumption can be reduced by increasing the feed salinity improving the heat source temperature and promoting the humidifier effectiveness 4 compared to the evaporative crystallizer the proposed process reduces the heat and electricity consumption levels by 59 and 56 respectively and the plant cost is 58 lower the derived results provide useful information for the design and operation of the proposed crystallization system to achieve a higher technical readiness level the next

center wdrc king abdullah university of science and technology kaust appendix a model validation the developed model is validated using the data published in the literature firstly we compare the predicted air and water temperatures in the humidifier and the dehumidifier with the data published by narayan et al narayan et al 2012 in their study the inlet air and water temperatures were 30 and 56 4 c respectively in the dehumidifier and the values were 47 and 38 5 c in the humidifier as shown in table a1 the air was fully saturated and the seawater flowrate was the same as the air flowrate

16507,industrial chemicals are frequently detected in sediments due to a legacy of chemical spills globally site remedies for groundwater and sediment decontamination include natural attenuation by in situ abiotic and biotic processes compound specific isotope analysis csia is a diagnostic tool to identify quantify and characterize degradation processes in situ and in some cases can differentiate between abiotic degradation and biodegradation this study reports high resolution carbon chlorine and hydrogen stable isotope profiles for monochlorobenzene mcb and carbon and hydrogen stable isotope profiles for benzene coupled with measurements of pore water concentrations in contaminated sediments multi element isotopic analysis of δ13c and δ37cl for mcb were used to generate dual isotope plots which for 2 locations at the study site resulted in λc cl 130 values of 1 42 0 19 and λc cl 131 values of 1 70 0 15 consistent with theoretical calculations for carbon chlorine bond cleavage λ t 1 80

same location indicating not only production of benzene due to biodegradation of mcb but subsequent biotransformation of benzene itself to nontoxic end products degradation rate constants calculated independently using chlorine isotopic data and carbon isotopic data respectively agreed within uncertainty thus providing multiple lines of evidence for in situ contaminant degradation via reductive dechlorination and providing the foundation for a novel approach to determine site specific in situ rate estimates essential for the prediction of remediation outcomes and timelines graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stable isotopes csia biodegradation dual isotopes 1 introduction monochlorobenzene mcb is a direct and indirect product of industrial manufacturing mcb is used in herbicides and dyes and as a manufacturing intermediate in the production of adhesives polishes and drugs malcolm et al 2004 mcb is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and humans targeting the liver kidney and hematopoietic systems who chronicle 2011 water quality can be compromised when mcb is discharged into the environment padmanabhan et al 2005 although physicochemical properties suggest that mcb is adsorbed to the sediment and quickly undergoes degradation in an oxygen rich environment transforming mcb into nontoxic co2 kurt et al 2012 kurt and spain 2013 mcb can be more persistent in anaerobic environments although it has been shown to biodegrade via reductive dechlorination under methanogenic iron reducing and sulfate reducing conditions producing benzene and where sufficient electron donors exist co2 gilevska et al 2019 masunaga et al 1996 passeport et al 2016 given the toxicity of benzene complete mineralization to co2 is the remediation goal yardley jones et al 1991 a number of remediation strategies for mcb have proven effective for anaerobic contaminated sediments including dredging capping solidification and monitored natural recovery mnr mulligan et al 2009 mnr relies on sediment decontamination by taking advantage of in situ abiotic and biotic mechanisms and is also cost effective and sustainable because it avoids disturbing the system in ways that could promote redistribution of contaminants e g triggering concentration increases due to desorption from newly exposed sediments for mnr to be an effective remediation strategy a detailed understanding of the chemical and physical processes happening within the sediment and across the sediment water interface swi is important to ensure that the natural processes are occurring at an adequate rate to be protective of the environment office of land and emergency management 2017 typical contaminant site monitoring and degradation rate estimation relies on concentration measurements of the contaminant over time wilson and chapelle 1998 concentration decreases can be a result of volatilization adsorption diffusion or biodegradation only the last of which removes the contaminant from the environment completely via transformation compound specific isotope analysis csia paired with high resolution sampling has previously been used to identify biodegradation potential and quantify the rate of decontamination of the environment from mcb by distinguishing between concentration decreases due to actual transformation from those related to non degradative processes of phase change or transport gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 csia has emerged as a diagnostic tool that aids in remediation efforts by identifying changes in the isotopic signature of the contaminant within the plume hunkeler et al 2008 csia involves measuring the ratio of a heavy isotope of an element he to the light isotope le in a compound and is reported in the delta notation as δhe where e refers to any element with stable isotopes urey 1947 during reactions chemical bonds containing exclusively the light isotopes e g 12c 2h 35cl are broken at a faster rate than those containing one of the heavier isotopes e g 13c 2h 37cl this fractionation results in an isotopic enrichment in the heavy isotope in the remaining contaminant pool as transformation proceeds under many circumstances it has been shown that physical processes show smaller isotopic fractionation effects compared to larger fractionation associated with bond breakage during degradation hunkeler et al 2008 providing a tool for identifying transformation of contaminants the magnitude of fractionation the enrichment factor ε for a given element and transformation process can be determined in laboratory studies using the rayleigh model in situ rates of biodegradation can be calculated for applications to field based concentrations and isotopic measurements when the seepage velocity is known gilevska et al 2019 even controlled laboratory fractionation experiments can be influenced by a number of additional rate limiting steps transport across the cell membrane ehrl et al 2019 renpenning et al 2015 low substrate bioavailability sherwood lollar et al 2010 or substrate enzyme binding mancini et al 2006 any of which can mask the intrinsic isotope effect normally associated with bond cleavage partly to deal with this issue more robust methods to identify distinct transformation pathways involve measuring the isotopic fractionation of multiple elements for a given contaminant to generate a dual isotope plot e g δδ37cl δδ13c in theory all elements in the molecule are affected in a similar way by the masking processes mentioned above eliminating the bias observed for ε plotting the measured changes in δhe1 vs δhe2 gives the slope λ which is typically more representative of the bond cleaving transformation reactions there are examples where this is not the case i e where two elements are affected differently by masking processes gafni et al 2020 but to date these are the exception extending carefully determined values of λ from laboratory controlled experiments and microcosms to the field has been successful for well studied toxic compounds like methyl tert butyl ether btex compounds chlorinated ethenes and ethanes nitro aromatics and micropollutants fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2011 nelson et al 2011 however to extend this approach for less studied contaminants like mcb and in environments where there are multiple mechanisms involved in degradation there is a need for laboratory constrained data for isotopic fractionation of elements other than carbon and for field studies integrating multi element csia measurements at sufficient resolution to produce carbon hydrogen chlorine and concentration data on a representative spatial scale the concept of representative elementary volume rev most commonly applied in the context of porosity or hydraulic conductivity can be useful to statistically evaluate degradation rates derived from isotopic data particularly for identifying formations or sedimentary layers with the highest potential rates of biodegradation gilevska et al 2019 this study aims 1 to investigate the changes in chlorine carbon and hydrogen isotope values for mcb and of the latter two elements for benzene 2 to investigate thereby the in situ degradation potential of these compounds via a high resolution sampling study in sediments approaching the sediment water interface 3 to extend the rev approach to a dual isotope system for in situ rates of biodegradation calculated independently from the carbon and chlorine isotope data and 4 to calculate λc cl for mcb to evaluate potential degradation pathways 2 methods 2 1 study site mcb is present in the sediments underlying a freshwater canal as a legacy of past industrial manufacturing nearby gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 the canal is isolated from the contaminant plume by a sheet pile barrier installed at the edge of the canal over a decade ago to restrict further hydrogeologic connection between the contaminated groundwater and canal sediments therefore any contamination at this time in the canal sediments is a legacy from residual chlorinated aromatics and their degradation product benzene sediment thickness ranges from approximately 0 15 m at the banks to 1 4 m in the middle of the canal the canal sediment texture ranges from silty loam to sandy loam with a total organic content of 2 5 passeport et al 2016 a detailed description of the redox conditions at the study site including concentration profiles of all redox sensitive species can be found in gilevska et al 2019 additional site details including geologic setting hydrogeologic parameters and contaminant distribution are provided in prior publications kurt and spain 2013 passeport et al 2016 for this study pore water samples from the canal were collected from the upper portion of the sediment layer by in situ passive diffusion membrane samplers peepers after the methods described in gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 unlike earlier studies which involved only 3 relatively short 30 cm passive diffusion samplers and or measured only carbon isotope signatures this study uses peepers installed to much greater sediment depth 60 90 cm at 4 locations and applied a multi isotope approach incorporating carbon hydrogen and chlorine isotope analysis the previously published studies identified strong biodegradation capacity in these sediments fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2011 nelson et al 2011 and rate constants of biodegradation were calculated using both conventional environmental protection agency epa protocols based on concentration and independently derived csia approaches gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 here the multi isotope approach provides independent lines of evidence to evaluate the location and rates of highest biodegradation capacity across the sediment water interface and to compare with the previous findings based on a single isotope system carbon 2 2 stable isotope analysis and standardization stable carbon isotope analysis was performed

oxidation reactor thermo scientific 1 040 920 and conversion unit gc c iii for quantitative conversion of compounds to co2 the same configuration was used for hydrogen isotope analysis with the exception that a custom chromium reactor was made gilevska et al 2020 renpenning et al 2017 for quantitative conversion of hydrogen bearing compounds to h2 the injector temperature was 210 c with a fixed column flow of 1 5 ml min which is further restricted by the chromium oven to 1 2 ml min the gc was equipped with a vocol capillary column 60 m x 0 25 mm 3μm thickness with an initial hold

chlorine isotopic measurements including accuracy and reproducibility was 0 3 all isotopic measurements are reported in delta notation following eq 1 elsner 2010 1 δ h e h e l e s a m p l e h e l e s t a n d a r d 1 where δhe is the isotopic value in per mil h e l e sample is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in the sample and h e l e standard is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in an international isotopic standard like pee dee belemnite pdb for carbon isotopes vsmow for hydrogen isotopes standard mean ocean chloride smoc for chlorine isotopes 2 3 calculation of representative elementary volume rev the concept of representative elementary volume rev is a major principle in hydrogeology most commonly applied in the context of porosity or hydraulic conductivity it describes the idea that for each porous media an appropriate scale of measurement exists such that the measured values are the same within that elementary volume independent of the point of measurement and hence reliably representative of the environmental system under investigation freeze and cherry 1979 the novel application of this concept to csia data and the statistical determination of in situ biodegradation rate constants λ was described in detail previously gilevska et al 2019 briefly if the difference between degradation rate constants calculated using isotope ratios between two successive peeper chambers 3 cm apart is smaller than the propagated error the calculated rates values are considered to be representative of the same rev zone hence a rev zone is defined as a zone within which a statistically identical and hence representative biodegradation rate constant can be calculated for that sediment interval in the present study this statistical approach is applied to chlorine isotope data and rev zones are identified based on statistically significant differences in biodegradation rate constants α 0 05 kruskal wallis post hoc dunn test following the same method used to determine rev based on carbon isotope data for this site in gilevska et al 2019 2 4 calculation and reporting of λ measured δ13c and δ37cl values were used to generate dual isotope plots following the methods of ojeda et al 2019 values of λ together with slope error and 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the york method implemented in the r package vermeesch 2018 two parameters were used to evaluate the quality of the regression reduced chi squared test χw 2 and probability of χw 2 p χw 2 if the assigned errors are the only cause of scatter the χw 2 will tend to be near 1 χw 2 values much greater than 1 generally indicate either underestimated analytical errors or the presence of non analytical scatter χw 2 values much less than 1 generally indicate either over estimated analytical error or unrecognized error correlations the χw 2 value can be statistically compared to 1 producing a p χw 2 value thus quantifying the model fit the default value for this minimum probability of fit parameter is p χw 2 0 15 37 datasets with p χw 2 values that produced a poor model fit i e p χw 2 0 15 were not carried for further analysis regression slopes were compared using a z test paternoster et al 1998 and statistical significance was evaluated at α 0 05 the theoretical λ λt of 1 80 0 31 for microbial reductive dechlorination of mcb under anaerobic conditions was calculated based on the average of published apparent kinetic isotope effects akie cl of 1 0091 table s1 and εc 5 0 0 2 from liang et al 2011 marchesi et al 2018 published an estimated λt of 1 010 but included both abiotic and biotic studies in the calculation potentially biasing the value in favor of the abiotic reactions that could proceed by several reaction mechanisms butler and hayes 1999 here the akie cl was calculated using only the data available for microbial reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents to provide the basis for a comparison between the theoretical and the field λ values table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 multi element isotopic evidence for anaerobic mcb degradation figs 1 and s4 show carbon chlorine and hydrogen isotopes signature profiles and concentration fig s4 of mcb along the sediment water interface swi for locations 130 and 132 there is steady isotope enrichment in 13c and 37cl over the whole profile for mcb although chlorine isotope measurements were more variable similarly for locations 135 and 131 below 16 and 14 cm respectively significant isotopic co enrichment trends in 13c and 37cl were observed liang et al 2011 showed that degradation of mcb under aerobic conditions did not result in isotope fractionation in carbon isotopes while marchesi et al 2018 showed a small enrichment in chlorine isotopes εcl 0 6 during biodegradation in contrast biodegradation under anaerobic conditions shows significant carbon isotope enrichment εc 5 0 liang et al 2011 but no εcl data has been published to date to make similar comparisons for chlorine for other chlorinated hydrocarbons both carbon and chlorine enrichment is observed during degradation in anaerobic environments buchner et al 2015 cretnik et al 2014 kuder et al 2013 wiegert et al 2013 consistent with ccl bond breaking as the rate limiting step the consistent isotopic enrichment in both 13c and 37cl in mcb in all the profiles fig 1 is suggestive of anaerobic reductive dechlorination the upper portion of the sediment showed different carbon and chlorine trends in location 131 a reversal in the trend in isotope values to more negative values in these uppermost few samples and a similar pattern is seen only for the carbon isotopes in location 135 fig 1 the possibility of a transition from anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions at the uppermost sampling ports for these two profiles was considered however the redox potentials suggest anaerobic conditions at all depths redox pairs indicated sulfate reducing conditions dominated the sediment redox potential at the sediment water interface while iron reducing or methanogenic conditions dominated in the sediment profile below 3 cm gilevska et al 2019 likewise the isotopic trends were not consistent with a shift to degradation under aerobic conditions for example the pronounced isotopic depletion in 37cl at location 131 is not consistent with the small 37cl enrichment factors observed during aerobic degradation εcl 0 6 marchesi et al 2018 hence the isotopic depletion in 13c and 37cl observed in the last few data points in the upper portion of the sediment of these two locations cannot be explained at the present time but may reflect physical processes such as sediment disturbance or mixing hydrogen signatures among the four locations ranged from 70 to 130 these isotope signatures were likely the result of different degrees of degradation of the mcb source transported upwards from the underlying aquifer units but having undergone different degrees of biodegradation prior to entering the sediment profiles this has been observed before in carbon isotope signatures and supported by the previous work gilevska et al 2019 overall any variations in δ2h are small in the 4 profiles compared to those observed for chlorinate and carbon not unexpected as h does not participate in the carbon chlorine bond cleavage during reductive dechlorination of mcb a small overall enrichment in 2h values for mcb 25 was seen in location 131 the profile with the highest degradation activity the pattern might suggest a secondary hydrogen isotope effect fig 1 in this location that is when a heavy isotope in this case 2h is present only in adjacent positions to the reacting bond and therefore affects the fractionation observed during reaction typically to only a small extent hunkeler et al 2008 however because of the extent of the enrichment trend combined with the uncertainty of the measurements of the environmental samples additional laboratory experiments and modeling studies are required to delineate the reasons for hydrogen isotope fractionation during mcb degradation in this profile 3 2 evidence for anaerobic benzene degradation and production the hydrogen isotope profile of benzene was measured in all locations except location 135 where concentrations were too low for hydrogen isotope analysis of the locations where hydrogen isotope measurements were feasible location 131 has the most significant isotope depletion trend fig 2 reinforced by the co variation observed in both carbon and hydrogen isotope values as products of biodegradation accumulate their more isotopically depleted values i e more negative δ values added to the porewaters can result in the trend observed here as δ13c values become more and more negative from 53 cm to 22 cm below the swi due to the addition of benzene produced from biodegradation of mcb fig 2 similar depletion trends in hydrogen isotopes were measured during the production of cis 1 2 dichloroethene from tce kuder et al 2013 and further supported by modeling van breukelen et al 2017 in locations 130 and 132 no change outside of analytical uncertainty is observed for the admittedly small number of δ2h values obtained fig s4 despite carbon and chlorine isotopic evidence for mcb degradation this might be explained by the balance between the multiplicity of processes transport degradation production influencing benzene isotope values the extent of these processes and the concentration of both benzene and mcb for location 131 for samples above 22 cm the trend reverses within the shaded zone shown in fig 2 that reflects the previously identified highest rates of biodegradation potential δ13c values become less and less negative this is consistent with there being the zone with a significant rate of benzene biodegradation in addition to the production of benzene as a product of mcb biodegradation fischer et al 2009 mancini et al 2008 2003 the net isotopic depletion trend 53 to 22 cm versus isotopic enrichment trend 22 to 14 cm is a function of the relative rates of simultaneous benzene production and benzene degradation ultimately as the swi is approached that biodegradative processes dominate 3 3 application of rev zones to calculate biodegradation rate constants via chlorine isotope fractionation some sediments are relatively homogeneous and uniform rates of biodegradation are observed passeport et al 2016 in successive sediment intervals in many cases however biological activity and biodegradation potential vary significantly due to small scale variations in nutrients and electron acceptors and donors among other factors and in such cases appropriate high resolution sampling techniques may be required to identify and to determine rates of the most biologically active zones in the sediment profile abe et al 2009 damgaard et al 2013 hunkeler et al 2004 identification of these active zones which account for the greatest in situ loss of contaminants allows for better assessment of the sediment decontamination potential a statistical rev approach was introduced in our previous work to identify and calculate in situ biodegradation rate constants for zones with both high and low rates of biodegradation based on high resolution carbon isotope values referred to here as carbon rev zones gilevska et al 2019 in this study chlorine isotope values and statistical tests were used to independently define chlorine rev zones table 1 fig s5 the carbon rev zones previous study gilevska et al 2019 and chlorine rev zones this study are compared in table 1 furthermore the rate constants for mcb biodegradation derived from chlorine isotope values λcl were calculated for each chlorine rev zone and can be compared to those calculated from carbon isotope values λc table 1 in general there is good agreement between the rev zones using both methods although as expected the more sensitive signal associated with carbon isotope effects means that in some cases such as locations 132 and 135 carbon based data suggest 2 or 3 rev zones while chlorine data identifies only one regardless both carbon and chlorine isotope data provide the same estimated biodegradation rate within uncertainty for location 130 carbon and chlorine isotope trends both identified one rev zone reflecting the fact that the calculated biodegradation rate constants are statistically uniform across the whole profile similarly the rev zones and rate constants based on both carbon and chloride isotope data show good agreement at location 131 where the same three zones were identified table 1 the only notable difference was an offset in the transition between the upper two rev zones by two sampling ports approximately 6 cm regardless in both cases a very consistent rate constant of mcb biodegradation of between 1 0 and 1 3 year 1 was identified table 1 both carbon and chlorine based data identify the zones with the highest biodegradation potential and provide coherent estimates of the rates of biodegradation across these profiles 3 4 dual isotope analysis enrichment or depletion in isotope values across the swi profiles can indicate changes in the balance of biodegradation rates and or changes in the reaction mechanism as noted above dual isotope analysis and the resulting λ values reduce the influence of masking effects and provide more direct insight into the reaction mechanism and hence are critical to evaluate before the results from biodegradation rate estimates are finalized mancini et al 2006 meyer et al 2009 ratti et al 2015 for each profile in this study calculated λc cl values using δ37cl versus δ13c are presented in table 2 and fig 3 for all the field data a statistical test must first be applied to determine if the mathematical model used for regression is a reasonable fit in general a reliable λc cl is confirmed by an acceptable regression model fit usually evaluated by an r2 value for ordinary least squares or χw 2 for the york method ojeda et al 2019 vermeesch 2018 in this study the criteria used to establish acceptable model fits is p χw 2 0 15 see calculation and reporting of λ typically after a reliable λc cl was calculated the λc cl is compared to laboratory studies that constrained the range of λc cl observed for different reaction mechanisms ojeda et al 2020 and by comparison the most likely reaction mechanism at the site can be inferred however few mcb laboratory experiments have been performed to determine λc cl values for possible reaction mechanisms so in this case a direct comparison between laboratory constrained λ and field data is not possible to circumvent this issue a theoretical λt of 1 80 0 31 was calculated see calculation and reporting of λ representing biologically mediated reductive dechlorination mechanisms from the literature the field derived λc cl values were statistically compared to this λt value to determine if reductive dechlorination is the most likely reaction mechanism the λc cl of the full profile referred to as λfull and λc cl of the rev zone with the highest biodegradation activity referred to as λrev were also compared since the carbon rev zones displayed higher sensitivity to biodegradation the carbon rev zones were used to define the sediment interval with the highest biodegradation activity fig 1 shaded regions and used to compare the λfull and λrev for locations 130 and 131 the λfull displayed acceptable regression fits p χw 2 0 15 and were statistically similar to the theoretical calculation z test α 0 05 table 2 and fig 2 the agreement of the λfull compared with λt confirms that anaerobic reductive dechlorination is likely to account for contaminant transformation and remediation in the sediment profile at these locations for location 130 there was only one carbon rev zone determined so there is no λfull and λ rev comparison available the λrev for location 131 table 2 blue points fig 3 is not significantly different from the λfull z test α 0 05 suggesting a similar mechanism for the whole profile for location 135 the λfull displayed an acceptable regression model fit p χw 2 0 15 but was statistically different from λt z score 2 9 calculation of λrev for location 135 was not possible due to a poor regression model fit of the regression table 2 a closer look at the dual isotope plot for this location shows that the data points are clustered around zero and only two points show changes in carbon and chlorine isotope values greater than analytical uncertainty 0 5 carbon 0 3 chlorine fig 3 although the λfull showed an acceptable model fit it is possible that λc cl in location 135 is not a true representation of the reaction mechanism due to the small number of points with large shifts in isotopic values in other words the extent of degradation in this location in combination with analytical errors might not provide sufficient evidence to establish consistent mechanistic processes from isotope data of course it is also possible that this location represents a different mechanism of anaerobic dechlorination or that processes or the extent of processes happening within the sediment at this location varied at an even smaller scale than our methods were able to capture for location 132 similar to location 135 all the points are clustered around zero and the regression model fit was poor p χw 2 0 15 for λfull and λrev table 2 and fig s6 the χw 2 statistic indicated that either the model is improperly fitting or the uncertainty in the data has been overestimated vermeesch 2018 overall when comparative analyses were feasible i e there was an acceptable model fit and comparisons between λs were appropriate for the studied sediment profiles they showed remarkable consistency in both carbon and chlorine isotope interpretations the consistency between λt and λfull indicates that the major pathway of in situ mcb degradation is likely microbial reductive dehalogenation furthermore there was also an agreement between λfull and λrev for location 131 despite differences in rate constants of biodegradation table 1 suggesting the reaction mechanism was consistent over the whole profile most importantly this analysis suggests that changes in observed isotopic values can indeed be attributed to changes in biodegradation rates without the complicating factor of isotopic effects related to different reaction mechanisms controlling transformation for mcb 4 conclusions quantification of in situ rates of biodegradation remains challenging particularly at complex field sites where multiple contaminants are present where processes of transport and transformation are occurring simultaneously and most importantly where some compounds such as mcb and benzene are both the product of biodegradation but also themselves undergoing biotransformation this study provides the first multi element approach c h cl to decipher the relative importance of these effects at a complex site contaminated by chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene by integrating csia with a statistical approach of evaluating the zones of highest biodegradation potential using the concept of representative elemental volume isotopic evidence based on both carbon and chlorine data supports biotransformation of mcb via reductive dehalogenation in all sediment locations carbon and hydrogen isotope data similarly support biodegradation of benzene across the swi degradation rate constants calculated independently using a rev approach based on carbon and chlorine isotopes were consistent between both independent approaches reinforcing the power of this combination of analytical statistical and modeling techniques for quantifying remediation

16507,industrial chemicals are frequently detected in sediments due to a legacy of chemical spills globally site remedies for groundwater and sediment decontamination include natural attenuation by in situ abiotic and biotic processes compound specific isotope analysis csia is a diagnostic tool to identify quantify and characterize degradation processes in situ and in some cases can differentiate between abiotic degradation and biodegradation this study reports high resolution carbon chlorine and hydrogen stable isotope profiles for monochlorobenzene mcb and carbon and hydrogen stable isotope profiles for benzene coupled with measurements of pore water concentrations in contaminated sediments multi element isotopic analysis of δ13c and δ37cl for mcb were used to generate dual isotope plots which for 2 locations at the study site resulted in λc cl 130 values of 1 42 0 19 and λc cl 131 values of 1 70 0 15 consistent with theoretical calculations for carbon chlorine bond cleavage λ t 1 80 0 31 via microbial reductive dechlorination for benzene significant δ2h 122 and δ13c 6 depletion trends followed by enrichment trends in δ13c 1 6 in the upper part of the sediment were observed at the same location indicating not only production of benzene due to biodegradation of mcb but subsequent biotransformation of benzene itself to nontoxic end products degradation rate constants calculated independently using chlorine isotopic data and carbon isotopic data respectively agreed within uncertainty thus providing multiple lines of evidence for in situ contaminant degradation via reductive dechlorination and providing the foundation for a novel approach to determine site specific in situ rate estimates essential for the prediction of remediation outcomes and timelines graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stable isotopes csia biodegradation dual isotopes 1 introduction monochlorobenzene mcb is a direct and indirect product of industrial manufacturing mcb is used in herbicides and dyes and as a manufacturing intermediate in the production of adhesives polishes and drugs malcolm et al 2004 mcb is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and humans targeting the liver kidney and hematopoietic systems who chronicle 2011 water quality can be compromised when mcb is discharged into the environment padmanabhan et al 2005 although physicochemical properties suggest that mcb is adsorbed to the sediment and quickly undergoes degradation in an oxygen rich environment transforming mcb into nontoxic co2 kurt et al 2012 kurt and spain 2013 mcb can be more persistent in anaerobic environments although it has been shown to biodegrade via reductive dechlorination under methanogenic iron reducing and sulfate reducing conditions producing benzene and where sufficient electron donors exist co2 gilevska et al 2019 masunaga et al 1996 passeport et al 2016 given the toxicity of benzene complete mineralization to co2 is the remediation goal yardley jones et al 1991 a number of remediation strategies for mcb have proven effective for anaerobic contaminated sediments including dredging capping solidification and monitored natural recovery mnr mulligan et al 2009 mnr relies on sediment decontamination by taking advantage of in situ abiotic and biotic mechanisms and is also cost effective and sustainable because it avoids disturbing the system in ways that could promote redistribution of contaminants e g triggering concentration increases due to desorption from newly exposed sediments for mnr to be an effective remediation strategy a detailed understanding of the chemical and physical processes happening within the sediment and across the sediment water interface swi is important to ensure that the natural processes are occurring at an adequate rate to be protective of the environment office of land and emergency management 2017 typical contaminant site monitoring and degradation rate estimation relies on concentration measurements of the contaminant over time wilson and chapelle 1998 concentration decreases can be a result of volatilization adsorption diffusion or biodegradation only the last of which removes the contaminant from the environment completely via transformation compound specific isotope analysis csia paired with high resolution sampling has previously been used to identify biodegradation potential and quantify the rate of decontamination of the environment from mcb by distinguishing between concentration decreases due to actual transformation from those related to non degradative processes of phase change or transport gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 csia has emerged as a diagnostic tool that aids in remediation efforts by identifying changes in the isotopic signature of the contaminant within the plume hunkeler et al 2008 csia involves measuring the ratio of a heavy isotope of an element he to the light isotope le in a compound and is reported in the delta notation as δhe where e refers to any element with stable isotopes urey 1947 during reactions chemical bonds containing exclusively the light isotopes e g 12c 2h 35cl are broken at a faster rate than those containing one of the heavier isotopes e g 13c 2h 37cl this fractionation results in an isotopic enrichment in the heavy isotope in the remaining contaminant pool as transformation proceeds under many circumstances it has been shown that physical processes show smaller isotopic fractionation effects compared to larger fractionation associated with bond breakage during degradation hunkeler et al 2008 providing a tool for identifying transformation of contaminants the magnitude of fractionation the enrichment factor ε for a given element and transformation process can be determined in laboratory studies using the rayleigh model in situ rates of biodegradation can be calculated for applications to field based concentrations and isotopic measurements when the seepage velocity is known gilevska et al 2019 even controlled laboratory fractionation experiments can be influenced by a number of additional rate limiting steps transport across the cell membrane ehrl et al 2019 renpenning et al 2015 low substrate bioavailability sherwood lollar et al 2010 or substrate enzyme binding mancini et al 2006 any of which can mask the intrinsic isotope effect normally associated with bond cleavage partly to deal with this issue more robust methods to identify distinct transformation pathways involve measuring the isotopic fractionation of multiple elements for a given contaminant to generate a dual isotope plot e g δδ37cl δδ13c in theory all elements in the molecule are affected in a similar way by the masking processes mentioned above eliminating the bias observed for ε plotting the measured changes in δhe1 vs δhe2 gives the slope λ which is typically more representative of the bond cleaving transformation reactions there are examples where this is not the case i e where two elements are affected differently by masking processes gafni et al 2020 but to date these are the exception extending carefully determined values of λ from laboratory controlled experiments and microcosms to the field has been successful for well studied toxic compounds like methyl tert butyl ether btex compounds chlorinated ethenes and ethanes nitro aromatics and micropollutants fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2011 nelson et al 2011 however to extend this approach for less studied contaminants like mcb and in environments where there are multiple mechanisms involved in degradation there is a need for laboratory constrained data for isotopic fractionation of elements other than carbon and for field studies integrating multi element csia measurements at sufficient resolution to produce carbon hydrogen chlorine and concentration data on a representative spatial scale the concept of representative elementary volume rev most commonly applied in the context of porosity or hydraulic conductivity can be useful to statistically evaluate degradation rates derived from isotopic data particularly for identifying formations or sedimentary layers with the highest potential rates of biodegradation gilevska et al 2019 this study aims 1 to investigate the changes in chlorine carbon and hydrogen isotope values for mcb and of the latter two elements for benzene 2 to investigate thereby the in situ degradation potential of these compounds via a high resolution sampling study in sediments approaching the sediment water interface 3 to extend the rev approach to a dual isotope system for in situ rates of biodegradation calculated independently from the carbon and chlorine isotope data and 4 to calculate λc cl for mcb to evaluate potential degradation pathways 2 methods 2 1 study site mcb is present in the sediments underlying a freshwater canal as a legacy of past industrial manufacturing nearby gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 the canal is isolated from the contaminant plume by a sheet pile barrier installed at the edge of the canal over a decade ago to restrict further hydrogeologic connection between the contaminated groundwater and canal sediments therefore any contamination at this time in the canal sediments is a legacy from residual chlorinated aromatics and their degradation product benzene sediment thickness ranges from approximately 0 15 m at the banks to 1 4 m in the middle of the canal the canal sediment texture ranges from silty loam to sandy loam with a total organic content of 2 5 passeport et al 2016 a detailed description of the redox conditions at the study site including concentration profiles of all redox sensitive species can be found in gilevska et al 2019 additional site details including geologic setting hydrogeologic parameters and contaminant distribution are provided in prior publications kurt and spain 2013 passeport et al 2016 for this study pore water samples from the canal were collected from the upper portion of the sediment layer by in situ passive diffusion membrane samplers peepers after the methods described in gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 unlike earlier studies which involved only 3 relatively short 30 cm passive diffusion samplers and or measured only carbon isotope signatures this study uses peepers installed to much greater sediment depth 60 90 cm at 4 locations and applied a multi isotope approach incorporating carbon hydrogen and chlorine isotope analysis the previously published studies identified strong biodegradation capacity in these sediments fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2011 nelson et al 2011 and rate constants of biodegradation were calculated using both conventional environmental protection agency epa protocols based on concentration and independently derived csia approaches gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 here the multi isotope approach provides independent lines of evidence to evaluate the location and rates of highest biodegradation capacity across the sediment water interface and to compare with the previous findings based on a single isotope system carbon 2 2 stable isotope analysis and standardization stable carbon isotope analysis was performed

oxidation reactor thermo scientific 1 040 920 and conversion unit gc c iii for quantitative conversion of compounds to co2 the same configuration was used for hydrogen isotope analysis with the exception that a custom chromium reactor was made gilevska et al 2020 renpenning et al 2017 for quantitative conversion of hydrogen bearing compounds to h2 the injector temperature was 210 c with a fixed column flow of 1 5 ml min which is further restricted by the chromium oven to 1 2 ml min the gc was equipped with a vocol capillary column 60 m x 0 25 mm 3μm thickness with an initial hold

incorporating both accuracy and reproducibility in isotope measurements was 7 for hydrogen the community consensus to report not simply reproducibility precision based on running replicates at the same signal size but a larger and more representative total uncertainty to ensure accuracy related to the linearity effects of continuous flow whereby samples and standards may be run within a range

chlorine further iaea national institute of standards and technology nist standards for compound specific hydrogen isotope analysis remain few and to that end the community consensus has been to develop in house compound specific hydrogen isotopic standards for a wide variety of materials by cross calibrating to elemental analyses ea gehre et al 2017 gilevska et al 2020 hunkeler et al 2008

chlorine isotopic measurements including accuracy and reproducibility was 0 3 all isotopic measurements are reported in delta notation following eq 1 elsner 2010 1 δ h e h e l e s a m p l e h e l e s t a n d a r d 1 where δhe is the isotopic value in per mil h e l e sample is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in the sample and h e l e standard is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in an international isotopic standard like pee dee belemnite pdb for carbon isotopes vsmow for hydrogen isotopes standard mean ocean chloride smoc for chlorine isotopes 2 3 calculation of representative elementary volume rev the concept of representative elementary volume rev is a major principle in hydrogeology most commonly applied in the context of porosity or hydraulic conductivity it describes the idea that for each porous media an appropriate scale of measurement exists such that the measured values are the same within that elementary volume independent of the point of measurement and hence reliably representative of the environmental system under investigation freeze and cherry 1979 the novel application of this concept to csia data and the statistical determination of in situ biodegradation rate constants λ was described in detail previously gilevska et al 2019 briefly if the difference between degradation rate constants calculated using isotope ratios between two successive peeper chambers 3 cm apart is smaller than the propagated error the calculated rates values are considered to be representative of the same rev zone hence a rev zone is defined as a zone within which a statistically identical and hence representative biodegradation rate constant can be calculated for that sediment interval in the present study this statistical approach is applied to chlorine isotope data and rev zones are identified based on statistically significant differences in biodegradation rate constants α 0 05 kruskal wallis post hoc dunn test following the same method used to determine rev based on carbon isotope data for this site in gilevska et al 2019 2 4 calculation and reporting of λ measured δ13c and δ37cl values were used to generate dual isotope plots following the methods of ojeda et al 2019 values of λ together with slope error and 95 confidence intervals were calculated using the york method implemented in the r package vermeesch 2018 two parameters were used to evaluate the quality of the regression reduced chi squared test χw 2 and probability of χw 2 p χw 2 if the assigned errors are the only cause of scatter the χw 2 will tend to be near 1 χw 2 values much greater than 1 generally indicate either underestimated analytical errors or the presence of non analytical scatter χw 2 values much less than 1 generally indicate either over estimated analytical error or unrecognized error correlations the χw 2 value can be statistically compared to 1 producing a p χw 2 value thus quantifying the model fit the default value for this minimum probability of fit parameter is p χw 2 0 15 37 datasets with p χw 2 values that produced a poor model fit i e p χw 2 0 15 were not carried for further analysis regression slopes were compared using a z test paternoster et al 1998 and statistical significance was evaluated at α 0 05 the theoretical λ λt of 1 80 0 31 for microbial reductive dechlorination of mcb under anaerobic conditions was calculated based on the average of published apparent kinetic isotope effects akie cl of 1 0091 table s1 and εc 5 0 0 2 from liang et al 2011 marchesi et al 2018 published an estimated λt of 1 010 but included both abiotic and biotic studies in the calculation potentially biasing the value in favor of the abiotic reactions that could proceed by several reaction mechanisms butler and hayes 1999 here the akie cl was calculated using only the data available for microbial reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents to provide the basis for a comparison between the theoretical and the field λ values table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 multi element isotopic evidence for anaerobic mcb degradation figs 1 and s4 show carbon chlorine and hydrogen isotopes signature profiles and concentration fig s4 of mcb along the sediment water interface swi for locations 130 and 132 there is steady isotope enrichment in 13c and 37cl over the whole profile for mcb although chlorine isotope measurements were more variable similarly for locations 135 and 131 below 16 and 14 cm respectively significant isotopic co enrichment trends in 13c and 37cl were observed liang et al 2011 showed that degradation of mcb under aerobic conditions did not result in isotope fractionation in carbon isotopes while marchesi et al 2018 showed a small enrichment in chlorine isotopes εcl 0 6 during biodegradation in contrast biodegradation under anaerobic conditions shows significant carbon isotope enrichment εc 5 0 liang et al 2011 but no εcl data has been published to date to make similar comparisons for chlorine for other chlorinated hydrocarbons both carbon and chlorine enrichment is observed during degradation in anaerobic environments buchner et al 2015 cretnik et al 2014 kuder et al 2013 wiegert et al 2013 consistent with ccl bond breaking as the rate limiting step the consistent isotopic enrichment in both 13c and 37cl in mcb in all the profiles fig 1 is suggestive of anaerobic reductive dechlorination the upper portion of the sediment showed different carbon and chlorine trends in location 131 a reversal in the trend in isotope values to more negative values in these uppermost few samples and a similar pattern is seen only for the carbon isotopes in location 135 fig 1 the possibility of a transition from anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions at the uppermost sampling ports for these two profiles was considered however the redox potentials suggest anaerobic conditions at all depths redox pairs indicated sulfate reducing conditions dominated the sediment redox potential at the sediment water interface while iron reducing or methanogenic conditions dominated in the sediment profile below 3 cm gilevska et al 2019 likewise the isotopic trends were not consistent with a shift to degradation under aerobic conditions for example the pronounced isotopic depletion in 37cl at location 131 is not consistent with the small 37cl enrichment factors observed during aerobic degradation εcl 0 6 marchesi et al 2018 hence the isotopic depletion in 13c and 37cl observed in the last few data points in the upper portion of the sediment of these two locations cannot be explained at the present time but may reflect physical processes such as sediment disturbance or mixing hydrogen signatures among the four locations ranged from 70 to 130 these isotope signatures were likely the result of different degrees of degradation of the mcb source transported upwards from the underlying aquifer units but having undergone different degrees of biodegradation prior to entering the sediment profiles this has been observed before in carbon isotope signatures and supported by the previous work gilevska et al 2019 overall any variations in δ2h are small in the 4 profiles compared to those observed for chlorinate and carbon not unexpected as h does not participate in the carbon chlorine bond cleavage during reductive dechlorination of mcb a small overall enrichment in 2h values for mcb 25 was seen in location 131 the profile with the highest degradation activity the pattern might suggest a secondary hydrogen isotope effect fig 1 in this location that is when a heavy isotope in this case 2h is present only in adjacent positions to the reacting bond and therefore affects the fractionation observed during reaction typically to only a small extent hunkeler et al 2008 however because of the extent of the enrichment trend combined with the uncertainty of the measurements of the environmental samples additional laboratory experiments and modeling studies are required to delineate the reasons for hydrogen isotope fractionation during mcb degradation in this profile 3 2 evidence for anaerobic benzene degradation and production the hydrogen isotope profile of benzene was measured in all locations except location 135 where concentrations were too low for hydrogen isotope analysis of the locations where hydrogen isotope measurements were feasible location 131 has the most significant isotope depletion trend fig 2 reinforced by the co variation observed in both carbon and hydrogen isotope values as products of biodegradation accumulate their more isotopically depleted values i e more negative δ values added to the porewaters can result in the trend observed here as δ13c values become more and more negative from 53 cm to 22 cm below the swi due to the addition of benzene produced from biodegradation of mcb fig 2 similar depletion trends in hydrogen isotopes were measured during the production of cis 1 2 dichloroethene from tce kuder et al 2013 and further supported by modeling van breukelen et al 2017 in locations 130 and 132 no change outside of analytical uncertainty is observed for the admittedly small number of δ2h values obtained fig s4 despite carbon and chlorine isotopic evidence for mcb degradation this might be explained by the balance between the multiplicity of processes transport degradation production influencing benzene isotope values the extent of these processes and the concentration of both benzene and mcb for location 131 for samples above 22 cm the trend reverses within the shaded zone shown in fig 2 that reflects the previously identified highest rates of biodegradation potential δ13c values become less and less negative this is consistent with there being the zone with a significant rate of benzene biodegradation in addition to the production of benzene as a product of mcb biodegradation fischer et al 2009 mancini et al 2008 2003 the net isotopic depletion trend 53 to 22 cm versus isotopic enrichment trend 22 to 14 cm is a function of the relative rates of simultaneous benzene production and benzene degradation ultimately as the swi is approached that biodegradative processes dominate 3 3 application of rev zones to calculate biodegradation rate constants via chlorine isotope fractionation some sediments are relatively homogeneous and uniform rates of biodegradation are observed passeport et al 2016 in successive sediment intervals in many cases however biological activity and biodegradation potential vary significantly due to small scale variations in nutrients and electron acceptors and donors among other factors and in such cases appropriate high resolution sampling techniques may be required to identify and to determine rates of the most biologically active zones in the sediment profile abe et al 2009 damgaard et al 2013 hunkeler et al 2004 identification of these active zones which account for the greatest in situ loss of contaminants allows for better assessment of the sediment decontamination potential a statistical rev approach was introduced in our previous work to identify and calculate in situ biodegradation rate constants for zones with both high and low rates of biodegradation based on high resolution carbon isotope values referred to here as carbon rev zones gilevska et al 2019 in this study chlorine isotope values and statistical tests were used to independently define chlorine rev zones table 1 fig s5 the carbon rev zones previous study gilevska et al 2019 and chlorine rev zones this study are compared in table 1 furthermore the rate constants for mcb biodegradation derived from chlorine isotope values λcl were calculated for each chlorine rev zone and can be compared to those calculated from carbon isotope values λc table 1 in general there is good agreement between the rev zones using both methods although as expected the more sensitive signal associated with carbon isotope effects means that in some cases such as locations 132 and 135 carbon based data suggest 2 or 3 rev zones while chlorine data identifies only one regardless both carbon and chlorine isotope data provide the same estimated biodegradation rate within uncertainty for location 130 carbon and chlorine isotope trends both identified one rev zone reflecting the fact that the calculated biodegradation rate constants are statistically uniform across the whole profile similarly the rev zones and rate constants based on both carbon and chloride isotope data show good agreement at location 131 where the same three zones were identified table 1 the only notable difference was an offset in the transition between the upper two rev zones by two sampling ports approximately 6 cm regardless in both cases a very consistent rate constant of mcb biodegradation of between 1 0 and 1 3 year 1 was identified table 1 both carbon and chlorine based data identify the zones with the highest biodegradation potential and provide coherent estimates of the rates of biodegradation across these profiles 3 4 dual isotope analysis enrichment or depletion in isotope values across the swi profiles can indicate changes in the balance of biodegradation rates and or changes in the reaction mechanism as noted above dual isotope analysis and the resulting λ values reduce the influence of masking effects and provide more direct insight into the reaction mechanism and hence are critical to evaluate before the results from biodegradation rate estimates are finalized mancini et al 2006 meyer et al 2009 ratti et al 2015 for each profile in this study calculated λc cl values using δ37cl versus δ13c are presented in table 2 and fig 3 for all the field data a statistical test must first be applied to determine if the mathematical model used for regression is a reasonable fit in general a reliable λc cl is confirmed by an acceptable regression model fit usually evaluated by an r2 value for ordinary least squares or χw 2 for the york method ojeda et al 2019 vermeesch 2018 in this study the criteria used to establish acceptable model fits is p χw 2 0 15 see calculation and reporting of λ typically after a reliable λc cl was calculated the λc cl is compared to laboratory studies that constrained the range of λc cl observed for different reaction mechanisms ojeda et al 2020 and by comparison the most likely reaction mechanism at the site can be inferred however few mcb laboratory experiments have been performed to determine λc cl values for possible reaction mechanisms so in this case a direct comparison between laboratory constrained λ and field data is not possible to circumvent this issue a theoretical λt of 1 80 0 31 was calculated see calculation and reporting of λ representing biologically mediated reductive dechlorination mechanisms from the literature the field derived λc cl values were statistically compared to this λt value to determine if reductive dechlorination is the most likely reaction mechanism the λc cl of the full profile referred to as λfull and λc cl of the rev zone with the highest biodegradation activity referred to as λrev were also compared since the carbon rev zones displayed higher sensitivity to biodegradation the carbon rev zones were used to define the sediment interval with the highest biodegradation activity fig 1 shaded regions and used to compare the λfull and λrev for locations 130 and 131 the λfull displayed acceptable regression fits p χw 2 0 15 and were statistically similar to the theoretical calculation z test α 0 05 table 2 and fig 2 the agreement of the λfull compared with λt confirms that anaerobic reductive dechlorination is likely to account for contaminant transformation and remediation in the sediment profile at these locations for location 130 there was only one carbon rev zone determined so there is no λfull and λ rev comparison available the λrev for location 131 table 2 blue points fig 3 is not significantly different from the λfull z test α 0 05 suggesting a similar mechanism for the whole profile for location 135 the λfull displayed an acceptable regression model fit p χw 2 0 15 but was statistically different from λt z score 2 9 calculation of λrev for location 135 was not possible due to a poor regression model fit of the regression table 2 a closer look at the dual isotope plot for this location shows that the data points are clustered around zero and only two points show changes in carbon and chlorine isotope values greater than analytical uncertainty 0 5 carbon 0 3 chlorine fig 3 although the λfull showed an acceptable model fit it is possible that λc cl in location 135 is not a true representation of the reaction mechanism due to the small number of points with large shifts in isotopic values in other words the extent of degradation in this location in combination with analytical errors might not provide sufficient evidence to establish consistent mechanistic processes from isotope data of course it is also possible that this location represents a different mechanism of anaerobic dechlorination or that processes or the extent of processes happening within the sediment at this location varied at an even smaller scale than our methods were able to capture for location 132 similar to location 135 all the points are clustered around zero and the regression model fit was poor p χw 2 0 15 for λfull and λrev table 2 and fig s6 the χw 2 statistic indicated that either the model is improperly fitting or the uncertainty in the data has been overestimated vermeesch 2018 overall when comparative analyses were feasible i e there was an acceptable model fit and comparisons between λs were appropriate for the studied sediment profiles they showed remarkable consistency in both carbon and chlorine isotope interpretations the consistency between λt and λfull indicates that the major pathway of in situ mcb degradation is likely microbial reductive dehalogenation furthermore there was also an agreement between λfull and λrev for location 131 despite differences in rate constants of biodegradation table 1 suggesting the reaction mechanism was consistent over the whole profile most importantly this analysis suggests that changes in observed isotopic values can indeed be attributed to changes in biodegradation rates without the complicating factor of isotopic effects related to different reaction mechanisms controlling transformation for mcb 4 conclusions quantification of in situ rates of biodegradation remains challenging particularly at complex field sites where multiple contaminants are present where processes of transport and transformation are occurring simultaneously and most importantly where some compounds such as mcb and benzene are both the product of biodegradation but also themselves undergoing biotransformation this study provides the first multi element approach c h cl to decipher the relative importance of these effects at a complex site contaminated by chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene by integrating csia with a statistical approach of evaluating the zones of highest biodegradation potential using the concept of representative elemental volume isotopic evidence based on both carbon and chlorine data supports biotransformation of mcb via reductive dehalogenation in all sediment locations carbon and hydrogen isotope data similarly support biodegradation of benzene across the swi degradation rate constants calculated independently using a rev approach based on carbon and chlorine isotopes were consistent between both independent approaches reinforcing the power of this combination of analytical statistical and modeling techniques for quantifying remediation of priority pollutants increasingly field site remediation strategies rely on in situ abiotic and biotic mechanisms which can contribute to cost effective and sustainable environmental solutions because they avoid disturbing the system in ways that could promote redistribution of contaminants e g triggering concentration increases due to desorption from newly exposed sediments monitoring and demonstrating the effectiveness of such in situ remediation however requires techniques to quantitatively constrain the amount of contaminant transformation the approach developed in this study will further the application by bioremediation practitioners investigating fate of organic compounds in complex contaminated sites around the world by providing multiple lines of evidence in support for

16508,feed spacers are an essential part of spiral wound modules for reverse osmosis ro they create flow channels between membrane sheets and manipulate hydrodynamic conditions to control membrane fouling in this work additive manufacturing polyjet was used to print novel sinusoidal spacers with wavy axial filaments connected by perpendicular st or slanted sl transverse filaments when tested with 2 g l nacl solution conventional and sl spacers had similar flux while the st spacer had about 5 7 lower flux the pressure losses for st and sl spacers increased by up to 3 folds depending on the flow condition in the colloidal silica fouling and biofouling tests the sinusoidal spacers showed lower membrane permeability decrease of 46 for st 41 for sl vs 56 for conventional and 26 for st 22 for sl vs 33 for conventional respectively optical coherence tomography images from colloidal silica fouling and confocal images from biofouling tests revealed that fouling patterns were closely associated with the local hydrodynamic conditions overall sinusoidal spacers showed promising results in controlling membrane fouling but there is potential for further optimizations to reduce channel

becoming a critical method today to produce high quantity and quality drinking water fritzmann et al 2007 one of the major challenges of ro is membrane fouling as it decreases membrane performance i e increase in trans membrane pressure or decrease in permeate flux and decrease in permeate quality and shortens membrane lifespan due to repeated cycles of chemical cleaning jiang et al 2017 a wide range of approaches have been attempted to mitigate membrane fouling such as pre treatment of feed water prihasto et al 2009 qasim et al 2019 modification of membrane properties goh et al 2019 hailemariam et al 2020 and optimization of operating conditions hoslett et al 2018 hube et al 2020 in addition the use of novel feed spacers in spiral wound modules swm a common configuration for ro membrane has also proven to be effective in controlling membrane fouling through the manipulation of hydrodynamic conditions within the flow channel koutsou et al 2004 lin et al 2020 schwinge et al 2004a conventionally feed spacers are 2 layer mesh like structures fabricated by extrusion and welding of low density polypropylene filaments they have two important roles in an swm 1 form a feed channel between membrane sheets 2 act as turbulence promoter in feed channel to increase mass transfer thus decreasing concentration polarization and membrane fouling koutsou et al 2004 schwinge et al 2004a sreedhar et al 2021 thomas et al 2021 however the presence of feed spacer also increases the channel pressure loss due to increased hydraulic resistance thus requiring additional pumping energy it is evident that in a spacer filled channel there is a trade off between having improved mass transfer fouling mitigation and increased channel pressure loss research is needed to optimise feed spacers that can maximize the membrane flux while minimizing membrane fouling and channel pressure loss methods of optimizing feed spacer geometry can be categorized into 1 improving the conventional mesh design and 2 developing novel spacer designs the first type of spacer optimization focuses on improving the existing conventional mesh spacer by making simple modifications to the geometrical characteristics such as filament diameter da costa et al 1993 schwinge et al 2004b shakaib et al 2009 filament spacing cao et al 2001 da costa et al 1993 da costa et al 1994 schwinge et al 2004b position of filament cao et al 2001 schwinge et al 2004b and hydrodynamic angle da costa et al 1994 shakaib et al 2009 table s2 these were basic factors which affected various parameters of the spacer such as hydraulic radius spacer void ratio and specific surface area schock and miquel 1987 while the first type of optimization has helped to improve conventional mesh spacers it does not solve some of the underlying limitations of the mesh design the method of flow disruption by the mesh spacers has inevitably created small stagnant zones which encourage the deposition of foulants onto the membrane schwinge et al 2000 this has prompted researchers to investigate other novel designs that differ from the conventional mesh spacer which we classify as the second type of spacer optimization some earlier publications include sinusoidal channels xie et al 2014 zigzag filaments schwinge et al 2000 saw tooth channels liu et al 2015 and hairy spacers li et al 2016 which are summarised in table s2 in essence most of these earlier works faced a common problem the conceptual design of spacer or channel usually prepared by either gluing or carving different patterns directly onto the wall of the flow channel in a filtration cell cannot be easily realised into a standalone layer of spacer that can potentially be inserted between sheet of membranes for an swm there is thus a need for a new spacer fabrication method to produce separate layers of standalone spacer and 3d printing technology could potentially be the answer 3d printing also known as additive manufacturing am is a layer by layer fabrication technique capable of building complex three dimensional objects quickly and accurately chua and leong 2017 lee et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 with electronics saengchairat et al 2017 tan et al 2020 metals kuo et al 2020 tan et al 2015 polymers lee et al 2019 composites valino et al 2019 yu et al 2019 and even living cells an et al 2015 derakhshanfar et al 2018 ng et al 2019 as printing materials its ability to maximize resource efficiency i e reduce waste while achieving part production flexibility in terms of design customization makes it suitable for fabricating prototypes of membrane spacers koo et al 2021 lin et al 2021 ng et al 2021 more specifically 3d printing has been increasingly adopted for the second type of spacer optimization table s2 to help fabricate the complex spacers so that cfd result can be validated toh et al 2020 some novel 3d printed spacers include column spacers ali et al 2019 perforated spacers kerdi et al 2018 triply periodic minimal surface tpms spacers castillo et al 2019 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 and turbo spacers ali et al 2020 several other 3d printed spacers are summarised in table s2 it is worth noting that because 3d printing can fabricate separate standalone spacer layers the prototypes are more feasible to be integrated into an swm however there are still other factors such as sharp edges or large features within the spacer design which may be a hindrance to the coiling process for swms this study focused on a sinusoidal spacer design which is categorized under the second type of spacer optimization we have improved the sinusoidal channel which in previous work was created by milling the sinusoidal channels into plastic blocks that make the flat sheet flow cell xie et al 2014 previous study achieved up to 33 increase in mass transfer but the pressure losses were up to 8 times higher compared to conventional mesh spacers this suggested potential for further improvement based on their work we selected a suitable sinusoidal wave to act as axial filaments and introduced transverse filaments slanted and straight help stabilize and maintain structural integrity of the overall spacer it is important to investigate how the introduction of transverse filaments will affect the performance of the spacer especially since the transverse filaments are connected at the peak and valley of the sinusoidal wave that coincide with the regions of highest and lowest flow velocities in the previous study 3d printing polyjet was used as the fabrication method to make the prototype of the complex spacer design the resulting 3d printed sinusoidal spacers underwent a series of filtration tests to evaluate their performance in terms of water flux channel pressure loss and fouling mitigation capabilities the relationship between water flux j and channel pressure loss δpch for the spacers were investigated experimentally with nacl solution the mitigation of inorganic fouling i e colloidal silica foulant and biofouling i e model bacteria and nutrient were evaluated via the decrease of membrane permeability optical coherence tomography oct observations were also taken for inorganic fouling development while membrane and spacer autopsies were carried out for biofouled samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 3d printed feed spacers computer aided design cad models of the conventional mesh spacer and novel sinusoidal spacer were first drawn using autocad software to ensure a fair comparison for subsequent tests the spacers were designed such that the spacer height and membrane area per unit cell were constant for all spacers however the effective membrane area is different for the spacers due to different thickness of the filaments which was experimentally determined using filtration with a coloured dye appendix c the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was selected based on channel pressure loss study from previous work xie et al 2014 to ensure minimal channel pressure loss the geometrical characteristics of the spacers are shown in table 1 the surface area and volume of the spacers were obtained from autocad to calculate the spacer voidage and hydraulic diameter using 1 and 2 da costa et al 1994 where ε is voidage dh is hydraulic diameter vtot is volume is channel vsp is volume spacer hsp is spacer height ssp is surface area of spacer and vsp is volume of spacer 1 ɛ v tot v sp v tot 2 d h 4 ɛ 2 h sp 1 ɛ s sp v sp for the sinusoidal spacers axial filaments are parallel to the flow direction while transverse filaments run perpendicular to the flow direction the st spacers have transverse filaments that connect each peak of the sinusoidal wave to the neighbouring peak of the next sinusoidal wave table 1 while the sl spacers have transverse filaments that connect each peak to the neighbouring adjacent valley of the next sinusoidal wave table 1 this ensures that the axial filaments can be held firmly together and the spacers can be fabricated as an independent layer to be integrated into an swm the cad files were converted into stereolithography stl files and loaded into the 3d printer after optimizing the placement and orientation of the spacers they were fabricated using polyjet connex3 objet500 stratasys ltd the polyjet printing technique was employed due to its high degree of accuracy tan et al 2017 which is particularly important for this study that revolves around the geometry of the spacers veroclear rgd810 stratasys ltd was used as model material and sup705 stratasys ltd was used as support material the printing resolution of this polyjet printer is 25 µm in the xy dimension and 16 µm in the z dimension after the printing process was completed the support materials were carefully removed using a weak water jet to prevent damage to the delicate filaments the filaments of the 3d printed spacers were measured and compared to the cad model to check for significant filament diameter

metre myron l company ultrameter ii 4p when necessary a customized filtration cell feed channel dimension 300 mm x 50 mm x 1 mm was used in the studies it has a transparent observation window made of sapphire 1 thorlabs to allow monitoring of the development of inorganic silica fouling layer by the optical coherence tomography oct unit ganymede sp5 thorlabs prior to any experiment the membranes dow filmtec bw30 were disinfected with ethanol merck for 2 h and stored in milli q water for at least 24 h subsequently the membranes were placed in the filtration cell with the 3d printed spacers on the feed channel top and a commercial permeate support on the permeate channel bottom the membrane is compacted together with the spacers at 25 bar using milli q water for 24 h before the start of experiments 2 3 water flux and channel pressure loss the water flux and pressure loss tests were conducted with milli q water and 2000 mg l nacl emsure cas 7647 14 5 at a constant feed pressure of 20

concentration of 200 mg l no microfilters were installed on the retentate line in colloidal fouling studies the test solution was at ph 8 the crossflow rate through the filtration cell was set at 500

the permeate side pressure was auto adjusted to give an increasing δptmp as membrane fouling progressed the normalised permeability of membrane lp over time was used as an indicator of the extent of fouling calculated by 5 5 l p t l p 0 j δ p tmp t δ π m j δ p tmp 0 δ π m δ p tmp 0 cp δ π b δ p tmp t cp δ π b during the experiment that lasted for 3 h an oct unit was used to monitor the foulant build up of the silica fouling layer on the membrane surface an appropriate scan volume was selected such that it covered one repeating unit cell in the respective spacers each voxel resolution within the scanning volume was set to 3 µm x 5 µm x 3 48 µm imagej version 1 51j8 and imaris bitplane version 7 1 3 software were used to process the oct images to obtain 3d images of the cake layer and to calculate the volume of foulants on the membrane 2 5 biofouling and membrane autopsies the biofouling test was simulated using the model bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01 atcc baa 47 and 24 mg l nutrient broth nb difco nb bd diagnostics with 2000 mg l background nacl as the feed solution the crossflow rate was set at 500 ml min entrance crossflow velocity 0 167 m s the feed pressure was fixed at 20 bar and the permeate flow was controlled at 450 ml h the biofouling experiment lasted for 13 days and the degree of biofouling was determined by the normalised membrane permeability 5 and post experiment autopsy oct was unsuccessful in detecting biofouling because the biofilm layer had very similar refractive index as the bulk solution thus did not allow distinct identification of different interfaces above the membrane in addition the biofilm of single culture formed under ro conditions was very thin with an average thickness of 5 µm based on the membrane autopsy data the resolution of oct 3 µm x 5 µm x 3 48 µm per voxel could only obtain poor quality images of the biofouling cake layer all necessary consumables and solutions were sterilized by autoclaving for 45 mins before being used to culture bacteria pa01 bacteria was transferred from nb agar plates 8 g l nb 14 g l agar difco agar bd diagnostics to nb solution 5 g l nb 2 g l nacl and cultured with shaking at 180 rpm and 37

shimadzu model uv1800 of 0 1 to make up the bacteria stock solution the bacteria stock solution was injected at a dilution ratio of 1 1000 into the feed line equivalent to final bacteria load of 103 count ml the bacteria stock solution was replaced every 2 days to ensure healthy bacteria cells were injected into the feed line while the solution in the feed tank was replaced twice per day to ensure constant nutrient available for bacteria growth on the membrane at the end of biofouling experiment the biofouled membrane and spacer were removed for autopsy and segments were cut out according to figure s6 for post experiment membrane autopsy the 3 cm 4 cm coupons were soaked in test tubes of 30 ml of 0 85 nacl solution and sonicated for 10 min to detach the biofilm the sample solutions were then analysed for extracellular polymeric substances eps and live dead cells contents the 1 cm x 3 cm coupons were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm details of the autopsy procedure can be found in appendix b 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux and channel pressure loss the water flux j of the c st and sl spacers are plotted against 4 different crossflow rates the results presented in fig 2 show that the c and sl spacers achieved similar membrane flux while the st spacer has about 5 7 lower flux compared to them this is unexpected because the lower voidage of the sinusoidal spacers should result in higher effective crossflow velocity thus inducing higher shear forces consistent with cfd in appendix a to improve mass transfer koutsou et al 2018 shakaib et al 2009 and enhancing membrane flux the unexpected performance of the c spacer can likely be attributed to the effective membrane area being higher than the st and sl spacers as shown in table 1 since the transverse filaments of the sinusoidal spacers are thicker than the c spacer more areas of the membrane is being covered in the st and sl spacer when being compressed in the filtration cell this reduces the permeation area which in turn reduces the overall membrane flux of the st and sl spacer the lower water flux of the st spacer compared to the sl spacer can be attributed to greater low shear regions i e 5 of peak shear rate in figure s5 as seen in the cfd analysis appendix a the experimental channel pressure losses expressed in terms of kpa m which is estimated based on the measured value in kpa for test cell with channel length of 0 30 m used in this study of the c st and sl spacers are plotted against 4 different crossflow rates in fig 3 depicted by hollow symbols no experimental data was collected for crossflow rate at 300 ml min for st spacers and crossflow rate 500 ml min for c spacers because the pressure loss was below the detection limit of the differential pressure transducer 1 kpa the results show that the experimental channel pressure loss was 2 3 times greater for the sinusoidal spacers compared to the c spacer for the range of flow rates investigated when comparing the experimental channel pressure loss with modelling predictions in fig 3 depicted by solid symbols we observe good agreement which show a similar trend the higher channel pressure loss of the sinusoidal spacers can be explained by the lower voidage which suggest more obstruction to flow difference in flow pattern within the channel can also be used to explain the greater pressure losses in the c spacer the filaments are arranged in a zig zag manner and flow direction goes towards the top layer of the spacers as it encounters a filament in the bottom layer and flows back downwards to the bottom layer when it encounters another filament in the top layer this results in an alternating flow between the top and bottom layer of the c spacers cao et al 2001 shakaib et al 2009 in the sinusoidal spacers the transverse filaments are suspended in the middle of the flow channel causing the flow to split when it encounters a transverse filament cfd study by cao et al 2001 showed that filaments suspended in the middle of the flow channel cause lower channel pressure losses compared to a zig zag configuration because flow direction is not forced to change drastically therefore it is unlikely to be the cause of the greater channel pressure loss for the sinusoidal spacer however the sinusoidal axial filaments cause a lateral disruption of the flow pattern as flow moves between the peak and valley of the sinusoidal channel studies nishimura et al 1990 nishimura et al 1987 xie et al 2014 also suggested the presence of taylor goertler vortices near the peaks and valleys of the sinusoidal channel which further increases the viscous energy dissipation causing greater energy loss the axial sinusoidal filaments are likely to be the main factor which caused higher channel pressure losses for the st and sl spacers compared to the c spacer the higher channel pressure loss experienced by the sl spacer over the st spacer can be explained by the larger vortices formed behind the longer slanted transverse filaments in the sl spacer compared to the st spacer cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 these larger vortices caused greater disruptions to the flow within the channel sl channel leading to greater pressure losses note that the highest channel pressure loss of the sl spacer is 57 kpa m at entrance velocity of 0 33 m s 1000 ml min at entrance velocity of 0 167 m s 500 ml min which is within the range of crossflow velocity in an swm the channel pressure drop of sl spacer is 9 kpa m thus the total channel pressure loss for a standard system of 7 units of swm with sl spacer can be up to 63 kpa or equivalent to 3 1 of feed pressure of 2000 kpa 3 2 inorganic fouling and optical coherence tomography the normalized membrane permeability 5 during the inorganic silica fouling is presented in fig 4 exponential decrease in membrane permeability is observed in the first 30 min of fouling for all 3 spacers the c spacer had the greatest fouling rate followed by the st and sl spacer by the end of the experiment the membrane permeability of the c spacer decreased by 56 while the st and sl spacer only showed about 46 and 41 decrease respectively the higher peak spear rates of the sinusoidal spacer led to greater shear induced diffusion chew et al 2020 zamani et al 2015 to keep certain areas of the membrane free of foulants for a longer period thus slowing down the overall decrease of membrane permeability the development of the silica cake layer on the membrane characterized by oct is presented in table 2 the spatial distribution graph at each timing is obtained by slicing the cake layer into 9 equal areas 0 4 mm x 0 4 mm to cover the unit cell of each spacer similar to table s1 the volume of foulants deposited on the membrane showed that c spacer always had the greatest amount of foulants followed by the st then sl spacer by the end of the experiment the c and st spacers had 83 and 29 more foulants on the membrane compared to sl spacer this is consistent with the permeability trend in fig 4 the fouling pattern for the different spacers can also be observed in table 2 for the c spacer foulants first start to gather before the filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface this is consistent with previous cfd studies indicating low velocity regions before filaments cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 a striping pattern in the centre of the channel is also observed consistent with some previous studies liu et al 2017 radu et al 2014 by 90 mins into the experiment the silica cake layer is already relatively developed and covering almost the entire membrane surface the thickness of the cake layer is also more even throughout the entire membrane surface for the st spacer foulants first accumulate near the regions in the sinusoidal valley as these areas showed lower velocity the left half of the unit cell also showed lower foulant thickness compared to the right half this observation is consistent with previous cfd works cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 which suggest the presence of recirculation zones right after the suspended transverse filaments which discourages the deposition of foulants as fouling continued foulants continued to build up at the regions near the sinusoidal valley and before the suspended transverse filaments while the regions after the suspended transverse filaments remained relatively clean a similar phenomenon is observed for the transverse filaments of the sl spacer which led to minimal foulant accumulation in the lower left corner after the suspended transverse filaments however the recirculation zones were disrupted by the sinusoidal wave on the upper left corner which resulted in some degree of fouling the region before the slanted transverse filaments is more concentrated with foulants due to lower velocity before transverse filaments similar to c and st spacer overall the oct analysis showed that higher peak shear rates were effective to prevent particle deposition during initial stage of fouling there were great disparities between the distribution of foulants within the 3 spacers at 30 min as shown in table 2 where least foulants were observed at high velocity regions and greater foulants were observed at low velocity regions with exception of recirculation zones formed behind filaments however at later stage of fouling at 180 min the distribution of foulants were more even throughout the 3 spacers under constant flux condition the particles started to deposit due to greater water permeation at those initial foulant free regions with lower fouling resistance while a slow build up of foulants due to lower water permeation at those initial fouled regions with higher fouling resistance the effectiveness of the higher peak shear rate appeared to slowly diminish nevertheless the fouling on the spacer with higher peak shear rate is still lower throughout the entire duration of the experiment 3 3 biofouling 3 3 1 membrane permeability and channel pressure loss the normalized membrane permeability 5 during the biofouling test is presented in fig 5 during initial stage the amount of biofilm formed was relatively thin i e surface conditioning and bacteria deposition and ro biofouling i e permeability drop was not significant thus the differences between 3 spacers were not obvious after the initial stage large amounts of eps were excreted thicker biofilm was formed and exponential decrease in permeability was observed these abrupt decrease in the membrane permeability were commonly observed in ro biofouling studies herzberg and elimelech 2007 suwarno et al 2012 by the end of the experiment sl spacers only had a 22 decrease in membrane permeability the st spacers had slightly higher decrease of 26 while the c spacers had the most decrease of 33 the exponential decrease in the permeability also started at a later stage for the sl spacers at day 10 this exponential decrease occurred as early as day 8 for the st and c spacers overall the decline in permeability of the spacers is consistent with results from inorganic fouling the stronger shear forces generated by the sinusoidal spacers seem to be effective in slowing down attachment onto the membrane surface the overall tmp increase in the c and sl spacers were 560 and 395 kpa respectively at the end of the biofouling experiment for the sl spacer an overall channel pressure drop increase of 12 7 kpa m figure s8 was observed by the end of the experiment or equivalent to 3 2 of the overall tmp increase of 395 kpa on the other hand for c spacer an overall channel pressure drop increase of 8 3 kpa m figure s8 was observed by the end of the experiment or equivalent to 1 5 of the overall tmp increase of 560 kpa take note that the pressure drop increase is included in the tmp increase for constant flux operation in the biofouling tests although there is higher channel pressure loss for the sl spacer due to biofouling the overall energy saving achieved associated with fouling reduction by the sinusoidal spacer as compared to conventional spacer still greatly surpass the energy increase due to channel pressure loss it has been reported a distributed fouling pattern can be observed from the first to last element in an ro system with first element suffers the most severe biofouling siebdrath et al 2019 we recommend using swm with sl spacer as first element to reduce biofouling while using swm with conventional spacer as subsequent elements since they do not experience severe biofouling as such no significant increase in the overall channel pressure loss while achieving an overall reduction in biofouling 3 3 2 membrane and spacer autopsy after the biofouling experiment autopsy was carried out on the fouled membranes and spacers the number of live and dead bacteria cells on the membranes and spacers were quantified separately and plotted in fig 6a the c membrane showed the most bacteria at about 3 23 106 count cm2 bacteria present on the st and sl membranes were 30 and 75 lower compared to the c membrane respectively the spacers also had a similar trend as the bacteria count on membranes the c spacer has the highest count of live and dead bacteria of about 1 08 106 count cm2 while the st and sl spacers only have about 68 and 35 count of the c spacer respectively compared to the bacteria count on the membranes the spacers displayed about 67 lower count than their respective membranes this could be due to different fouling mechanisms on the spacer compared to the membrane the adsorption of organics demneh et al 2011 saeki et al 2021 is different for the spacer and membrane thus leading to different eps growth rates kim et al 2006 nagaraj et al 2018 nevertheless the total bacteria trend is consistent with the permeability decrease in fig 5 fig 6b shows the total biovolume of bacteria cells accumulated on the membranes quantified by clsm images using imaris software the biovolume was the highest for the c membrane compared to st and sl membranes which showed 19 and 36 lower biovolume respectively fig 6c shows the total biovolume of bacteria cells accumulated on the spacers obtained from the confocal images they were quantified and results revealed that the highest total biovolume was obtained on the c spacers whilst st and sl spacers showed 85 and 65 lesser biovolume in comparison with the c spacer this trend coincides with the bacteria cell count obtained from fig 6a the eps on the membranes and spacers were extracted after 13 days of biofouling and presented in fig 7a results showed that the sl membranes had the lowest concentration of total eps at about 85 µg cm2 the st and c membranes had 45 and 87 higher total eps than the sl membrane respectively the sl spacer also had the lowest total eps concentration of 48 µg cm2 while the st and c spacers had almost 2 and 2 7 times higher total eps compared to the sl spacers respectively the total eps trend is consistent with the permeability decrease in fig 5 the biovolume of the eps on the membranes were also calculated from the clsm images using imaris results shown in fig 7b indicated that the total eps biovolume on the sl membranes was the lowest the st and c membranes had 50 and 120 higher total eps biovolume when compared to the sl membranes respectively when the biovolume of the eps on the spacers were quantified in fig 7c it indicated that the total eps biovolume on the sl spacers were the lowest the st and c spacers had 4 and 12 times higher total eps biovolume when compared to the sl spacers respectively this trend is consistent with the eps concentration in fig 7a in general quantitative values of the live dead cell and eps agree with the membrane permeability decline trend fig 5 where greater amounts of live dead cell and eps resulted in greater membrane permeability decline the biofouling pattern from confocal microscopy is consistent with the inorganic fouling pattern from oct for the c spacer fouling occurs before the filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface for the st spacer fouling occurs in the sinusoidal valley and the regions before the perpendicular transverse filaments for the sl spacer fouling occurs before the slanted transverse filaments the sl valleys experienced less fouling due to the interaction with the transverse filaments which disrupted the low velocity regions in that area it is also worth noting the fouling pattern on the spacers itself for the c spacer biofouling seem to occur significantly on the spacer filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface more live dead cells and eps are observed on the lower layer filaments of the c spacer while the top layer remained relatively clean for the st and sl spacers there were minimal foulants even on the axial filaments in contact with the membrane this could be due to the thicker filaments which generated larger wakes da costa et al 1993 1994 schwinge et al 2004b that greatly reduced biofouling 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of 3d printed sinusoidal spacers on the reverse osmosis process water flux and pressure loss tests were carried out with low concentrations of nacl subsequently a series of fouling test with silica particles and pa01 bacteria were carried out to determine the fouling mitigation capabilities of the different spacers the key results from the experiments can be summarised below 1 in the water flux and channel pressure loss test the spacers ranked sl c st in terms of water flux this is unexpected but is likely due to the higher effective membrane area of the c spacer greater channel pressure loss was detected for the sinusoidal spacer due to more drastic changes in flow direction 2 in the inorganic fouling test the spacers ranked sl st c in terms of fouling mitigation capability this is supported by oct scans which reveal that certain parts of the membrane are kept free of foulants for a longer period when using sinusoidal spacers as compared to c spacer during initial stages of fouling 3 in the biofouling test the spacers ranked sl st c in terms of biofouling mitigation capability i e reduction in membrane permeability decrease but ranked st c sl in terms of lower channel pressure loss increase the energy saved from biofouling mitigation still surpass the energy increase due to channel pressure loss increase for the sinusoidal spacer which suggests that sinusoidal spacers are superior compared to conventional spacers ultimately this study demonstrated the promising capabilities of the 3d printed sinusoidal spacers in lab scale studies perhaps with further optimisations to minimize pressure loss i e by reducing the number of slanted filaments or changing the amplitudes of the sinusoidal filament these 3d printed sinusoidal spacers can be a good alternative over conventional spacers to

16508,feed spacers are an essential part of spiral wound modules for reverse osmosis ro they create flow channels between membrane sheets and manipulate hydrodynamic conditions to control membrane fouling in this work additive manufacturing polyjet was used to print novel sinusoidal spacers with wavy axial filaments connected by perpendicular st or slanted sl transverse filaments when tested with 2 g l nacl solution conventional and sl spacers had similar flux while the st spacer had about 5 7 lower flux the pressure losses for st and sl spacers increased by up to 3 folds depending on the flow condition in the colloidal silica fouling and biofouling tests the sinusoidal spacers showed lower membrane permeability decrease of 46 for st 41 for sl vs 56 for conventional and 26 for st 22 for sl vs 33 for conventional respectively optical coherence tomography images from colloidal silica fouling and confocal images from biofouling tests revealed that fouling patterns were closely associated with the local hydrodynamic conditions overall sinusoidal spacers showed promising results in controlling membrane fouling but there is potential for further optimizations to reduce channel

becoming a critical method today to produce high quantity and quality drinking water fritzmann et al 2007 one of the major challenges of ro is membrane fouling as it decreases membrane performance i e increase in trans membrane pressure or decrease in permeate flux and decrease in permeate quality and shortens membrane lifespan due to repeated cycles of chemical cleaning jiang et al 2017 a wide range of approaches have been attempted to mitigate membrane fouling such as pre treatment of feed water prihasto et al 2009 qasim et al 2019 modification of membrane properties goh et al 2019 hailemariam et al 2020 and optimization of operating conditions hoslett et al 2018 hube et al 2020 in addition the use of novel feed spacers in spiral wound modules swm a common configuration for ro membrane has also proven to be effective in controlling membrane fouling through the manipulation of hydrodynamic conditions within the flow channel koutsou et al 2004 lin et al 2020 schwinge et al 2004a conventionally feed spacers are 2 layer mesh like structures fabricated by extrusion and welding of low density polypropylene filaments they have two important roles in an swm 1 form a feed channel between membrane sheets 2 act as turbulence promoter in feed channel to increase mass transfer thus decreasing concentration polarization and membrane fouling koutsou et al 2004 schwinge et al 2004a sreedhar et al 2021 thomas et al 2021 however the presence of feed spacer also increases the channel pressure loss due to increased hydraulic resistance thus requiring additional pumping energy it is evident that in a spacer filled channel there is a trade off between having improved mass transfer fouling mitigation and increased channel pressure loss research is needed to optimise feed spacers that can maximize the membrane flux while minimizing membrane fouling and channel pressure loss methods of optimizing feed spacer geometry can be categorized into 1 improving the conventional mesh design and 2 developing novel spacer designs the first type of spacer optimization focuses on improving the existing conventional mesh spacer by making simple modifications to the geometrical characteristics such as filament diameter da costa et al 1993 schwinge et al 2004b shakaib et al 2009 filament spacing cao et al 2001 da costa et al 1993 da costa et al 1994 schwinge et al 2004b position of filament cao et al 2001 schwinge et al 2004b and hydrodynamic angle da costa et al 1994 shakaib et al 2009 table s2 these were basic factors which affected various parameters of the spacer such as hydraulic radius spacer void ratio and specific surface area schock and miquel 1987 while the first type of optimization has helped to improve conventional mesh spacers it does not solve some of the underlying limitations of the mesh design the method of flow disruption by the mesh spacers has inevitably created small stagnant zones which encourage the deposition of foulants onto the membrane schwinge et al 2000 this has prompted researchers to investigate other novel designs that differ from the conventional mesh spacer which we classify as the second type of spacer optimization some earlier publications include sinusoidal channels xie et al 2014 zigzag filaments schwinge et al 2000 saw tooth channels liu et al 2015 and hairy spacers li et al 2016 which are summarised in table s2 in essence most of these earlier works faced a common problem the conceptual design of spacer or channel usually prepared by either gluing or carving different patterns directly onto the wall of the flow channel in a filtration cell cannot be easily realised into a standalone layer of spacer that can potentially be inserted between sheet of membranes for an swm there is thus a need for a new spacer fabrication method to produce separate layers of standalone spacer and 3d printing technology could potentially be the answer 3d printing also known as additive manufacturing am is a layer by layer fabrication technique capable of building complex three dimensional objects quickly and accurately chua and leong 2017 lee et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 with electronics saengchairat et al 2017 tan et al 2020 metals kuo et al 2020 tan et al 2015 polymers lee et al 2019 composites valino et al 2019 yu et al 2019 and even living cells an et al 2015 derakhshanfar et al 2018 ng et al 2019 as printing materials its ability to maximize resource efficiency i e reduce waste while achieving part production flexibility in terms of design customization makes it suitable for fabricating prototypes of membrane spacers koo et al 2021 lin et al 2021 ng et al 2021 more specifically 3d printing has been increasingly adopted for the second type of spacer optimization table s2 to help fabricate the complex spacers so that cfd result can be validated toh et al 2020 some novel 3d printed spacers include column spacers ali et al 2019 perforated spacers kerdi et al 2018 triply periodic minimal surface tpms spacers castillo et al 2019 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 and turbo spacers ali et al 2020 several other 3d printed spacers are summarised in table s2 it is worth noting that because 3d printing can fabricate separate standalone spacer layers the prototypes are more feasible to be integrated into an swm however there are still other factors such as sharp edges or large features within the spacer design which may be a hindrance to the coiling process for swms this study focused on a sinusoidal spacer design which is categorized under the second type of spacer optimization we have improved the sinusoidal channel which in previous work was created by milling the sinusoidal channels into plastic blocks that make the flat sheet flow cell xie et al 2014 previous study achieved up to 33 increase in mass transfer but the pressure losses were up to 8 times higher compared to conventional mesh spacers this suggested potential for further improvement based on their work we selected a suitable sinusoidal wave to act as axial filaments and introduced transverse filaments slanted and straight help stabilize and maintain structural integrity of the overall spacer it is important to investigate how the introduction of transverse filaments will affect the performance of the spacer especially since the transverse filaments are connected at the peak and valley of the sinusoidal wave that coincide with the regions of highest and lowest flow velocities in the previous study 3d printing polyjet was used as the fabrication method to make the prototype of the complex spacer design the resulting 3d printed sinusoidal spacers underwent a series of filtration tests to evaluate their performance in terms of water flux channel pressure loss and fouling mitigation capabilities the relationship between water flux j and channel pressure loss δpch for the spacers were investigated experimentally with nacl solution the mitigation of inorganic fouling i e colloidal silica foulant and biofouling i e model bacteria and nutrient were evaluated via the decrease of membrane permeability optical coherence tomography oct observations were also taken for inorganic fouling development while membrane and spacer autopsies were carried out for biofouled samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 3d printed feed spacers computer aided design cad models of the conventional mesh spacer and novel sinusoidal spacer were first drawn using autocad software to ensure a fair comparison for subsequent tests the spacers were designed such that the spacer height and membrane area per unit cell were constant for all spacers however the effective membrane area is different for the spacers due to different thickness of the filaments which was experimentally determined using filtration with a coloured dye appendix c the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was selected based on channel pressure loss study from previous work xie et al 2014 to ensure minimal channel pressure loss the geometrical characteristics of the spacers are shown in table 1 the surface area and volume of the spacers were obtained from autocad to calculate the spacer voidage and hydraulic diameter using 1 and 2 da costa et al 1994 where ε is voidage dh is hydraulic diameter vtot is volume is channel vsp is volume spacer hsp is spacer height ssp is surface area of spacer and vsp is volume of spacer 1 ɛ v tot v sp v tot 2 d h 4 ɛ 2 h sp 1 ɛ s sp v sp for the sinusoidal spacers axial filaments are parallel to the flow direction while transverse filaments run perpendicular to the flow direction the st spacers have transverse filaments that connect each peak of the sinusoidal wave to the neighbouring peak of the next sinusoidal wave table 1 while the sl spacers have transverse filaments that connect each peak to the neighbouring adjacent valley of the next sinusoidal wave table 1 this ensures that the axial filaments can be held firmly together and the spacers can be fabricated as an independent layer to be integrated into an swm the cad files were converted into stereolithography stl files and loaded into the 3d printer after optimizing the placement and orientation of the spacers they were fabricated using polyjet connex3 objet500 stratasys ltd the polyjet printing technique was employed due to its high degree of accuracy tan et al 2017 which is particularly important for this study that revolves around the geometry of the spacers veroclear rgd810 stratasys ltd was used as model material and sup705 stratasys ltd was used as support material the printing resolution of this polyjet printer is 25 µm in the xy dimension and 16 µm in the z dimension after the printing process was completed the support materials were carefully removed using a weak water jet to prevent damage to the delicate filaments the filaments of the 3d printed spacers were measured and compared to the cad model to check for significant filament diameter

metre myron l company ultrameter ii 4p when necessary a customized filtration cell feed channel dimension 300 mm x 50 mm x 1 mm was used in the studies it has a transparent observation window made of sapphire 1 thorlabs to allow monitoring of the development of inorganic silica fouling layer by the optical coherence tomography oct unit ganymede sp5 thorlabs prior to any experiment the membranes dow filmtec bw30 were disinfected with ethanol merck for 2 h and stored in milli q water for at least 24 h subsequently the membranes were placed in the filtration cell with the 3d printed spacers on the feed channel top and a commercial permeate support on the permeate channel bottom the membrane is compacted together with the spacers at 25 bar using milli q water for 24 h before the start of experiments 2 3 water flux and channel pressure loss the water flux and pressure loss tests were conducted with milli q water and 2000 mg l nacl emsure cas 7647 14 5 at a constant feed pressure of 20

carried out using colloidal silica particles 200 300 nm sigma aldrich cas 112 945 52 5 with 2000 mg l background nacl silica stock solution 40 g l was added to the feed tank to make up a final concentration of 200 mg l no microfilters were installed on the retentate line in colloidal fouling studies the test solution was at ph 8 the crossflow rate through the filtration cell was set at 500

the permeate side pressure was auto adjusted to give an increasing δptmp as membrane fouling progressed the normalised permeability of membrane lp over time was used as an indicator of the extent of fouling calculated by 5 5 l p t l p 0 j δ p tmp t δ π m j δ p tmp 0 δ π m δ p tmp 0 cp δ π b δ p tmp t cp δ π b during the experiment that lasted for 3 h an oct unit was used to monitor the foulant build up of the silica fouling layer on the membrane surface an appropriate scan volume was selected such that it covered one repeating unit cell in the respective spacers each voxel resolution within the scanning volume was set to 3 µm x 5 µm x 3 48 µm imagej version 1 51j8 and imaris bitplane version 7 1 3 software were used to process the oct images to obtain 3d images of the cake layer and to calculate the volume of foulants on the membrane 2 5 biofouling and membrane autopsies the biofouling test was simulated using the model bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01 atcc baa 47 and 24 mg l nutrient broth nb difco nb bd diagnostics with 2000 mg l background nacl as the feed solution the crossflow rate was set at 500 ml min entrance crossflow velocity 0 167 m s the feed pressure was fixed at 20 bar and the permeate flow was controlled at 450 ml h the biofouling experiment lasted for 13 days and the degree of biofouling was determined by the normalised membrane permeability 5 and post experiment autopsy oct was unsuccessful in detecting biofouling because the biofilm layer had very similar refractive index as the bulk solution thus did not allow distinct identification of different interfaces above the membrane in addition the biofilm of single culture formed under ro conditions was very thin with an average thickness of 5 µm based on the membrane autopsy data the resolution of oct 3 µm x 5 µm x 3 48 µm per voxel could only obtain poor quality images of the biofouling cake layer all necessary consumables and solutions were sterilized by autoclaving for 45 mins before being used to culture bacteria pa01 bacteria was transferred from nb agar plates 8 g l nb 14 g l agar difco agar bd diagnostics to nb solution 5 g l nb 2 g l nacl and cultured with shaking at 180 rpm and 37

shimadzu model uv1800 of 0 1 to make up the bacteria stock solution the bacteria stock solution was injected at a dilution ratio of 1 1000 into the feed line equivalent to final bacteria load of 103 count ml the bacteria stock solution was replaced every 2 days to ensure healthy bacteria cells were injected into the feed line while the solution in the feed tank was replaced twice per day to ensure constant nutrient available for bacteria growth on the membrane at the end of biofouling experiment the biofouled membrane and spacer were removed for autopsy and segments were cut out according to figure s6 for post experiment membrane autopsy the 3 cm 4 cm coupons were soaked in test tubes of 30 ml of 0 85 nacl solution and sonicated for 10 min to detach the biofilm the sample solutions were then analysed for extracellular polymeric substances eps and live dead cells contents the 1 cm x 3 cm coupons were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm details of the autopsy procedure can be found in appendix b 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux and channel pressure loss the water flux j of the c st and sl spacers are plotted against 4 different crossflow rates the results presented in fig 2 show that the c and sl spacers achieved similar membrane flux while the st spacer has about 5 7 lower flux compared to them this is unexpected because the lower voidage of the sinusoidal spacers should result in higher effective crossflow velocity thus inducing higher shear forces consistent with cfd in appendix a to improve mass transfer koutsou et al 2018 shakaib et al 2009 and enhancing membrane flux the unexpected performance of the c spacer can likely be attributed to the effective membrane area being higher than the st and sl spacers as shown in table 1 since the transverse filaments of the sinusoidal spacers are thicker than the c spacer more areas of the membrane is being covered in the st and sl spacer when being compressed in the filtration cell this reduces the permeation area which in turn reduces the overall membrane flux of the st and sl spacer the lower water flux of the st spacer compared to the sl spacer can be attributed to greater low shear regions i e 5 of peak shear rate in figure s5 as seen in the cfd analysis appendix a the experimental channel pressure losses expressed in terms of kpa m which is estimated based on the measured value in kpa for test cell with channel length of 0 30 m used in this study of the c st and sl spacers are plotted against 4 different crossflow rates in fig 3 depicted by hollow symbols no experimental data was collected for crossflow rate at 300 ml min for st spacers and crossflow rate 500 ml min for c spacers because the pressure loss was below the detection limit of the differential pressure transducer 1 kpa the results show that the experimental channel pressure loss was 2 3 times greater for the sinusoidal spacers compared to the c spacer for the range of flow rates investigated when comparing the experimental channel pressure loss with modelling predictions in fig 3 depicted by solid symbols we observe good agreement which show a similar trend the higher channel pressure loss of the sinusoidal spacers can be explained by the lower voidage which suggest more obstruction to flow difference in flow pattern within the channel can also be used to explain the greater pressure losses in the c spacer the filaments are arranged in a zig zag manner and flow direction goes towards the top layer of the spacers as it encounters a filament in the bottom layer and flows back downwards to the bottom layer when it encounters another filament in the top layer this results in an alternating flow between the top and bottom layer of the c spacers cao et al 2001 shakaib et al 2009 in the sinusoidal spacers the transverse filaments are suspended in the middle of the flow channel causing the flow to split when it encounters a transverse filament cfd study by cao et al 2001 showed that filaments suspended in the middle of the flow channel cause lower channel pressure losses compared to a zig zag configuration because flow direction is not forced to change drastically therefore it is unlikely to be the cause of the greater channel pressure loss for the sinusoidal spacer however the sinusoidal axial filaments cause a lateral disruption of the flow pattern as flow moves between the peak and valley of the sinusoidal channel studies nishimura et al 1990 nishimura et al 1987 xie et al 2014 also suggested the presence of taylor goertler vortices near the peaks and valleys of the sinusoidal channel which further increases the viscous energy dissipation causing greater energy loss the axial sinusoidal filaments are likely to be the main factor which caused higher channel pressure losses for the st and sl spacers compared to the c spacer the higher channel pressure loss experienced by the sl spacer over the st spacer can be explained by the larger vortices formed behind the longer slanted transverse filaments in the sl spacer compared to the st spacer cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 these larger vortices caused greater disruptions to the flow within the channel sl channel leading to greater pressure losses note that the highest channel pressure loss of the sl spacer is 57 kpa m at entrance velocity of 0 33 m s 1000 ml min at entrance velocity of 0 167 m s 500 ml min which is within the range of crossflow velocity in an swm the channel pressure drop of sl spacer is 9 kpa m thus the total channel pressure loss for a standard system of 7 units of swm with sl spacer can be up to 63 kpa or equivalent to 3 1 of feed pressure of 2000 kpa 3 2 inorganic fouling and optical coherence tomography the normalized membrane permeability 5 during the inorganic silica fouling is presented in fig 4 exponential decrease in membrane permeability is observed in the first 30 min of fouling for all 3 spacers the c spacer had the greatest fouling rate followed by the st and sl spacer by the end of the experiment the membrane permeability of the c spacer decreased by 56 while the st and sl spacer only showed about 46 and 41 decrease respectively the higher peak spear rates of the sinusoidal spacer led to greater shear induced diffusion chew et al 2020 zamani et al 2015 to keep certain areas of the membrane free of foulants for a longer period thus slowing down the overall decrease of membrane permeability the development of the silica cake layer on the membrane characterized by oct is presented in table 2 the spatial distribution graph at each timing is obtained by slicing the cake layer into 9 equal areas 0 4 mm x 0 4 mm to cover the unit cell of each spacer similar to table s1 the volume of foulants deposited on the membrane showed that c spacer always had the greatest amount of foulants followed by the st then sl spacer by the end of the experiment the c and st spacers had 83 and 29 more foulants on the membrane compared to sl spacer this is consistent with the permeability trend in fig 4 the fouling pattern for the different spacers can also be observed in table 2 for the c spacer foulants first start to gather before the filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface this is consistent with previous cfd studies indicating low velocity regions before filaments cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 a striping pattern in the centre of the channel is also observed consistent with some previous studies liu et al 2017 radu et al 2014 by 90 mins into the experiment the silica cake layer is already relatively developed and covering almost the entire membrane surface the thickness of the cake layer is also more even throughout the entire membrane surface for the st spacer foulants first accumulate near the regions in the sinusoidal valley as these areas showed lower velocity the left half of the unit cell also showed lower foulant thickness compared to the right half this observation is consistent with previous cfd works cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 which suggest the presence of recirculation zones right after the suspended transverse filaments which discourages the deposition of foulants as fouling continued foulants continued to build up at the regions near the sinusoidal valley and before the suspended transverse filaments while the regions after the suspended transverse filaments remained relatively clean a similar phenomenon is observed for the transverse filaments of the sl spacer which led to minimal foulant accumulation in the lower left corner after the suspended transverse filaments however the recirculation zones were disrupted by the sinusoidal wave on the upper left corner which resulted in some degree of fouling the region before the slanted transverse filaments is more concentrated with foulants due to lower velocity before transverse filaments similar to c and st spacer overall the oct analysis showed that higher peak shear rates were effective to prevent particle deposition during initial stage of fouling there were great disparities between the distribution of foulants within the 3 spacers at 30 min as shown in table 2 where least foulants were observed at high velocity regions and greater foulants were observed at low velocity regions with exception of recirculation zones formed behind filaments however at later stage of fouling at 180 min the distribution of foulants were more even throughout the 3 spacers under constant flux condition the particles started to deposit due to greater water permeation at those initial foulant free regions with lower fouling resistance while a slow build up of foulants due to lower water permeation at those initial fouled regions with higher fouling resistance the effectiveness of the higher peak shear rate appeared to slowly diminish nevertheless the fouling on the spacer with higher peak shear rate is still lower throughout the entire duration of the experiment 3 3 biofouling 3 3 1 membrane permeability and channel pressure loss the normalized membrane permeability 5 during the biofouling test is presented in fig 5 during initial stage the amount of biofilm formed was relatively thin i e surface conditioning and bacteria deposition and ro biofouling i e permeability drop was not significant thus the differences between 3 spacers were not obvious after the initial stage large amounts of eps were excreted thicker biofilm was formed and exponential decrease in permeability was observed these abrupt decrease in the membrane permeability were commonly observed in ro biofouling studies herzberg and elimelech 2007 suwarno et al 2012 by the end of the experiment sl spacers only had a 22 decrease in membrane permeability the st spacers had slightly higher decrease of 26 while the c spacers had the most decrease of 33 the exponential decrease in the permeability also started at a later stage for the sl spacers at day 10 this exponential decrease occurred as early as day 8 for the st and c spacers overall the decline in permeability of the spacers is consistent with results from inorganic fouling the stronger shear forces generated by the sinusoidal spacers seem to be effective in slowing down attachment onto the membrane surface the overall tmp increase in the c and sl spacers were 560 and 395 kpa respectively at the end of the biofouling experiment for the sl spacer an overall channel pressure drop increase of 12 7 kpa m figure s8 was observed by the end of the experiment or equivalent to 3 2 of the overall tmp increase of 395 kpa on the other hand for c spacer an overall channel pressure drop increase of 8 3 kpa m figure s8 was observed by the end of the experiment or equivalent to 1 5 of the overall tmp increase of 560 kpa take note that the pressure drop increase is included in the tmp increase for constant flux operation in the biofouling tests although there is higher channel pressure loss for the sl spacer due to biofouling the overall energy saving achieved associated with fouling reduction by the sinusoidal spacer as compared to conventional spacer still greatly surpass the energy increase due to channel pressure loss it has been reported a distributed fouling pattern can be observed from the first to last element in an ro system with first element suffers the most severe biofouling siebdrath et al 2019 we recommend using swm with sl spacer as first element to reduce biofouling while using swm with conventional spacer as subsequent elements since they do not experience severe biofouling as such no significant increase in the overall channel pressure loss while achieving an overall reduction in biofouling 3 3 2 membrane and spacer autopsy after the biofouling experiment autopsy was carried out on the fouled membranes and spacers the number of live and dead bacteria cells on the membranes and spacers were quantified separately and plotted in fig 6a the c membrane showed the most bacteria at about 3 23 106 count cm2 bacteria present on the st and sl membranes were 30 and 75 lower compared to the c membrane respectively the spacers also had a similar trend as the bacteria count on membranes the c spacer has the highest count of live and dead bacteria of about 1 08 106 count cm2 while the st and sl spacers only have about 68 and 35 count of the c spacer respectively compared to the bacteria count on the membranes the spacers displayed about 67 lower count than their respective membranes this could be due to different fouling mechanisms on the spacer compared to the membrane the adsorption of organics demneh et al 2011 saeki et al 2021 is different for the spacer and membrane thus leading to different eps growth rates kim et al 2006 nagaraj et al 2018 nevertheless the total bacteria trend is consistent with the permeability decrease in fig 5 fig 6b shows the total biovolume of bacteria cells accumulated on the membranes quantified by clsm images using imaris software the biovolume was the highest for the c membrane compared to st and sl membranes which showed 19 and 36 lower biovolume respectively fig 6c shows the total biovolume of bacteria cells accumulated on the spacers obtained from the confocal images they were quantified and results revealed that the highest total biovolume was obtained on the c spacers whilst st and sl spacers showed 85 and 65 lesser biovolume in comparison with the c spacer this trend coincides with the bacteria cell count obtained from fig 6a the eps on the membranes and spacers were extracted after 13 days of biofouling and presented in fig 7a results showed that the sl membranes had the lowest concentration of total eps at about 85 µg cm2 the st and c membranes had 45 and 87 higher total eps than the sl membrane respectively the sl spacer also had the lowest total eps concentration of 48 µg cm2 while the st and c spacers had almost 2 and 2 7 times higher total eps compared to the sl spacers respectively the total eps trend is consistent with the permeability decrease in fig 5 the biovolume of the eps on the membranes were also calculated from the clsm images using imaris results shown in fig 7b indicated that the total eps biovolume on the sl membranes was the lowest the st and c membranes had 50 and 120 higher total eps biovolume when compared to the sl membranes respectively when the biovolume of the eps on the spacers were quantified in fig 7c it indicated that the total eps biovolume on the sl spacers were the lowest the st and c spacers had 4 and 12 times higher total eps biovolume when compared to the sl spacers respectively this trend is consistent with the eps concentration in fig 7a in general quantitative values of the live dead cell and eps agree with the membrane permeability decline trend fig 5 where greater amounts of live dead cell and eps resulted in greater membrane permeability decline the biofouling pattern from confocal microscopy is consistent with the inorganic fouling pattern from oct for the c spacer fouling occurs before the filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface for the st spacer fouling occurs in the sinusoidal valley and the regions before the perpendicular transverse filaments for the sl spacer fouling occurs before the slanted transverse filaments the sl valleys experienced less fouling due to the interaction with the transverse filaments which disrupted the low velocity regions in that area it is also worth noting the fouling pattern on the spacers itself for the c spacer biofouling seem to occur significantly on the spacer filaments which are in contact with the membrane surface more live dead cells and eps are observed on the lower layer filaments of the c spacer while the top layer remained relatively clean for the st and sl spacers there were minimal foulants even on the axial filaments in contact with the membrane this could be due to the thicker filaments which generated larger wakes da costa et al 1993 1994 schwinge et al 2004b that greatly reduced biofouling 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of 3d printed sinusoidal spacers on the reverse osmosis process water flux and pressure loss tests were carried out with low concentrations of nacl subsequently a series of fouling test with silica particles and pa01 bacteria were carried out to determine the fouling mitigation capabilities of the different spacers the key results from the experiments can be summarised below 1 in the water flux and channel pressure loss test the spacers ranked sl c st in terms of water flux this is unexpected but is likely due to the higher effective membrane area of the c spacer greater channel pressure loss was detected for the sinusoidal spacer due to more drastic changes in flow direction 2 in the inorganic fouling test the spacers ranked sl st c in terms of fouling mitigation capability this is supported by oct scans which reveal that certain parts of the membrane are kept free of foulants for a longer period when using sinusoidal spacers as compared to c spacer during initial stages of fouling 3 in the biofouling test the spacers ranked sl st c in terms of biofouling mitigation capability i e reduction in membrane permeability decrease but ranked st c sl in terms of lower channel pressure loss increase the energy saved from biofouling mitigation still surpass the energy increase due to channel pressure loss increase for the sinusoidal spacer which suggests that sinusoidal spacers are superior compared to conventional spacers ultimately this study demonstrated the promising capabilities of the 3d printed sinusoidal spacers in lab scale studies perhaps with further optimisations to minimize pressure loss i e by reducing the number of slanted filaments or changing the amplitudes of the sinusoidal filament these 3d printed sinusoidal spacers can be a good alternative over conventional spacers to

16509,surface water runoff can export pesticides from agricultural fields into adjacent aquatic ecosystems where they may pose adverse effects to organisms constructed wetlands cws are widely used to treat agricultural runoff contaminated by pesticides but the removal of hydrophilic pesticides is usually low in this study we suggest superabsorbent polymer sap a cross linked hydrophilic polymer as a supplement to substrates of cws and tested the hypothesis that sap results in an enhanced removal of hydrophilic pesticides therefore batch experiments were conducted to study the retention capacity of water saturated sap w sap for several hydrophilic pesticides retention of the pesticides on w sap was related to the ionization state and water solubility of the pesticides the retention of neutral pesticides imidacloprid metalaxyl and propiconazole was about 20 higher than that measured for anionic pesticides bentazone glyphosate and mcpa the retention of the pesticides by w sap mainly resulted from their distribution in the gel water phase of w sap while less water soluble pesticides might have also been adsorbed on the molecular backbone of sap furthermore we tested the efficacy of w sap for treatment of runoff water contaminated by pesticides in lab scale horizontal subsurface flow cws sap in cws improved the removal of the pesticides including the recalcitrant ones the removal enhancement was owing to the increase of hydraulic retention time and improvement of biodegradation the removal of the pesticides in sap containing cws was 93 for mcpa glyphosate and propiconazole 62 99 for imidacloprid 50 84 for metalaxyl and 38 73 for bentazone in the control gravel cws the removal was 98 for glyphosate generally 83 for mcpa and propiconazole 46 98 for imidacloprid 32 97 for

a cross linked hydrophilic polymer material which has an unique ability to retain large volumes of water or aqueous solutions ma and wen 2020 zohuriaan mehr and kabiri 2008 it is widely applied in agriculture to promote plant growth in semi arid and arid areas through the retention of water and nutrients and is not considered to be toxic islam et al 2011 yang et al 2014 in addition sap is used in wastewater treatment to remove pollutants mostly dyes by adsorption alsbaiee et al 2016 dhiman et al 2015 fosso kankeu et al 2015 water saturated sap w sap added in planted soil filters retained pesticides considerably particularly hydrophilic ones and also improved pesticide removal butkovskyi et al 2021 to date however it is still unclear which processes actually govern the retention of pesticides by w sap besides the efficacy of sap application in cws for pesticide removal has never been investigated we hypothesize that pesticide retention processes by w sap can be i adsorption on the molecular backbone of the w sap or ii the diffusion of pesticides from the outer water to the gel water phase of the w sap absorption and the application of sap as a new substrate to cws can enhance the removal of hydrophilic pesticides from agricultural runoff therefore the objectives of this study were to i explore the retention capability and retention processes of w sap for six hydrophilic pesticides bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole and ii examine the efficacy of w sap as substrate in cws for these pesticides removal retention kinetics and isotherms of the retention and release of the pesticides by w sap were tested in batch experiments we also distinguished between the adsorption of pesticides on sap backbone molecules and their distribution in gel water phase of w sap moreover the removal efficiencies for the pesticides were determined in lab scale horizontal sub surface flow hssf cws with a mixture of sap and pumice as the substrate pumice is needed to stabilize the hydrogel phase of w sap and increase the hydraulic conductivity of cw substrates bollman et al 2019 this approach was compared against conventional cws with

were passed through a 4 mm sieve to remove the small size particles obtaining a grain size of 4 12 mm 2 2 retention of the pesticides by w sap in batch experiment 2 2 1 batch retention experiment batch retention experiments were conducted based on oecd 106 oecd 2000 all experiments were carried out in 50 ml sterile polypropylene pp vials in triplicates the vials were placed on an orbital shaker unimax 1010 heidolph at 250 rpm and at 25 c dry sap was first saturated with tap water more chemical similarity to runoff water compared to miliq or deionized water for 1 5 h before mixing with pesticide solutions individual pesticide solution was prepared by dissolving 10 0 mg of solid pesticide bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl in 100 ml of tap water yielding a 100 mg l of stock solution for each pesticide due to low water solubility of propiconazole 50 mg l of its stock solution was prepared the stock solution of each pesticide was then diluted with tap water to meet the required concentrations for determination of retention kinetics or retention and release isotherms for the experiments 20 ml of each pesticide solution was mixed with w sap which had a dry weight of 0 20 g before saturating with water the mixture solutions had a ph around 7 5 a blank treatment with pesticide solution but without w sap was included in order to check the sorption of the pesticides on pp vials retention kinetic was investigated with 1 mg l of pesticide solution at different time intervals for each pesticide separately more specifically after 5 10 30 min 2 h and 24 h an aliquot of water sample was taken from the water phase of each pesticide solution for pesticide concentration determination the concentration was quantified after dilution with miliq water by either lc hrms or lc ms ms see sec 2 4 the retention percentage of the pesticides by w sap was calculated by the following equation 1 r e t e n t i o n o f p e s t i c i d e s c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of the pesticide ct mg l is the concentration at time t retention and release isotherms were determined for the pesticides separately at 25 c with an equilibrium time of 24 h the studied concentrations of the pesticide were 0 01 0 05 0 50 5 10 mg l for all pesticides except for propiconazole the solutions of propiconazole were prepared as follows 0 01 0 05 0 5 2 and 5 mg l these concentrations ranged from close to environmentally detected concentrations µg l to relatively high concentrations mg l after retention the excess water of w sap was removed by passing through a 150 µm sieve then the w sap was resuspended in 20 ml of tap water and placed back onto the shaker after 24 h of equilibrium the water was sampled again for pesticides analysis the amount of pesticides retained in sap was determined by 2 c s c 0 c e v m where cs mg g is the amount of pesticide retained in per g of sap ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of pesticide v l is the volume of pesticide solution and m g is the mass of sap the freundlich isotherm model was used to fit the retention and release data from isotherms with originpro 9 6 according to the following equation 3 c s k f c e 1 n where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich coefficient indicating retention capacity 1 n is the freundlich exponent which indicates retention intensity the hysteresis index hi was calculated according to huang et al 1998 4 h i c s d c s s c s s t c e where c s d mg g and c s s mg g are the amount of pesticide retained per g of sap in release and retention experiment respectively and calculated based on the parameters of freundlich model fitted by release and retention data respectively t is the temperature at which the experiment was carried out here hi for each pesticide was calculated accordingly at concentration of 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 1 mg l negative and zero hi imply reversible retention whereas positive values suggest hysteresis exists 2 2 2 retention processes analysis the equilibration of pesticide distribution existed between outer water gel water phase and backbone molecule of w sap if it is assumed that the retained pesticides are distributed merely in the gel water phase of w sap a concentration ce sap which represents pesticide concentration in gel water phase of w sap can be calculated as follows 5 c e s a p m p v s a p where m p mg is the amount of pesticides retained by w sap which is derived from equation 2 by multiplying the mass of sap v s a p l is the volume of gel water retained by w sap hence the distribution ratio kd is defined as this concentration to the corresponding equilibrium concentration in the outer water solution 6 k d c e s a p c e since the ratio of gel water of w sap and outer water is 1 when k d 1 we consider adsorption of pesticides on the molecular backbone of w sap otherwise pesticides were distributed in the gel water phase of w sap 2 3 application of w sap to lab scale cws 2 3 1 setup of cws and application of pesticides lab scale hssf cws were set up for testing sap as a supplement of cw substrate to retain pesticides from agricultural runoff fig 1 and fig s1 two types of cws with different substrates were included one had the substrate which was a mixture of w sap and pumice at a dry weight ratio of 5 sap pumice dw dw the other had conventional gravel as the substrate and served as control each cw treatment gravel or w sap pumice comprised two independent units in all cws 10 cm seedlings of reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea were planted which was chosen due to its

during plant development period all the cws were maintained in the greenhouse at the temperature of 22 c from 6 am to 9 pm and 16 c at night illumination by master son pia 400 w phillips belgium was switched on as supplementary light source when the natural light strength fall below 60 klx after four months of plant growth pesticides solutions were supplied to the cws when the plant height reached around 90 cm the pesticide solution was a mixture of bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole the solutions were dosed continuously to the influents of cws by use of infusion pumps targeting final inflow concentrations between 20 50 µg l the inflow rate for all cws was 2 l d which corresponded to a hrt of 12 d due to the high evapotranspiration of cws the flow rate was increased to 3 l d after 4 weeks resulting in a hrt of 8 d the infusion rate of pesticides solution was also adjusted to maintain the same concentration in the influent as the condition of 2 l d of influent pesticides were continuously applied for 65 days in addition to the lab scale cws the retention and sorption potential of the pesticides mixture by the cw substrates w sap pumice gravel was tested in batch experiments see supplementary information 2 3 2 sampling of cws and water analysis water samples were taken weekly from the influent and effluent of the cws concentrations

performed by internal standard calibration using isotope labelled compounds the details on sample preparation instrumental parameters for the pesticides and method validation can be found in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 retention kinetics of pesticides by w sap retention kinetics of the pesticides by w sap was fast and reached equilibrium already after 2 h fig 2 for each pesticide over half of the initially applied amount was retained by w sap in the first 10 min thereafter the retention rate slowed down the rapid retention rate of pesticides by polymer was also reported in other studies alsbaiee et al 2016 vergili and barlas 2009 the fast retention of pesticides by w sap improves the removal of pesticides when the contact time of w sap with water is short and there is fast water flow sap showed the highest retention of 63 for propiconazole while it was lower for metalaxyl and imidacloprid with comparable retentions of 49 and between 34 and 36 for bentazone mcpa and glyphosate were noticed since the water absorption capacity per g sap is around 98 8 g the ratio of the gel water of w sap and the outer water is close to 1 1 v v if there was only distribution of pesticides between the two water phases and ideal equilibrium reached the retention percentage of the pesticides should be 50 the deviation from 50 indicated that there were other interactions between the pesticides and molecular backbone of sap 3 2 retention and release isotherms of pesticides by w sap retention and release isotherms of bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole were fitted well by freundlich model with r2 0 98 fig 3 the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 in general the retention capacity of sap for imidacloprid and propiconazole was the highest according to the kf values more specifically it followed the order imidacloprid propiconazole metalaxyl mcpa bentazone glyphosate the retention isotherms of all the pesticides were close to linear as indicated by the 1 nads values range from 0 93 to 1 16 except for glyphosate which was 1 27 if we assume the pesticides were just retained in the gel water of w sap with n 1 the kf value for the pesticides would be 0 0988 l g the water absorption capacity of sap except that imidacloprid and propiconazole had kf values close to 0 0988 all the other pesticides had kf values below 0 0988 this implied that distribution of all the pesticides prevailed in the gel water of w sap but imidacloprid and propiconazole exhibited higher distribution in the gel water than the other pesticides the kf values in this study were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of compounds with similar logd values by the other common substrates e g petcoke zeolite in cws reported by zhang et al 2018a besides all the investigated substrates sand blast iron slag zeolite etc in the study showed no or very low sorption especially for the most hydrophilic compound iohexol note that in our study the kf values of the pesticides showed minor differences a factor of 5 although their logd values range from 7 24 for glyphosate and to 4 33 for propiconazole table s1 retention of the pesticides by w sap was related to the ionization state and water solubility of the pesticides w sap showed higher retention for neutral pesticides imidacloprid metalaxyl and propiconazole whereas lower for anionic pesticides bentazone glyphosate and mcpa the sap is an anionic polymer thus the retention of anionic pesticides was lower due to electrostatic repulsion among the neutral pesticides metalaxyl with the highest water solubility table s1 displayed lower retention than imidacloprid and propiconazole similarly the most water soluble glyphosate showed lower retention than the other two anionic pesticides bentazone and mcpa the release ability of the pesticides followed the order glyphosate metalaxyl bentazone propiconazole imidacloprid mcpa see k f des in table 1 except for bentazone and glyphosate all the other pesticides had linear release isotherms the k f des values of the pesticides showed similar pattern comparing with 0 0988 l g except that mcpa had k f des value larger than 0 0988 0 116 this suggested that the release of the pesticides mainly resulted from their diffusion between the gel water and outer water the observation was in agreement with the hysteresis indexes of the pesticides being small the hysteresis indexes were negative for bentazone except for ce 1 mg l glyphosate except for ce 1 mg l metalaxyl and propiconazole implying insignificant hysteresis imidacloprid and mcpa had hi 0 but it was still small 1 table 1 indicating slight hysteresis in addition the hysteresis index depends on the concentration except for imidacloprid and metalaxyl hysteresis increased to a slight extent for the other four pesticides with the increase of their concentrations noteworthy is that mcpa showed relatively significant hysteresis among the pesticides in particular at high concentrations e g ce 1 mg l the low values of hysteresis indexes indicated the retained pesticides were readily released from w sap 3 3 process analysis of pesticide retention by w sap and implications for sap application to cws the retention and release processes were studied through the distribution ratio k d fig 4 the retention of the pesticides except for imidacloprid and propiconazole at low concentrations was ascribed to their distribution in the gel water phase of w sap rather than adsorption on the backbone of sap as indicated by the ratio k d s 1 similar trends were observed for the release process except that mcpa had ratio k d d 1 when c e d 1 mg l propiconazole and imidaclorid had k d ratios 1 when ce 1 mg l during both retention and release process indicating their adsorption on the backbone of w sap we consider that the affinity of a pesticide for the w sap s backbone molecule increases with the decrease of hydrophilicity therefore propiconazole which has the lowest hydrophilicity highest logd table s1 had the highest kd value however their ratios decreased to below 1 when ce 1 mg l at high concentrations the competition of pesticides distribution between the two water phases prevailed we consider that the water activity in the outer water is higher than that in the gel water phase where salts keeping the backbone structure intact and water bound by the backbone molecules are present this could result in higher dissolution and distribution of pesticides in the outer water diminishing the kd values the lower release of mcpa suggests stronger interaction of mcpa with w sap which is in accord with the positive hi values of mcpa table 1 li et al 2013 suggested a negative charge assisted h bond between a carboxyl group of the solute and carboxylate group of sorbent contributes to the sorption of ionic compounds to carbonaceous sorbents such an h bond might also exist between the carboxylic group of mcpa and the carboxylate group of the acrylic acid of sap network although glyphosate also has the carboxylate group its anionic state and high water solubility hindered the interaction with the backbone molecule of w sap hence glyphosate did not show hysteresis like mcpa to sum up it appeared that the main driving force of the pesticide retention was the diffusion of pesticides from outer water phase into the gel water phase of w sap this is in accord with the kf values which varied in a small range and the release of pesticide with insignificant hysteresis moreover we consider that interaction between the pesticides and the backbone molecule of w sap resulted in adsorption which slightly increased the retention capacity e g propiconazole and caused also irreversible retention e g mcpa the application of w sap in cws is expected to improve removal efficiency of pesticides firstly gel water phase of w sap can serve as a buffer zone for influents containing high concentrations of pesticides thereby reducing the pesticide concentration in effluents secondly since there is no defined interface between the gel water phase and the outer water pesticides retained in the gel water are considered to be still bioavailable thirdly the diffusion of pesticides between the gel water of w sap and outer water driven by concentration difference i e the retention and release processes can also increase the relative retention time of pesticides in cws which usually leads to enhanced removal of pesticides gaullier et al 2019 lyu et al 2018 in other words similar to other porous media in general the pore space supplied by w sap provides larger pore volume for cw thus enhancing the hrt therefore high retention of pesticides by w sap can be obtained by either increasing the applied amount of sap or employing sap with high water absorption capacity however applying large amounts of w sap can decrease hydraulic conductivity and stability of cw matrix data not shown moreover sap with very high water absorption capacity usually loses some water retaining capacity and mechanical strength due to fertilizer and salts saha et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 thus the selection and application of sap for cws should consider the above issues and make trade off 3 4 removal of pesticides in lab scale cws with w sap as a supplement to substrate due to the fact that the evapotranspiration of some cws were more than 95 with the initial hrt of 12 d we reduced the hrt to 8 d after 30 days to observe more pronounced differences all the wetlands had almost 100 removal for nh4 no3 po4 3 however the four wetlands two filled with a mixture of pumice and sap and two with conventional gravel all showed differences in dissolved oxygen contents ph and redox conditions fig s2 and thus they cannot be treated as parallels therefore we provide the trends of the removal efficiencies of all cws as individual data sets in fig 5 both gravel cws and sap cws showed high removal 82 for glyphosate mcpa and propiconazole independent of the hrt removal of bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl in all cws was lower than that for glyphosate mcpa and propiconazole but cws with sap and pumice showed superior removal for bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl over the gravel cws the removal of these pesticides in cws can be attributed to various processes such as sorption uptake by plants and microbial degradation vymazal and bfezinova 2015 sorption and degradation can be responsible for glyphosate removal in all the cws considering the high sorption of glyphosate by gravel and pumice found in the batch experiment fig s3 the highest removal of glyphosate 98 in our gravel cws coincides with the findings of lópez chávez s investigation where less than 1 5 of initial applied glyphosate was detected in outlet water of cws lópez chávez et al 2021 the removal of propiconazole 82 in our cws was similar to that reported by others in which there was 88 mass reduction of propiconazole by a subsurface flow cw mcmaine et al 2020 the removal of propiconazole from our cws can result from both sorption and degradation sorption and retention of mcpa was low by all the substrates gravel pumice and w sap fig s3 uptake of mcpa by reed canary grass was found to be minor in a batch experiment butkovskyi et al 2021 studies found mcpa degrades rapidly under aerobic conditions lopez pineiro et al 2019 morton et al 2020 sørensen et al 2006 gravel cws and sap cws were both in aerobic conditions as indicated by the do values between 2 6 mg l fig s2 the lower removal of 54 was only found in one of the gravel cw on day 44 which can be explained by the lower redox potential detected in this specific cw system fig s2 studies showed that bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl were recalcitrant to degradation baskaran et al 1999 broholm et al 2001 jones and ananyeva 2001 after increasing the hydraulic loading rate the removal of bentazone in cws with w sap varied between 38 73 and between 9 96 in gravel cws removal of imidacloprid was 62 99 in sap cws with increment during the later sampling time and 46 98 in gravel cws with fluctuation cws with w sap removed 50 84 metalaxyl while gravel cws retained 32 97 fig 5 from day 44 we consider the cws as stable operating thereafter the removal of bentazone imidacloprid and metalxyl were consistently higher in cws with sap and pumice in comparison to gravel cws control the enhanced removal was up to 60 for bentazone 46 for imidacloprid and up to 35 for metalaxyl sorption of these three pesticides by gravel and pumice was much lower than that of glyphosate and propiconazole fig s3 a previous study suggests that bentazone was not likely to be taken up by plants butkovskyi et al 2021 other studies found that hardly degradable bentazone degraded faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions and its removal efficiency can be improved by increasing oxygen availability hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 lopez pineiro et al 2017 interestingly higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and redox potential were detected in our cws with w sap in comparison to the gravel cws fig s2 this might result from the higher oxygen diffusivity in w sap cws which contained highly porous pumice njau et al 2003 thus the retention of bentazone by sap and higher oxygen concentration in cws with sap and pumice could contribute to the higher removal of bentazone in cws containing sap and pumice whereas considerable translocation of imidacloprid and metalaxyl in plants was observed in a previous study butkovskyi et al 2021 hence plant uptake and biodegradation could contribute to the removal of imidacloprid and metalaxyl in all cws above all sap cws generally exhibited better performance than gravel cws for removing pesticides in particular for recalcitrant ones the enhanced removal of the pesticides is believed to be partly because of retention by w sap and partly because of fostered bio degradation by increased pesticide residence time which was from retention and release cycle of pesticide in the gel water of w sap and interstitial water of cws the application of pumice in sap cws compensated the weak matrix stability of w sap as well as low retention capacity of w sap for some pesticides e g glyphosate thus pumice helped maintain the stability and performance of sap cws 4 conclusion w sap can retain considerable amounts of a variety of hydrophilic pesticides within short times of several hours pesticides are less retained when they have opposite ionization state to w sap and have high water solubility the application of sap as supplement substrate of cws improved the removal of all tested pesticides due to the big variations of the results we expect that determined pesticide removal by the sap cws is underestimated based on the results from the batch experiment the enhanced pesticide removal can be ascribed to pesticide retention by w sap and increase of pesticide retention time in cws in view of the low cost and the approval of sap for water retention in agriculture use as well as the efficacy of removing pesticides sap can be considered as a promising cw substrate in addition the size of cw can be reduced due to the increased pore volume by w sap in the cw at the same time high hrt can still be achieved and be comparable with that of the large sized common cw however further studies should involve i testing the stability of sap in cws ii investigating biodegradability of sap and iii exploring transformation of pesticides in sap containing cws under various operation conditions in addition it is worth paying attention to the impurities in the sap and degradation products of sap declaration of competing interest the authors

16509,surface water runoff can export pesticides from agricultural fields into adjacent aquatic ecosystems where they may pose adverse effects to organisms constructed wetlands cws are widely used to treat agricultural runoff contaminated by pesticides but the removal of hydrophilic pesticides is usually low in this study we suggest superabsorbent polymer sap a cross linked hydrophilic polymer as a supplement to substrates of cws and tested the hypothesis that sap results in an enhanced removal of hydrophilic pesticides therefore batch experiments were conducted to study the retention capacity of water saturated sap w sap for several hydrophilic pesticides retention of the pesticides on w sap was related to the ionization state and water solubility of the pesticides the retention of neutral pesticides imidacloprid metalaxyl and propiconazole was about 20 higher than that measured for anionic pesticides bentazone glyphosate and mcpa the retention of the pesticides by w sap mainly resulted from their distribution in the gel water phase of w sap while less water soluble pesticides might have also been adsorbed on the molecular backbone of sap furthermore we tested the efficacy of w sap for treatment of runoff water contaminated by pesticides in lab scale horizontal subsurface flow cws sap in cws improved the removal of the pesticides including the recalcitrant ones the removal enhancement was owing to the increase of hydraulic retention time and improvement of biodegradation the removal of the pesticides in sap containing cws was 93 for mcpa glyphosate and propiconazole 62 99 for imidacloprid 50 84 for metalaxyl and 38 73 for bentazone in the control gravel cws the removal was 98 for glyphosate generally 83 for mcpa and propiconazole 46 98 for imidacloprid 32 97 for metalaxyl and 9 96 for bentazone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords superabsorbent polymer constructed wetland hydrophilic pesticide retention sorption 1 introduction pesticides are

hydrophilic chen et al 2019 also the removal efficiency of hydrophilic pesticides in cws is usually low vymazal and bfezinova 2015 thus new approaches are needed to increase removal efficiency of

a cross linked hydrophilic polymer material which has an unique ability to retain large volumes of water or aqueous solutions ma and wen 2020 zohuriaan mehr and kabiri 2008 it is widely applied in agriculture to promote plant growth in semi arid and arid areas through the retention of water and nutrients and is not considered to be toxic islam et al 2011 yang et al 2014 in addition sap is used in wastewater treatment to remove pollutants mostly dyes by adsorption alsbaiee et al 2016 dhiman et al 2015 fosso kankeu et al 2015 water saturated sap w sap added in planted soil filters retained pesticides considerably particularly hydrophilic ones and also improved pesticide removal butkovskyi et al 2021 to date however it is still unclear which processes actually govern the retention of pesticides by w sap besides the efficacy of sap application in cws for pesticide removal has never been investigated we hypothesize that pesticide retention processes by w sap can be i adsorption on the molecular backbone of the w sap or ii the diffusion of pesticides from the outer water to the gel water phase of the w sap absorption and the application of sap as a new substrate to cws can enhance the removal of hydrophilic pesticides from agricultural runoff therefore the objectives of this study were to i explore the retention capability and retention processes of w sap for six hydrophilic pesticides bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole and ii examine the efficacy of w sap as substrate in cws for these pesticides removal retention kinetics and isotherms of the retention and release of the pesticides by w sap were tested in batch experiments we also distinguished between the adsorption of pesticides on sap backbone molecules and their distribution in gel water phase of w sap moreover the removal efficiencies for the pesticides were determined in lab scale horizontal sub surface flow hssf cws with a mixture of sap and pumice as the substrate pumice is needed to stabilize the hydrogel phase of w sap and increase the hydraulic conductivity of cw substrates bollman et al 2019 this approach was compared against conventional cws with

purchased from agricultural polymers international ltd durham uk who stated the material as nontoxic and degradable in the long run it is often used in horticulture and agriculture for retaining water broadleaf p4 is a cross linked copolymer of acrylamide and acrylate and has a grain size of 0 5 2 8 mm its water absorption capacity was 98 8 0 8 g g gram of absorbed tap water per gram of sap which was measured by a sieve method according to zohuriaan mehr and kabiri 2008 pumice was obtained from vulkatec plaidt germany gravel was purchased from a local market leipzig germany pumice and gravel were passed through a 4 mm sieve to remove the small size particles obtaining a grain size of 4 12 mm 2 2 retention of the pesticides by w sap in batch experiment 2 2 1 batch retention experiment batch retention experiments were conducted based on oecd 106 oecd 2000 all experiments were carried out in 50 ml sterile polypropylene pp vials in triplicates the vials were placed on an orbital shaker unimax 1010 heidolph at 250 rpm and at 25 c dry sap was first saturated with tap water more chemical similarity to runoff water compared to miliq or deionized water for 1 5 h before mixing with pesticide solutions individual pesticide solution was prepared by dissolving 10 0 mg of solid pesticide bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl in 100 ml of tap water yielding a 100 mg l of stock solution for each pesticide due to low water solubility of propiconazole 50 mg l of its stock solution was prepared the stock solution of each pesticide was then diluted with tap water to meet the required concentrations for determination of retention kinetics or retention and release isotherms for the experiments 20 ml of each pesticide solution was mixed with w sap which had a dry weight of 0 20 g before saturating with water the mixture solutions had a ph around 7 5 a blank treatment with pesticide solution but without w sap was included in order to check the sorption of the pesticides on pp vials retention kinetic was investigated with 1 mg l of pesticide solution at different time intervals for each pesticide separately more specifically after 5 10 30 min 2 h and 24 h an aliquot of water sample was taken from the water phase of each pesticide solution for pesticide concentration determination the concentration was quantified after dilution with miliq water by either lc hrms or lc ms ms see sec 2 4 the retention percentage of the pesticides by w sap was calculated by the following equation 1 r e t e n t i o n o f p e s t i c i d e s c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of the pesticide ct mg l is the concentration at time t retention and release isotherms were determined for the pesticides separately at 25 c with an equilibrium time of 24 h the studied concentrations of the pesticide were 0 01 0 05 0 50 5 10 mg l for all pesticides except for propiconazole the solutions of propiconazole were prepared as follows 0 01 0 05 0 5 2 and 5 mg l these concentrations ranged from close to environmentally detected concentrations µg l to relatively high concentrations mg l after retention the excess water of w sap was removed by passing through a 150 µm sieve then the w sap was resuspended in 20 ml of tap water and placed back onto the shaker after 24 h of equilibrium the water was sampled again for pesticides analysis the amount of pesticides retained in sap was determined by 2 c s c 0 c e v m where cs mg g is the amount of pesticide retained in per g of sap ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of pesticide v l is the volume of pesticide solution and m g is the mass of sap the freundlich isotherm model was used to fit the retention and release data from isotherms with originpro 9 6 according to the following equation 3 c s k f c e 1 n where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich coefficient indicating retention capacity 1 n is the freundlich exponent which indicates retention intensity the hysteresis index hi was calculated according to huang et al 1998 4 h i c s d c s s c s s t c e where c s d mg g and c s s mg g are the amount of pesticide retained per g of sap in release and retention experiment respectively and calculated based on the parameters of freundlich model fitted by release and retention data respectively t is the temperature at which the experiment was carried out here hi for each pesticide was calculated accordingly at concentration of 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 1 mg l negative and zero hi imply reversible retention whereas positive values suggest hysteresis exists 2 2 2 retention processes analysis the equilibration of pesticide distribution existed between outer water gel water phase and backbone molecule of w sap if it is assumed that the retained pesticides are distributed merely in the gel water phase of w sap a concentration ce sap which represents pesticide concentration in gel water phase of w sap can be calculated as follows 5 c e s a p m p v s a p where m p mg is the amount of pesticides retained by w sap which is derived from equation 2 by multiplying the mass of sap v s a p l is the volume of gel water retained by w sap hence the distribution ratio kd is defined as this concentration to the corresponding equilibrium concentration in the outer water solution 6 k d c e s a p c e since the ratio of gel water of w sap and outer water is 1 when k d 1 we consider adsorption of pesticides on the molecular backbone of w sap otherwise pesticides were distributed in the gel water phase of w sap 2 3 application of w sap to lab scale cws 2 3 1 setup of cws and application of pesticides lab scale hssf cws were set up for testing sap as a supplement of cw substrate to retain pesticides from agricultural runoff fig 1 and fig s1 two types of cws with different substrates were included one had the substrate which was a mixture of w sap and pumice at a dry weight ratio of 5 sap pumice dw dw the other had conventional gravel as the substrate and served as control each cw treatment gravel or w sap pumice comprised two independent units in all cws 10 cm seedlings of reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea were planted which was chosen due to its fast growth and reported high potential for pesticide removal in its rhizosphere elsaesser et al 2011 vymazal 2013 each lab scale wetland unit had a size of 0 90 0 15 0 35 m l w h fertilizer 0 25 g l

organic matter content 37 clay 41 silt and 22 sand the extract was diluted with tap water resulting in 3 5 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc in the wetland influent the flow rate of cws remained 2 l d during plant development period all the cws were maintained in the greenhouse at the temperature of 22 c from 6 am to 9 pm and 16 c at night illumination by master son pia 400 w phillips belgium was switched on as supplementary light source when the natural light strength fall below 60 klx after four months of plant growth pesticides solutions were supplied to the cws when the plant height reached around 90 cm the pesticide solution was a mixture of bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole the solutions were dosed continuously to the influents of cws by use of infusion pumps targeting final inflow concentrations between 20 50 µg l the inflow rate for all cws was 2 l d which corresponded to a hrt of 12 d due to the high evapotranspiration of cws the flow rate was increased to 3 l d after 4 weeks resulting in a hrt of 8 d the infusion rate of pesticides solution was also adjusted to maintain the same concentration in the influent as the condition of 2 l d of influent pesticides were continuously applied for 65 days in addition to the lab scale cws the retention and sorption potential of the pesticides mixture by the cw substrates w sap pumice gravel was tested in batch experiments see supplementary information 2 3 2 sampling of cws and water analysis water samples were taken weekly from the influent and effluent of the cws concentrations

performed by internal standard calibration using isotope labelled compounds the details on sample preparation instrumental parameters for the pesticides and method validation can be found in supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 retention kinetics of pesticides by w sap retention kinetics of the pesticides by w sap was fast and reached equilibrium already after 2 h fig 2 for each pesticide over half of the initially applied amount was retained by w sap in the first 10 min thereafter the retention rate slowed down the rapid retention rate of pesticides by polymer was also reported in other studies alsbaiee et al 2016 vergili and barlas 2009 the fast retention of pesticides by w sap improves the removal of pesticides when the contact time of w sap with water is short and there is fast water flow sap showed the highest retention of 63 for propiconazole while it was lower for metalaxyl and imidacloprid with comparable retentions of 49 and between 34 and 36 for bentazone mcpa and glyphosate were noticed since the water absorption capacity per g sap is around 98 8 g the ratio of the gel water of w sap and the outer water is close to 1 1 v v if there was only distribution of pesticides between the two water phases and ideal equilibrium reached the retention percentage of the pesticides should be 50 the deviation from 50 indicated that there were other interactions between the pesticides and molecular backbone of sap 3 2 retention and release isotherms of pesticides by w sap retention and release isotherms of bentazone glyphosate imidacloprid mcpa metalaxyl and propiconazole were fitted well by freundlich model with r2 0 98 fig 3 the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 in general the retention capacity of sap for imidacloprid and propiconazole was the highest according to the kf values more specifically it followed the order imidacloprid propiconazole metalaxyl mcpa bentazone glyphosate the retention isotherms of all the pesticides were close to linear as indicated by the 1 nads values range from 0 93 to 1 16 except for glyphosate which was 1 27 if we assume the pesticides were just retained in the gel water of w sap with n 1 the kf value for the pesticides would be 0 0988 l g the water absorption capacity of sap except that imidacloprid and propiconazole had kf values close to 0 0988 all the other pesticides had kf values below 0 0988 this implied that distribution of all the pesticides prevailed in the gel water of w sap but imidacloprid and propiconazole exhibited higher distribution in the gel water than the other pesticides the kf values in this study were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of compounds with similar logd values by the other common substrates e g petcoke zeolite in cws reported by zhang et al 2018a besides all the investigated substrates sand blast iron slag zeolite etc in the study showed no or very low sorption especially for the most hydrophilic compound iohexol note that in our study the kf values of the pesticides showed minor differences a factor of 5 although their logd values range from 7 24 for glyphosate and to 4 33 for propiconazole table s1 retention of the pesticides by w sap was related to the ionization state and water solubility of the pesticides w sap showed higher retention for neutral pesticides imidacloprid metalaxyl and propiconazole whereas lower for anionic pesticides bentazone glyphosate and mcpa the sap is an anionic polymer thus the retention of anionic pesticides was lower due to electrostatic repulsion among the neutral pesticides metalaxyl with the highest water solubility table s1 displayed lower retention than imidacloprid and propiconazole similarly the most water soluble glyphosate showed lower retention than the other two anionic pesticides bentazone and mcpa the release ability of the pesticides followed the order glyphosate metalaxyl bentazone propiconazole imidacloprid mcpa see k f des in table 1 except for bentazone and glyphosate all the other pesticides had linear release isotherms the k f des values of the pesticides showed similar pattern comparing with 0 0988 l g except that mcpa had k f des value larger than 0 0988 0 116 this suggested that the release of the pesticides mainly resulted from their diffusion between the gel water and outer water the observation was in agreement with the hysteresis indexes of the pesticides being small the hysteresis indexes were negative for bentazone except for ce 1 mg l glyphosate except for ce 1 mg l metalaxyl and propiconazole implying insignificant hysteresis imidacloprid and mcpa had hi 0 but it was still small 1 table 1 indicating slight hysteresis in addition the hysteresis index depends on the concentration except for imidacloprid and metalaxyl hysteresis increased to a slight extent for the other four pesticides with the increase of their concentrations noteworthy is that mcpa showed relatively significant hysteresis among the pesticides in particular at high concentrations e g ce 1 mg l the low values of hysteresis indexes indicated the retained pesticides were readily released from w sap 3 3 process analysis of pesticide retention by w sap and implications for sap application to cws the retention and release processes were studied through the distribution ratio k d fig 4 the retention of the pesticides except for imidacloprid and propiconazole at low concentrations was ascribed to their distribution in the gel water phase of w sap rather than adsorption on the backbone of sap as indicated by the ratio k d s 1 similar trends were observed for the release process except that mcpa had ratio k d d 1 when c e d 1 mg l propiconazole and imidaclorid had k d ratios 1 when ce 1 mg l during both retention and release process indicating their adsorption on the backbone of w sap we consider that the affinity of a pesticide for the w sap s backbone molecule increases with the decrease of hydrophilicity therefore propiconazole which has the lowest hydrophilicity highest logd table s1 had the highest kd value however their ratios decreased to below 1 when ce 1 mg l at high concentrations the competition of pesticides distribution between the two water phases prevailed we consider that the water activity in the outer water is higher than that in the gel water phase where salts keeping the backbone structure intact and water bound by the backbone molecules are present this could result in higher dissolution and distribution of pesticides in the outer water diminishing the kd values the lower release of mcpa suggests stronger interaction of mcpa with w sap which is in accord with the positive hi values of mcpa table 1 li et al 2013 suggested a negative charge assisted h bond between a carboxyl group of the solute and carboxylate group of sorbent contributes to the sorption of ionic compounds to carbonaceous sorbents such an h bond might also exist between the carboxylic group of mcpa and the carboxylate group of the acrylic acid of sap network although glyphosate also has the carboxylate group its anionic state and high water solubility hindered the interaction with the backbone molecule of w sap hence glyphosate did not show hysteresis like mcpa to sum up it appeared that the main driving force of the pesticide retention was the diffusion of pesticides from outer water phase into the gel water phase of w sap this is in accord with the kf values which varied in a small range and the release of pesticide with insignificant hysteresis moreover we consider that interaction between the pesticides and the backbone molecule of w sap resulted in adsorption which slightly increased the retention capacity e g propiconazole and caused also irreversible retention e g mcpa the application of w sap in cws is expected to improve removal efficiency of pesticides firstly gel water phase of w sap can serve as a buffer zone for influents containing high concentrations of pesticides thereby reducing the pesticide concentration in effluents secondly since there is no defined interface between the gel water phase and the outer water pesticides retained in the gel water are considered to be still bioavailable thirdly the diffusion of pesticides between the gel water of w sap and outer water driven by concentration difference i e the retention and release processes can also increase the relative retention time of pesticides in cws which usually leads to enhanced removal of pesticides gaullier et al 2019 lyu et al 2018 in other words similar to other porous media in general the pore space supplied by w sap provides larger pore volume for cw thus enhancing the hrt therefore high retention of pesticides by w sap can be obtained by either increasing the applied amount of sap or employing sap with high water absorption capacity however applying large amounts of w sap can decrease hydraulic conductivity and stability of cw matrix data not shown moreover sap with very high water absorption capacity usually loses some water retaining capacity and mechanical strength due to fertilizer and salts saha et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 thus the selection and application of sap for cws should consider the above issues and make trade off 3 4 removal of pesticides in lab scale cws with w sap as a supplement to substrate due to the fact that the evapotranspiration of some cws were more than 95 with the initial hrt of 12 d we reduced the hrt to 8 d after 30 days to observe more pronounced differences all the wetlands had almost 100 removal for nh4 no3 po4 3 however the four wetlands two filled with a mixture of pumice and sap and two with conventional gravel all showed differences in dissolved oxygen contents ph and redox conditions fig s2 and thus they cannot be treated as parallels therefore we provide the trends of the removal efficiencies of all cws as individual data sets in fig 5 both gravel cws and sap cws showed high removal 82 for glyphosate mcpa and propiconazole independent of the hrt removal of bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl in all cws was lower than that for glyphosate mcpa and propiconazole but cws with sap and pumice showed superior removal for bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl over the gravel cws the removal of these pesticides in cws can be attributed to various processes such as sorption uptake by plants and microbial degradation vymazal and bfezinova 2015 sorption and degradation can be responsible for glyphosate removal in all the cws considering the high sorption of glyphosate by gravel and pumice found in the batch experiment fig s3 the highest removal of glyphosate 98 in our gravel cws coincides with the findings of lópez chávez s investigation where less than 1 5 of initial applied glyphosate was detected in outlet water of cws lópez chávez et al 2021 the removal of propiconazole 82 in our cws was similar to that reported by others in which there was 88 mass reduction of propiconazole by a subsurface flow cw mcmaine et al 2020 the removal of propiconazole from our cws can result from both sorption and degradation sorption and retention of mcpa was low by all the substrates gravel pumice and w sap fig s3 uptake of mcpa by reed canary grass was found to be minor in a batch experiment butkovskyi et al 2021 studies found mcpa degrades rapidly under aerobic conditions lopez pineiro et al 2019 morton et al 2020 sørensen et al 2006 gravel cws and sap cws were both in aerobic conditions as indicated by the do values between 2 6 mg l fig s2 the lower removal of 54 was only found in one of the gravel cw on day 44 which can be explained by the lower redox potential detected in this specific cw system fig s2 studies showed that bentazone imidacloprid and metalaxyl were recalcitrant to degradation baskaran et al 1999 broholm et al 2001 jones and ananyeva 2001 after increasing the hydraulic loading rate the removal of bentazone in cws with w sap varied between 38 73 and between 9 96 in gravel cws removal of imidacloprid was 62 99 in sap cws with increment during the later sampling time and 46 98 in gravel cws with fluctuation cws with w sap removed 50 84 metalaxyl while gravel cws retained 32 97 fig 5 from day 44 we consider the cws as stable operating thereafter the removal of bentazone imidacloprid and metalxyl were consistently higher in cws with sap and pumice in comparison to gravel cws control the enhanced removal was up to 60 for bentazone 46 for imidacloprid and up to 35 for metalaxyl sorption of these three pesticides by gravel and pumice was much lower than that of glyphosate and propiconazole fig s3 a previous study suggests that bentazone was not likely to be taken up by plants butkovskyi et al 2021 other studies found that hardly degradable bentazone degraded faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions and its removal efficiency can be improved by increasing oxygen availability hedegaard and albrechtsen 2014 lopez pineiro et al 2017 interestingly higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and redox potential were detected in our cws with w sap in comparison to the gravel cws fig s2 this might result from the higher oxygen diffusivity in w sap cws which contained highly porous pumice njau et al 2003 thus the retention of bentazone by sap and higher oxygen concentration in cws with sap and pumice could contribute to the higher removal of bentazone in cws containing sap and pumice whereas considerable translocation of imidacloprid and metalaxyl in plants was observed in a previous study butkovskyi et al 2021 hence plant uptake and biodegradation could contribute to the removal of imidacloprid and metalaxyl in all cws above all sap cws generally exhibited better performance than gravel cws for removing pesticides in particular for recalcitrant ones the enhanced removal of the pesticides is believed to be partly because of retention by w sap and partly because of fostered bio degradation by increased pesticide residence time which was from retention and release cycle of pesticide in the gel water of w sap and interstitial water of cws the application of pumice in sap cws compensated the weak matrix stability of w sap as well as low retention capacity of w sap for some pesticides e g glyphosate thus pumice helped maintain the stability and performance of sap cws 4 conclusion w sap can retain considerable amounts of a variety of hydrophilic pesticides within short times of several hours pesticides are less retained when they have opposite ionization state to w sap and have high water solubility the application of sap as supplement substrate of cws improved the removal of all tested pesticides due to the big variations of the results we expect that determined pesticide removal by the sap cws is underestimated based on the results from the batch experiment the enhanced pesticide removal can be ascribed to pesticide retention by w sap and increase of pesticide retention time in cws in view of the low cost and the approval of sap for water retention in agriculture use as well as the efficacy of removing pesticides sap can be considered as a promising cw substrate in addition the size of cw can be reduced due to the increased pore volume by w sap in the cw at the same time high hrt can still be achieved and be comparable with that of the large sized common cw however further studies should involve i testing the stability of sap in cws ii investigating biodegradability of sap and iii exploring transformation of pesticides in sap containing cws under various operation conditions in addition it is worth paying attention to the impurities in the sap and degradation products of sap declaration of competing interest the authors
