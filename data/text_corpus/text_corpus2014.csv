10070,the determination of the volumetric soil water content θv by means of capacitive profile probes is often applied to investigate the soil water storage change δs that serves as basis for decisions in agricultural water management the soil properties have a big effect on the accuracy of the θv measurements the use of only one calibration function often provided by the manufacturers of the probes cannot fulfil the requirements of all site conditions therefore many individual calibration functions have in the past been determined for different soils and sensors a literature review of existing calibration functions of the capacitive profile probe diviner 2000 shows the broad range of available functions the review makes it clear that there is a lack of functions for organic soils these soils are typical soils of wet sites with shallow groundwater tables the soil moisture is of big importance for many ecological processes of these sites and therefore an exact determination of θv is important a diviner 2000 profile probe was calibrated on such a shallow groundwater site in a classic field calibration procedure and the determined functions were applied to the soil profile of a weighable groundwater lysimeter the soil water storage change δs was estimated with the measured θv values and compared with the measured mass change δm of the lysimeter the mean error bias between δs with the field calibration function and δm was 7 8 kg and the root mean squared error rmse 19 9 kg an iterative adaptation of the calibration functions to the measured δm values of the lysimeter reduced the bias to 0 9 kg and the rmse to 14 0 kg the investigations illustrate the problems of a classic field calibration under the conditions of a shallow groundwater site with low θv changes in deeper soil horizons and soils with high corg contents as well as the inaccuracy in the determination of δs based on θv measurements with capacitive profile probes keywords shallow groundwater site organic soils volumetric soil water content capacitance probe diviner 2000 field calibration lysimeter water storage change 1 introduction a particular characteristic of many lowland regions are sites with shallow groundwater tables and organic soils in densely populated regions like central and western europe most of these sites have been agriculturally used for hundreds of years mostly as grassland but they still have high groundwater tables a few centimetres below the surface many of the shallow groundwater sites are peatlands and received progressively more attention as source or sink for greenhouse gas emissions during the last years the moisture conditions in the soil profile of these sites influences most processes in the water and matter cycle such as water consumption or storage as well as nutrient and gas emissions or storage after all the growth of the plants but also the composition of the species depends on these moisture conditions therefore a good knowledge of volumetric soil water content θv in a soil profile with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution is important for the understanding of many hydrological meteorological and ecological processes the change of θv reflects change of the water storage change δs in the soil profile and is the basis of a sustainable agricultural and water resources management there are many different possibilities to determine θv of study sites advantages and disadvantages of different methods of electromagnetic soil moisture sensors were evaluated in a series of papers blonquist et al 2005 da silva et al 2018 dobriyal et al 2012 evett et al 2012 jones et al 2005 lekshmi et al 2014 2018 robinson et al 2003 a comparison with gravimetrically determined volumetric soil water contents θgrav often serves as basis for calibration and verification of the measurement quality of the sensors however gravimetric measurements are labour intensive and they are connected with a destruction of the soil profile at the measurement point therefore neutron moisture meters are sometimes an alternative for the calibration of the electromagnetic sensors their main advantages are the relatively large sample volume and the suitability for profiling high costs radioactive risk hazards and regulations are a large disadvantage of the method lekshmi et al 2014 paltineanu and starr 1997 despite the lower measurement accuracy and the necessity of a calibration electromagnetic sensors are seen as a good compromise to get measurement serieses of θv with high temporal and spatial resolution within soil profiles for the investigations of soil water balance and as a basis for soil water management δs plays a particular role the measurement of θv in several depths of the soil profile offers a good possibility of the estimation of δs evett et al 2012 but also requires the installation of soil moisture probes at several depths the necessary horizontal installation of many probe types is labour intensive and connected with a relatively large destruction of the soil profile a good alternative are profile probes which can measure θv at several depths with relatively small destruction of the soil profile and comparatively simple installation profile probes can be portable probes e g diviner 2000 sentek sensor technologies stepney south australia or permanent multisensory probes e g enviroscan sentek sensor technologies or they combine both applications e g pr2 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk all three mentioned probes use capacitive sensors for the measurement of the permittivity of the soil evett et al 2006 θv can then be determined by using a soil specific calibration many publications document the necessity of a soil specific calibration gabriel et al 2010 jabro et al 2005 jones et al 2005 morgan et al 2001 paltineanu and starr 1997 the calibration functions of the same probe show large differences between the functions in dependence on the soil properties which do not allow the application of one function for a broad spectrum of soils paraskevas et al 2012 collected the parameters of 28 calibration functions of the probes enviroscan and diviner 2000 and showed the variety of soil properties calibration procedures field laboratory and resulting functions despite the many calibration functions in the literature for many site conditions suitable functions are still not available often the soils in the literature are agriculturally used rather dry soils just like wetter soils soils with high organic content are also underrepresented hence it is not surprising that suitable functions for soils of shallow groundwater sites are not available these soils often have a high organic content and they are almost saturated exclusively nachabe et al 2004 used an enviroscan profile probe for θv and δs determination under shallow groundwater conditions with fine sand they assumed that the default factory calibration is sufficient for their purposes and did no own calibration the results of the literature show that the application of capacitive profile probes without a soil specific calibration has a big uncertainty concerning the absolute θv values the producer of the probes argues that a calibration is not necessary if only the relative change of θv respectively δs is of interest sentek 2009 however mazahrih et al 2008 and evett et al 2009 found large differences between δs estimated with a neutron moisture meter and electromagnetic sensors including a diviner 2000 probe it is not sufficiently verified how far the soil properties can differ from the properties of the soil of the default factory calibration and an individual calibration is recommended calibration procedures are labour intensive and have to be done at sites with presumably the same soil properties as at the eventual study site because the procedure destroys the original soil profile a real evaluation of the performance of the calibration function and the accuracy of the θv and δs determination at the soil profile is not easily possible an option for the verification of a calibration function could be a weighable lysimeter but lysimeter monoliths often contain more than one soil layer hence the water storage change measured with the weighing system is a summarised value of θv in more than one layer with more than one calibration function a classic calibration procedure with extraction of soil cores for a gravimetric θv determination would destroy the lysimeter soil monolith thus a two step calibration with a classic calibration for single soil classes and the application of the determined calibration functions for the different soil layers in the lysimeter is necessary in any case the uncertainties in the transfer of the function from the calibration site to the lysimeter are unavoidable they must be minimised as far as possible the objective of this paper is the calibration of a diviner 2000 soil moisture probe on a shallow groundwater site with different soil layers the application of the calibration functions in a weighable groundwater lysimeter and their verification with the measured δs of the lysimeter the first step was a classic field calibration with θgrav measurements beside the lysimeter station then the functions were applied in the lysimeter based on the soil properties and verified in the last step the calibration functions were modified to reach a better adaptation of the δs values derived from θv to the δs values derived from δm of the lysimeter 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site and lysimeter station the study site is located in the spreewald wetland 51 52 n 14 02 e around 85 km south east of berlin germany the unesco biosphere reserve spreewald is one of the most famous german wetlands with a widely ramified water system which is intensively used for tourism a detailed description of the wetland and the water resource management systems therein is given by dietrich et al 2007 the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research has been operating a lysimeter station at a typical agricultural used grassland area with shallow groundwater conditions in the middle of the wetland since 2009 dietrich et al 2016 the groundwater lysimeter station contains four weighable soil monoliths each monolith has an area of 1 m2 and height of 2 m all monoliths were cut at the place where the station is located now they have the same soil profiles agreeing with the conditions beside the station the typical grassland vegetation was the same at all monoliths in 2009 each monolith is equipped with numerous measurement systems for water balance components which are described in detail in dietrich et al 2016 the time interval of the measurements is 10 min all monoliths have groundwater tables near the surface they are managed in different ways in dependence on the objectives of the investigations of the lysimeter station dietrich and kaiser 2017 the water tables of the site range between surface level in winter and spring around 60 cm below surface level b s l in normal summer months and down to 80 cm b s l in dry summers at the reference site four diviner access tubes were installed for a classic field calibration section 2 4 the soil profiles at these places contain three horizons the classification of the samples to the horizons was based on the dry bulk density the soil properties at the reference site beside the lysimeter station and in the lysimeter monolith are summarised in tables 1 and 2 2 2 diviner 2000 the diviner 2000 probe is a capacitance type soil water sensing system sentek environmental technologies stepney south australia a single sensor is fitted to a square rod that can be inserted into the soil in a polyvinyl chloride pvc access tube the sensor can be lowered down to a depth of 1 6 m the sensor measures a soil volume of 10 cm vertical height in 5 10 cm radial distance from the outer wall of the access tube sentek 2009 the output of the sensor are raw frequency readings affected by the air water soil mix of the soil volume outside the access tube this raw frequency values in soil fs will be normalised with the raw frequency values in air fa and water fw result is a scaled frequency sf 1 sf f a f s f a f w the calibration function 2 establishes the relationship between the scaled frequency sf and the volumetric water content θv of the soil surrounding the measuring tube at the respective measuring depth 2 θ v a sf b c where θv is the volumetric soil water content in cm³ cm³ and a b c are the calibration coefficients the probe can work in two different modes a scan mode where it automatically takes a measurement every 10 cm and the sf value is stored on the display unit or a continuous mode where readings are done at all depths in the continuous mode the values are not stored on the display unit the raw frequency value has to be written down manually and the sf has to be calculated later the advantage of this mode is a finer resolution of the measurement depth 2 3 existing diviner 2000 calibration functions as a result of a literature review existing calibration functions of the diviner 2000 soil moisture probe were analysed concerning information about soil properties and calibration functions like soil classes soil texture bulk density organic content function parameters a b and c of the function type of eq 2 performance of the functions r2 rmse range of input data and or validity θvmin θvmax sfmin sfmax we found 42 calibration functions for a diviner 2000 probe in ten publications with 35 different soil textures table 3 one publication did not have information about the relative proportions of sand silt and clay it contains only the names of soil textures haberland et al 2014 provenzano et al 2016 performed two different calibrations field and laboratory for all their soils the shares of field and laboratory calibrations are approximately equally distributed in the data set 22 vs 18 only three calibrations were performed on lysimeters the organic content of most soils was below 2 there are only two soils among the functions of groves and rose 2004 with an organic content above 10 the original publications contain both types of the calibration functions the type of eq 2 and the type of eq 3 3 sf a θ v b c in table 3 all coefficients of the type of eq 3 are transformed to the type of eq 2 while the a value of 40 functions is between 0 25 and 0 75 the b values are much more widely scattered the b value range is from 1 to 10 c values 0 are only used in the functions of evett et al 2006 a connection between soil types and the values of the coefficients was not recognisable the b value is of particular importance large b values mean a large increase of the θv values in the range of large sf values and thus large changes in the measured θv of the corresponding soil this has an effect on δs as well as on the measuring accuracy of the probe different b values mean that the same change in the measured frequency leads to different changes in the measured θv fig 1 illustrates the broad spectrum of soils in literature including the textures of soils on our site clay soils contain the most functions in literature 20 followed by sandy soils 11 and silty soils 7 we summarised all functions of a soil class that contained the information about their validity range fig 2 illustrates the variety of functions within each soil class the range of the sandy soil function is relatively slim and stretches along a large range of the sf from 0 4 to 1 0 the average of all sandy soil functions lies near the sentek function the clay soil functions have the broadest range maybe because they are the most functions only the clay soil functions of geesing et al 2004 have sf values 0 5 the average value of the clay soil functions is smaller as the sentek function for sf values 0 75 not significant the silty soil functions are the fewest 7 most of them cover only a range of sf values 0 8 fig 2 right the average value of the silty soil functions differs significantly from the sentek function p 0 01 it seems that the calibration procedures also have an impact the mean b value of laboratory calibration functions is significantly higher p 0 01 than the mean b value of field calibration functions 4 3 vs 2 9 the results of provenzano et al 2016 who carried out laboratory and field calibrations for the same soils 6 5 vs 1 8 show this especially clearly the comparison is not an evaluation of the two calibration methods but shows the sensitivity of a calibration procedure with respect to the prevailing boundary conditions fig 2 also shows that the validity range of most functions is for relatively low θv values up to 0 3 cm³ cm³ only a few calibration functions cover the range up to 0 5 cm³ cm³ and no function represents wetter soil moisture conditions which are typical conditions on shallow groundwater sites and soils with higher organic content 2 4 diviner field calibration at reference site the reference site is located directly beside the lysimeter station four pvc access tubes were installed for the calibration of the diviner 2000 probe in august 2018 a date with an especially deep groundwater table of 80 cm b s l the installation followed the instructions of the sentek calibration manual sentek 2011 the installation of the access tubes on shallow groundwater sites is much more difficult compared to sites with deep groundwater tables drilling within the tube in the saturated zone is not possible therefore the tubes could only be installed within the unsaturated zone the same problem exists when taking soil samples with a core cutter from the different horizons for gravimetric water content determination an open pit can also only be excavated in the unsaturated soil as soon as the saturated zone is reached the pit is filled with water therefore the maximum depth of the soil profile of the four gravimetric calibrations differed in dependence on the actual water table on the reference site at the day of taking the soil samples fig 3 another problem was that the deepest soil horizon never had dry conditions even though the water table was lower almost saturated conditions prevailed due to the capillary rise the time schedule for taking soil samples was determined by water tables and weather conditions thus the dates were chosen both under the driest possible conditions with a deep groundwater table 7th september 2018 and under wet conditions with a high groundwater table on the day after heavy precipitation 12th june 2019 two further samplings were carried out under medium conditions 6th august 2018 and 1st november 2018 at each of the four pvc access tubes the same procedure was conducted the procedure started with the measuring of the raw frequency of the diviner 2000 probe in 5 cm steps from the surface to the maximal depth of the tube and then back to the surface the mean value of each 5 cm step was used for the calculation of sf following eq 1 after measuring the raw frequency with diviner three undisturbed soil samples were extracted with a core cutter height 63 mm diameter 72 mm around the access tube starting at surface level and step by step downwards samples from four to nine depths were excavated depending on the water table the soil samples were weighed after the excavation they were then dried for 24 h at 105 c in an oven and weighed again the mass change divided by the volume of the soil core yields the gravimetrically determined volumetric soil water content θgrav at the end the three θgrav values of each depth and access tube were combined into an average θgrav value and assigned to the corresponding sf value in the next step all pairs of θgrav and sf values were sorted in three soil horizons depending on their excavation depth and bulk density all pairs of a horizon form the basis of respectively one horizon specific calibration function according to eq 2 2 5 diviner measurements in the lysimeter we used one of the four monoliths of the lysimeter station for the validation of a diviner 2000 probe for this purpose a pvc access tube was installed in the soil monolith in december 2017 during the installation the water table in the lysimeter monolith was lowered down to the bottom of the container the minimal distance between the tube and the sidewall of the lysimeter is 30 cm so that the measurement volume of the capacitance probe is completely inside the monolith measurements with the diviner 2000 probe were conducted in the lysimeter between march 2018 and july 2019 fig 3 the sf values were measured for 15 layers of 10 cm thickness in the scan mode during the measurement period the water table in the lysimeter followed the typical annual cycle with high levels in winter and deep levels in summer in summer 2018 the groundwater table in the lysimeter was deliberately lowered beneath the levels of the natural groundwater table of the surrounding area fig 3 to have a thicker unsaturated zone with more changes in θv for each date of the diviner measurements the mass of the lysimeter mi was selected from the lysimeter data set the mass change δmi was calculated as the difference to the lowest mass of the whole time series mmin on 7th september 2018 4 m i m i m min the date of the lowest mass was also the date with the deepest water table in the lysimeter during the measurements 2 6 lysimeter soil water content determination with diviner 2000 the determination of θv of the lysimeter soil profile was performed based on the sf of the diviner measurements in the lysimeter monolith and the calibration function of each layer than the θv values were cumulated over all layers up to a depth of 150 cm for each date the result is the water storage of the soil profile down to 150 cm depth s150i for each date the difference between s150i and s150 min the storage value of the 7th september 2018 results in the storage change δs150i 5 s 150 i s 150 i s 150 min the comparison of the time series of δmi and δs150i provides an information about the quality of the calibration functions with regard to the determination of the storage change in a soil profile using a diviner probe the comparison of the time series of δmi and δs150i was done for three different calibration approaches a the sentek factory calibration function was applied to all three horizons for the determination of θv b the three horizon specific field calibration functions from the own field calibration see 2 4 were applied to the horizons c a modified version of the field calibration functions of horizon one and three both functions were modified to reach a better fit between the mass change of the lysimeter δmi and the water storage change δs150i based on the θv values horizon 2 was excluded from this because of it being relatively thin and the relatively stable sf values so it was assumed to have no effect on δs therefore only the calibration functions of the first and third soil horizon were adapted to the time series of δmi by a nonlinear optimisation procedure using the excel addin solver frontline solvers www solver com the target was to minimise the square sum error sse of δs and δm 6 sse i 1 n m i s 150 i 2 the solver addin found an optimal solution in an iterative process in the first step the respective field calibration functions were applied to the horizons 2 and 3 and the calibration function of horizon 1 was adapted with solver so that the sse of δs and δm was minimised we started with the adaption of horizon 1 because it has the biggest effect on the δs and the other two horizons were saturated during most of the time in a second step the adapted calibration function of horizon 1 was applied to horizon 1 the field calibration function was applied to horizon 2 and the calibration function of horizon 3 was adapted to the mass change by the solver procedure 2 7 efficiency criteria different efficiency criteria are used for the assessment of the calibration functions following the recommendations of bennett et al 2013 and krause et al 2005 the root mean square error rmse describes the mean error it

ioa compares the sum of squared error between θgrav values and θv values to the sum of squared absolute values of the differences between the θv values and the mean θgrav value and between the observed θgrav values and the mean observed θgrav value this method is designed to be better at handling differences between modelled and observed means and variances bennett et al 2013 9 ioa 1 i 1 n θ gravi θ vi 2 i 1 n θ vi θ grav θ gravi θ grav 2 3 results 3 1 field calibration the average θgrav and corresponding sf values of the three horizons differed strongly fig 4a especially the θgrav values of horizon 1 differ from the values of horizon 2 and 3 the measured θgrav values of horizon 1 range between 0 2 and 0 6 cm³ cm³ with corresponding sf values between 0 42 and 0 97 the values are completely outside the range of all values we found in the calibration functions of the literature the differences between the θgrav and sf values of horizons 2 and 3 are relatively small the measured θgrav values range between 0 26 and 0 45 cm³ cm³ with corresponding sf values between 0 83 and 0 99 the measured θgrav and sf values cover a relatively small range because of the high groundwater table and relatively stable water content conditions there is a lack of very dry conditions in particular all values are within the range of known calibration functions from literature the first derivation of calibration functions represents the slope of the functions the slope of the calibration function has a big effect on the calculated δs values of a soil profile fig 4 b shows the slope of the calibration functions we found in literature for sandy soils the range of δθv for sf values smaller 0 8 is relatively small this means that the sensitivity of a function is relatively small concerning changing sf values on the other hand the sensitivity is high at high sf values which occur particularly in moist soils this means that the measurement error can be very large if no soil specific calibration is available since the scatter of the function slopes is large it underlines once again the necessity of soil specific calibration therefore we decided not to combine the horizons 2 and 3 the soil specific calibration functions with parameter and quality performance are presented in fig 5 and table 4 the performance parameters in table 4 underline the improvement of the calibration functions compared to the default sentek calibration especially the rmse of horizon 1 decreases from 0 142 cm³ cm³ to 0 041 cm³ cm³ the θv values of the horizons 1 and 3 calculated with the default calibration function sentek and the horizon specific classical gravimetric field calibration function field calibration are significantly different p 0 01 the corresponding θv values of horizon 2 are not significantly different 3 2 lysimeter water content and water storage change between 26th march 2018 and 27th july 2019 26 diviner measurements were conducted in the lysimeter soil profile fig 3 during this time the water table in the lysimeter followed an annual cycle with the highest levels in april 2018 4 cm b s l and the deepest levels in september 2018 127 cm b s l the range of all sf values in dependence on the measurement depth reflects the different soil specific properties of the horizons within the profile fig 6a near surface the range of the frequencies is large there we find the driest soil conditions in september 2018 and the wettest in april 2018 the sf range decreases down to a depth of 40 cm the lower boundary of the upper horizon the very thin second horizon 10 15 cm thick has a very small sf range of 0 05 0 91 0 96 this signifies a small change in water content and small contribution to water storage change in a depth of around 55 cm where the third horizon begins the sf range increases again and then decreases down to a depth of 120 cm below 120 cm the sf values were constant during the whole period because the water table does not fall deeper and saturated conditions prevail fig 6a also shows that horizon 1 and 2 have higher sf values under saturated conditions than horizon 3 max values 0 983 in horizon 1 0 956 in horizon 2 0 896 in horizon 3 we determined θv for all sf values with the sentek factory calibration function fig 6b and the horizon specific field calibration functions fig 6c the values of θv of horizon 1 are around 0 1 cm³ cm³ higher with the horizon specific field calibration function than with the sentek factory function p 0 01 the range of the θv values of horizon 1 with the field calibration function is smaller than with the sentek factory calibration function 0 29 cm³ cm³ vs 0 37 cm³ cm³ this has an effect on the calculated water storage change between dry and wet soil moisture conditions of the upper horizon fig 7 the θv values of horizon 2 are not significantly different between sentek factory and field calibration function the water storage change based on the change of the cumulated volumetric soil water content δs150i of the sentek factory and the horizon specific field calibration was compared with the measured mass change δmi of the lysimeter fig 7 δs150i of both calibrations underestimates δmi in spring 2018 in winter 2019 the δs150i values of horizon specific field calibration function also underestimate the δmi values of the lysimeter the δmi between april and september 2018 is bigger than δs150i of this period in the following period with increasing water table in autumn winter 2018 19 δs150i increases faster than δmi the difference of δs150i between its minimal and maximal value as well as the difference of δmi for the same period are similar the differences between δmi and δs150i of sentek factory calibration are much bigger as for horizon specific field calibration in summary the change of the lysimeter mass is underestimated by both calibrations δmi is bigger than the storage change based on soil water content measurements with the diviner 2000 probe δs150i 3 3 adaption of calibration equations to the mass change in horizon 1 the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function did not improve the determination of the θv compared to the field calibration function fig 8 horizon 1 table 5 vs table 4 the curve runs nearly horizontal up to a sf of 0 7 and rises sharply after a transition range after a sf value of 0 9 this means that there are large changes in θv connected with small changes of the sf values in the area with the steep slope in the end this results in large water storage changes but it is also clear that the steep slope of the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function increases the measurement inaccuracy in this range in the case of horizon 3 the mass change adapted calibration function hardly differs from the field calibration function fig 8 horizon 3 the θv values are a little bit smaller and the slope of the function increases slightly 2 26 vs 2 15 there is a significant difference between the θv values resulting from the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function of the horizons 1 and 3 and the values of the field calibration function horizon 1 p 0 05 horizon 3 p 0 01 a better fit of δmi and δs150i led to a decrease of the quality performance between θgrav and θv table 5 vs table 4 the application of the different calibration functions to the three horizons of the lysimeter mainly resulted in differences of the θv values of horizon 1 table 6 the minimum and maximum θv values from field calibration function and its mass change adaption are each larger compared to the minimum and maximum values for the sentek factory calibration function the increase of the range between minimum and maximum θv of the adapted field calibration function improves the adaptation of δs150i to δmi however the changes of θv of horizon 3 are negligible small the adapted field calibration functions seem to improve the measurement of the water storage change with the diviner 2000 even though the annual cycle of drainage and refilling of the soil water storage based on θv measurements with the diviner 2000 probe shows a better adjustment to the measurement of the lysimeter mass fig 9 a significance cannot be demonstrated the difference between δmi and δs150i was still up to 45 kg 26 with the field calibration functions at the beginning of the measurements in april 2018 in the following year this was only 22 kg 12 in february 2019 the difference reduces to 21 kg 12 in april 2018 and 6 kg 4 in february 2019 with adapted field calibration function for horizon 1 all performance parameters are summarised in table 7 they document the improvement of water storage estimation compared to both the sentek and the field calibration 4 discussion the field calibration function of horizon 1 with a high content of organic matter and low bulk density differs from the functions of horizons 2 and 3 with higher bulk densities and predominantly mineral matter distinctly the θgrav values of the core probes of horizon 1 are higher than the values of horizon 2 and 3 they are also completely outside the range of sandy soil literature functions fig 4a the soil of horizon 1 is able to store and to drain more water than the soils of the other horizons the range of θv values lies between 0 20 and 0 60 cm³ cm³ the range of the sf values between 0 42 and 0 97 the range of the θgrav values of horizon 2 and 3 are smaller they lie between 0 28 cm³ cm³ and 0 42 cm³ cm³ resp 0 26 cm³ cm³ and 0 45 cm³ cm³ their sf values range between 0 84 and 0 96 horizon 2 resp 0 83 and 0 99 horizon 3 the high organic matter content and the low bulk density of the soil of horizon 1 are possible reasons corg 13 9 ρb 0 58 g cm³ soils with comparable corg contents are only the soils gro5 and gro6 of groves and rose 2004 but the soil texture of our soil is different and the bulk density lower table 3 fig 1 unfortunately no information on the minimum and maximum θv and sf values could be derived from the authors publication the bulk density of the soil of da silva et al 2007 has a value comparable to our soil 0 73 g cm³ vs 0 58 g cm³ but the corg content of their soil is very low 1 59 vs 13 9 their calibration function is slightly shifted to the sentek default calibration function the function was determined for θv values between 0 07 cm³ cm³ and 0 26 cm³ cm³ it is completely different to our horizon 1 function this underlines the big impact the corg content has on the calibration function no soil in the literature data of table 3 has θv values up to 0 6 cm³ cm³ this emphasizes the exception of a shallow groundwater site where higher θv values are usual especially if the soils are peats or degraded peats lapen et al 2000 price 1997 a problem of the field calibration for horizons 2 and 3 was the situation that dry conditions practically did not occur under field conditions of this study hence it was difficult to find situations with low θv values for these horizons for the calibration procedure reasons are the low thickness of horizon 2 and the high groundwater table horizon 3 was nearly always below the groundwater table with saturated soil moisture conditions or in the capillary fringe with also nearly saturated conditions hence the ranges of θgrav values of the soil core samples and corresponding sf values are relatively small subsequently the uncertainties of the determined calibration functions are large our field calibration function of horizon 2 is nearly identical with the sentek default calibration function our function of horizon 3 lies only slightly lower both functions are similar to field calibration functions of other authors with comparable soils da silva et al 2007 groves and rose 2004 provenzano et al 2016 in contrast the laboratory calibration functions of provenzano et al 2016 have a much steeper slope for the same soils therefore a laboratory calibration could also be an option to improve our calibration functions for horizons 2 and 3 in a laboratory calibration the soils could be drained stronger as under field conditions and the range between low and high θv values would be enlarged we did not summarise the horizons 2 and 3 to one horizon because of the different soil properties of the soils and their effect on the capacitive measurement the measured sf values in the lysimeter profile show this particularly fig 6a the thin horizon 2 between 40 cm and 55 cm depth has nearly no change in the sf values during the whole measurements in contrast to the sf values of the deeper laying horizon 3 the range of the sf values increases again directly below horizon 2 this is because of the changing soil characteristics it was not possible to conduct a classic gravimetric field calibration within the lysimeter this would destroy the soil monolith of the lysimeter and decrease the value of the lysimeter for investigations therefore the calibration functions of the field calibration at the reference site beside the lysimeter station had to be applied to the lysimeter monolith on the basis of the soil properties tables 1 and 2 show that there are small differences in the soil properties and the thickness of the horizons even though the reference site and the lysimeter monoliths were no more than 5 m apart dietrich et al 2016 these transmission uncertainties are unavoidable they are comparable to the relevance of spatially changing soil properties for the calibration of capacitive soil moisture sensors reported by wendroth et al 2013 or the evaluation of differences between field and laboratory calibrations of soil moisture sensors provenzano et al 2016 it corresponds to the classic procedure in the application of profile probes for θv measurements as recommended e g for irrigation management sentek 2011 the calibration must be performed on comparable reference profiles since the actual measurement profiles should not be destroyed the measured sf values under different water tables in the lysimeter illustrate the dependence of the permittivity on the soil properties and hence the different response of the capacitive sensor to the different soils fig 6 the values sfmmax in fig 6 a were measured on a date with a water table of 11 cm b s l and the maximal lysimeter mass during the measurement period at this water table the soil should be saturated in the whole profile therefore the changes of the maximal sf values in different depths indicate changes in the permittivity of the soils as response to different soil properties they show the change from horizon 1 to horizon 2 between 35 cm and 40 cm depth and the change from horizon 2 to horizon 3 between 50 and 55 cm depth the sf values of the first and second horizon were clearly higher than the values of the third horizon 0 95 vs 0 88 the sf values of horizon 3 in the lysimeter were also a little smaller than the maximal sf values of horizon 3 at the reference site 0 88 vs 0 96 different soil properties cannot be the reason because the deeper soil layer of the study site is relatively homogeneous the reason for the different sf values is presumably an effect of the deep lowering of the water table in the lysimeter for the installation of the diviner access tube in december 2017 the deep layer was not completely saturated at the time of the measurements it seems that the process of the complete refilling of the soil profile needs more time the three horizons also have a very different drainage behaviour in contrast to horizons 1 and 3 horizon 2 drains very slowly the minimum sf value sfmmin in september 2018 was 0 91 despite the groundwater table was 1 27 m b s l and 0 7 m below horizon 2 the capillary fringe could not reach horizon 2 in this time but the θv value of the horizon changed only minimal the water storage change of the lysimeter monolith took place only in the horizons 1 and 3 horizon 2 was hardly involved the application of the field calibration functions increases the θv values of horizon 1 and decreases the θv values in horizon 3 compared to the sentek default calibration function the minimum θv values of horizon 1 with the field calibration functions are bigger than the θgrav values measured at the reference site despite of deeper groundwater tables in the lysimeter it indicates an overestimation of θv with the diviner measurement on the other site the range of θv values in horizon 1 decreases with the field calibration by around 0 1 cm³ cm³ the deviations between δm and δs increase consequently the calculated δs based on diviner measurements underestimates the real storage change in the soil profile the adaptation of the calibration function to the measured mass change of the lysimeter reduces the error of storage change estimation with the diviner the maximal error of the calculated storage change between highest and lowest groundwater table halves from 26 to 12 the annual cycle of the measured storage change in fig 9 is improved all performance parameters underline this finding table 7 a bigger difference between measured and calculated storage change occurs mainly in the first months up to june 2018 this can also be a late effect of the deep drainage for the installation of the access tube however the calibration function adapted to the mass change has a lower quality performance than the field calibration and the sentek default calibration concerning the θgrav values tables 4 and 5 their curve with the different slope in the lower and upper part is not optimal fig 8 evett et al 2012 described a number of other possible reasons of measurement inaccuracies inherent in the capacitive measurement principle in detail 5 conclusions the investigations concerned a number of problem areas that affect the calibration of capacitive soil moisture sensors application of capacitive sensors in soils with high corg contents field calibration on shallow groundwater sites with small changes of θv values field calibration of soil profiles with thin layers soil heterogeneity and transfer of calibration functions estimation of storage change based on θv measurements and their verification the verification of a calculated storage change based on measured θv values in a weighable lysimeter can serve as validation however the θv measurement summarizes all before listed insecurities and an exact differentiation between the single error sources was not possible with the used experimental setup further investigations should be performed a suitable laboratory calibration can lead to

10070,the determination of the volumetric soil water content θv by means of capacitive profile probes is often applied to investigate the soil water storage change δs that serves as basis for decisions in agricultural water management the soil properties have a big effect on the accuracy of the θv measurements the use of only one calibration function often provided by the manufacturers of the probes cannot fulfil the requirements of all site conditions therefore many individual calibration functions have in the past been determined for different soils and sensors a literature review of existing calibration functions of the capacitive profile probe diviner 2000 shows the broad range of available functions the review makes it clear that there is a lack of functions for organic soils these soils are typical soils of wet sites with shallow groundwater tables the soil moisture is of big importance for many ecological processes of these sites and therefore an exact determination of θv is important a diviner 2000 profile probe was calibrated on such a shallow groundwater site in a classic field calibration procedure and the determined functions were applied to the soil profile of a weighable groundwater lysimeter the soil water storage change δs was estimated with the measured θv values and compared with the measured mass change δm of the lysimeter the mean error bias between δs with the field calibration function and δm was 7 8 kg and the root mean squared error rmse 19 9 kg an iterative adaptation of the calibration functions to the measured δm values of the lysimeter reduced the bias to 0 9 kg and the rmse to 14 0 kg the investigations illustrate the problems of a classic field calibration under the conditions of a shallow groundwater site with low θv changes in deeper soil horizons and soils with high corg contents as well as the inaccuracy in the determination of δs based on θv measurements with capacitive profile probes keywords shallow groundwater site organic soils volumetric soil water content capacitance probe diviner 2000 field calibration lysimeter water storage change 1 introduction a particular characteristic of many lowland regions are sites with shallow groundwater tables and organic soils in densely populated regions like central and western europe most of these sites have been agriculturally used for hundreds of years mostly as grassland but they still have high groundwater tables a few centimetres below the surface many of the shallow groundwater sites are peatlands and received progressively more attention as source or sink for greenhouse gas emissions during the last years the moisture conditions in the soil profile of these sites influences most processes in the water and matter cycle such as water consumption or storage as well as nutrient and gas emissions or storage after all the growth of the plants but also the composition of the species depends on these moisture conditions therefore a good knowledge of volumetric soil water content θv in a soil profile with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution is important for the understanding of many hydrological meteorological and ecological processes the change of θv reflects change of the water storage change δs in the soil profile and is the basis of a sustainable agricultural and water resources management there are many different possibilities to determine θv of study sites advantages and disadvantages of different methods of electromagnetic soil moisture sensors were evaluated in a series of papers blonquist et al 2005 da silva et al 2018 dobriyal et al 2012 evett et al 2012 jones et al 2005 lekshmi et al 2014 2018 robinson et al 2003 a comparison with gravimetrically determined volumetric soil water contents θgrav often serves as basis for calibration and verification of the measurement quality of the sensors however gravimetric measurements are labour intensive and they are connected with a destruction of the soil profile at the measurement point therefore neutron moisture meters are sometimes an alternative for the calibration of the electromagnetic sensors their main advantages are the relatively large sample volume and the suitability for profiling high costs radioactive risk hazards and regulations are a large disadvantage of the method lekshmi et al 2014 paltineanu and starr 1997 despite the lower measurement accuracy and the necessity of a calibration electromagnetic sensors are seen as a good compromise to get measurement serieses of θv with high temporal and spatial resolution within soil profiles for the investigations of soil water balance and as a basis for soil water management δs plays a particular role the measurement of θv in several depths of the soil profile offers a good possibility of the estimation of δs evett et al 2012 but also requires the installation of soil moisture probes at several depths the necessary horizontal installation of many probe types is labour intensive and connected with a relatively large destruction of the soil profile a good alternative are profile probes which can measure θv at several depths with relatively small destruction of the soil profile and comparatively simple installation profile probes can be portable probes e g diviner 2000 sentek sensor technologies stepney south australia or permanent multisensory probes e g enviroscan sentek sensor technologies or they combine both applications e g pr2 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk all three mentioned probes use capacitive sensors for the measurement of the permittivity of the soil evett et al 2006 θv can then be determined by using a soil specific calibration many publications document the necessity of a soil specific calibration gabriel et al 2010 jabro et al 2005 jones et al 2005 morgan et al 2001 paltineanu and starr 1997 the calibration functions of the same probe show large differences between the functions in dependence on the soil properties which do not allow the application of one function for a broad spectrum of soils paraskevas et al 2012 collected the parameters of 28 calibration functions of the probes enviroscan and diviner 2000 and showed the variety of soil properties calibration procedures field laboratory and resulting functions despite the many calibration functions in the literature for many site conditions suitable functions are still not available often the soils in the literature are agriculturally used rather dry soils just like wetter soils soils with high organic content are also underrepresented hence it is not surprising that suitable functions for soils of shallow groundwater sites are not available these soils often have a high organic content and they are almost saturated exclusively nachabe et al 2004 used an enviroscan profile probe for θv and δs determination under shallow groundwater conditions with fine sand they assumed that the default factory calibration is sufficient for their purposes and did no own calibration the results of the literature show that the application of capacitive profile probes without a soil specific calibration has a big uncertainty concerning the absolute θv values the producer of the probes argues that a calibration is not necessary if only the relative change of θv respectively δs is of interest sentek 2009 however mazahrih et al 2008 and evett et al 2009 found large differences between δs estimated with a neutron moisture meter and electromagnetic sensors including a diviner 2000 probe it is not sufficiently verified how far the soil properties can differ from the properties of the soil of the default factory calibration and an individual calibration is recommended calibration procedures are labour intensive and have to be done at sites with presumably the same soil properties as at the eventual study site because the procedure destroys the original soil profile a real evaluation of the performance of the calibration function and the accuracy of the θv and δs determination at the soil profile is not easily possible an option for the verification of a calibration function could be a weighable lysimeter but lysimeter monoliths often contain more than one soil layer hence the water storage change measured with the weighing system is a summarised value of θv in more than one layer with more than one calibration function a classic calibration procedure with extraction of soil cores for a gravimetric θv determination would destroy the lysimeter soil monolith thus a two step calibration with a classic calibration for single soil classes and the application of the determined calibration functions for the different soil layers in the lysimeter is necessary in any case the uncertainties in the transfer of the function from the calibration site to the lysimeter are unavoidable they must be minimised as far as possible the objective of this paper is the calibration of a diviner 2000 soil moisture probe on a shallow groundwater site with different soil layers the application of the calibration functions in a weighable groundwater lysimeter and their verification with the measured δs of the lysimeter the first step was a classic field calibration with θgrav measurements beside the lysimeter station then the functions were applied in the lysimeter based on the soil properties and verified in the last step the calibration functions were modified to reach a better adaptation of the δs values derived from θv to the δs values derived from δm of the lysimeter 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site and lysimeter station the study site is located in the spreewald wetland 51 52 n 14 02 e around 85 km south east of berlin germany the unesco biosphere reserve spreewald is one of the most famous german wetlands with a widely ramified water system which is intensively used for tourism a detailed description of the wetland and the water resource management systems therein is given by dietrich et al 2007 the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research has been operating a lysimeter station at a typical agricultural used grassland area with shallow groundwater conditions in the middle of the wetland since 2009 dietrich et al 2016 the groundwater lysimeter station contains four weighable soil monoliths each monolith has an area of 1 m2 and height of 2 m all monoliths were cut at the place where the station is located now they have the same soil profiles agreeing with the conditions beside the station the typical grassland vegetation was the same at all monoliths in 2009 each monolith is equipped with numerous measurement systems for water balance components which are described in detail in dietrich et al 2016 the time interval of the measurements is 10 min all monoliths have groundwater tables near the surface they are managed in different ways in dependence on the objectives of the investigations of the lysimeter station dietrich and kaiser 2017 the water tables of the site range between surface level in winter and spring around 60 cm below surface level b s l in normal summer months and down to 80 cm b s l in dry summers at the reference site four diviner access tubes were installed for a classic field calibration section 2 4 the soil profiles at these places contain three horizons the classification of the samples to the horizons was based on the dry bulk density the soil properties at the reference site beside the lysimeter station and in the lysimeter monolith are summarised in tables 1 and 2 2 2 diviner 2000 the diviner 2000 probe is a capacitance type soil water sensing system sentek environmental technologies stepney south australia a single sensor is fitted to a square rod that can be inserted into the soil in a polyvinyl chloride pvc access tube the sensor can be lowered down to a depth of 1 6 m the sensor measures a soil volume of 10 cm vertical height in 5 10 cm radial distance from the outer wall of the access tube sentek 2009 the output of the sensor are raw frequency readings affected by the air water soil mix of the soil volume outside the access tube this raw frequency values in soil fs will be normalised with the raw frequency values in air fa and water fw result is a scaled frequency sf 1 sf f a f s f a f w the calibration function 2 establishes the relationship between the scaled frequency sf and the volumetric water content θv of the soil surrounding the measuring tube at the respective measuring depth 2 θ v a sf b c where θv is the volumetric soil water content in cm³ cm³ and a b c are the calibration coefficients the probe can work in two different modes a scan mode where it automatically takes a measurement every 10 cm and the sf value is stored on the display unit or a continuous mode where readings are done at all depths in the continuous mode the values are not stored on the display unit the raw frequency value has to be written down manually and the sf has to be calculated later the advantage of this mode is a finer resolution of the measurement depth 2 3 existing diviner 2000 calibration functions as a result of a literature review existing calibration functions of the diviner 2000 soil moisture probe were analysed concerning information about soil properties and calibration functions like soil classes soil texture bulk density organic content function parameters a b and c of the function type of eq 2 performance of the functions r2 rmse range of input data and or validity θvmin θvmax sfmin sfmax we found 42 calibration functions for a diviner 2000 probe in ten publications with 35 different soil textures table 3 one publication did not have information about the relative proportions of sand silt and clay it contains only the names of soil textures haberland et al 2014 provenzano et al 2016 performed two different calibrations field and laboratory for all their soils the shares of field and laboratory calibrations are approximately equally distributed in the data set 22 vs 18 only three calibrations were performed on lysimeters the organic content of most soils was below 2 there are only two soils among the functions of groves and rose 2004 with an organic content above 10 the original publications contain both types of the calibration functions the type of eq 2 and the type of eq 3 3 sf a θ v b c in table 3 all coefficients of the type of eq 3 are transformed to the type of eq 2 while the a value of 40 functions is between 0 25 and 0 75 the b values are much more widely scattered the b value range is from 1 to 10 c values 0 are only used in the functions of evett et al 2006 a connection between soil types and the values of the coefficients was not recognisable the b value is of particular importance large b values mean a large increase of the θv values in the range of large sf values and thus large changes in the measured θv of the corresponding soil this has an effect on δs as well as on the measuring accuracy of the probe different b values mean that the same change in the measured frequency leads to different changes in the measured θv fig 1 illustrates the broad spectrum of soils in literature including the textures of soils on our site clay soils contain the most functions in literature 20 followed by sandy soils 11 and silty soils 7 we summarised all functions of a soil class that contained the information about their validity range fig 2 illustrates the variety of functions within each soil class the range of the sandy soil function is relatively slim and stretches along a large range of the sf from 0 4 to 1 0 the average of all sandy soil functions lies near the sentek function the clay soil functions have the broadest range maybe because they are the most functions only the clay soil functions of geesing et al 2004 have sf values 0 5 the average value of the clay soil functions is smaller as the sentek function for sf values 0 75 not significant the silty soil functions are the fewest 7 most of them cover only a range of sf values 0 8 fig 2 right the average value of the silty soil functions differs significantly from the sentek function p 0 01 it seems that the calibration procedures also have an impact the mean b value of laboratory calibration functions is significantly higher p 0 01 than the mean b value of field calibration functions 4 3 vs 2 9 the results of provenzano et al 2016 who carried out laboratory and field calibrations for the same soils 6 5 vs 1 8 show this especially clearly the comparison is not an evaluation of the two calibration methods but shows the sensitivity of a calibration procedure with respect to the prevailing boundary conditions fig 2 also shows that the validity range of most functions is for relatively low θv values up to 0 3 cm³ cm³ only a few calibration functions cover the range up to 0 5 cm³ cm³ and no function represents wetter soil moisture conditions which are typical conditions on shallow groundwater sites and soils with higher organic content 2 4 diviner field calibration at reference site the reference site is located directly beside the lysimeter station four pvc access tubes were installed for the calibration of the diviner 2000 probe in august 2018 a date with an especially deep groundwater table of 80 cm b s l the installation followed the instructions of the sentek calibration manual sentek 2011 the installation of the access tubes on shallow groundwater sites is much more difficult compared to sites with deep groundwater tables drilling within the tube in the saturated zone is not possible therefore the tubes could only be installed within the unsaturated zone the same problem exists when taking soil samples with a core cutter from the different horizons for gravimetric water content determination an open pit can also only be excavated in the unsaturated soil as soon as the saturated zone is reached the pit is filled with water therefore the maximum depth of the soil profile of the four gravimetric calibrations differed in dependence on the actual water table on the reference site at the day of taking the soil samples fig 3 another problem was that the deepest soil horizon never had dry conditions even though the water table was lower almost saturated conditions prevailed due to the capillary rise the time schedule for taking soil samples was determined by water tables and weather conditions thus the dates were chosen both under the driest possible conditions with a deep groundwater table 7th september 2018 and under wet conditions with a high groundwater table on the day after heavy precipitation 12th june 2019 two further samplings were carried out under medium conditions 6th august 2018 and 1st november 2018 at each of the four pvc access tubes the same procedure was conducted the procedure started with the measuring of the raw frequency of the diviner 2000 probe in 5 cm steps from the surface to the maximal depth of the tube and then back to the surface the mean value of each 5 cm step was used for the calculation of sf following eq 1 after measuring the raw frequency with diviner three undisturbed soil samples were extracted with a core cutter height 63 mm diameter 72 mm around the access tube starting at surface level and step by step downwards samples from four to nine depths were excavated depending on the water table the soil samples were weighed after the excavation they were then dried for 24 h at 105 c in an oven and weighed again the mass change divided by the volume of the soil core yields the gravimetrically determined volumetric soil water content θgrav at the end the three θgrav values of each depth and access tube were combined into an average θgrav value and assigned to the corresponding sf value in the next step all pairs of θgrav and sf values were sorted in three soil horizons depending on their excavation depth and bulk density all pairs of a horizon form the basis of respectively one horizon specific calibration function according to eq 2 2 5 diviner measurements in the lysimeter we used one of the four monoliths of the lysimeter station for the validation of a diviner 2000 probe for this purpose a pvc access tube was installed in the soil monolith in december 2017 during the installation the water table in the lysimeter monolith was lowered down to the bottom of the container the minimal distance between the tube and the sidewall of the lysimeter is 30 cm so that the measurement volume of the capacitance probe is completely inside the monolith measurements with the diviner 2000 probe were conducted in the lysimeter between march 2018 and july 2019 fig 3 the sf values were measured for 15 layers of 10 cm thickness in the scan mode during the measurement period the water table in the lysimeter followed the typical annual cycle with high levels in winter and deep levels in summer in summer 2018 the groundwater table in the lysimeter was deliberately lowered beneath the levels of the natural groundwater table of the surrounding area fig 3 to have a thicker unsaturated zone with more changes in θv for each date of the diviner measurements the mass of the lysimeter mi was selected from the lysimeter data set the mass change δmi was calculated as the difference to the lowest mass of the whole time series mmin on 7th september 2018 4 m i m i m min the date of the lowest mass was also the date with the deepest water table in the lysimeter during the measurements 2 6 lysimeter soil water content determination with diviner 2000 the determination of θv of the lysimeter soil profile was performed based on the sf of the diviner measurements in the lysimeter monolith and the calibration function of each layer than the θv values were cumulated over all layers up to a depth of 150 cm for each date the result is the water storage of the soil profile down to 150 cm depth s150i for each date the difference between s150i and s150 min the storage value of the 7th september 2018 results in the storage change δs150i 5 s 150 i s 150 i s 150 min the comparison of the time series of δmi and δs150i provides an information about the quality of the calibration functions with regard to the determination of the storage change in a soil profile using a diviner probe the comparison of the time series of δmi and δs150i was done for three different calibration approaches a the sentek factory calibration function was applied to all three horizons for the determination of θv b the three horizon specific field calibration functions from the own field calibration see 2 4 were applied to the horizons c a modified version of the field calibration functions of horizon one and three both functions were modified to reach a better fit between the mass change of the lysimeter δmi and the water storage change δs150i based on the θv values horizon 2 was excluded from this because of it being relatively thin and the relatively stable sf values so it was assumed to have no effect on δs therefore only the calibration functions of the first and third soil horizon were adapted to the time series of δmi by a nonlinear optimisation procedure using the excel addin solver frontline solvers www solver com the target was to minimise the square sum error sse of δs and δm 6 sse i 1 n m i s 150 i 2 the solver addin found an optimal solution in an iterative process in the first step the respective field calibration functions were applied to the horizons 2 and 3 and the calibration function of horizon 1 was adapted with solver so that the sse of δs and δm was minimised we started with the adaption of horizon 1 because it has the biggest effect on the δs and the other two horizons were saturated during most of the time in a second step the adapted calibration function of horizon 1 was applied to horizon 1 the field calibration function was applied to horizon 2 and the calibration function of horizon 3 was adapted to the mass change by the solver procedure 2 7 efficiency criteria different efficiency criteria are used for the assessment of the calibration functions following the recommendations of bennett et al 2013 and krause et al 2005 the root mean square error rmse describes the mean error it has the same units as the original data 7 r s m e 1 n i 1 n θ g r a v i θ v i 2 coefficient of determination r2 indicates how the variation of the gravimetrically measured θgrav values is explained by

ioa compares the sum of squared error between θgrav values and θv values to the sum of squared absolute values of the differences between the θv values and the mean θgrav value and between the observed θgrav values and the mean observed θgrav value this method is designed to be better at handling differences between modelled and observed means and variances bennett et al 2013 9 ioa 1 i 1 n θ gravi θ vi 2 i 1 n θ vi θ grav θ gravi θ grav 2 3 results 3 1 field calibration the average θgrav and corresponding sf values of the three horizons differed strongly fig 4a especially the θgrav values of horizon 1 differ from the values of horizon 2 and 3 the measured θgrav values of horizon 1 range between 0 2 and 0 6 cm³ cm³ with corresponding sf values between 0 42 and 0 97 the values are completely outside the range of all values we found in the calibration functions of the literature the differences between the θgrav and sf values of horizons 2 and 3 are relatively small the measured θgrav values range between 0 26 and 0 45 cm³ cm³ with corresponding sf values between 0 83 and 0 99 the measured θgrav and sf values cover a relatively small range because of the high groundwater table and relatively stable water content conditions there is a lack of very dry conditions in particular all values are within the range of known calibration functions from literature the first derivation of calibration functions represents the slope of the functions the slope of the calibration function has a big effect on the calculated δs values of a soil profile fig 4 b shows the slope of the calibration functions we found in literature for sandy soils the range of δθv for sf values smaller 0 8 is relatively small this means that the sensitivity of a function is relatively small concerning changing sf values on the other hand the sensitivity is high at high sf values which occur particularly in moist soils this means that the measurement error can be very large if no soil specific calibration is available since the scatter of the function slopes is large it underlines once again the necessity of soil specific calibration therefore we decided not to combine the horizons 2 and 3 the soil specific calibration functions with parameter and quality performance are presented in fig 5 and table 4 the performance parameters in table 4 underline the improvement of the calibration functions compared to the default sentek calibration especially the rmse of horizon 1 decreases from 0 142 cm³ cm³ to 0 041 cm³ cm³ the θv values of the horizons 1 and 3 calculated with the default calibration function sentek and the horizon specific classical gravimetric field calibration function field calibration are significantly different p 0 01 the corresponding θv values of horizon 2 are not significantly different 3 2 lysimeter water content and water storage change between 26th march 2018 and 27th july 2019 26 diviner measurements were conducted in the lysimeter soil profile fig 3 during this time the water table in the lysimeter followed an annual cycle with the highest levels in april 2018 4 cm b s l and the deepest levels in september 2018 127 cm b s l the range of all sf values in dependence on the measurement depth reflects the different soil specific properties of the horizons within the profile fig 6a near surface the range of the frequencies is large there we find the driest soil conditions in september 2018 and the wettest in april 2018 the sf range decreases down to a depth of 40 cm the lower boundary of the upper horizon the very thin second horizon 10 15 cm thick has a very small sf range of 0 05 0 91 0 96 this signifies a small change in water content and small contribution to water storage change in a depth of around 55 cm where the third horizon begins the sf range increases again and then decreases down to a depth of 120 cm below 120 cm the sf values were constant during the whole period because the water table does not fall deeper and saturated conditions prevail fig 6a also shows that horizon 1 and 2 have higher sf values under saturated conditions than horizon 3 max values 0 983 in horizon 1 0 956 in horizon 2 0 896 in horizon 3 we determined θv for all sf values with the sentek factory calibration function fig 6b and the horizon specific field calibration functions fig 6c the values of θv of horizon 1 are around 0 1 cm³ cm³ higher with the horizon specific field calibration function than with the sentek factory function p 0 01 the range of the θv values of horizon 1 with the field calibration function is smaller than with the sentek factory calibration function 0 29 cm³ cm³ vs 0 37 cm³ cm³ this has an effect on the calculated water storage change between dry and wet soil moisture conditions of the upper horizon fig 7 the θv values of horizon 2 are not significantly different between sentek factory and field calibration function the water storage change based on the change of the cumulated volumetric soil water content δs150i of the sentek factory and the horizon specific field calibration was compared with the measured mass change δmi of the lysimeter fig 7 δs150i of both calibrations underestimates δmi in spring 2018 in winter 2019 the δs150i values of horizon specific field calibration function also underestimate the δmi values of the lysimeter the δmi between april and september 2018 is bigger than δs150i of this period in the following period with increasing water table in autumn winter 2018 19 δs150i increases faster than δmi the difference of δs150i between its minimal and maximal value as well as the difference of δmi for the same period are similar the differences between δmi and δs150i of sentek factory calibration are much bigger as for horizon specific field calibration in summary the change of the lysimeter mass is underestimated by both calibrations δmi is bigger than the storage change based on soil water content measurements with the diviner 2000 probe δs150i 3 3 adaption of calibration equations to the mass change in horizon 1 the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function did not improve the determination of the θv compared to the field calibration function fig 8 horizon 1 table 5 vs table 4 the curve runs nearly horizontal up to a sf of 0 7 and rises sharply after a transition range after a sf value of 0 9 this means that there are large changes in θv connected with small changes of the sf values in the area with the steep slope in the end this results in large water storage changes but it is also clear that the steep slope of the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function increases the measurement inaccuracy in this range in the case of horizon 3 the mass change adapted calibration function hardly differs from the field calibration function fig 8 horizon 3 the θv values are a little bit smaller and the slope of the function increases slightly 2 26 vs 2 15 there is a significant difference between the θv values resulting from the mass change adaptation of the field calibration function of the horizons 1 and 3 and the values of the field calibration function horizon 1 p 0 05 horizon 3 p 0 01 a better fit of δmi and δs150i led to a decrease of the quality performance between θgrav and θv table 5 vs table 4 the application of the different calibration functions to the three horizons of the lysimeter mainly resulted in differences of the θv values of horizon 1 table 6 the minimum and maximum θv values from field calibration function and its mass change adaption are each larger compared to the minimum and maximum values for the sentek factory calibration function the increase of the range between minimum and maximum θv of the adapted field calibration function improves the adaptation of δs150i to δmi however the changes of θv of horizon 3 are negligible small the adapted field calibration functions seem to improve the measurement of the water storage change with the diviner 2000 even though the annual cycle of drainage and refilling of the soil water storage based on θv measurements with the diviner 2000 probe shows a better adjustment to the measurement of the lysimeter mass fig 9 a significance cannot be demonstrated the difference between δmi and δs150i was still up to 45 kg 26 with the field calibration functions at the beginning of the measurements in april 2018 in the following year this was only 22 kg 12 in february 2019 the difference reduces to 21 kg 12 in april 2018 and 6 kg 4 in february 2019 with adapted field calibration function for horizon 1 all performance parameters are summarised in table 7 they document the improvement of water storage estimation compared to both the sentek and the field calibration 4 discussion the field calibration function of horizon 1 with a high content of organic matter and low bulk density differs from the functions of horizons 2 and 3 with higher bulk densities and predominantly mineral matter distinctly the θgrav values of the core probes of horizon 1 are higher than the values of horizon 2 and 3 they are also completely outside the range of sandy soil literature functions fig 4a the soil of horizon 1 is able to store and to drain more water than the soils of the other horizons the range of θv values lies between 0 20 and 0 60 cm³ cm³ the range of the sf values between 0 42 and 0 97 the range of the θgrav values of horizon 2 and 3 are smaller they lie between 0 28 cm³ cm³ and 0 42 cm³ cm³ resp 0 26 cm³ cm³ and 0 45 cm³ cm³ their sf values range between 0 84 and 0 96 horizon 2 resp 0 83 and 0 99 horizon 3 the high organic matter content and the low bulk density of the soil of horizon 1 are possible reasons corg 13 9 ρb 0 58 g cm³ soils with comparable corg contents are only the soils gro5 and gro6 of groves and rose 2004 but the soil texture of our soil is different and the bulk density lower table 3 fig 1 unfortunately no information on the minimum and maximum θv and sf values could be derived from the authors publication the bulk density of the soil of da silva et al 2007 has a value comparable to our soil 0 73 g cm³ vs 0 58 g cm³ but the corg content of their soil is very low 1 59 vs 13 9 their calibration function is slightly shifted to the sentek default calibration function the function was determined for θv values between 0 07 cm³ cm³ and 0 26 cm³ cm³ it is completely different to our horizon 1 function this underlines the big impact the corg content has on the calibration function no soil in the literature data of table 3 has θv values up to 0 6 cm³ cm³ this emphasizes the exception of a shallow groundwater site where higher θv values are usual especially if the soils are peats or degraded peats lapen et al 2000 price 1997 a problem of the field calibration for horizons 2 and 3 was the situation that dry conditions practically did not occur under field conditions of this study hence it was difficult to find situations with low θv values for these horizons for the calibration procedure reasons are the low thickness of horizon 2 and the high groundwater table horizon 3 was nearly always below the groundwater table with saturated soil moisture conditions or in the capillary fringe with also nearly saturated conditions hence the ranges of θgrav values of the soil core samples and corresponding sf values are relatively small subsequently the uncertainties of the determined calibration functions are large our field calibration function of horizon 2 is nearly identical with the sentek default calibration function our function of horizon 3 lies only slightly lower both functions are similar to field calibration functions of other authors with comparable soils da silva et al 2007 groves and rose 2004 provenzano et al 2016 in contrast the laboratory calibration functions of provenzano et al 2016 have a much steeper slope for the same soils therefore a laboratory calibration could also be an option to improve our calibration functions for horizons 2 and 3 in a laboratory calibration the soils could be drained stronger as under field conditions and the range between low and high θv values would be enlarged we did not summarise the horizons 2 and 3 to one horizon because of the different soil properties of the soils and their effect on the capacitive measurement the measured sf values in the lysimeter profile show this particularly fig 6a the thin horizon 2 between 40 cm and 55 cm depth has nearly no change in the sf values during the whole measurements in contrast to the sf values of the deeper laying horizon 3 the range of the sf values increases again directly below horizon 2 this is because of the changing soil characteristics it was not possible to conduct a classic gravimetric field calibration within the lysimeter this would destroy the soil monolith of the lysimeter and decrease the value of the lysimeter for investigations therefore the calibration functions of the field calibration at the reference site beside the lysimeter station had to be applied to the lysimeter monolith on the basis of the soil properties tables 1 and 2 show that there are small differences in the soil properties and the thickness of the horizons even though the reference site and the lysimeter monoliths were no more than 5 m apart dietrich et al 2016 these transmission uncertainties are unavoidable they are comparable to the relevance of spatially changing soil properties for the calibration of capacitive soil moisture sensors reported by wendroth et al 2013 or the evaluation of differences between field and laboratory calibrations of soil moisture sensors provenzano et al 2016 it corresponds to the classic procedure in the application of profile probes for θv measurements as recommended e g for irrigation management sentek 2011 the calibration must be performed on comparable reference profiles since the actual measurement profiles should not be destroyed the measured sf values under different water tables in the lysimeter illustrate the dependence of the permittivity on the soil properties and hence the different response of the capacitive sensor to the different soils fig 6 the values sfmmax in fig 6 a were measured on a date with a water table of 11 cm b s l and the maximal lysimeter mass during the measurement period at this water table the soil should be saturated in the whole profile therefore the changes of the maximal sf values in different depths indicate changes in the permittivity of the soils as response to different soil properties they show the change from horizon 1 to horizon 2 between 35 cm and 40 cm depth and the change from horizon 2 to horizon 3 between 50 and 55 cm depth the sf values of the first and second horizon were clearly higher than the values of the third horizon 0 95 vs 0 88 the sf values of horizon 3 in the lysimeter were also a little smaller than the maximal sf values of horizon 3 at the reference site 0 88 vs 0 96 different soil properties cannot be the reason because the deeper soil layer of the study site is relatively homogeneous the reason for the different sf values is presumably an effect of the deep lowering of the water table in the lysimeter for the installation of the diviner access tube in december 2017 the deep layer was not completely saturated at the time of the measurements it seems that the process of the complete refilling of the soil profile needs more time the three horizons also have a very different drainage behaviour in contrast to horizons 1 and 3 horizon 2 drains very slowly the minimum sf value sfmmin in september 2018 was 0 91 despite the groundwater table was 1 27 m b s l and 0 7 m below horizon 2 the capillary fringe could not reach horizon 2 in this time but the θv value of the horizon changed only minimal the water storage change of the lysimeter monolith took place only in the horizons 1 and 3 horizon 2 was hardly involved the application of the field calibration functions increases the θv values of horizon 1 and decreases the θv values in horizon 3 compared to the sentek default calibration function the minimum θv values of horizon 1 with the field calibration functions are bigger than the θgrav values measured at the reference site despite of deeper groundwater tables in the lysimeter it indicates an overestimation of θv with the diviner measurement on the other site the range of θv values in horizon 1 decreases with the field calibration by around 0 1 cm³ cm³ the deviations between δm and δs increase consequently the calculated δs based on diviner measurements underestimates the real storage change in the soil profile the adaptation of the calibration function to the measured mass change of the lysimeter reduces the error of storage change estimation with the diviner the maximal error of the calculated storage change between highest and lowest groundwater table halves from 26 to 12 the annual cycle of the measured storage change in fig 9 is improved all performance parameters underline this finding table 7 a bigger difference between measured and calculated storage change occurs mainly in the first months up to june 2018 this can also be a late effect of the deep drainage for the installation of the access tube however the calibration function adapted to the mass change has a lower quality performance than the field calibration and the sentek default calibration concerning the θgrav values tables 4 and 5 their curve with the different slope in the lower and upper part is not optimal fig 8 evett et al 2012 described a number of other possible reasons of measurement inaccuracies inherent in the capacitive measurement principle in detail 5 conclusions the investigations concerned a number of problem areas that affect the calibration of capacitive soil moisture sensors application of capacitive sensors in soils with high corg contents field calibration on shallow groundwater sites with small changes of θv values field calibration of soil profiles with thin layers soil heterogeneity and transfer of calibration functions estimation of storage change based on θv measurements and their verification the verification of a calculated storage change based on measured θv values in a weighable lysimeter can serve as validation however the θv measurement summarizes all before listed insecurities and an exact differentiation between the single error sources was not possible with the used experimental setup further investigations should be performed a suitable laboratory calibration can lead to

intensification 1 introduction bioenergy is the largest renewable energy source globally constitutes 70 of all renewable energy sources and contributes 14 to global primary energy supply iea 2017 however water consumption and water quality continue to be key factors affecting environmental sustainability in bioenergy production zhong et al 2018 the increasing demand of energy crops will lead to increased pressure on water resources due to inefficient water consumption and pollution issues mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 water requirements for bioenergy production vary according to feedstock used geographic location and climatic variables therefore these factors must be considered to determine water consumptive use and to identify critical scenarios and mitigation strategies dominguez faus et al 2009 different raw materials have been evaluated to produce bioenergy morales et al 2015 however it is necessary to consider long term environmental benefits and impacts associated with each halvorsen et al 2009 in uruguay there are several agricultural long term experiments lte investigating technology development and environmental performance of different agronomic cropping systems siri prieto 2013 recently energy policy in uruguay has focused on the decarbonization of energy sources in response to this goal a liquid fuel market and electric power generation from biofuel and biomass has been developed ludeña and ryfisch 2015 within this framework uruguay decreased oil consumption by 25 from 2006 to 2016 increased renewable energy by 62 and became an exporter rather than importer of electrical energy uruguay xxi 2017 thus agroindustry residues i e forest and agricultural currently represent two thirds of current bioenergy production in 2017 energy from biomass accounted for 43 of total produced energy compared to only 20 for the 1990 2007 period uruguay xxi 2017 the potential production area for bioethanol crops in uruguay is limited by availability of bioethanol plants in the country there are two agro industrial complexes in paysandú and bella union with a production capacity of 100 million liters per year these facilities use 200 thousand tons of grain sorghum maize and wheat and 450 thousand tons of sugar cane and sweet sorghum as raw material which is equivalent to 50 thousand hectares of crops uruguay s government owned oil company i e ancap has invested in domestic ethanol production from annual crops but little prior research has investigated environmental impacts of this biofuel program among potential environmental issues related to biofuel production water consumption and water pollution are critically important ji and long 2016 to address these issues evaluating the water footprint wf allows assessment of water volume consumed or polluted when producing a product this includes direct and indirect water use virtual water along product supply chains hoekstra et al 2011 total water footprint wf t is the sum of three types of water blue wf blue green wf green and gray wf gray where wf blue is the consumptive use of freshwater from water bodies wf green refers exclusively to consumed or evapotranspired rainwater in crop production and wf gray is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutant loads based on existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 global estimates of wf t associated with different bioenergy feedstocks varied widely depending on feedstock and location gerbens leenes et al 2009b mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mathioudakis et al 2017 for example gerbens leenes et al 2009a quantified the wf t of biomass based energy and compared to fossil energy study results indicated that biomass production increased wf t due to large crop water consumption most studies have focused on water consumption without any quantification of water pollution in fact the reduction of wf gray is important in reducing the environmental impact during the production process chukalla et al 2015 however estimates of wf gray associated with biofuel feedstock production have been relatively limited in wf analyses wu et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 and generally have not consider regional variability of contaminant leaching and loading rates zhong et al 2018 globally the prevailing threat to freshwater quality is eutrophication khan and mohammad 2014 caused by excess phosphorous p and nitrogen n in freshwater bodies however most studies only considered n pollution in wf gray estimates chukalla et al 2015 however p from fertilizers can be a contributor due to losses by leaching and transport by soil erosion to nearby water bodies scherer and pfister 2015 the development of bioethanol cropping systems is still limited in uruguay and there are several scientific gaps concerning environmental sustainability related to water quality and usage to address these issues we evaluated two hypotheses 1 agricultural intensification i e consumption of inputs crops per year and or residue removal will increase the wf t of the system i e cropping system and 2 this intensification will reduce the wf t of the product i e bioethanol produced to evaluate the consequence of these hypotheses we estimated the wf t of four bioethanol cropping systems and their bioethanol production the studied bioethanol cropping systems which belong to an eight year agricultural lte had different degrees of intensification and were representative of the main agricultural region in uruguay 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design agronomic information used for wf t estimates utilized the database of the eight year lte of bioethanol cropping systems maintained at the mario cassinoni agricultural experimental station eemac paysandú department uruguay 32 22 s 58 03 w these bioethanol cropping systems are representative of production conditions for western arable soils of the country fig 1 according to the köeppen classification kottek et al 2006 this region has a temperate humid climate without a dry season daily average temperatures of 24 c summer and 12 c winter and average annual precipitation of 1598 mm monthly climate information was used to determine the 13 year average 2002 2015 the lte is on a brunosol éutrico typico uruguay soil taxonomy durán and garcía préchac 2007 or argiudol usda soil

2008 the research site had been under a wheat soybean maize rotation from 2003 to 2007 treatments within the lte were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications table 1 the bioethanol cropping systems were 1 maize zea mays wheat triticum aestivum grain sorghum sorghum bicolor rotation without crop residue removal mws 2 maize wheat grain sorghum rotation with crop residue removal mws r 3 continuous sweet sorghum with winter cover ss and 4 switchgrass panicum virgatum sw treatments 1 and 2 had three crops in two years consequently these two cropping systems include additional plots so all crops for each crop rotation are present every year the continuous sweet sorghum treatment includes oat avena sativa as a cover crop to reduce soil erosion the fourth treatment was switchgrass a perennial lignocellulosic crop planted in 2008 and harvest every winter since intensification is ranked based on number of cash crops in the cropping system and harvested biomass the system intensities were ranked as follows mws r mws ss sw 2 2 crop management no tillage was used with annual crops maize wheat sorghum sweet sorghum and oat while initial sw cultivation was carried out using conventional tillage in sw the activities and inputs for soil preparation and planting stages were made only in the year of establishment of the crop so all the inputs and emissions associated with this period were amortized over a period of eight years recommended planting densities were used for all crops pre and post emergent herbicides were applied in all treatments to control weeds as needed phosphorus fertilization was carried out at planting with different doses according to the crop using ammonium phosphate as source 18 n 46 p nitrogen fertilizer applications were carried out in the post planting stage varying rates according to management practices using urea 46 n none fertilization for the oat cover crop in the ss system was done in mws r system residue

grain residues total biomass correspond to means of field measurements over eight years 2009 2016 in mws and mws r systems total yield dry matter or ethanol corresponded to the sum of each crop yield grain or residue in the crop rotation each crop mean yield is presented in table 3 mean dry matter and ethanol yield of bioethanol cropping systems is presented in table 4 in mws and mws r systems each crop had different grain yields as a result of residue harvest effect in the crop rotation switchgrass achieved the highest dry matter and ethanol yields with values of 15 mg ha yr 1 and 4 263 l ha yr 1 respectively table 4 the ethanol yield produced by sw was followed by mws r with 3 104 l ha yr 1 the mws rotation presented lower yields both in dry matter 6 08 mg ha yr 1 and ethanol 2 128 l ha yr 1 on the other hand the harvest of crop residues showed an increase of 58 and 46 for dry matter and ethanol respectively 2 4 water footprint calculations we estimated the wf t of four bioenergy cropping systems following the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 the wf t for a product is the sum of three types of water blue green and gray hoekstra et al 2011 eq 1 1 w f t m 3 w f b l u e w f g r e e n w f g r a y where blue water is the volume of surface and ground water consumed irrigation water green water is soil water loss due to evapotranspiration in the cropping system and gray water is the water volume needed to dilute pollutant emissions to concentrations allowed by water protection laws hoekstra et al 2011 since wf blue is zero under rainfed conditions the wf t of bioethanol cropping systems correspond to the sum of wf green and wf gray in the ss system wf t correspond to the sum of wf t values for ss and the cover crop oats since cover crops received no fertilizer wf t for oats corresponded to wf green functional units used for comparing wf t of systems were m3 ha yr 1 and units used for product ethanol comparisons were m3 l 1ethanol water consumption per crop was allocated to crop ethanol yield from dry matter harvested grains and residues of maize wheat grain sorghum and to total aboveground biomass for sweet sorghum and switchgrass fresh matter yields was transported by truck to ethanol production plant however dry matter yields were used for calculations 2 5 green water footprint assessment for crop evapotranspiration requirement estimates etc mm day 1 the most desirable estimates would be based on local measurements which were not available in this study therefore estimates were based on the recommended empirical equation of allen et al 1998 where crop evaporation requirement etc mm day 1 was the product of reference evapotranspiration eto mm multiplied by a single crop coefficient kc eq 2 values of kc vary with crop and stage of development variation in kc throughout crop growth was represented by the crop coefficient curve composed of three kc values corresponding to the initial stage kc ini the mid season stage kc med and the final stage kc end fig 2 2 e t c e t o k c the wf green m3 ha 1 is equal to the integration of etc daily values over the growing season green water depends on crop specific evapotranspiration and soil moisture availability in the field allen et al 1998 cropwat 8 0 fao 2010 software was used to calculate etc using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the irrigation schedule cropwat option was used in order to calculate actual evapotranspiration which included a soil water balance that tracks soil moisture content over time using a daily time step rather than accounting for effective precipitation the calculated evapotranspiration was referred to the adjusted crop evapotranspiration eta eq 3 which can be smaller than etc due to non optimal conditions the stress coefficient ks describes the effect of water stress on crop transpiration 3 e t a e t c k s cropwat model inputs for estimating evapotranspiration were climate crop and soil parameters climatic information temperature precipitation humidity radiation and wind speed was measured using a vantage pro2 automatic weather station model 6510 davis instruments hayward ca located approximately 100 m from the lte monthly climate information based on 13 year averages 2002 2015 was used regarding crop parameters kc values for the different crop growth stages and rooting depths were based on studies by allen et al 1998 and chapagain and hoekstra 2004 since there was no national information crop planting and harvest dates and lengths of each crop developmental stage were from the lte data base fig 2 soil parameters included available soil water content maximum infiltration rate maximum rooting depth and initial soil moisture depletion available soil water content adh for the entire soil profile was estimated as 110 mm using the following empirical function adjusted for uruguayan soils silva et al 1988 eq 4 4 a d h f c p w p where fc represents field capacity and pwp is the permanent wilting point these parameters were estimated based on percent contents of sand silt clay and organic matter on soil horizons a maximum infiltration rate of 90 mm day 1 was measured in the lte by the müntz method using double ring infiltrometers custodio and llamas 1976 an average soil depth of 0 7 m was taken as the maximum rooting depth for the lte different initial soil moisture contents at the start of the growing season for each crop were used cropwat outputs were real and potential crop water use and irrigation requirements for our work we used the real crop water use as our output this value corresponded to real etc under rainfed conditions rainfed conditions were simulated by the model by choosing to apply no irrigation in our case of rainfed production the wf green was equal to total evapotranspiration as simulated by the model 2 6 gray water footprint assessment emissions related to n and p were considered for wf gray estimation the wf gray corresponded to the nutrient having the largest volume of water the gray component of the wf m3 ton 1 was calculated according to hoekstra et al 2011 eq 5 5 w f g r a y m 3 t o n 1 a l f c m a x c n a t y where al is the annual pollutant load per unit area of each crop expressed in kg ha 1 f is the fraction of al emitted to the ecosystem cmax is the maximum permissible pollutant concentration in freshwater kg m3 cnat is the natural pollutant concentration in water kg m3 and y is crop yield mg ha yr 1 although we use the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 for calculating gray water in this study we consider adding three sources of real nutrient loss in addition to n loss by leaching as recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were also considered in our study further we assumed that an average of 10 n and 3 p of applied fertilizers fig 3 was lost through rainfall and leaching according to chapagain et al 2006 nutrient losses by soil erosion mg ha yr 1 were estimated with erosion 6 0 software based on the combination of validated and calibrated usle rusle model for uruguay garcía préchac et al 2013 the erosion 6 0 software was downloaded from its official website garcía préchac et al 2013 this model estimates annual soil erosion for each combination of agricultural land use and soil properties based on usle factors foster et al 1981 losses of n and p were estimated as the product of the amount of eroded soil and n and p enrichment of the first 5 cm of soil in this study we used water concentrations of n and p allowed for tap water production in uruguay decree 253 79 mvotma 1979 10 mg of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and 0 025 mg of phosphorous po4 p per liter 2 7 statistical analysis water footprint means for the different bioethanol cropping systems were compared by analysis of variance anova normal distribution and homoscedasticity were tested with the shapiro wilk s and levene tests respectively when these assumptions were not met the anova was done with the kruskal wallis test and post hoc analysis by the dunn test all analyses were performed at a 5 significance level using the infostat p program di rienzo et al 2014 and r software r core team 2013 3 results 3 1 water footprint estimation the wf t of different cropping systems can be seen in table 5 the mws r system had the largest wf t per hectare 68 862 m3 ha yr 1 which was 23 larger than the mws system 53 018 m3 ha yr 1 by comparison sw displayed the lowest wf t value per hectare 12 735 m3 ha yr 1 when wf t was expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis mws 26 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 was not different from mws r 23 1 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and ss 30 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 table 5 sw had the lowest wf t value per liter of ethanol 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 for both functional units hectare and liter of ethanol annual systems mws mws r ss had larger values than the perennial system sw table 5 in the sw system wf green was the main fraction 68 of wf t and had the largest value 8 680 m3 ha yr 1 mws r and mws systems were not different from each other and had a wf green value 7 180 m3 ha yr 1 that was 20 lower than sw when wf green was expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis mws 3 6 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 was different from mws r 2 4 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and sw 2 6 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 table 5 in the ss system wfgreen 8 160 m3 ha yr 1 was only 6 lower than the sw system and had a higher value when expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis 4 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 overall cropping systems total loss of n was 30 times higher than p table 6 however wf gray related to p was 13 times higher than wf gray related to pollution by n compounds table 5 in annual systems mws mws r ss wf gray was the main fraction 87 of wf t mws r had the largest wf gray per hectare 61 682 m3 ha yr 1 which was 30 larger than mws 45 838 m3 ha yr 1 the sw system had the lowest wf gray value per hectare 4 055 m3 ha yr 1 an 8 year crop yield database allowed us to see the response of the wf when there were variations in yield fig 4 for this a specific wf was estimated for each year and cultivation system the graph reflects the result of having an lte that allows for taking into account the effect of weather on the wf the results showed that the wf of bioethanol cropping systems has a negative exponential relationship with yield performance we observed how the reduction of yield in systems led to significant increases in the wf this was more important in years where climatic conditions adversely impacted crop growth annual crops showed higher wf values since overall yields were lower compared to sw in our study annual crops showed a mean value of 26 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 while the perennial sw had the smallest value 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 switchgrass had more extreme values minimum and maximum in biomass production ranging from 4 200 to 30 494 mg ha yr 1 fig 4 however the wf values of sw displayed a more stable pattern given the great climatic variability to which crops are exposed sw would be the recommended crop for maintaining low wf values 3 2 wf gray estimation in fig 5 wf t and wf gray m3 ha yr 1 of bioethanol cropping systems were presented noted differences were due to the fact that three levels of nutrient loss were added to the methodology recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 in our study in addition to considering the loss of n by leaching as mentioned by hoekstra et al 2011 p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were also considered compared to our results the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 produced an average wf t that was 6 7 and 1 3 times lower in annual systems and sw respectively this suggests that the addition of three levels of nutrient loss allowed for the detection of more differences in annual systems in addition the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 did not detect important differences in wf t within bioethanol cropping systems 8 400 9 600 m3 ha yr 1 as observed in our study 12 700 68 800 m3 ha yr 1 the proposed levels allowed for better quantification of n and p losses and showed which nutrient had greater impact on wf gray therefore the proposed changes in wf gray estimation can reveal the greater impact on water quality in more intensive systems another important difference was the wf t profile on average in our study wf gray represented 87 of wf t in annual systems while representing only 13 when the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 was applied in general wf t of bioethanol cropping systems and contributions of wf gray were much larger based on nutrient loss sources used in this study source of nutrient loss affected the wf gray in the bioethanol cropping systems table 6 nutrient loss by leaching was largest in systems with high fertilizations rates mws mws r and nutrient loss by soil erosion was largest in systems with total biomass harvests mws r ss in regard to p loss by leaching was the most important fraction of wf gray for all systems on average this represented 73 of the wf gray within systems however in mws r and ss systems having total biomass harvests p losses by soil erosion represented 38 of the wf gray compared to the mws system the higher value of wf t per hectare in mws r corresponded to the largest p loss by soil erosion 0 58 vs 0 18 kg p po4 ha 1yr 1 table 6 in addition the lowest wf t seen in the sw system corresponded to p loss kg po4 p ha yr 1 that was 12 times lower than the annual cropping systems 4 discussion 4 1 wf t of bioethanol systems comparing our results with other studies wf t of bioethanol cropping systems was observed to be higher than calculated values mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2012 gerbens leenes 2017 gerbens leenes 2017 evaluated the total wf t of different feedstocks food crops energy crops and residues for bioethanol production the wf t green blue and gray ranged between 1 05 and 3 8 and between 0 15 and 0 7 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 for first and second generation from residues respectively the wf t of second generation bioethanol from energy crops correspond only to wf green and ranged between 1 5 and 7 4 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 with a mean value of 3 2 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 gerbens leenes 2017 in our study annual crops showed a mean value of 26 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 while the perennial sw had the smallest value 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 fig 4 in addition the wf t of annual cropping systems mws mws r and ss had a different profile to those previously reported gerbens leenes 2017 holmatov et al 2019 mathioudakis et al 2017 where wf green was the main fraction of wf t ranging 62 95 regardless of feedstock the contribution of wf blue and wf gray varied between crops on the other hand the wf t of corn and sweet sorghum ethanol feedstocks evaluated by su et al 2015 ranged from 25 to 50 40 45 and 10 30 for green blue and gray respectively in our work wf green and wf gray in annual systems represented 13 and 87 of wf t respectively unlike other reports our results highlight the large wf gray component of wf t switchgrass exhibited a profile similar to that reported by others where green and gray water represent 60 and 40 of wf t respectively in annual crops the differences between our results and other reported values were reflected by the ratio between wf green and wf gray in our case the ratio was 1 6 7 while ratios of other published work varied between 1 0 6 and 2 5 1 when comparing annual and perennial crops sw achieved the smallest wf t per unit of ethanol m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and per area m3 ha yr 1 our results did not agree with reported values of gerbens leenes 2017 where wf t of second generation bioethanol from energy crops miscanthus pine eucalyptus was similar to wf t mean values of first generation feedstock our results show that this difference is due to the important role of wf gray in wf t table 5 the largest values of wf gray in annual systems correspond to intensive systems that are characterized by a greater number of crops and therefore higher fertilizer application rates in addition these systems have the highest rates of soil loss and nutrient loss by erosion in contrast sw is the least intensive system and had a wf gray volume that was 7 times lower than the mean of annual systems in reviewed studies gerbens leenes et al 2009a gerbens leenes 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mathioudakis et al 2017 wf green of bioethanol feedstocks were calculated globally at high spatial resolutions and did not consider climatic and soil variations in regions under study in our work the use of specific soil parameters representative of the region i e available water content maximum infiltration rate maximum rooting depth and initial soil moisture depletion allowed for more accurate wf green values given that there are no reported values of wf green for uruguayan conditions our results can be considered the first accurate assessment of values for this region 4 2 wf t changes by crop residue management harvest of crop residues mws r affected the wf t although mws and mws r systems were not statistically different when wf was expressed per unit ethanol produced m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 wf t per hectare in the mws r system was 30 higher than mws due to an increased wf gray the larger wf gray was due to p losses by soil erosion that were 3 times greater table 6 low soil coverage at post harvest in the mws r system led to higher soil erosion levels and therefore larger p losses 4 3 wf gray analyses of evaluated bioethanol systems larger wf gray values in bioethanol cropping systems imply that the volume required to assimilate nutrient loads without regard to other agrochemicals to meet quality standards plays a significant role and demonstrates the importance of accounting for water pollution and water quality to avoid underestimation the literature shows that most previous studies did not assess the gray component due to difficulties in evaluating pollutants and integrating real water component volumes bocchiola et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 in cases where wf gray was quantified only n compounds were considered for water quality restoration lovarelli et al 2016 in agricultural production wf gray is predominantly due to nutrient load from fertilizers liu et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 and n often has greater impact on wf gray since n fertilizers are more abundantly applied to fields although our results showed that n loss was 30 times larger than p kg ha yr 1 overall systems wf gray related to p was 13 times larger than n table 5 the lower permissible limit values for p in potable water production requires larger volumes of freshwater to dilute nutrient concentrations to established limits in our work the different wf gray values compared to others gerbens leenes 2017 mathioudakis et al 2017 holmatov et al 2019 were largely due to the manner in which wf gray was calculated in fig 5 wf t and wf gray m3 ha yr 1 of bioethanol cropping systems were based on using the recommended methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 and three sources of nutrient loss were added for results reported in this study in previously reported values of wf gray for bioethanol cropping systems gerbens leenes 2017 mathioudakis et al 2017 holmatov et al 2019 losses of n by leaching were considered for water quality restoration but p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were not considered according to lovarelli et al 2016 the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 is over simplified and has limitations for assessing wf gray when wf is applied to agricultural production these authors further suggest that wf gray should be calculated following a more detailed methodology and using specific field estimates in this regard estimates of pollutants released to water bodies should consider site specific parameters such as daily precipitation field slope soil characteristics e g texture carbon content and run off in agreement with these authors our use of site specific data to estimate wf gray allowed for more accurate values furthermore the use of erosion 6 0 software with lte data made it possible to estimate local soil erosion levels and subsequent nutrient losses 4 4 strengths limitations and recommendations most wf studies on agricultural products have focused on single crops and only a few studies analyzed cropping systems as a whole núñez et al 2013 although this approach could be acceptable for perennial crops annual cropping system cannot be adequately assessed due to multiple operations inherent to crop rotation e g nutrient inputs soil erosion control etc in this regard analyzing cropping systems as a whole allowed us to account for different fertilization rates and the initial depletion of soil moisture due to the previous crop in addition it was possible to quantify rates of soil loss in the different cropping systems and their impacts on wf t in regards to wf green estimates the cropwat model is limited in that crop biomass is not considered when determining evapotranspired water values therefore two year cropping systems mws and mws r composed of the same crops had equal values of wf green per hectare despite having different biomass yields this is a consequence of the model being insensitive to crop yield due to low values of wf green in annual crops this limitation did not introduce important changes in our study nevertheless this could be detrimental to reseach estimating wf green for different crops cropwat is not a crop growth model and does not provide real time scheduling advice rather it was developed as a tool for estimating crop irrigation requirements van heerden et al 2008 intensification of bioethanol cropping systems by increasing harvested biomass grain and residues demonstrates the necessity for calibrating models e g specific to uruguay that estimate water consumption by unit of product total biomass regarding this aquacrop the last model developed and recommended by fao is a water driven model that can simulate annual growing cycle of crops and incorporates the concept of crop water productivity to transform estimated crop evapotranspiration to final crop yield steduto et al 2009 climate input requirements are very similar to those of cropwat but aquacrop is a more sophisticated model that requires more detailed soil and crop information tsakmakis et al 2018 our results showed that p management is a factor key to reducing wf gray thus strategies that reduce p loss or increase system efficiency will result in a reduction of wf gray since uruguayan soils are characterized by low p availability berretta et al 2000 reductions in p fertilization can lead to lower yields according to herath et al 2014 fertilizer application can be minimized by adopting alternative fertilizer management practices this requires that farmers are familiar with soil characteristics especially nutrient content and nutrient requirements at various growth stages in order to determine optimal timing and fertilizer amount results showed that high rates of soil erosion had a large effect on wf gray values therefore erosion control is a key to reducing wf gray in cropping systems in fact results showed that crop residue removal promoted increased wf t due to increased nutrient loss by soil erosion to reduce water pollution in bioethanol production systems removal of annual crop residues is not recommended on the other hand cropping systems characterized by high amounts of post harvest residues will reduce wf gray in addition nutrient recycling from decomposing residue can lead to lower fertilization requirements in these cropping systems perennial grasses such as switchgrass sw have been proposed as potential candidates for bioethanol production due to promising productivity and water quality benefits switchgrass has high adaptability high yield and high nutrient turnover with little carbon debt fargione et al 2008 david and ragauskas 2010 to avoid land competition with food crops sw is a feasible option for low agriculture suitability soils cai et al 2011 where annual crops have low yields and profitability gelfand et al 2013 our results showed that sw had lower wf t than annual cropping systems under uruguayan conditions moreover sw had the largest yields biomass and ethanol and the lowest carbon footprint of all studied systems bustamante et al submitted therefore sw can be a recommended biofuel crop for uruguay 5 conclusions our results support the hypothesis that the intensification of agricultural systems resulted in increased wf t the most intensified agricultural system mws r had the highest wf t per hectare the least intensive crop sw had the lowest wf t per hectare and per ethanol yield the volume required to assimilate p played a significant role in the bioethanol cropping systems in annual systems wf gray was the primary component of wf t system intensification due to greater number of crops per year and removal of crop residues increased wf gray as a result of large nutrient losses by leaching and soil erosion in addition the wf t of sw was lowest and corresponded to p losses that were 12 times lower than annual cropping systems based on these wf t results sw is the best option for bioethanol crop production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10071,bioenergy is the most widely used type of renewable energy however an assessment of water consumption and pollution is necessary to determine the water demand of this energy source the uruguayan public policy to decarbonize energy sources highlighted the use of bioenergy in this regard we analyzed the water footprint wf of four bioethanol cropping systems 1 maize wheat sorghum rotation without harvested crop residues mws 2 maize wheat sorghum rotation with harvested crop residues mws r 3 continuous sweet sorghum ss and 4 switchgrass sw in order to assess the wf of bioethanol production green wf green and gray wf gray components of crop production were calculated by considering the different volumes of water involved in evaporation rainfall and fertilizer pollution annual cropping systems i e mws mws r ss had the largest wfs 23 1 30 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 switchgrass had the lowest values per hectare and per liter of ethanol 12 735 m3 ha yr 1 and 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 respectively the volume required to assimilate phosphorous p and nitrogen n fertilizers played a significant role in bioethanol cropping systems in annual systems wf gray was the main fraction 87 of total wf wf t averaged across all cropping systems wf gray related to p was 13 times larger than wf gray related to n graphical abstract ga1 keywords bioenergy green water gray water soil erosion intensification 1 introduction bioenergy is the largest renewable energy source globally constitutes 70 of all renewable energy sources and contributes 14 to global primary energy supply iea 2017 however water consumption and water quality continue to be key factors affecting environmental sustainability in bioenergy production zhong et al 2018 the increasing demand of energy crops will lead to increased pressure on water resources due to inefficient water consumption and pollution issues mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 water requirements for bioenergy production vary according to feedstock used geographic location and climatic variables therefore these factors must be considered to determine water consumptive use and to identify critical scenarios and mitigation strategies dominguez faus et al 2009 different raw materials have been evaluated to produce bioenergy morales et al 2015 however it is necessary to consider long term environmental benefits and impacts associated with each halvorsen et al 2009 in uruguay there are several agricultural long term experiments lte investigating technology development and environmental performance of different agronomic cropping systems siri prieto 2013 recently energy policy in uruguay has focused on the decarbonization of energy sources in response to this goal a liquid fuel market and electric power generation from biofuel and biomass has been developed ludeña and ryfisch 2015 within this framework uruguay decreased oil consumption by 25 from 2006 to 2016 increased renewable energy by 62 and became an exporter rather than importer of electrical energy uruguay xxi 2017 thus agroindustry residues i e forest and agricultural currently represent two thirds of current bioenergy production in 2017 energy from biomass accounted for 43 of total produced energy compared to only 20 for the 1990 2007 period uruguay xxi 2017 the potential production area for bioethanol crops in uruguay is limited by availability of bioethanol plants in the country there are two agro industrial complexes in paysandú and bella union with a production capacity of 100 million liters per year these facilities use 200 thousand tons of grain sorghum maize and wheat and 450 thousand tons of sugar cane and sweet sorghum as raw material which is equivalent to 50 thousand hectares of crops uruguay s government owned oil company i e ancap has invested in domestic ethanol production from annual crops but little prior research has investigated environmental impacts of this biofuel program among potential environmental issues related to biofuel production water consumption and water pollution are critically important ji and long 2016 to address these issues evaluating the water footprint wf allows assessment of water volume consumed or polluted when producing a product this includes direct and indirect water use virtual water along product supply chains hoekstra et al 2011 total water footprint wf t is the sum of three types of water blue wf blue green wf green and gray wf gray where wf blue is the consumptive use of freshwater from water bodies wf green refers exclusively to consumed or evapotranspired rainwater in crop production and wf gray is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutant loads based on existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 global estimates of wf t associated with different bioenergy feedstocks varied widely depending on feedstock and location gerbens leenes et al 2009b mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mathioudakis et al 2017 for example gerbens leenes et al 2009a quantified the wf t of biomass based energy and compared to fossil energy study results indicated that biomass production increased wf t due to large crop water consumption most studies have focused on water consumption without any quantification of water pollution in fact the reduction of wf gray is important in reducing the environmental impact during the production process chukalla et al 2015 however estimates of wf gray associated with biofuel feedstock production have been relatively limited in wf analyses wu et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 and generally have not consider regional variability of contaminant leaching and loading rates zhong et al 2018 globally the prevailing threat to freshwater quality is eutrophication khan and mohammad 2014 caused by excess phosphorous p and nitrogen n in freshwater bodies however most studies only considered n pollution in wf gray estimates chukalla et al 2015 however p from fertilizers can be a contributor due to losses by leaching and transport by soil erosion to nearby water bodies scherer and pfister 2015 the development of bioethanol cropping systems is still limited in uruguay and there are several scientific gaps concerning environmental sustainability related to water quality and usage to address these issues we evaluated two hypotheses 1 agricultural intensification i e consumption of inputs crops per year and or residue removal will increase the wf t of the system i e cropping system and 2 this intensification will reduce the wf t of the product i e bioethanol produced to evaluate the consequence of these hypotheses we estimated the wf t of four bioethanol cropping systems and their bioethanol production the studied bioethanol cropping systems which belong to an eight year agricultural lte had different degrees of intensification and were representative of the main agricultural region in uruguay 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design agronomic information used for wf t estimates utilized the database of the eight year lte of bioethanol cropping systems maintained at the mario cassinoni agricultural experimental station eemac paysandú department uruguay 32 22 s 58 03 w these bioethanol cropping systems are representative of production conditions for western arable soils of the country fig 1 according to the köeppen classification kottek et al 2006 this region has a temperate humid climate without a dry season daily average temperatures of 24 c summer and 12 c winter and average annual precipitation of 1598 mm monthly climate information was used to determine the 13 year average 2002 2015 the lte is on a brunosol éutrico typico uruguay soil taxonomy durán and garcía préchac 2007 or argiudol usda soil taxonomy usda 1999 that belongs to the san manuel soil unit with a soil depth of 40 90 cm and average slope of 1 the experimental plots were 150 m2 30 m 5 m prior to start of this lte in the summer of 2008 the research site had been under a wheat soybean maize rotation from 2003 to 2007 treatments within the lte were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications table 1 the bioethanol cropping systems were 1 maize zea mays wheat triticum aestivum grain sorghum sorghum bicolor rotation without crop residue removal mws 2 maize wheat grain sorghum rotation with crop residue removal mws r 3 continuous sweet sorghum with winter cover ss and 4 switchgrass panicum virgatum sw treatments 1 and 2 had three crops in two years consequently these two cropping systems include additional plots so all crops for each crop rotation are present every year the continuous sweet sorghum treatment includes oat avena sativa as a cover crop to reduce soil erosion the fourth treatment was switchgrass a perennial lignocellulosic crop planted in 2008 and harvest every winter since intensification is ranked based on number of cash crops in the cropping system and harvested biomass the system intensities were ranked as follows mws r mws ss sw 2 2 crop management no tillage was used with annual crops maize wheat sorghum sweet sorghum and oat while initial sw cultivation was carried out using conventional tillage in sw the activities and inputs for soil preparation and planting stages were made only in the year of establishment of the crop so all the inputs and emissions associated with this period were amortized over a period of eight years recommended planting densities were used for all crops pre and post emergent herbicides were applied in all treatments to control weeds as needed phosphorus fertilization was carried out at planting with different doses according to the crop using ammonium phosphate as source 18 n 46 p nitrogen fertilizer applications were carried out in the post planting stage varying rates according to management practices using urea 46 n none fertilization for the oat cover crop in the ss system was done in mws r system residue was harvested using additional machinery information of supplies and field activities i e seed fertilizers pesticides fuels machinery is presented in table 2 2 3 biomass production yields crop yields grain residues total biomass correspond to means of field measurements over eight years 2009 2016 in mws and mws r systems total yield dry matter or ethanol corresponded to the sum of each crop yield grain or residue in the crop rotation each crop mean yield is presented in table 3 mean dry matter and ethanol yield of bioethanol cropping systems is presented in table 4 in mws and mws r systems each crop had different grain yields as a result of residue harvest effect in the crop rotation switchgrass achieved the highest dry matter and ethanol yields with values of 15 mg ha yr 1 and 4 263 l ha yr 1 respectively table 4 the ethanol yield produced by sw was followed by mws r with 3 104 l ha yr 1 the mws rotation presented lower yields both in dry matter 6 08 mg ha yr 1 and ethanol 2 128 l ha yr 1 on the other hand the harvest of crop residues showed an increase of 58 and 46 for dry matter and ethanol respectively 2 4 water footprint calculations we estimated the wf t of four bioenergy cropping systems following the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 the wf t for a product is the sum of three types of water blue green and gray hoekstra et al 2011 eq 1 1 w f t m 3 w f b l u e w f g r e e n w f g r a y where blue water is the volume of surface and ground water consumed irrigation water green water is soil water loss due to evapotranspiration in the cropping system and gray water is the water volume needed to dilute pollutant emissions to concentrations allowed by water protection laws hoekstra et al 2011 since wf blue is zero under rainfed conditions the wf t of bioethanol cropping systems correspond to the sum of wf green and wf gray in the ss system wf t correspond to the sum of wf t values for ss and the cover crop oats since cover crops received no fertilizer wf t for oats corresponded to wf green functional units used for comparing wf t of systems were m3 ha yr 1 and units used for product ethanol comparisons were m3 l 1ethanol water consumption per crop was allocated to crop ethanol yield from dry matter harvested grains and residues of maize wheat grain sorghum and to total aboveground biomass for sweet sorghum and switchgrass fresh matter yields was transported by truck to ethanol production plant however dry matter yields were used for calculations 2 5 green water footprint assessment for crop evapotranspiration requirement estimates etc mm day 1 the most desirable estimates would be based on local measurements which were not available in this study therefore estimates were based on the recommended empirical equation of allen et al 1998 where crop evaporation requirement etc mm day 1 was the product of reference evapotranspiration eto mm multiplied by a single crop coefficient kc eq 2 values of kc vary with crop and stage of development variation in kc throughout crop growth was represented by the crop coefficient curve composed of three kc values corresponding to the initial stage kc ini the mid season stage kc med and the final stage kc end fig 2 2 e t c e t o k c the wf green m3 ha 1 is equal to the integration of etc daily values over the growing season green water depends on crop specific evapotranspiration and soil moisture availability in the field allen et al 1998 cropwat 8 0 fao 2010 software was used to calculate etc using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the irrigation schedule cropwat option was used in order to calculate actual evapotranspiration which included a soil water balance that tracks soil moisture content over time using a daily time step rather than accounting for effective precipitation the calculated evapotranspiration was referred to the adjusted crop evapotranspiration eta eq 3 which can be smaller than etc due to non optimal conditions the stress coefficient ks describes the effect of water stress on crop transpiration 3 e t a e t c k s cropwat model inputs for estimating evapotranspiration were climate crop and soil parameters climatic information temperature precipitation humidity radiation and wind speed was measured using a vantage pro2 automatic weather station model 6510 davis instruments hayward ca located approximately 100 m from the lte monthly climate information based on 13 year averages 2002 2015 was used regarding crop parameters kc values for the different crop growth stages and rooting depths were based on studies by allen et al 1998 and chapagain and hoekstra 2004 since there was no national information crop planting and harvest dates and lengths of each crop developmental stage were from the lte data base fig 2 soil parameters included available soil water content maximum infiltration rate maximum rooting depth and initial soil moisture depletion available soil water content adh for the entire soil profile was estimated as 110 mm using the following empirical function adjusted for uruguayan soils silva et al 1988 eq 4 4 a d h f c p w p where fc represents field capacity and pwp is the permanent wilting point these parameters were estimated based on percent contents of sand silt clay and organic matter on soil horizons a maximum infiltration rate of 90 mm day 1 was measured in the lte by the müntz method using double ring infiltrometers custodio and llamas 1976 an average soil depth of 0 7 m was taken as the maximum rooting depth for the lte different initial soil moisture contents at the start of the growing season for each crop were used cropwat outputs were real and potential crop water use and irrigation requirements for our work we used the real crop water use as our output this value corresponded to real etc under rainfed conditions rainfed conditions were simulated by the model by choosing to apply no irrigation in our case of rainfed production the wf green was equal to total evapotranspiration as simulated by the model 2 6 gray water footprint assessment emissions related to n and p were considered for wf gray estimation the wf gray corresponded to the nutrient having the largest volume of water the gray component of the wf m3 ton 1 was calculated according to hoekstra et al 2011 eq 5 5 w f g r a y m 3 t o n 1 a l f c m a x c n a t y where al is the annual pollutant load per unit area of each crop expressed in kg ha 1 f is the fraction of al emitted to the ecosystem cmax is the maximum permissible pollutant concentration in freshwater kg m3 cnat is the natural pollutant concentration in water kg m3 and y is crop yield mg ha yr 1 although we use the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 for calculating gray water in this study we consider adding three sources of real nutrient loss in addition to n loss by leaching as recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were also considered in our study further we assumed that an average of 10 n and 3 p of applied fertilizers fig 3 was lost through rainfall and leaching according to chapagain et al 2006 nutrient losses by soil erosion mg ha yr 1 were estimated with erosion 6 0 software based on the combination of validated and calibrated usle rusle model for uruguay garcía préchac et al 2013 the erosion 6 0 software was downloaded from its official website garcía préchac et al 2013 this model estimates annual soil erosion for each combination of agricultural land use and soil properties based on usle factors foster et al 1981 losses of n and p were estimated as the product of the amount of eroded soil and n and p enrichment of the first 5 cm of soil in this study we used water concentrations of n and p allowed for tap water production in uruguay decree 253 79 mvotma 1979 10 mg of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and 0 025 mg of phosphorous po4 p per liter 2 7 statistical analysis water footprint means for the different bioethanol cropping systems were compared by analysis of variance anova normal distribution and homoscedasticity were tested with the shapiro wilk s and levene tests respectively when these assumptions were not met the anova was done with the kruskal wallis test and post hoc analysis by the dunn test all analyses were performed at a 5 significance level using the infostat p program di rienzo et al 2014 and r software r core team 2013 3 results 3 1 water footprint estimation the wf t of different cropping systems can be seen in table 5 the mws r system had the largest wf t per hectare 68 862 m3 ha yr 1 which was 23 larger than the mws system 53 018 m3 ha yr 1 by comparison sw displayed the lowest wf t value per hectare 12 735 m3 ha yr 1 when wf t was expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis mws 26 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 was not different from mws r 23 1 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and ss 30 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 table 5 sw had the lowest wf t value per liter of ethanol 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 for both functional units hectare and liter of ethanol annual systems mws mws r ss had larger values than the perennial system sw table 5 in the sw system wf green was the main fraction 68 of wf t and had the largest value 8 680 m3 ha yr 1 mws r and mws systems were not different from each other and had a wf green value 7 180 m3 ha yr 1 that was 20 lower than sw when wf green was expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis mws 3 6 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 was different from mws r 2 4 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and sw 2 6 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 table 5 in the ss system wfgreen 8 160 m3 ha yr 1 was only 6 lower than the sw system and had a higher value when expressed on a per liter of ethanol basis 4 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 overall cropping systems total loss of n was 30 times higher than p table 6 however wf gray related to p was 13 times higher than wf gray related to pollution by n compounds table 5 in annual systems mws mws r ss wf gray was the main fraction 87 of wf t mws r had the largest wf gray per hectare 61 682 m3 ha yr 1 which was 30 larger than mws 45 838 m3 ha yr 1 the sw system had the lowest wf gray value per hectare 4 055 m3 ha yr 1 an 8 year crop yield database allowed us to see the response of the wf when there were variations in yield fig 4 for this a specific wf was estimated for each year and cultivation system the graph reflects the result of having an lte that allows for taking into account the effect of weather on the wf the results showed that the wf of bioethanol cropping systems has a negative exponential relationship with yield performance we observed how the reduction of yield in systems led to significant increases in the wf this was more important in years where climatic conditions adversely impacted crop growth annual crops showed higher wf values since overall yields were lower compared to sw in our study annual crops showed a mean value of 26 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 while the perennial sw had the smallest value 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 switchgrass had more extreme values minimum and maximum in biomass production ranging from 4 200 to 30 494 mg ha yr 1 fig 4 however the wf values of sw displayed a more stable pattern given the great climatic variability to which crops are exposed sw would be the recommended crop for maintaining low wf values 3 2 wf gray estimation in fig 5 wf t and wf gray m3 ha yr 1 of bioethanol cropping systems were presented noted differences were due to the fact that three levels of nutrient loss were added to the methodology recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 in our study in addition to considering the loss of n by leaching as mentioned by hoekstra et al 2011 p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were also considered compared to our results the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 produced an average wf t that was 6 7 and 1 3 times lower in annual systems and sw respectively this suggests that the addition of three levels of nutrient loss allowed for the detection of more differences in annual systems in addition the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 did not detect important differences in wf t within bioethanol cropping systems 8 400 9 600 m3 ha yr 1 as observed in our study 12 700 68 800 m3 ha yr 1 the proposed levels allowed for better quantification of n and p losses and showed which nutrient had greater impact on wf gray therefore the proposed changes in wf gray estimation can reveal the greater impact on water quality in more intensive systems another important difference was the wf t profile on average in our study wf gray represented 87 of wf t in annual systems while representing only 13 when the methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 was applied in general wf t of bioethanol cropping systems and contributions of wf gray were much larger based on nutrient loss sources used in this study source of nutrient loss affected the wf gray in the bioethanol cropping systems table 6 nutrient loss by leaching was largest in systems with high fertilizations rates mws mws r and nutrient loss by soil erosion was largest in systems with total biomass harvests mws r ss in regard to p loss by leaching was the most important fraction of wf gray for all systems on average this represented 73 of the wf gray within systems however in mws r and ss systems having total biomass harvests p losses by soil erosion represented 38 of the wf gray compared to the mws system the higher value of wf t per hectare in mws r corresponded to the largest p loss by soil erosion 0 58 vs 0 18 kg p po4 ha 1yr 1 table 6 in addition the lowest wf t seen in the sw system corresponded to p loss kg po4 p ha yr 1 that was 12 times lower than the annual cropping systems 4 discussion 4 1 wf t of bioethanol systems comparing our results with other studies wf t of bioethanol cropping systems was observed to be higher than calculated values mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2012 gerbens leenes 2017 gerbens leenes 2017 evaluated the total wf t of different feedstocks food crops energy crops and residues for bioethanol production the wf t green blue and gray ranged between 1 05 and 3 8 and between 0 15 and 0 7 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 for first and second generation from residues respectively the wf t of second generation bioethanol from energy crops correspond only to wf green and ranged between 1 5 and 7 4 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 with a mean value of 3 2 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 gerbens leenes 2017 in our study annual crops showed a mean value of 26 9 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 while the perennial sw had the smallest value 3 8 m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 fig 4 in addition the wf t of annual cropping systems mws mws r and ss had a different profile to those previously reported gerbens leenes 2017 holmatov et al 2019 mathioudakis et al 2017 where wf green was the main fraction of wf t ranging 62 95 regardless of feedstock the contribution of wf blue and wf gray varied between crops on the other hand the wf t of corn and sweet sorghum ethanol feedstocks evaluated by su et al 2015 ranged from 25 to 50 40 45 and 10 30 for green blue and gray respectively in our work wf green and wf gray in annual systems represented 13 and 87 of wf t respectively unlike other reports our results highlight the large wf gray component of wf t switchgrass exhibited a profile similar to that reported by others where green and gray water represent 60 and 40 of wf t respectively in annual crops the differences between our results and other reported values were reflected by the ratio between wf green and wf gray in our case the ratio was 1 6 7 while ratios of other published work varied between 1 0 6 and 2 5 1 when comparing annual and perennial crops sw achieved the smallest wf t per unit of ethanol m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 and per area m3 ha yr 1 our results did not agree with reported values of gerbens leenes 2017 where wf t of second generation bioethanol from energy crops miscanthus pine eucalyptus was similar to wf t mean values of first generation feedstock our results show that this difference is due to the important role of wf gray in wf t table 5 the largest values of wf gray in annual systems correspond to intensive systems that are characterized by a greater number of crops and therefore higher fertilizer application rates in addition these systems have the highest rates of soil loss and nutrient loss by erosion in contrast sw is the least intensive system and had a wf gray volume that was 7 times lower than the mean of annual systems in reviewed studies gerbens leenes et al 2009a gerbens leenes 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 mathioudakis et al 2017 wf green of bioethanol feedstocks were calculated globally at high spatial resolutions and did not consider climatic and soil variations in regions under study in our work the use of specific soil parameters representative of the region i e available water content maximum infiltration rate maximum rooting depth and initial soil moisture depletion allowed for more accurate wf green values given that there are no reported values of wf green for uruguayan conditions our results can be considered the first accurate assessment of values for this region 4 2 wf t changes by crop residue management harvest of crop residues mws r affected the wf t although mws and mws r systems were not statistically different when wf was expressed per unit ethanol produced m 3 l e t h a n o l 1 wf t per hectare in the mws r system was 30 higher than mws due to an increased wf gray the larger wf gray was due to p losses by soil erosion that were 3 times greater table 6 low soil coverage at post harvest in the mws r system led to higher soil erosion levels and therefore larger p losses 4 3 wf gray analyses of evaluated bioethanol systems larger wf gray values in bioethanol cropping systems imply that the volume required to assimilate nutrient loads without regard to other agrochemicals to meet quality standards plays a significant role and demonstrates the importance of accounting for water pollution and water quality to avoid underestimation the literature shows that most previous studies did not assess the gray component due to difficulties in evaluating pollutants and integrating real water component volumes bocchiola et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 in cases where wf gray was quantified only n compounds were considered for water quality restoration lovarelli et al 2016 in agricultural production wf gray is predominantly due to nutrient load from fertilizers liu et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2015 and n often has greater impact on wf gray since n fertilizers are more abundantly applied to fields although our results showed that n loss was 30 times larger than p kg ha yr 1 overall systems wf gray related to p was 13 times larger than n table 5 the lower permissible limit values for p in potable water production requires larger volumes of freshwater to dilute nutrient concentrations to established limits in our work the different wf gray values compared to others gerbens leenes 2017 mathioudakis et al 2017 holmatov et al 2019 were largely due to the manner in which wf gray was calculated in fig 5 wf t and wf gray m3 ha yr 1 of bioethanol cropping systems were based on using the recommended methodology of hoekstra et al 2011 and three sources of nutrient loss were added for results reported in this study in previously reported values of wf gray for bioethanol cropping systems gerbens leenes 2017 mathioudakis et al 2017 holmatov et al 2019 losses of n by leaching were considered for water quality restoration but p losses by leaching and losses of p and n by soil erosion were not considered according to lovarelli et al 2016 the methodology proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 is over simplified and has limitations for assessing wf gray when wf is applied to agricultural production these authors further suggest that wf gray should be calculated following a more detailed methodology and using specific field estimates in this regard estimates of pollutants released to water bodies should consider site specific parameters such as daily precipitation field slope soil characteristics e g texture carbon content and run off in agreement with these authors our use of site specific data to estimate wf gray allowed for more accurate values furthermore the use of erosion 6 0 software with lte data made it possible to estimate local soil erosion levels and subsequent nutrient losses 4 4 strengths limitations and recommendations most wf studies on agricultural products have focused on single crops and only a few studies analyzed cropping systems as a whole núñez et al 2013 although this approach could be acceptable for perennial crops annual cropping system cannot be adequately assessed due to multiple operations inherent to crop rotation e g nutrient inputs soil erosion control etc in this regard analyzing cropping systems as a whole allowed us to account for different fertilization rates and the initial depletion of soil moisture due to the previous crop in addition it was possible to quantify rates of soil loss in the different cropping systems and their impacts on wf t in regards to wf green estimates the cropwat model is limited in that crop biomass is not considered when determining evapotranspired water values therefore two year cropping systems mws and mws r composed of the same crops had equal values of wf green per hectare despite having different biomass yields this is a consequence of the model being insensitive to crop yield due to low values of wf green in annual crops this limitation did not introduce important changes in our study nevertheless this could be detrimental to reseach estimating wf green for different crops cropwat is not a crop growth model and does not provide real time scheduling advice rather it was developed as a tool for estimating crop irrigation requirements van heerden et al 2008 intensification of bioethanol cropping systems by increasing harvested biomass grain and residues demonstrates the necessity for calibrating models e g specific to uruguay that estimate water consumption by unit of product total biomass regarding this aquacrop the last model developed and recommended by fao is a water driven model that can simulate annual growing cycle of crops and incorporates the concept of crop water productivity to transform estimated crop evapotranspiration to final crop yield steduto et al 2009 climate input requirements are very similar to those of cropwat but aquacrop is a more sophisticated model that requires more detailed soil and crop information tsakmakis et al 2018 our results showed that p management is a factor key to reducing wf gray thus strategies that reduce p loss or increase system efficiency will result in a reduction of wf gray since uruguayan soils are characterized by low p availability berretta et al 2000 reductions in p fertilization can lead to lower yields according to herath et al 2014 fertilizer application can be minimized by adopting alternative fertilizer management practices this requires that farmers are familiar with soil characteristics especially nutrient content and nutrient requirements at various growth stages in order to determine optimal timing and fertilizer amount results showed that high rates of soil erosion had a large effect on wf gray values therefore erosion control is a key to reducing wf gray in cropping systems in fact results showed that crop residue removal promoted increased wf t due to increased nutrient loss by soil erosion to reduce water pollution in bioethanol production systems removal of annual crop residues is not recommended on the other hand cropping systems characterized by high amounts of post harvest residues will reduce wf gray in addition nutrient recycling from decomposing residue can lead to lower fertilization requirements in these cropping systems perennial grasses such as switchgrass sw have been proposed as potential candidates for bioethanol production due to promising productivity and water quality benefits switchgrass has high adaptability high yield and high nutrient turnover with little carbon debt fargione et al 2008 david and ragauskas 2010 to avoid land competition with food crops sw is a feasible option for low agriculture suitability soils cai et al 2011 where annual crops have low yields and profitability gelfand et al 2013 our results showed that sw had lower wf t than annual cropping systems under uruguayan conditions moreover sw had the largest yields biomass and ethanol and the lowest carbon footprint of all studied systems bustamante et al submitted therefore sw can be a recommended biofuel crop for uruguay 5 conclusions our results support the hypothesis that the intensification of agricultural systems resulted in increased wf t the most intensified agricultural system mws r had the highest wf t per hectare the least intensive crop sw had the lowest wf t per hectare and per ethanol yield the volume required to assimilate p played a significant role in the bioethanol cropping systems in annual systems wf gray was the primary component of wf t system intensification due to greater number of crops per year and removal of crop residues increased wf gray as a result of large nutrient losses by leaching and soil erosion in addition the wf t of sw was lowest and corresponded to p losses that were 12 times lower than annual cropping systems based on these wf t results sw is

10072,olive cultivation in argentina has experienced an important expansion based on large scale development of high density hd olive orchards intensification has led to yield increases but because of the high annual eto and low rainfall olive production must rely heavily on irrigation the aim of this work was to determine the yield response to variable water supply of a hd tall olive orchard and to assess the economic water productivity wp of the olive growing in an environment where the water resource is extremely scarce during three seasons in an olive orchard cv arbequina we evaluated seven irrigation regimes which supplied 120 t120 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 70 t70 60 t60 y 40 t40 of the estimated etc after the first year which was considered of transition the next two growing seasons exhibited a clear decline in yield in response to the irrigation decline with the reduction in fruit yield related to both fruit numbers and fruit size a third degree polynomial function was fitted to treatment averages r2 0 99 the maximum oil production ca 3080 kg oil ha 1 was obtained with 860 mm of irrigation the marginal wp reached a maximum 5 9 kg oil ha 1 mm 1 at 550 mm of irrigation and declined thereafter reaching zero at 860 mm in economic terms the grower achieves maximum returns us 3140 ha 1 at 850 mm of irrigation with the cost of water increasing from the present us 0 04 m 3 to us 0 24 m 3 the maximum net profit would be reduced by up to 53 us 1476 ha 1 however it would be achieved at a similar irrigation level 820 mm if in the near future water scarcity in the region makes it difficult to maintain the present levels of water supply aimed at maximizing profits there will be the need to impose restrictions through resource conservation policies to reach an equilibrium between economic environmental and sustainability goals keywords deficit irrigation water status oil yield production function marginal profit 1 introduction from the beginning of the 1990 s olive cultivation in argentina experienced an important expansion from 30 to 90 thousand ha based on production intensification given the option of irrigation the new olive groves increased their planting density over traditional recommendations leading to a large scale development of high density hd olive orchards 250 800 tree ha 1 that were mechanically harvested vita serman and matías 2013 these hd plantations formed tall continuous hedgerows of 4 5 m height under high vigor conditions for which side by side trunk shakers and straddle harvesters were developed connor et al 2014 these hd orchards represent nowadays more than 70 of the argentine olive area and even more in other countries where olive production expanded recently such as australia ravetti 2008 gomez riera and vita serman 2014 in other world areas such as spain production intensification was carried out by increasing tree density including super high density shd plantations of more than 1000 trees ha 1 pastor et al 2007 connor et al 2014 most of the new commercial plantations in argentina are drip irrigated intensively managed and relatively large 100 1500 ha puertas 2009 vita serman and matías 2013 production intensification in argentina along the lines described above has led to yield increases doubling what was achieved in conventional plantations gómez del campo et al 2010 the olive growing areas of argentina are located in a semi arid region of low annual rainfall 100 300 mm most of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer months in contrast to the winter rainfall pattern of the mediterranean and relatively high temperatures occur for much of the year due to the subtropical latitude 28 35 s of the region these two important environmental differences affect the orchard water balance the timing of phenological events such as flowering the vegetative growth patterns and the yield potential correa tedesco et al 2010 since the annual evaporative demand is high eto about 1500 mm annual average olive production must rely heavily on irrigation the irrigation water used in commercial farms comes mainly from aquifers the water being abstracted from 80 to 300 m deep is recharged mostly from the snowmelt of the andes however annual recharge is often less than the rate of water abstraction by agriculture there are already indications of groundwater overdraft in some areas evidenced by a decline in the water table auge et al 2006 miguel and gareis 2017 the lack of water use restrictions and the habit of farmers of overirrigating are creating a growing problem in the agriculture of these oases in argentina most of the commercial farms base the calculation of irrigation requirements on the fao method allen et al 1998 using crop coefficients kc for the olive that vary between 0 7 and 1 0 throughout the year leading to applications between 1000 and 1500 mm year 1 correa tedesco et al 2010 gómez del campo et al 2010 these high irrigation levels are possible because of the low energy costs of water abstraction rousseaux et al 2008 a recent sharp increase in energy costs acovi 2018 capece et al 2018 which directly impacts irrigation water costs has significantly affected the profitability of olive irrigation and may be threatening in the future even though the olive has been grown under rainfed conditions in the mediterranean basin for many centuries its positive response to irrigation was documented long ago ben gal et al 2011 orgaz et al 2017 olive water requirements have been studied in different environments goldhamer et al 1993 estimated a yearly kc value of 0 75 for obtaining maximum fruit yields in mature manzanillo olive trees in california usa when analyzing yield response to eight different irrigation levels kc 0 16 0 85 while other authors have found similar average kc values from 0 6 to 0 8 in the mediterranean basin girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 villalobos et al 2000 indicated that olive kc s were not constant throughout the year being lower during the summer period of high vapor pressure deficits vpd furthermore it appears that a reduction in the water supply during the summer period has less impact on yield than in other seasons thus reducing irrigation amounts alegre et al 2002 vita serman et al 2011 capraro et al 2018 intensively managed olive orchards in new growing regions are characterized by moderate to high use of irrigation water and other inputs which may result in competition between the agricultural sector and other uses of higher priority such as municipal uses fereres et al 2011 in early stages of water management this natural resource was treated as a renewable one such as wind or solar radiation as water was regarded as a freely available a non economical good and therefore free of charge in many regions of the world mesa jurado et al 2010 assert that the lack of recognition of the economic value of water in the past has led to over exploitation and inefficient use of this resource with adverse effects on the environment in situations where agricultural production is limited by water rather than land the concept of water productivity wp becomes useful water productivity is defined as the ratio of production to water use where production may be defined as yield or value while water may be defined as that used or consumed et or only that applied through irrigation kijne et al 2003 when water availability decreases and or cost increases it is important to determine the marginal wp in economic terms which is defined as the return that the farmer would get for an additional unit of water used consumed fernández et al 2020 the aim of this work was to determine the yield response to variable water supply of a high density tall olive hedgerow orchard and to assess the economic water productivity of the olive growing in an environment where the water resource is extremely scarce such as the semi arid valleys of north western argentina 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year experiment was carried out between 2015 and 2018 in a commercial olive cv arbequina orchard located in cañada honda 32º 2 s 68º 32 w 620 m a s l san juan in northwest argentina the high density hedgerow was established in 2004 with rows oriented n s and tree spacing of 6 3 m 555 trees ha 1 the climate of the region is arid with an average annual rainfall of 190 mm that falls mostly in the summer months and with an average annual temperature of 18 5 c babelis et al 2013 the orchard soil has a sandy loam top layer 0 60 cm then a sandy layer 60 90 cm with gravel below the 90 cm depth maximum depth of the root system was found at 0 90 m daily meteorological data was recorded at an automated weather station located at about 200 m from experimental site in the hedgerow tree height was 4 4 m and ground cover was around 55 the individual canopy volume varied between 30 and 35 m3 tree 1 an estimate based on the assumption confirmed visually that the canopy structure of a tall hedgerow orchard has a rectangular prism shape the farmer carried out hedgerow pruning every 3 years comprising lateral branches using chainsaw and topping applied by machine with four rotating disks assembled on two rotating booms in winter manual pruning and topping set at 3 5 m height was made along july 2017 the mineral fertilization program consisted in the application of 135 kg ha 1 of n 75 kg ha 1 of p and 120 kg ha 1 of k twice september february in the last two growing seasons the fertilization was calculated on the basis of extractions of 9 g of n 8 g of k and 5 g of p per kg of harvested fruit considering an average yield of 15 000 kg of fruit ha 1 the fertilizers used were ammonium nitrate diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride applied manually mixed within the surface soil in all treatments instead of through fertigation to avoid differential fertilization caused by the number of drippers per plant 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design seven irrigation regimes were established which applied 120 t120 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 70 t70 60 t60 y 40 t40 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc as calculated below the t100 treatment was applied to restore 100 of the crop water requirements throughout the season crop evapotranspiration was calculated here as 1 etc eto kc kr eto is reference evapotranspiration calculated with penman monteith modified by fao allen et al 1998 kc was a seasonally constant crop coefficient kc 0 55 taking into account what was proposed by villalobos et al 2000 considering that winter rains are non existent in this region kr is an empirical coefficient to account for the level of crop cover and it was calculated as 2 crop cover 100 with a limit of kr 1 for cover fraction 50 fereres et al 1982 in the first two seasons the ground cover horizontal projection was 50 therefore kr 1 in the third season the ground cover was reduced after pruning to 49 therefore we used a kr 0 98 previous research in the same region and variety indicated that there was little or no effect of an irrigation deficit on fruit yield by reducing 20 irrigation below the calculated etc in the summer period december 15 to february 15 vita serman et al 2011 therefore in every treatment the calculated applied water was reduced by 20 during the two summer months olive trees were irrigated using 4 l h 1 emitters in a double drip line per hedgerow separated 2 m the distance between drippers for t100 was 1 14 m leading to an application rate of 0 87 mm h 1 ha 1 used in the orchard in the other treatments the same emitter was used changing the spacing along the drip line proportionally to get the pre established percentage of water for each treatment irrigation was carried out every 5 days as done by the farmer in which a deep irrigation was prioritized for a full filling of the soil profile effective rainfall for the spring summer period was calculated as part of the total water supply of the orchard following the method of gómez et al 2001 if the daily rainfall dr was 5 mm then effective rainfall was estimated daily as dr 0 60 whereas for greater rainfall amounts effective rainfall was estimated as dr 0 9 the experimental design followed a line source design pioneered by hanks et al 1976 and further refined by hanks et al 1980 for field crops this design created a sequential variable water application gradient with the treatments within the commercial olive orchard a homogeneous plot of 21 adjacent rows was selected with 24 trees per row twenty eight experimental plots four replicate plots per treatment were chosen which consisted of 3 rows 6 trees with the two central trees from the central row used for data collection 2 3 soil and plants measurements midday stem water potential ψstem was measured in two trees per replicate every 3 weeks on sunny days between 13 00 h and 14 30 h solar time using a scholander pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina sun exposed shoots tips of the current year with two pairs of fully expanded leaves were enclosed in a small bag of aluminum foil at least 60 min before measurements measurements were made the day before irrigation from november to may in the first season and from september to may in the following seasons soil water content swc was determined every 21 days and it was performed in two ways gravimetrically within the emitter zone where root density should be highest soil samples 200 g were taken from 0 to 0 3 m at 0 4 m north of the trunk in the middle of the wetted zone established between the two drip lines samples were taken in the 4 replicate plots changing every year the area observed to avoid soil disturbance soil samples were weighed and dried at 105 c to constant weight to calculate soil water content as 100 soil wet wt soil dry wt soil dry wt in order to assess the swc distribution and its dynamics within the root zone access tubes of 0 9 m long were placed at 40 cm under the drip line 80 cm and 120 cm away from the tree line soil moisture was measured using a fdr type probe diviner sentek every 10 cm depth to obtain a gravimetric soil moisture value an in situ calibration procedure was carried out extracting soil samples close to the access tubes 15 cm between 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm of depth the gravimetric soil water content and the bulk density were measured on each soil sample in order to have an estimation of the volumetric soil water content mm at different depths swc measurements using fdr probe were conducted on one replicate and consequently data were analyzed graphically but not statistically fruit and olive oil yields were derived from fruit samples taken from central trees of each replicate plot on each year s harvesting day the total fruit weight was measured in three trees per replicate selected by homogeneity in the trunk diameter a representative sample of 1 kg of the harvested olives was taken in which the weight of 100 randomly selected fruits was determined to estimate the average fruit weight the fruit number was estimated as the ratio between the total weight of fruit per tree and the average fruit weight from the same sample the maturity index fruit moisture and oil content were obtained the wet and dry base oil content was measured by the soxhlet method described in frías et al 1999 which accounts for the potential amount of oil per tree but not the industrial oil yield the recorded fruit and oil yields together with the total ws to each treatment allowed us to calculate water productivity wp values as the amount of marketable product per hectare per unit of supplied water in this case ws may be considered close to actual etc kijne et al 2003 since water losses by drainage were avoided as indicated by the swc distribution the fruit and oil yield response to the amount of water supply was represented by a third degree polynomial function adjusted to the average results of the last two experimental years the oil yield was estimated as the product of fruit yield and the total oil content on a wet basis an agronomic model based on the production function must be integrated into an economic model linked to the profitability of the crop in this case the obtained fruit yield production function was used since most olive orchards in the area are of high density the economic model transforms harvest into profits for the farmer measured as net profit us ha net profits were obtained following mesa jurado et al 2010 for olive groves using the following expression 2 np p q kw w kf q hc fc avc where np net profit in us ha 1 p price of olive oil in us kg 1 here we used the average price received by olive growers in the years 2016 2017 2018

average is us 100 ha 1 it includes all structural costs of the farm pc average of production costs in us ha 1 this included the production costs with the exception of fertilization and harvest costs and it has been estimated as 1100 ha 1 for an average yield this is a simplification as the model considers ceteris paribus the rest of labor and materials inputs production costs were obtained from interviewing the farm manager which were checked with several coordinators from olive farm associations in the area 2 4 statistical analysis the effect of treatments on the variables measured over the course of the growing season ψstem swc and fruit yield components were analyzed using the anova procedure of statistic analitical sofware r and means were separated using the lsd test for a level of significance of α 0 05 to obtain the water productivity a third degree polynomial function was fitted to the average 4 replicates x 2 seasons of the treatments tested 3 results 3 1 seasonal conditions meteorological conditions in the experiment are shown in table 1 as it is characteristic in these andean valleys a typical continental climate was observed with the rainfall concentrated between november and april representing only a small fraction of reference evapotranspiration in contrast to other olive growing regions eto is particularly high in the winter months due to the low air humidity and occasionally high diurnal temperatures table 1 rainfall was higher than the long term average 190 mm for the south west of tulum valley babelis et al 2013 in 2015 16 and lower in the next two seasons monthly mean temperatures from september to may were similar in the three growing seasons 2015 16 19 0 c 2016 17 19 2 c and 2017 18 18 6 c frost events were most extreme during the winter of the 2017 reaching a minimum temperature of 9 c in 18 july fig 1 3 2 water applied seasonal applied irrigation ai and total water supply ws irrigation effective rainfall are reported in table 2 irrigation plus effective rainfall in t100 exceeded the calculated annual etc in the three years the ws was relatively higher in the first two seasons due to higher precipitation than usual in the first year and to higher applied irrigation on the second year needed to meet a higher etc table 2 calculated seasonal etc taking into account the 20 reduction in the kc during the two summer months was 676 mm 756 mm and 698 mm for the three years in t40 ws represented 71 55 and 52 of the calculated annual etc for the same respective years 3 3 soil water content and stem water potential the swc pattern at 0 0 3 m varied among seasons and treatments fig 2a c in the first year the experimental plot was irrigated by the farmer during winter and early spring before the beginning of the experiment so swc was high in all treatments fig 2a after january 84 days after bloom dab swc dropped in t60 and t40 from about 30 to 16 6 g g and 15 1 g g respectively and then differentiated from the rest of the treatments during fruit maturation in the second season although the swc recovered at the end of winter the differences among treatments appeared before flowering t70 t60 and t40 swc decreased significantly in all treatments from 17 dab in contrast with t100 and t120 which remained close to field capacity ca 24 5 g g but showing variations during the season associated with the irrigation events and rainfall during the spring summer time fig 2b in the 2017 18 season the soil in t70 t60 and t40 was not replenished by irrigation at the end of winter and the swc remained very low during the whole crop cycle reaching swc values in the summer below 10 g g in the t40 treatment fig 2c seasonal average swc showed in the last two seasons ranging between 24 4 and 11 4 g g in t120 and t40 respectively fig 2b c the soil moisture distribution on the root zone in t100 and t40 is presented in fig 3 under the t100 drip line the distribution of the swc in depth was similar during the three seasons fig 3a something related occurred at 120 cm away towards the inter file outside the wet bulb although only the first 30 cm contained moisture probably associated with spring summer rains in t40 the swc under the drip line decreased significantly during the first season and then stabilized in the following ones maintaining the soil moisture similar to that measured gravimetrically in the first 30 cm depth but consuming the water available at greater depth fig 3c after the first season the swc decreased to 10 mm below the 40 cm depth both below the drip line and 120 cm away towards the inter file showing a significant reduction in the volume of wet soil fig 3c and d related to what was observed with the distribution and evolution of water in the soil the stem water potential ψstem was highly responsive to irrigation regime fig 2d f more markedly in the last two years in the first season only in t40 and t60 trees the ψstem decreased below 2 mpa since january 80 dab differing from the control treatment t100 and remaining around 2 5 mpa until harvest the rest of the treatments did not have a ψstem different from that of the control and after harvesting all the treatments presented a slight recovery of water status fig 2d ψstem of t60 y t40 trees in 2016 17 dropped sharply after the end of september before bloom fig 2e in agreement with the reduced ai table 2 and the decreasing swc values recorded fig 2b reaching a minimum of 3 2 and 4 0 mpa respectively the seasonal ψstem in t70 t60 y t40 was also significantly lower than the control a similar ψstem drop occurred along the third season in the deficit treatments reaching 4 8 mpa in t40 fig 2f in 2016 17 and 2017 18 the t40 and t60 trees showed fruit shrivel leaf rolling and reductions in leaf angles with the stem all visual symptoms of severe water stress fernández et al 2013 from ca 120 dab to harvest ca 230 dab in the second and third season it was also observed a drop in the ψstem of t100 t90 and t80 along summer when compared with t120 which should be related to the 20 ai reduction in this period see section 2 2 a prompt recovery in tree water status was observed at the end of the deficit period in summer having similar ψstem values in all treatments fig 2e and f 3 4 fruit and oil yield and yield components oil production per hectare estimated measuring the total amount of oil into the fruit by the soxhlet method differed among the three seasons and clearly responded to the amount of irrigation applied in the last two seasons fig 4 there was much less of a response in the first season due to the fact that fruiting positions were determined the year before and thus were not affected by the differential irrigation treatments additionally the soil profile had some residual subsoil moisture from the previous year fig 2a there was a slight decrease in fruit yield only on t70 t60 and t40 trees which was related to lower fruit weight but not to fruit number per tree table 3 the second season exhibited significant treatment differences in fruit yield related to both number of fruits and fruit size table 3 both impacting on oil yield fig 4 the following season 2017 18 was a low yielding year a consequence of the alternate bearing behavior of the olive lavee 2007 but the tendency for yields to decline as applied water was reduced was there with no yield harvested in t40 fig 4 fruit oil content expressed as of the oil in the fruit was variable among seasons and treatments table 3 and no clear trend was found data not shown 3 5 yield response to water the relation between yield and water supply ws is represented in fig 5 this water production function was constructed only with data from the 2016 17 to 2017 18 seasons representing a pair of years after a first experimental year that was considered transitional in this first year even though the different irrigation treatments were established they had limited impact on yield due to the past history of the farm irrigation program which had irrigated uniformly all the differential treatments up to the establishment of the experiment a third degree polynomial function was fitted to treatment averages obtaining an r2 0 99 the maximum oil production ca 3080 kg ha 1 was obtained with 860 mm of ws although no differences in oil production were observed for ws between 910 mm and 715 mm as ws declined below 715 mm there was a sharp decrease in oil production with lower amounts of water the water productivity wp calculated as the ratio of yield to ws reached a value of 3 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 at maximum yield in contrast with a wp of 4 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 715 mm and then declined to 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 390 mm of ws fig 6 3 6 marginal water productivity and net profits to quantify water productivity levels as a function of ws using the third order polynomial expression that was fitted to the mean oil yield its derivative was calculated to obtain the marginal water productivity wpm and plotted as a function of ws fig 6 wpm reached a maximum value of 5 88 kg ha 1 mm 1 at ws level of 550 mm and declined thereafter reaching zero at 860 mm and becoming negative as ws increased as ws decreased below 550 mm wpm also diminished to a value of 4 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 at the lowest level of ws used in the experiment 392 mm fig 7 depicts the net profit np as a function of the ws for the period 2016 18 plotted marginal profit mp us ha 1 is the derivative of net profit estimated by eq 2 the np and mp were calculated considering both the current cost of m3 of irrigation water in this orchard us 0 04 m 3 and a relatively high cost us 0 24 m 3 similar to what is paid in some irrigation districts in andalusia spain in our case the np reached a maximum us 3140 ha 1 when the ws is 850 mm and the wpm is approaching zero fig 6 marginal profits reached a maximum value of us 1 06 m 3 at a ws of 550 mm although at that ws level the farmer would be earning only us 1082 ha 1 or 34 of maximum profit if we consider the hypothetical case of a water cost of us 0 24 m 3 the maximum np us 1476 ha 1 is reached at a ws of 820 mm with the np decreasing if ws increases beyond that point the highest mp is also obtained at 550 mm ws but at a negative np fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water status response to water supply midday ψstem has been reported to be a sensitive indicator of water stress in olive moriana and fereres 2002 ben gal et al 2010 in control t100 trees irrigation and rainfall replaced around 60 of calculated eto or over 100 of calculated etc and the averages of the ψstem were 1 68 mpa during spring autumn and 2 05 mpa during summer december 15 to february 15 it is interesting to note that the ψstem of the control was maintained between 1 2 and 1 7 mpa until the end of spring and during the fall similar results observed by moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 and trentacoste et al 2019 under non water stress conditions in intensive olive orchards the exception was the summer period when the applied irrigation amount was reduced by 20 of the etc and the ψstem decrease below 1 7 mpa differing from t120 and reaching the mild water stress thresholds for olive hedgerows proposed by fernández et al 2011 the sharp drop in ψstem in the most stressed treatments t40 t60 and t70 during the second and third season was associated with the decrease in swc both in terms of quantity fig 2b and c and distribution of water in the soil fig 3 a similar decrease in soil available water was observed by fernández et al 2013 when a severe di 30 of etc was applied to cv arbequina on a shd continuous hedgerow where they reached comparable ψstem values to the 3 2 and 4 8 mpa reached in our experiment trentacoste et al 2019 found similar results after establishing a water deficit of 30 and 50 of the etc reducing the swc average to 43 and 16 respectively relative to a control 75 etc in our experiment the swc was reduced by an average of 8 2 for each 10 reduction of etc calculated among t40 and t100 and as in that case this reduction determined a decline in ψstem since the objective of this experiment was to subject a sustained deficit irrigation strategy to a hd olive orchard in all those cases in which the ws was less than 100 of the etc there was a fall in the ψstem as the season progressed as it has been observed in other reports goldhamer et al 1993 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 ben gal et al 2011 once the summer period where an extra reduction 20 of ai was applied a slight recovery of water status was observed a situation widely documented when rdi strategies were implemented both in argentina puertas 2009 vita serman et al 2011 and in other olive growing regions of different climatic conditions alegre et al 2002 tognetti et al 2005 ahumada orellana et al 2017 4 2 crop performance the reduction in ws resulted in less fruit and oil yield which was consistent with previously observed in olive orchards in different countries girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 and in other fruit crops holzapfel et al 2000 garcía tejero et al 2012 vera et al 2013 goldhamer and fereres 2016 in the first season there was only a slight decrease in yield in t70 t60 and t40 trees which was related to lower fruit weight but not to fruit number per tree table 3 which is explained by the lack of water stress until fruit set fig 2d but not from mid summer and onwards rapoport et al 2004 after the first year of transition to the differential ws regime the next two growing seasons exhibited a clear response to the decline in ws with a reduction in fruit yield related to both number of fruits and fruit size which impacted on oil yield table 3 nevertheless results show a greater impact of reduced irrigation on fresh fruit yield than on oil yield in agreement with other reports in olive lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 an interesting result is the stronger response to irrigation level in the on year as indicated by the higher slope in the relation between yield and ws fig 4 this response has previously reported in ben gal et al 2011 and latter on in bustan et al 2016 who investigated the relations between fruit load and water consumption of the olive the wp of ca 20 kg of fresh fruits ha 1mm 1 recorded in our orchard data not shown was greater than those found in others hd olive orchards in argentina in a previous experiment in a 6 year old arbequina orchard with 833 trees ha 1 in san juan argentina wp was ca 13 5 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in a full irrigated and in a 40 di treatment along fruit development vita serman et al 2011 correa tedesco et al 2010 reported 16 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in a 7 year old manzanilla fina olive orchard in la rioja argentina with 317 trees ha 1 however there are reports in other olive growing areas of wp values of up to 30 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in fully irrigated hd and shd olive orchards tognetti et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 fernández et al 2013 4 3 water production function in this experiment there was an increase in fruit and oil yield as ws increased up to 860 mm ha 1 equivalent to an average kc 0 63 goldhamer et al 1993 reported a similar response in manzanilla olive trees in califonia usa when they analyzed eight irrigation levels kc 0 16 0 85 and but they determined a yearly kc value of 0 75 for maximum fruit yields after that many reports have shown a positive response to ws finding similar optimum yearly kc values between 0 5 and 0 7 in different olive regions girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 correa tedesco et al 2010 in a mature orchard in spain moriana et al 2003 determined the relation between fruit an oil yields and tree etc in low etc treatments ca 500 mm yields were similar to those obtain in our orchard ca 1100 kg ha 1 but they differed strongly at maximum etc ca 800 mm where they obtain about 1800 kg ha 1 against our ca 3000 kg ha 1 fig 5 one probable reason for the higher yields here is our tree density which was twice that of moriana et al 2003 555 vs 278 trees ha 1 and a canopy volume of ca 22 000 m3 ha 1 the other difference between the production function and that of moriana et al 2003 is the steeper decline in yield as ws declined fig 5 this is probably due to climatic differences between the two locations while in a mediterranean climate there are smooth transitions between seasons in northern argentina there are sudden episodes of high temperatures and winds during winter and spring seasons gómez del campo et al 2010 such sudden episodes of very high water demand would have a more negative impact on performance if the trees are subjected to water deficits as in t40 and t60 a non linear response of olive yield to et deficits was first found by moriana et al 2003 indicating that wp was not constant varying linearly from 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 at low etc to 0 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 at maximum etc a similar relation has been recently reported in israel by ben gal et al 2021 using different deficit irrigation treatments in the barnea cultivar in our case as we fitted a third degree polynomial function to the yield response to ws data the wp followed a second degree polynomial with a maximum value in the range of 500 550 mm ws of about 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 then decreasing on both sides of that level of ws and becoming negative below 860 mm of ws fig 6 the very low ws in our t40 trees 29 of yearly eto has undoubtedly severely affected fruit yield and wp a situation rarely achieved even in rain fed treatments on the other hand some authors found in hd orchards wp of ca 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in fully irrigated treatments tognetti et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 values which are very similar to the average wp observed in this experiment throughout the ws range fig 6 grattan et al 2006 conducted a two year experiment in a young shd california orchard and also described non linear yield responses to applied irrigation with both fruit and oil yield decreasing dramatically at low irrigation doses but then reaching a plateau with higher irrigation levels girona et al 2002 has indicated that kc values of 0 85 and greater may lead to yield reductions due to anoxia in fine textured soils 4 4 marginal water productivity and net profits the wpm increased up to a maximum of 550 mm a value that may be considered a technical wp optimum for the water input after that wpm decreased until becoming null at a ws of 860 mm olive oil production responded to increases in ws positively but at decreasing amounts as ws increases debertin 2012 as it was found previously in olive field experiments moriana et al 2003 mesa jurado et al 2010 and in other fruit trees mccarthy et al 2002 geerts and raes 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2016 fig 6 shows that even though the marginal increase in production declines with increases in ws total production is also higher as long as such an increase in production also rises the profit the income being higher than the costs the grower would aim at reaching maximum yields where wpm 0 if we look at the results in terms of np and mp functions fig 7 the grower achieves maximum returns us 3140 ha 1 at 850 mm of ws so we can conclude that for an olive grower in argentina who sell the olive oil in a competitive market where he s a price taker ca us 1 9 kg 1 it is desirable from the standpoint of the farmer to intensify production up to such maximum where the marginal income is equal to the marginal cost mp 0 fig 7 if we hypothesize that the cost of water would increase from us 0 04 m 3 to us 0 24 m 3 the impact on profits would be very high up to 53 less maximum profit of us 1476 ha 1 however given the structure of production costs and the shape of the response function of fig 6 such a maximum is achieved at a similar ws level than that at the current cost of water 820 mm fig 7 these results may be related to the particularly high wp obtained in this experiment ca 20 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 as compared to other results in northwest of argentina correa tedesco et al 2010 vita serman et al 2011 trentacoste et al 2019 and also to the low impact of the current price of water on total operating costs extrapolation of our results to other olive growing areas must be done with caution taking into account the empirical nature of the production function determined in this research in the context of the growing worldwide concern about water resource use efficiency in agricultural systems fereres and soriano 2007 fereres et al 2011 it should be noted that maximum profits are obtained at a ws much higher than that giving maximum wpm these results suggest that if irrigation water availability is limited in the future the growers might have to give up some of their profits if they are required to operate at a higher wpm range this may happen where water is a scarce resource and or there is ground water overdraft and at the same time large scale development of high density olive orchards is being planned several authors garrido et al 2010 pellegrini et al 2016 souissi et al 2019 have highlighted the importance of incorporating sustainability criteria for the design of public policies in arid and semi arid regions where olive is often cultivated thus the multiple dimensions of the problem economic environmental social and agronomic imply the need to plan complementary instruments that involve productive and industrial technological environmental and social policies for the construction of a comprehensive water policy the experimental data quantifies the relation between production and water use and shows that olive yield and net profits are maximized at high irrigation levels of over 700 mm if in the near future water scarcity or the unsustainable groundwater exploitation in the region makes it difficult to maintain the present irrigation levels aimed at maximizing profits there will be the need to impose irrigation restrictions through resource conservation policies to reach an equilibrium between economic environmental and sustainability goals declaration of

10072,olive cultivation in argentina has experienced an important expansion based on large scale development of high density hd olive orchards intensification has led to yield increases but because of the high annual eto and low rainfall olive production must rely heavily on irrigation the aim of this work was to determine the yield response to variable water supply of a hd tall olive orchard and to assess the economic water productivity wp of the olive growing in an environment where the water resource is extremely scarce during three seasons in an olive orchard cv arbequina we evaluated seven irrigation regimes which supplied 120 t120 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 70 t70 60 t60 y 40 t40 of the estimated etc after the first year which was considered of transition the next two growing seasons exhibited a clear decline in yield in response to the irrigation decline with the reduction in fruit yield related to both fruit numbers and fruit size a third degree polynomial function was fitted to treatment averages r2 0 99 the maximum oil production ca 3080 kg oil ha 1 was obtained with 860 mm of irrigation the marginal wp reached a maximum 5 9 kg oil ha 1 mm 1 at 550 mm of irrigation and declined thereafter reaching zero at 860 mm in economic terms the grower achieves maximum returns us 3140 ha 1 at 850 mm of irrigation with the cost of water increasing from the present us 0 04 m 3 to us 0 24 m 3 the maximum net profit would be reduced by up to 53 us 1476 ha 1 however it would be achieved at a similar irrigation level 820 mm if in the near future water scarcity in the region makes it difficult to maintain the present levels of water supply aimed at maximizing profits there will be the need to impose restrictions through resource conservation policies to reach an equilibrium between economic environmental and sustainability goals keywords deficit irrigation water status oil yield production function marginal profit 1 introduction from the beginning of the 1990 s olive cultivation in argentina experienced an important expansion from 30 to 90 thousand ha based on production intensification given the option of irrigation the new olive groves increased their planting density over traditional recommendations leading to a large scale development of high density hd olive orchards 250 800 tree ha 1 that were mechanically harvested vita serman and matías 2013 these hd plantations formed tall continuous hedgerows of 4 5 m height under high vigor conditions for which side by side trunk shakers and straddle harvesters were developed connor et al 2014 these hd orchards represent nowadays more than 70 of the argentine olive area and even more in other countries where olive production expanded recently such as australia ravetti 2008 gomez riera and vita serman 2014 in other world areas such as spain production intensification was carried out by increasing tree density including super high density shd plantations of more than 1000 trees ha 1 pastor et al 2007 connor et al 2014 most of the new commercial plantations in argentina are drip irrigated intensively managed and relatively large 100 1500 ha puertas 2009 vita serman and matías 2013 production intensification in argentina along the lines described above has led to yield increases doubling what was achieved in conventional plantations gómez del campo et al 2010 the olive growing areas of argentina are located in a semi arid region of low annual rainfall 100 300 mm most of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer months in contrast to the winter rainfall pattern of the mediterranean and relatively high temperatures occur for much of the year due to the subtropical latitude 28 35 s of the region these two important environmental differences affect the orchard water balance the timing of phenological events such as flowering the vegetative growth patterns and the yield potential correa tedesco et al 2010 since the annual evaporative demand is high eto about 1500 mm annual average olive production must rely heavily on irrigation the irrigation water used in commercial farms comes mainly from aquifers the water being abstracted from 80 to 300 m deep is recharged mostly from the snowmelt of the andes however annual recharge is often less than the rate of water abstraction by agriculture there are already indications of groundwater overdraft in some areas evidenced by a decline in the water table auge et al 2006 miguel and gareis 2017 the lack of water use restrictions and the habit of farmers of overirrigating are creating a growing problem in the agriculture of these oases in argentina most of the commercial farms base the calculation of irrigation requirements on the fao method allen et al 1998 using crop coefficients kc for the olive that vary between 0 7 and 1 0 throughout the year leading to applications between 1000 and 1500 mm year 1 correa tedesco et al 2010 gómez del campo et al 2010 these high irrigation levels are possible because of the low energy costs of water abstraction rousseaux et al 2008 a recent sharp increase in energy costs acovi 2018 capece et al 2018 which directly impacts irrigation water costs has significantly affected the profitability of olive irrigation and may be threatening in the future even though the olive has been grown under rainfed conditions in the mediterranean basin for many centuries its positive response to irrigation was documented long ago ben gal et al 2011 orgaz et al 2017 olive water requirements have been studied in different environments goldhamer et al 1993 estimated a yearly kc value of 0 75 for obtaining maximum fruit yields in mature manzanillo olive trees in california usa when analyzing yield response to eight different irrigation levels kc 0 16 0 85 while other authors have found similar average kc values from 0 6 to 0 8 in the mediterranean basin girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 villalobos et al 2000 indicated that olive kc s were not constant throughout the year being lower during the summer period of high vapor pressure deficits vpd furthermore it appears that a reduction in the water supply during the summer period has less impact on yield than in other seasons thus reducing irrigation amounts alegre et al 2002 vita serman et al 2011 capraro et al 2018 intensively managed olive orchards in new growing regions are characterized by moderate to high use of irrigation water and other inputs which may result in competition between the agricultural sector and other uses of higher priority such as municipal uses fereres et al 2011 in early stages of water management this natural resource was treated as a renewable one such as wind or solar radiation as water was regarded as a freely available a non economical good and therefore free of charge in many regions of the world mesa jurado et al 2010 assert that the lack of recognition of the economic value of water in the past has led to over exploitation and inefficient use of this resource with adverse effects on the environment in situations where agricultural production is limited by water rather than land the concept of water productivity wp becomes useful water productivity is defined as the ratio of production to water use where production may be defined as yield or value while water may be defined as that used or consumed et or only that applied through irrigation kijne et al 2003 when water availability decreases and or cost increases it is important to determine the marginal wp in economic terms which is defined as the return that the farmer would get for an additional unit of water used consumed fernández et al 2020 the aim of this work was to determine the yield response to variable water supply of a high density tall olive hedgerow orchard and to assess the economic water productivity of the olive growing in an environment where the water resource is extremely scarce such as the semi arid valleys of north western argentina 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year experiment was carried out between 2015 and 2018 in a commercial olive cv arbequina orchard located in cañada honda 32º 2 s 68º 32 w 620 m a s l san juan in northwest argentina the high density hedgerow was established in 2004 with rows oriented n s and tree spacing of 6 3 m 555 trees ha 1 the climate of the region is arid with an average annual rainfall of 190 mm that falls mostly in the summer months and with an average annual temperature of 18 5 c babelis et al 2013 the orchard soil has a sandy loam top layer 0 60 cm then a sandy layer 60 90 cm with gravel below the 90 cm depth maximum depth of the root system was found at 0 90 m daily meteorological data was recorded at an automated weather station located at about 200 m from experimental site in the hedgerow tree height was 4 4 m and ground cover was around 55 the individual canopy volume varied between 30 and 35 m3 tree 1 an estimate based on the assumption confirmed visually that the canopy structure of a tall hedgerow orchard has a rectangular prism shape the farmer carried out hedgerow pruning every 3 years comprising lateral branches using chainsaw and topping applied by machine with four rotating disks assembled on two rotating booms in winter manual pruning and topping set at 3 5 m height was made along july 2017 the mineral fertilization program consisted in the application of 135 kg ha 1 of n 75 kg ha 1 of p and 120 kg ha 1 of k twice september february in the last two growing seasons the fertilization was calculated on the basis of extractions of 9 g of n 8 g of k and 5 g of p per kg of harvested fruit considering an average yield of 15 000 kg of fruit ha 1 the fertilizers used were ammonium nitrate diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride applied manually mixed within the surface soil in all treatments instead of through fertigation to avoid differential fertilization caused by the number of drippers per plant 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design seven irrigation regimes were established which applied 120 t120 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 70 t70 60 t60 y 40 t40 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc as calculated below the t100 treatment was applied to restore 100 of the crop water requirements throughout the season crop evapotranspiration was calculated here as 1 etc eto kc kr eto is reference evapotranspiration calculated with penman monteith modified by fao allen et al 1998 kc was a seasonally constant crop coefficient kc 0 55 taking into account what was proposed by villalobos et al 2000 considering that winter rains are non existent in this region kr is an empirical coefficient to account for the level of crop cover and it was calculated as 2 crop cover 100 with a limit of kr 1 for cover fraction 50 fereres et al 1982 in the first two seasons the ground cover horizontal projection was 50 therefore kr 1 in the third season the ground cover was reduced after pruning to 49 therefore we used a kr 0 98 previous research in the same region and variety indicated that there was little or no effect of an irrigation deficit on fruit yield by reducing 20 irrigation below the calculated etc in the summer period december 15 to february 15 vita serman et al 2011 therefore in every treatment the calculated applied water was reduced by 20 during the two summer months olive trees were irrigated using 4 l h 1 emitters in a double drip line per hedgerow separated 2 m the distance between drippers for t100 was 1 14 m leading to an application rate of 0 87 mm h 1 ha 1 used in the orchard in the other treatments the same emitter was used changing the spacing along the drip line proportionally to get the pre established percentage of water for each treatment irrigation was carried out every 5 days as done by the farmer in which a deep irrigation was prioritized for a full filling of the soil profile effective rainfall for the spring summer period was calculated as part of the total water supply of the orchard following the method of gómez et al 2001 if the daily rainfall dr was 5 mm then effective rainfall was estimated daily as dr 0 60 whereas for greater rainfall amounts effective rainfall was estimated as dr 0 9 the experimental design followed a line source design pioneered by hanks et al 1976 and further refined by hanks et al 1980 for field crops this design created a sequential variable water application gradient with the treatments within the commercial olive orchard a homogeneous plot of 21 adjacent rows was selected with 24 trees per row twenty eight experimental plots four replicate plots per treatment were chosen which consisted of 3 rows 6 trees with the two central trees from the central row used for data collection 2 3 soil and plants measurements midday stem water potential ψstem was measured in two trees per replicate every 3 weeks on sunny days between 13 00 h and 14 30 h solar time using a scholander pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina sun exposed shoots tips of the current year with two pairs of fully expanded leaves were enclosed in a small bag of aluminum foil at least 60 min before measurements measurements were made the day before irrigation from november to may in the first season and from september to may in the following seasons soil water content swc was determined every 21 days and it was performed in two ways gravimetrically within the emitter zone where root density should be highest soil samples 200 g were taken from 0 to 0 3 m at 0 4 m north of the trunk in the middle of the wetted zone established between the two drip lines samples were taken in the 4 replicate plots changing every year the area observed to avoid soil disturbance soil samples were weighed and dried at 105 c to constant weight to calculate soil water content as 100 soil wet wt soil dry wt soil dry wt in order to assess the swc distribution and its dynamics within the root zone access tubes of 0 9 m long were placed at 40 cm under the drip line 80 cm and 120 cm away from the tree line soil moisture was measured using a fdr type probe diviner sentek every 10 cm depth to obtain a gravimetric soil moisture value an in situ calibration procedure was carried out extracting soil samples close to the access tubes 15 cm between 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm of depth the gravimetric soil water content and the bulk density were measured on each soil sample in order to have an estimation of the volumetric soil water content mm at different depths swc measurements using fdr probe were conducted on one replicate and consequently data were analyzed graphically but not statistically fruit and olive oil yields were derived from fruit samples taken from central trees of each replicate plot on each year s harvesting day the total fruit weight was measured in three trees per replicate selected by homogeneity in the trunk diameter a representative sample of 1 kg of the harvested olives was taken in which the weight of 100 randomly selected fruits was determined to estimate the average fruit weight the fruit number was estimated as the ratio between the total weight of fruit per tree and the average fruit weight from the same sample the maturity index fruit moisture and oil content were obtained the wet and dry base oil content was measured by the soxhlet method described in frías et al 1999 which accounts for the potential amount of oil per tree but not the industrial oil yield the recorded fruit and oil yields together with the total ws to each treatment allowed us to calculate water productivity wp values as the amount of marketable product per hectare per unit of supplied water in this case ws may be considered close to actual etc kijne et al 2003 since water losses by drainage were avoided as indicated by the swc distribution the fruit and oil yield response to the amount of water supply was represented by a third degree polynomial function adjusted to the average results of the last two experimental years the oil yield was estimated as the product of fruit yield and the total oil content on a wet basis an agronomic model based on the production function must be integrated into an economic model linked to the profitability of the crop in this case the obtained fruit yield production function was used since most olive orchards in the area are of high density the economic model transforms harvest into profits for the farmer measured as net profit us ha net profits were obtained following mesa jurado et al 2010 for olive groves using the following expression 2 np p q kw w kf q hc fc avc where np net profit in us ha 1 p price of olive oil in us kg 1 here we used the average price received by olive growers in the years 2016 2017 2018 equivalent to us 1 90 kg 1 data provided by the argentina olive federation foa kw variable costs of irrigation computed based on energy costs us per kwh pumping depth and power installed given the

using the average cost of local fertilizers the cost was us 0 035 kg 1 of harvested olives calculated on the basis of extractions of 9 g of n 8 g of k and 5 g of p per kg of harvested fruit hc harvest costs we considered the same for all treatments us 1200 ha 1 as mechanical harvest is carried out in all cases irrespective of expected yields fc fixed operating costs in us ha 1 for our case the average is us 100 ha 1 it includes all structural costs of the farm pc average of production costs in us ha 1 this included the production costs with the exception of fertilization and harvest costs and it has been estimated as 1100 ha 1 for an average yield this is a simplification as the model considers ceteris paribus the rest of labor and materials inputs production costs were obtained from interviewing the farm manager which were checked with several coordinators from olive farm associations in the area 2 4 statistical analysis the effect of treatments on the variables measured over the course of the growing season ψstem swc and fruit yield components were analyzed using the anova procedure of statistic analitical sofware r and means were separated using the lsd test for a level of significance of α 0 05 to obtain the water productivity a third degree polynomial function was fitted to the average 4 replicates x 2 seasons of the treatments tested 3 results 3 1 seasonal conditions meteorological conditions in the experiment are shown in table 1 as it is characteristic in these andean valleys a typical continental climate was observed with the rainfall concentrated between november and april representing only a small fraction of reference evapotranspiration in contrast to other olive growing regions eto is particularly high in the winter months due to the low air humidity and occasionally high diurnal temperatures table 1 rainfall was higher than the long term average 190 mm for the south west of tulum valley babelis et al 2013 in 2015 16 and lower in the next two seasons monthly mean temperatures from september to may were similar in the three growing seasons 2015 16 19 0 c 2016 17 19 2 c and 2017 18 18 6 c frost events were most extreme during the winter of the 2017 reaching a minimum temperature of 9 c in 18 july fig 1 3 2 water applied seasonal applied irrigation ai and total water supply ws irrigation effective rainfall are reported in table 2 irrigation plus effective rainfall in t100 exceeded the calculated annual etc in the three years the ws was relatively higher in the first two seasons due to higher precipitation than usual in the first year and to higher applied irrigation on the second year needed to meet a higher etc table 2 calculated seasonal etc taking into account the 20 reduction in the kc during the two summer months was 676 mm 756 mm and 698 mm for the three years in t40 ws represented 71 55 and 52 of the calculated annual etc for the same respective years 3 3 soil water content and stem water potential the swc pattern at 0 0 3 m varied among seasons and treatments fig 2a c in the first year the experimental plot was irrigated by the farmer during winter and early spring before the beginning of the experiment so swc was high in all treatments fig 2a after january 84 days after bloom dab swc dropped in t60 and t40 from about 30 to 16 6 g g and 15 1 g g respectively and then differentiated from the rest of the treatments during fruit maturation in the second season although the swc recovered at the end of winter the differences among treatments appeared before flowering t70 t60 and t40 swc decreased significantly in all treatments from 17 dab in contrast with t100 and t120 which remained close to field capacity ca 24 5 g g but showing variations during the season associated with the irrigation events and rainfall during the spring summer time fig 2b in the 2017 18 season the soil in t70 t60 and t40 was not replenished by irrigation at the end of winter and the swc remained very low during the whole crop cycle reaching swc values in the summer below 10 g g in the t40 treatment fig 2c seasonal average swc showed in the last two seasons ranging between 24 4 and 11 4 g g in t120 and t40 respectively fig 2b c the soil moisture distribution on the root zone in t100 and t40 is presented in fig 3 under the t100 drip line the distribution of the swc in depth was similar during the three seasons fig 3a something related occurred at 120 cm away towards the inter file outside the wet bulb although only the first 30 cm contained moisture probably associated with spring summer rains in t40 the swc under the drip line decreased significantly during the first season and then stabilized in the following ones maintaining the soil moisture similar to that measured gravimetrically in the first 30 cm depth but consuming the water available at greater depth fig 3c after the first season the swc decreased to 10 mm below the 40 cm depth both below the drip line and 120 cm away towards the inter file showing a significant reduction in the volume of wet soil fig 3c and d related to what was observed with the distribution and evolution of water in the soil the stem water potential ψstem was highly responsive to irrigation regime fig 2d f more markedly in the last two years in the first season only in t40 and t60 trees the ψstem decreased below 2 mpa since january 80 dab differing from the control treatment t100 and remaining around 2 5 mpa until harvest the rest of the treatments did not have a ψstem different from that of the control and after harvesting all the treatments presented a slight recovery of water status fig 2d ψstem of t60 y t40 trees in 2016 17 dropped sharply after the end of september before bloom fig 2e in agreement with the reduced ai table 2 and the decreasing swc values recorded fig 2b reaching a minimum of 3 2 and 4 0 mpa respectively the seasonal ψstem in t70 t60 y t40 was also significantly lower than the control a similar ψstem drop occurred along the third season in the deficit treatments reaching 4 8 mpa in t40 fig 2f in 2016 17 and 2017 18 the t40 and t60 trees showed fruit shrivel leaf rolling and reductions in leaf angles with the stem all visual symptoms of severe water stress fernández et al 2013 from ca 120 dab to harvest ca 230 dab in the second and third season it was also observed a drop in the ψstem of t100 t90 and t80 along summer when compared with t120 which should be related to the 20 ai reduction in this period see section 2 2 a prompt recovery in tree water status was observed at the end of the deficit period in summer having similar ψstem values in all treatments fig 2e and f 3 4 fruit and oil yield and yield components oil production per hectare estimated measuring the total amount of oil into the fruit by the soxhlet method differed among the three seasons and clearly responded to the amount of irrigation applied in the last two seasons fig 4 there was much less of a response in the first season due to the fact that fruiting positions were determined the year before and thus were not affected by the differential irrigation treatments additionally the soil profile had some residual subsoil moisture from the previous year fig 2a there was a slight decrease in fruit yield only on t70 t60 and t40 trees which was related to lower fruit weight but not to fruit number per tree table 3 the second season exhibited significant treatment differences in fruit yield related to both number of fruits and fruit size table 3 both impacting on oil yield fig 4 the following season 2017 18 was a low yielding year a consequence of the alternate bearing behavior of the olive lavee 2007 but the tendency for yields to decline as applied water was reduced was there with no yield harvested in t40 fig 4 fruit oil content expressed as of the oil in the fruit was variable among seasons and treatments table 3 and no clear trend was found data not shown 3 5 yield response to water the relation between yield and water supply ws is represented in fig 5 this water production function was constructed only with data from the 2016 17 to 2017 18 seasons representing a pair of years after a first experimental year that was considered transitional in this first year even though the different irrigation treatments were established they had limited impact on yield due to the past history of the farm irrigation program which had irrigated uniformly all the differential treatments up to the establishment of the experiment a third degree polynomial function was fitted to treatment averages obtaining an r2 0 99 the maximum oil production ca 3080 kg ha 1 was obtained with 860 mm of ws although no differences in oil production were observed for ws between 910 mm and 715 mm as ws declined below 715 mm there was a sharp decrease in oil production with lower amounts of water the water productivity wp calculated as the ratio of yield to ws reached a value of 3 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 at maximum yield in contrast with a wp of 4 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 715 mm and then declined to 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 390 mm of ws fig 6 3 6 marginal water productivity and net profits to quantify water productivity levels as a function of ws using the third order polynomial expression that was fitted to the mean oil yield its derivative was calculated to obtain the marginal water productivity wpm and plotted as a function of ws fig 6 wpm reached a maximum value of 5 88 kg ha 1 mm 1 at ws level of 550 mm and declined thereafter reaching zero at 860 mm and becoming negative as ws increased as ws decreased below 550 mm wpm also diminished to a value of 4 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 at the lowest level of ws used in the experiment 392 mm fig 7 depicts the net profit np as a function of the ws for the period 2016 18 plotted marginal profit mp us ha 1 is the derivative of net profit estimated by eq 2 the np and mp were calculated considering both the current cost of m3 of irrigation water in this orchard us 0 04 m 3 and a relatively high cost us 0 24 m 3 similar to what is paid in some irrigation districts in andalusia spain in our case the np reached a maximum us 3140 ha 1 when the ws is 850 mm and the wpm is approaching zero fig 6 marginal profits reached a maximum value of us 1 06 m 3 at a ws of 550 mm although at that ws level the farmer would be earning only us 1082 ha 1 or 34 of maximum profit if we consider the hypothetical case of a water cost of us 0 24 m 3 the maximum np us 1476 ha 1 is reached at a ws of 820 mm with the np decreasing if ws increases beyond that point the highest mp is also obtained at 550 mm ws but at a negative np fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water status response to water supply midday ψstem has been reported to be a sensitive indicator of water stress in olive moriana and fereres 2002 ben gal et al 2010 in control t100 trees irrigation and rainfall replaced around 60 of calculated eto or over 100 of calculated etc and the averages of the ψstem were 1 68 mpa during spring autumn and 2 05 mpa during summer december 15 to february 15 it is interesting to note that the ψstem of the control was maintained between 1 2 and 1 7 mpa until the end of spring and during the fall similar results observed by moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 and trentacoste et al 2019 under non water stress conditions in intensive olive orchards the exception was the summer period when the applied irrigation amount was reduced by 20 of the etc and the ψstem decrease below 1 7 mpa differing from t120 and reaching the mild water stress thresholds for olive hedgerows proposed by fernández et al 2011 the sharp drop in ψstem in the most stressed treatments t40 t60 and t70 during the second and third season was associated with the decrease in swc both in terms of quantity fig 2b and c and distribution of water in the soil fig 3 a similar decrease in soil available water was observed by fernández et al 2013 when a severe di 30 of etc was applied to cv arbequina on a shd continuous hedgerow where they reached comparable ψstem values to the 3 2 and 4 8 mpa reached in our experiment trentacoste et al 2019 found similar results after establishing a water deficit of 30 and 50 of the etc reducing the swc average to 43 and 16 respectively relative to a control 75 etc in our experiment the swc was reduced by an average of 8 2 for each 10 reduction of etc calculated among t40 and t100 and as in that case this reduction determined a decline in ψstem since the objective of this experiment was to subject a sustained deficit irrigation strategy to a hd olive orchard in all those cases in which the ws was less than 100 of the etc there was a fall in the ψstem as the season progressed as it has been observed in other reports goldhamer et al 1993 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 ben gal et al 2011 once the summer period where an extra reduction 20 of ai was applied a slight recovery of water status was observed a situation widely documented when rdi strategies were implemented both in argentina puertas 2009 vita serman et al 2011 and in other olive growing regions of different climatic conditions alegre et al 2002 tognetti et al 2005 ahumada orellana et al 2017 4 2 crop performance the reduction in ws resulted in less fruit and oil yield which was consistent with previously observed in olive orchards in different countries girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 and in other fruit crops holzapfel et al 2000 garcía tejero et al 2012 vera et al 2013 goldhamer and fereres 2016 in the first season there was only a slight decrease in yield in t70 t60 and t40 trees which was related to lower fruit weight but not to fruit number per tree table 3 which is explained by the lack of water stress until fruit set fig 2d but not from mid summer and onwards rapoport et al 2004 after the first year of transition to the differential ws regime the next two growing seasons exhibited a clear response to the decline in ws with a reduction in fruit yield related to both number of fruits and fruit size which impacted on oil yield table 3 nevertheless results show a greater impact of reduced irrigation on fresh fruit yield than on oil yield in agreement with other reports in olive lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 an interesting result is the stronger response to irrigation level in the on year as indicated by the higher slope in the relation between yield and ws fig 4 this response has previously reported in ben gal et al 2011 and latter on in bustan et al 2016 who investigated the relations between fruit load and water consumption of the olive the wp of ca 20 kg of fresh fruits ha 1mm 1 recorded in our orchard data not shown was greater than those found in others hd olive orchards in argentina in a previous experiment in a 6 year old arbequina orchard with 833 trees ha 1 in san juan argentina wp was ca 13 5 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in a full irrigated and in a 40 di treatment along fruit development vita serman et al 2011 correa tedesco et al 2010 reported 16 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in a 7 year old manzanilla fina olive orchard in la rioja argentina with 317 trees ha 1 however there are reports in other olive growing areas of wp values of up to 30 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 in fully irrigated hd and shd olive orchards tognetti et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 fernández et al 2013 4 3 water production function in this experiment there was an increase in fruit and oil yield as ws increased up to 860 mm ha 1 equivalent to an average kc 0 63 goldhamer et al 1993 reported a similar response in manzanilla olive trees in califonia usa when they analyzed eight irrigation levels kc 0 16 0 85 and but they determined a yearly kc value of 0 75 for maximum fruit yields after that many reports have shown a positive response to ws finding similar optimum yearly kc values between 0 5 and 0 7 in different olive regions girona et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 correa tedesco et al 2010 in a mature orchard in spain moriana et al 2003 determined the relation between fruit an oil yields and tree etc in low etc treatments ca 500 mm yields were similar to those obtain in our orchard ca 1100 kg ha 1 but they differed strongly at maximum etc ca 800 mm where they obtain about 1800 kg ha 1 against our ca 3000 kg ha 1 fig 5 one probable reason for the higher yields here is our tree density which was twice that of moriana et al 2003 555 vs 278 trees ha 1 and a canopy volume of ca 22 000 m3 ha 1 the other difference between the production function and that of moriana et al 2003 is the steeper decline in yield as ws declined fig 5 this is probably due to climatic differences between the two locations while in a mediterranean climate there are smooth transitions between seasons in northern argentina there are sudden episodes of high temperatures and winds during winter and spring seasons gómez del campo et al 2010 such sudden episodes of very high water demand would have a more negative impact on performance if the trees are subjected to water deficits as in t40 and t60 a non linear response of olive yield to et deficits was first found by moriana et al 2003 indicating that wp was not constant varying linearly from 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 at low etc to 0 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 at maximum etc a similar relation has been recently reported in israel by ben gal et al 2021 using different deficit irrigation treatments in the barnea cultivar in our case as we fitted a third degree polynomial function to the yield response to ws data the wp followed a second degree polynomial with a maximum value in the range of 500 550 mm ws of about 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 then decreasing on both sides of that level of ws and becoming negative below 860 mm of ws fig 6 the very low ws in our t40 trees 29 of yearly eto has undoubtedly severely affected fruit yield and wp a situation rarely achieved even in rain fed treatments on the other hand some authors found in hd orchards wp of ca 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in fully irrigated treatments tognetti et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 values which are very similar to the average wp observed in this experiment throughout the ws range fig 6 grattan et al 2006 conducted a two year experiment in a young shd california orchard and also described non linear yield responses to applied irrigation with both fruit and oil yield decreasing dramatically at low irrigation doses but then reaching a plateau with higher irrigation levels girona et al 2002 has indicated that kc values of 0 85 and greater may lead to yield reductions due to anoxia in fine textured soils 4 4 marginal water productivity and net profits the wpm increased up to a maximum of 550 mm a value that may be considered a technical wp optimum for the water input after that wpm decreased until becoming null at a ws of 860 mm olive oil production responded to increases in ws positively but at decreasing amounts as ws increases debertin 2012 as it was found previously in olive field experiments moriana et al 2003 mesa jurado et al 2010 and in other fruit trees mccarthy et al 2002 geerts and raes 2009 goldhamer and fereres 2016 fig 6 shows that even though the marginal increase in production declines with increases in ws total production is also higher as long as such an increase in production also rises the profit the income being higher than the costs the grower would aim at reaching maximum yields where wpm 0 if we look at the results in terms of np and mp functions fig 7 the grower achieves maximum returns us 3140 ha 1 at 850 mm of ws so we can conclude that for an olive grower in argentina who sell the olive oil in a competitive market where he s a price taker ca us 1 9 kg 1 it is desirable from the standpoint of the farmer to intensify production up to such maximum where the marginal income is equal to the marginal cost mp 0 fig 7 if we hypothesize that the cost of water would increase from us 0 04 m 3 to us 0 24 m 3 the impact on profits would be very high up to 53 less maximum profit of us 1476 ha 1 however given the structure of production costs and the shape of the response function of fig 6 such a maximum is achieved at a similar ws level than that at the current cost of water 820 mm fig 7 these results may be related to the particularly high wp obtained in this experiment ca 20 kg of fresh fruits ha 1 mm 1 as compared to other results in northwest of argentina correa tedesco et al 2010 vita serman et al 2011 trentacoste et al 2019 and also to the low impact of the current price of water on total operating costs extrapolation of our results to other olive growing areas must be done with caution taking into account the empirical nature of the production function determined in this research in the context of the growing worldwide concern about water resource use efficiency in agricultural systems fereres and soriano 2007 fereres et al 2011 it should be noted that maximum profits are obtained at a ws much higher than that giving maximum wpm these results suggest that if irrigation water availability is limited in the future the growers might have to give up some of their profits if they are required to operate at a higher wpm range this may happen where water is a scarce resource and or there is ground water overdraft and at the same time large scale development of high density olive orchards is being planned several authors garrido et al 2010 pellegrini et al 2016 souissi et al 2019 have highlighted the importance of incorporating sustainability criteria for the design of public policies in arid and semi arid regions where olive is often cultivated thus the multiple dimensions of the problem economic environmental social and agronomic imply the need to plan complementary instruments that involve productive and industrial technological environmental and social policies for the construction of a comprehensive water policy the experimental data quantifies the relation between production and water use and shows that olive yield and net profits are maximized at high irrigation levels of over 700 mm if in the near future water scarcity or the unsustainable groundwater exploitation in the region makes it difficult to maintain the present irrigation levels aimed at maximizing profits there will be the need to impose irrigation restrictions through resource conservation policies to reach an equilibrium between economic environmental and sustainability goals declaration of

10073,understanding the contributions of soil water evaporation e and crop transpiration t to evapotranspiration et is essential for irrigation management and improving crop water use efficiency current methods for partitioning et are subject to uncertainties due in part to the scale differences in determining e t and et in this study et of a lysimeter planted with maize zea mays l was partitioned into e and t using sensors that had compatible measurement scales e was measured with heat pulse sensors following the sensible heat balance shb and modified sensible heat balance mshb approaches and t was measured with sap flow gauges following the heat balance sap flow hbsf method the accuracy of the measurements was evaluated by comparing the sum of e and t values e t to weighing lysimeter et data during the study period e t and et had average values of 0 9 4 0 and 4 8 mm d 1 respectively and the fractions of e and t were 19 and 81 of e t respectively in general the e t values agreed well with the lysimeter et data but slight overestimations and underestimations were observed at relatively small and relatively large et rates respectively by combining the shb and mshb approaches and the hbsf method it is possible to partition et into e and t with satisfactory accuracy keywords evaporation transpiration evapotranspiration partitioning maize 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of soil water evaporation e and plant transpiration t is an important component of the hydrologic cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum lemordant et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in agricultural ecosystems the fractions of e and t in et are affected by soil and water management practices and they have been used as indicators of crop water use efficiency agam et

and kool et al 2014 to monitor et e and t continuously to partition et into e and t two of the three variables are usually measured and the third variable is estimated either as the sum or the difference of the measured values herbst et al 1996 thompson et al 1997 jara et al 1998 zeggaf et al 2008 the water balance and micro meteorological methods e g eddy covariance and bowen ratio energy

measure t balwinder singh et al 2011 obtained an e et value of 0 25 0 33 by using micro lysimeters to measure e and the water balance method to measure et in a wheat field due to the large differences in measurement scales among the eddy covariance method thousands of square meters bowen ratio method thousands of square meters and sap flow method a single plant uncertainties exist in the accuracy and resolution of et partitioning results in field studies micro lysimeters have been used frequently to measure e jara et al 1998 liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 wang and liu 2007 agam et al 2012 micro lysimeters are simple cost effective and are generally considered to provide reliable measures of e the micro lysimeter method however has the drawbacks of destructive sampling soil cores have to be changed frequently labor intensive soil samples need to be sealed at the bottom and weighed manually discontinuous fails to monitor e continuously or during irrigation or rain and lack of automatization kool et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 in addition micro lysimeters are usually installed in inter row areas between crop rows liu et al 2002 wang and liu 2007 agam et al 2012 therefore they ignore root water uptake and spatial variations due to the heterogeneity of solar radiation and soil water content in the field which may cause errors in et partitioning hupet and vanclooster 2005 recently the sensible heat balance shb method has been developed to measure e heitman et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2017a in this method soil sensible heat fluxes and changes in sensible heat storage in a soil layer are measured 1 g 1 g 2 δ s l e where g 1 and g 2 w m 2 are soil sensible heat fluxes at two depths δs w m 2 is the change of sensible heat storage between these two depths l j m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization and e m s 1 is the soil water evaporation rate the sensible heat terms g 1 g 2 and δs can be calculated by using heat pulse sensor measured soil temperature and thermal property data and e can be calculated with eq 1 compared to the micro lysimeter method the shb approach is able to measure real time subsurface e continuously additionally xiao et al 2014 developed a modified sensible heat balance mshb method eq 2 that detected e occurring between the soil surface and the first subsurface measurement depth by replacing g 1 with net radiation at the soil surface r n to identify surface e under a crop canopy under wet conditions 2 r n g 2 δ s l e xiao et al 2016 monitored e and t dynamics in a fully developed maize field by measuring e with the shb and mshb methods and t with sap flow sensors and compared the summed values with et measured with the eddy covariance method the results showed that e et ranged from 3 to 39 and t et ranged from 61 to 97 differences between eddy covariance et and e t were due mainly to scale variations among the methods and to plant growth heterogeneity the objective of this study is to evaluate a combined approach that partitions et into e and t at similar spatial and temporal scales in a maize crop grown in a weighing lysimeter specifically we use the sensible heat balance shb and modified sensible heat balance mshb methods to monitor e automatically and a heat balance sap flow method hbsf to measure t continuously of the maize crop the weighing lysimeter measurements of et are used to evaluate the accuracy of the measured e t values 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the research station of the national engineering research center for information technology in agriculture near beijing city china the research station was located at 40 10 49 n 116 27 2 e at an elevation of 50 m above sea level with an annual precipitation of 550 mm an average annual sunshine

air temperature and relative humidity wind speed and rainfall at 2 m above the ground surface air temperature and relative humidity data were used to calculate saturated vapour pressure and vpd was estimated as the difference between actual vapour pressure and saturated vapour pressure asce ewri 2005 2 2 evapotranspiration measurement the weighing lysimeter measured the field et rates

row 12 5 1 4 row and 25 cm inter row from a maize plant and one probe was positioned between two maize plants in the row i e 12 5 cm away from the plants fig 1 we used the mean of the four measurements to represent soil water evaporation rates in the weighing lysimeter the needle to needle spacings within each sensor were determined in agar stabilized water 5 g l 1 before probe

solar radiation which produces non isothermal conditions that interfere with the heat pulse probe temperature signals to minimize ambient temperature impacts on thermal property estimations the ambient temperature drift was corrected following the approach of zhang et al 2014 the influences of the soil air interface on the heat pulse measurements in the 0 to 6 mm layer were eliminated by using the pulsed infinite line source adiabatic boundary condition pils abc liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 model considering the fact that the 0 to 0 5 mm layer was an undetectable zone in the shb method we applied the mshb method when the soil surface was undergoing stage 1 evaporation i e when phase change occurred at the soil surface the shb method was used when the soil water evaporation zone moved from the surface to the subsurface which was set as the inflection point 0 25 m3 m 3 for the study site on the water retention curve dexter and bird 2001 xiao et al 2014 to avoid interference among the adjacent heating needles during the heating periods we did two sets of measurements in the first half hour and another two sets in the second half hour thus the heat pulse measurement interval was one hour at each position and hourly values were obtained for soil evaporation rate daily e values were then determined by adding up the hourly values 2 4 plant transpiration measurements beginning on july 26 2014 sap flow velocities in maize plants were measured with hbsf sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa three repeated measurements were obtained with the sgb19 sap flow sensors fitted to maize plants with stalk diameters ranging from 18 to 23 mm the hbsf sensors were installed at the second internode of the maize plant following cohen et al 1993 and the manufacturer instructions dynagage sap flow sensor user manual 2007 briefly the leaf sheath of the third internode was removed natural canola oil was sprayed onto the stem and the sensor heater with a small amount of g4 silicone squeezed onto it was wrapped around the stem o rings were placed on the stem above and below the sensor respectively and a shield was placed tightly over the sensor the hbsf sensors with a working voltage of 4 0 4 5 v were connected to an am16 32 multiplexer campbell scientific logan utah that was controlled by a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah the data logger scanned every 10 s averaged the sap flow signals at a 10 min interval and stored the results every 30 min sap flow velocity was calculated from the voltage signals to avoid heat injury to the plants we changed the target plants every 7 days in addition the sensors were shifted to new plants immediately after rainfall events to avoid any errors caused by rain water sap flow measurements with the hbsf sensors are subject to errors due to unequal temperatures between plant stem surfaces and inner stem locations ishida et al 1991 braun and schmid 1999 and due to direct heating of plant stems by solar irradiance cohen et al 1993 thus the measured sap flow velocity was corrected by using the following calibration equation wang et al 2017b 6 t c 0 59 t p 2 82 where t c g h 1 and t p g h 1 are the corrected and original sap flow values respectively plant transpiration rates in the weighing lysimeter i e t were determined by multiplying t c by plant density n p a where n p is the number of plants in the weighing lysimeter and a is the lysimeter area m2 the mean values from the three sap flow sensors were used in the analysis 2 5 lai and net radiation measurements eight plants were selected to measure the leaf area index lai at selected dates during the maize growing season the length and width of each leaf were measured manually with a ruler and lai was calculated using the following equation mckee 1964 xu et al 2015 7 l a i n p i 1 n i 1 m l i w i 0 75 n a where n p is the number of total plants in the lysimeter n is the representative number of plants 8 m is the number of leaves of a representative plant a is the lysimeter area m2 and l and w are the length and width of a leaf m respectively by using the measured data we also calculated the basal crop coefficient k cb according to the method described by allen et al 1998 we used two net radiometers nr lite 2 kipp zonen delft the netherlands to determine r n at the soil surface the net radiometers were placed 10 cm above the soil surface with one at a plant row position and the other at an interrow position the net radiometers were connected to a datalogger cr3000 campbell scientific logan ut that recorded the r n w m 2 values every 30 min 3 results and discussion the study lasted for 58 days from july 26 to sep 21 2014 during the measurement period eighteen rainfall events were recorded two of the rainfall events on aug 31 and sep 1 had daily totals greater than 15 mm fig 2a the relative humidity of air and vapour pressure deficit ranged from 15 to 99 and 0 4 2 8 kpa daily mean values respectively fig 2b about 40 and 54 mm of water were supplied via irrigations on aug 19 and aug 27 respectively soil water content of the 0 5 cm layer varied from 0 12 to 0 40 m3 m 3 and it increased immediately after the rainfall or irrigation events fig 2c the daily average values of r g varied from 40 to 260 w m 2 which were large on clear days and small on cloudy days fig 2a in addition r g showed a declining trend from aug to sep as indicated by the maximum daily means of 260 and 250 w m 2 for aug and sep respectively lai varied from 3 8 to 6 8 during the measurement period fig 3a 3 1 soil water evaporation and plant transpiration during the measurement period daily e values ranged from 0 1 to 2 1 mm d 1 with an average value of 0 9 mm d 1 and followed the r n pattern fig 3b the daily e values were larger than those of xiao et al 2016 who reported a range of 0 1 1 2 mm d 1 with an average value of 0 6 mm d 1 these differences were mainly due to variations in measurement periods and climatic factors that affected e our e measurements were initiated 36 days after maize planting when maize plants were not fully developed with a lai about 3 8 while xiao et al 2016 measured e when maize plants were fully developed the below canopy r n values measured in this study varied from 0 1 to 4 8 mj m 2 d 1 were larger than the r n values reported by xiao et al 2016 varied from 0 2 to 3 1 mj m 2 d 1 maize transpiration rates varied considerably during the study period t was relatively small at the onset of the measurements increased gradually with time reached the peak value on aug 11 k cb 1 25 and then decreased gradually fig 3b maize transpiration rates t were affected by r g and lai figs 3a and 3b overall the daily t values followed the r g pattern fig 3b which explained 72 of the variation of t during the study period superimposed on this general trend was an increase of t before aug 11 and a decrease of t thereafter which were caused by the changes in maize lai figs 3a and 3b during the study period t varied in the range of 0 8 8 7 mm d 1 with an average of 4 0 mm d 1 these t values were greater than the values from 0 3 to 6 4 mm d 1 reported by xiao et al 2016 the xiao et al 2016 field had smaller lai between 3 9 and 4 3 and r g from 35 to 231 w m 2 values than our site 3 2 fractions of evaporation and transpiration during the entire measurement period the e fraction of evapotranspiration i e e e t ranged from 5 to 50 with an average value of 19 fig 3c which was lower than the values reported by kang et al 2003 26 liu et al 2002 30 ding et al 2013 31 and zhang et al 2013 35 this was caused mainly by the fact that our measurement period did not cover the earlier maize growth stages when due to less crop canopy shading the soil water evaporation rate was greater than it was at the later stages in general transpiration is the major mode of water loss in dryland agricultural fields liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 in this study the t e t ratio ranged from 50 to 92 with a mean value of 81 fig 3c the value was larger than that of liu et al 2002 70 and lower than that of xiao et al 2016 87 this was explained by the fact that liu et al 2002 collected data for the whole growing season that included the lower t values during early crop growth stages while xiao et al 2016 collected data only for a fully developed maize canopy that effectively shaded the soil surface 3 3 diurnal characteristics of evapotranspiration and its components fig 4 presents the hourly values of global radiation aboveground net radiation e t and e t during a drying period after a rainfall of 6 2 mm on aug 13 soil water content of the 0 5 cm layer was 0 265 m3 m 3 the field then experienced a 5 day drying period from aug 14 to aug 18 until the soil water content was reduced to 0 135 m3 m 3 on aug 18 both soil water evaporation and plant transpiration displayed clear diurnal patterns e and t rates started to increase at sunrise reached their peaks at solar noon and then slowly decreased the shape of the e curve however more resembled that of the net radiation measured at 10 cm above the soil surface while the shape of the t curve looked more like that of the global radiation curve fig 4 this is caused by the fact that during this period when the canopy had been fully developed the rate of soil water evaporation was determined by energy availability at soil surface and soil hydraulic properties the results differ from that in bare soils where soil water evaporation is energy limited during stage 1 and soil hydraulic properties largely determines liquid water movement to the surface for evaporation in stage 2 idso et al 1974 plant transpiration on the other hand is affected by factors such as net radiation at the leaf surface soil water availability in the root zone and biological factors such as stomatal resistance in addition to air temperature and relative humidity secondly during this period when the canopy had fully developed the peak e rate lasted for a shorter time and decreased more rapidly as compared to the t rate on aug 15 for example the t and e rates reached their peak values 0 36 mm h 1 and 0 31 mm h 1 respectively at about 11 30 am and the t rate was maintained for about 5 h until 15 30 while the e rate lasted for less than one hour this explained why transpiration was the major mode of water loss under the experimental conditions fig 3 the heat pulse sensors also captured some negative e rates during nighttime periods fig 4 this was mainly due to water vapor condensation zhang et al 2012 3 4 daily evapotranspiration rates daily evapotranspiration rates from the weighing lysimeter et and the combination approach e t varied dynamically during the maize growing season and both followed the vapour pressure deficit trend figs 2b and 5a in general et and e t were small in the early period of maize growth reached their peak values in mid august and declined in september the average e t value was 4 9 mm d 1 ranging from 1 2 to 9 6 mm d 1 which was similar to the average weighing lysimeter et value of 4 8 mm d 1 ranging from 0 4 to 10 1 mm d 1 however the daily e t values were mostly greater than the daily et values before aug 19 and tended to be less than daily et values after aug19 we speculate that the differences were related to errors in e measurements during near saturated soil surface conditions and t measurements during rainfall events the sensible heat balance approach loses accuracy during rain and irrigation times when significant convective heat flow occurs xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 and sap flow sensors fail to provide reasonable results on rainy days this was especially true during the period of aug 24 27 on sep 3 sep 4 and sep 8 when rainfall irrigation occurred just prior to these days additionally the individual to individual variations in plant body size thus transpiration rate may cause some errors in the results in terms of cumulative evapotranspiration during the measurement period et had a value of 281 mm while the e t value was 286 mm fig 5b overall e t overestimated the cumulative evapotranspiration by 2 which was less than the result e t was 26 larger than et reported by xiao et al 2016 who measured et with the eddy covariance method a main reason for the discrepancy reported by xiao et al 2016 was that they did not correct the sap flow estimates of t our results were also better than the results reported by jara et al 1998 e t was 5 7 larger than et who measured et with the bowen ratio method and e with microlysimeters thus by measuring e with heat pulse sensors and t with sap flow gauges at similar scales it is possible to partition et accurately correlation analysis showed a strong linearity of the relationship between daily e t and daily et fig 6 by setting the intercept as zero linear regression of e t versus et yielded a slope of 0 970 a coefficient of determination of 0 718 and a root mean square error rmse of 1 07 mm d 1 these results indicated that et and e t had similar trends and on the average the two approaches had good agreement over the season compared to et results from the weighing lysimeter the combination approach slightly overestimated et at relatively low evapotranspiration rates but slightly underestimated et at relatively high evapotranspiration rates in addition relatively large data scatter occurred at the larger evapotranspiration rates additional research is required to fully understand the sources of the overestimation and underestimation 4 conclusions in this study a combination e t approach was used to determine evapotranspiration rates in a maize crop grown in a weighing lysimeter the dynamics of daily e t were determined with heat pulse sensors and sap flow gauges respectively and the results were compared to weighing lysimeter et measurements during the study period when the maize canopy was mostly developed e was relatively small 1 mm d 1 and accounted for about 19 of the cumulative e t while t accounted for about 81 of the total e t while the cumulative e t value from the combination approach matched well to the weighing lysimeter cumulative et value daily e t slightly overestimated daily et when et was relatively small and daily e t marginally underestimated daily et when et was relatively large the combination of shb and mshb methods heat pulse sensors and the hbsf method sap flow sensors have the potential to measure daily evaporation and transpiration dynamics under field

10073,understanding the contributions of soil water evaporation e and crop transpiration t to evapotranspiration et is essential for irrigation management and improving crop water use efficiency current methods for partitioning et are subject to uncertainties due in part to the scale differences in determining e t and et in this study et of a lysimeter planted with maize zea mays l was partitioned into e and t using sensors that had compatible measurement scales e was measured with heat pulse sensors following the sensible heat balance shb and modified sensible heat balance mshb approaches and t was measured with sap flow gauges following the heat balance sap flow hbsf method the accuracy of the measurements was evaluated by comparing the sum of e and t values e t to weighing lysimeter et data during the study period e t and et had average values of 0 9 4 0 and 4 8 mm d 1 respectively and the fractions of e and t were 19 and 81 of e t respectively in general the e t values agreed well with the lysimeter et data but slight overestimations and underestimations were observed at relatively small and relatively large et rates respectively by combining the shb and mshb approaches and the hbsf method it is possible to partition et into e and t with satisfactory accuracy keywords evaporation transpiration evapotranspiration partitioning maize 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of soil water evaporation e and plant transpiration t is an important component of the hydrologic cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum lemordant et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in agricultural ecosystems the fractions of e and t in et are affected by soil and water management practices and they have been used as indicators of crop water use efficiency agam et

measure t balwinder singh et al 2011 obtained an e et value of 0 25 0 33 by using micro lysimeters to measure e and the water balance method to measure et in a wheat field due to the large differences in measurement scales among the eddy covariance method thousands of square meters bowen ratio method thousands of square meters and sap flow method a single plant uncertainties exist in the accuracy and resolution of et partitioning results in field studies micro lysimeters have been used frequently to measure e jara et al 1998 liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 wang and liu 2007 agam et al 2012 micro lysimeters are simple cost effective and are generally considered to provide reliable measures of e the micro lysimeter method however has the drawbacks of destructive sampling soil cores have to be changed frequently labor intensive soil samples need to be sealed at the bottom and weighed manually discontinuous fails to monitor e continuously or during irrigation or rain and lack of automatization kool et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 in addition micro lysimeters are usually installed in inter row areas between crop rows liu et al 2002 wang and liu 2007 agam et al 2012 therefore they ignore root water uptake and spatial variations due to the heterogeneity of solar radiation and soil water content in the field which may cause errors in et partitioning hupet and vanclooster 2005 recently the sensible heat balance shb method has been developed to measure e heitman et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2017a in this method soil sensible heat fluxes and changes in sensible heat storage in a soil layer are measured 1 g 1 g 2 δ s l e where g 1 and g 2 w m 2 are soil sensible heat fluxes at two depths δs w m 2 is the change of sensible heat storage between these two depths l j m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization and e m s 1 is the soil water evaporation rate the sensible heat terms g 1 g 2 and δs can be calculated by using heat pulse sensor measured soil temperature and thermal property data and e can be calculated with eq 1 compared to the micro lysimeter method the shb approach is able to measure real time subsurface e continuously additionally xiao et al 2014 developed a modified sensible heat balance mshb method eq 2 that detected e occurring between the soil surface and the first subsurface measurement depth by replacing g 1 with net radiation at the soil surface r n to identify surface e under a crop canopy under wet conditions 2 r n g 2 δ s l e xiao et al 2016 monitored e and t dynamics in a fully developed maize field by measuring e with the shb and mshb methods and t with sap flow sensors and compared the summed values with et measured with the eddy covariance method the results showed that e et ranged from 3 to 39 and t et ranged from 61 to 97 differences between eddy covariance et and e t were due mainly to scale variations among the methods and to plant growth heterogeneity the objective of this study is to evaluate a combined approach that partitions et into e and t at similar spatial and temporal scales in a maize crop grown in a weighing lysimeter specifically we use the sensible heat balance shb and modified sensible heat balance mshb methods to monitor e automatically and a heat balance sap flow method hbsf to measure t continuously of the maize crop the weighing lysimeter measurements of et are used to evaluate the accuracy of the measured e t values 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the research station of the national engineering research center for information technology in

daily e values were larger than those of xiao et al 2016 who reported a range of 0 1 1 2 mm d 1 with an average value of 0 6 mm d 1 these differences were mainly due to variations in measurement periods and climatic factors that affected e our e measurements were initiated 36 days after maize planting when maize plants were not fully developed with a lai about 3 8 while xiao et al 2016 measured e when maize plants were fully developed the below canopy r n values measured in this study varied from 0 1 to 4 8 mj m 2 d 1 were larger than the r n values reported by xiao et al 2016 varied from 0 2 to 3 1 mj m 2 d 1 maize transpiration rates varied considerably during the study period t was relatively small at the onset of the measurements increased gradually with time reached the peak value on aug 11 k cb 1 25 and then decreased gradually fig 3b maize transpiration rates t were affected by r g and lai figs 3a and 3b overall the daily t values followed the r g pattern fig 3b which explained 72 of the variation of t during the study period superimposed on this general trend was an increase of t before aug 11 and a decrease of t thereafter which were caused by the changes in maize lai figs 3a and 3b during the study period t varied in the range of 0 8 8 7 mm d 1 with an average of 4 0 mm d 1 these t values were greater than the values from 0 3 to 6 4 mm d 1 reported by xiao et al 2016 the xiao et al 2016 field had smaller lai between 3 9 and 4 3 and r g from 35 to 231 w m 2 values than our site 3 2 fractions of evaporation and transpiration during the entire measurement period the e fraction of evapotranspiration i e e e t ranged from 5 to 50 with an average value of 19 fig 3c which was lower than the values reported by kang et al 2003 26 liu et al 2002 30 ding et al 2013 31 and zhang et al 2013 35 this was caused mainly by the fact that our measurement period did not cover the earlier maize growth stages when due to less crop canopy shading the soil water evaporation rate was greater than it was at the later stages in general transpiration is the major mode of water loss in dryland agricultural fields liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 in this study the t e t ratio ranged from 50 to 92 with a mean value of 81 fig 3c the value was larger than that of liu et al 2002 70 and lower than that of xiao et al 2016 87 this was explained by the fact that liu et al 2002 collected data for the whole growing season that included the lower t values during early crop growth stages while xiao et al 2016 collected data only for a fully developed maize canopy that effectively shaded the soil surface 3 3 diurnal characteristics of evapotranspiration and its components fig 4 presents the hourly values of global radiation aboveground net radiation e t and e t during a drying period after a rainfall of 6 2 mm on aug 13 soil water content of the 0 5 cm layer was 0 265 m3 m 3 the field then experienced a 5 day drying period from aug 14 to aug 18 until the soil water content was reduced to 0 135 m3 m 3 on aug 18 both soil water evaporation and plant transpiration displayed clear diurnal patterns e and t rates started to increase at sunrise reached their peaks at solar noon and then slowly decreased the shape of the e curve however more resembled that of the net radiation measured at 10 cm above the soil surface while the shape of the t curve looked more like that of the global radiation curve fig 4 this is caused by the fact that during this period when the canopy had been fully developed the rate of soil water evaporation was determined by energy availability at soil surface and soil hydraulic properties the results differ from that in bare soils where soil water evaporation is energy limited during stage 1 and soil hydraulic properties largely determines liquid water movement to the surface for evaporation in stage 2 idso et al 1974 plant transpiration on the other hand is affected by factors such as net radiation at the leaf surface soil water availability in the root zone and biological factors such as stomatal resistance in addition to air temperature and relative humidity secondly during this period when the canopy had fully developed the peak e rate lasted for a shorter time and decreased more rapidly as compared to the t rate on aug 15 for example the t and e rates reached their peak values 0 36 mm h 1 and 0 31 mm h 1 respectively at about 11 30 am and the t rate was maintained for about 5 h until 15 30 while the e rate lasted for less than one hour this explained why transpiration was the major mode of water loss under the experimental conditions fig 3 the heat pulse sensors also captured some negative e rates during nighttime periods fig 4 this was mainly due to water vapor condensation zhang et al 2012 3 4 daily evapotranspiration rates daily evapotranspiration rates from the weighing lysimeter et and the combination approach e t varied dynamically during the maize growing season and both followed the vapour pressure deficit trend figs 2b and 5a in general et and e t were small in the early period of maize growth reached their peak values in mid august and declined in september the average e t value was 4 9 mm d 1 ranging from 1 2 to 9 6 mm d 1 which was similar to the average weighing lysimeter et value of 4 8 mm d 1 ranging from 0 4 to 10 1 mm d 1 however the daily e t values were mostly greater than the daily et values before aug 19 and tended to be less than daily et values after aug19 we speculate that the differences were related to errors in e measurements during near saturated soil surface conditions and t measurements during rainfall events the sensible heat balance approach loses accuracy during rain and irrigation times when significant convective heat flow occurs xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 and sap flow sensors fail to provide reasonable results on rainy days this was especially true during the period of aug 24 27 on sep 3 sep 4 and sep 8 when rainfall irrigation occurred just prior to these days additionally the individual to individual variations in plant body size thus transpiration rate may cause some errors in the results in terms of cumulative evapotranspiration during the measurement period et had a value of 281 mm while the e t value was 286 mm fig 5b overall e t overestimated the cumulative evapotranspiration by 2 which was less than the result e t was 26 larger than et reported by xiao et al 2016 who measured et with the eddy covariance method a main reason for the discrepancy reported by xiao et al 2016 was that they did not correct the sap flow estimates of t our results were also better than the results reported by jara et al 1998 e t was 5 7 larger than et who measured et with the bowen ratio method and e with microlysimeters thus by measuring e with heat pulse sensors and t with sap flow gauges at similar scales it is possible to partition et accurately correlation analysis showed a strong linearity of the relationship between daily e t and daily et fig 6 by setting the intercept as zero linear regression of e t versus et yielded a slope of 0 970 a coefficient of determination of 0 718 and a root mean square error rmse of 1 07 mm d 1 these results indicated that et and e t had similar trends and on the average the two approaches had good agreement over the season compared to et results from the weighing lysimeter the combination approach slightly overestimated et at relatively low evapotranspiration rates but slightly underestimated et at relatively high evapotranspiration rates in addition relatively large data scatter occurred at the larger evapotranspiration rates additional research is required to fully understand the sources of the overestimation and underestimation 4 conclusions in this study a combination e t approach was used to determine evapotranspiration rates in a maize crop grown in a weighing lysimeter the dynamics of daily e t were determined with heat pulse sensors and sap flow gauges respectively and the results were compared to weighing lysimeter et measurements during the study period when the maize canopy was mostly developed e was relatively small 1 mm d 1 and accounted for about 19 of the cumulative e t while t accounted for about 81 of the total e t while the cumulative e t value from the combination approach matched well to the weighing lysimeter cumulative et value daily e t slightly overestimated daily et when et was relatively small and daily e t marginally underestimated daily et when et was relatively large the combination of shb and mshb methods heat pulse sensors and the hbsf method sap flow sensors have the potential to measure daily evaporation and transpiration dynamics under field

10074,analysis of climate change impacts as well as conscious decision making and long term planning in complex water resources systems require use of innovative approaches under conditions of deep climate uncertainty this research aims to design and evaluate robust adaptable plans under deep climate uncertainties in the agricultural sector for this purpose a combination of the adaptation pathways ap approach in conjunction with the soil and water assessment tool swat model is used to evaluate the robustness of adaptation actions and to design robust adaptation pathways under future climate uncertainties in the hablehroud river basin iran deep climate uncertainties are specified as plausible climate scenario combinations according to the average precipitation and temperature changes in representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 2020 2080 according to the results changes in cropping patterns represent the most robust adaptation action across various combinations of climate scenarios other adaptation actions including deficit irrigation changes in crop planting dates and improving irrigation efficiency are fairly robust in the specific time period from 2020 to 2080 sequencing of these adaptation actions based on their robustness and expiry date results in designing adaptation pathway maps under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 finally different preferred pathways are identified based on the expiry date of each robust adaptation action changes in cropping patterns can be selected as the most robust adaptation pathway robustness greater than 80 under deep climate uncertainty among these different pathways suggesting other preferred pathways can be helpful to select reasonable pathways for implementation graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change deep uncertainty water management decision making adaptation pathways 1 introduction the complex and uncertain climate change impacts on socio physical processes pose a challenge for decision making and long term planning in water resources and agricultural systems the climate adaptation strategies and plans developed in these systems are limited when confronted by deep uncertainties about future socio economic and climatic changes thus it is crucial to pursue innovative decision making approaches for supporting policy and decision makers under such conditions various approaches and tools have been developed for planning under deep climate uncertainty in the literature some of them such as robust decision making matrosov et al 2013 groves et al 2015 information gap decision theory igdt ben haim 2006 decision scaling brown et al 2012 and robust optimization ben tal et al 2009 have been developed for assessing the robustness of a system action or decision in a wide range of plausible changes in the future nevertheless these approaches produce a static robust plan which will be likely to fail if the future is different from what is forecasted therefore a paradigm shift from the static robust approaches to new adaptive planning is necessary for this aim approaches such as real options analysis woodward et al 2014 adaptive policy making kwakkel et al 2010 adaptation pathways haasnoot et al 2012 2013 and dynamic adaptive policy pathways dapp haasnoot et al 2013 not only assess the robustness of plans in a wide range of plausible future changes but also analyze flexibility combined with the adaptive planning process thus the plans will be designed in such a manner that they can adapt with respect to changes over time this new paradigm has attracted a great deal of attention in various disciplines robust adaptive plans have been developed for flood management for the rhine delta in the netherlands haasnoot et al 2012 2013 river basin management groves et al 2013 bhave et al 2018 coastal adaptation rosenzweig et al 2011 lin et al 2017 climate risk adaptation wilby and dessai 2010 lawrence and manning 2012 rosenzweig and solecki 2014 and flood risk management in singapore buurman and babovic 2016 as well as new zealand lawrence and haasnoot 2017 the adaptation pathways ap as one of the robust adaptive planning approaches has great potential for framing climate adaptation strategy in addition to static robust approaches in which the possible actions are analyzed related to the impacts of different climate scenarios adaptation pathways analyze the possible extension of feasible options under the uncertain climate change condition over time zandvoort et al 2017 also the ap shows how portfolios of adaptation actions can be diversified through possible responses the ap approach claims to support climate change adaptation policy making by five contributions 1 handling deep uncertainty of climate change 2 incorporating multiple stakeholder preferences 3 structuring options with high adaptability 4 indicating the potential performance of actions and possible lock ins and 5 considering objective based thresholds for assessing actions haasnoot et al 2012 bloemen et al 2018 reported the same and showed that the ap approach can effectively improve the quality of decision making processes under deep uncertainty however despite growing application of ap only a few studies have evaluated it and its capability for decision and policy making lin et al 2017 furthermore haasnoot et al 2013 has modified and extended the ap they combined adaptive policy making and ap which resulted in the creation of the dynamic adaptive policy pathways dapp approach indeed ap constitutes the core of dapp for designing robust adaptive plans dapp extended ap by considering a monitoring system for implementation of actions or for reassessment of the plan in another study wise et al 2014 presented a broader conceptualization of ap considering the societal change aspects of adaptation they emphasized identifying institutional dimensions of governance in ap the important point is that assessing adaptation actions and pathways in the agriculture sector needs to be conducted at the basin scale delavar et al 2020 requiring an appropriate modeling tool various hydrological simulation and water allocation models such as vic weap mike basin and swat can be applied in this regard however the global use of swat arnold et al 1998 e g in north america and europe and other countries and regions including india brazil china iran south korea eastern africa and southeast asia has demonstrated the flexibility and capability of the model for investigating hydrologic and water quality problems at different basin scales and environmental conditions gassman et al 2010 2015 swat has also received the most attentions for simulation and assessment of climate scenarios and management measures e g baker and miller 2013 jha et al 2015 krysanova and srinivasan 2015 therefore linking swat and ap approaches makes it possible to propose reliable flexible plans that can be adapted over time and under unpredictable conditions the adaptable plans are presented as pathways which are obtained by sequencing a set of possible adaptation actions and assessing their expiry dates tipping points over time across a wide range of future plausible scenarios haasnoot et al 2012 2013 developing relevant methodology for such a linkage defines the objective of this study additionally an adaptation pathway map has been designed according to the determined robust adaptation actions and their tipping points to explore the developed methodology the hablehroud basin in iran is the case study water resources of the basin have considerably reduced in recent years due to the effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors such as land use change and agricultural extension etc as a result it has caused problems for stakeholders especially in the agricultural sector as the main water consumer in the basin smlwr 2014 moe ministry of energy 2012 thus providing suitable adaptation actions is essential for avoiding more serious problems in the basin accordingly the most robust actions in agricultural water management of the basin to adapt to climate change and the pathway to apply such actions in the future will be determined the paper is divided into 4 sections section 2 introduces the hablehroud river basin the study area and method including assessment of deep climate change uncertainty the swat model and associated data and the adaptation pathways approach the proposed adaptation actions in the agricultural sector and the igdt approach are explained in section 3 results and discussion are presented finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the hablehroud river basin is located in iran s central desert fig 1 with longitude of 52 20 to 53 10 e and latitude of 35 17 to 35 59 n the total area of the basin is about 3223 km2 its highest and lowest points are about 3878 m and 733 m above sea level respectively the annual rainfall in the basin varies from 142 8 mm to 444 6 mm in the period of 1982 2009 the hablehroud river is the main river of the basin and originates from alborz mountain in the north side of the basin and flows to the southwest this river is also the main source of agricultural water supply in the basin the area of irrigated lands is 11 274 ha over 30 different crops are cultivated in the basin that the main representative crops include wheat alfalfa potato tomato apple walnut and pomegranate current irrigation efficiency is about 38 for the areas using surface water and 50 for those that use groundwater the locations of two synoptic and eleven rain gauge stations as well as five hydrometric stations firouzkouh namroud simindasht dalichai and bonkouh are shown in fig 1 spatial e g dem soil and land use hydro climate and agricultural management data are as shown in table 1 2 2 methodology considering the objectives of this study the framework of the suggested methodology is presented in fig 2 it includes 3 main components first various climate scenarios are indicated based on temperature and precipitation rate as deeply uncertain factors extracted from the gsms global circulation models then the range of future average temperature and precipitation changes is determined through decision scaling brown et al 2012 the second component relates to parameterization calibration and validation of the hydrological model swat the model is then applied to assess the adaptation actions and pathways the third component and the core of our methodology is ap it requires evaluation of the efficacy and robustness of proposed adaptation actions on performance metrics where the information gap decision theory igdt ben haim 2006 is applied in the following subsections the descriptions of the components are described in more detail 2 2 1 climate change scenario generation to determine deep climate change uncertainty precipitation and temperature are estimated using five of the cmip5 gcms mpi esm mr hadgem2 es gfdl cm3 ec earth and miroc5 for three time periods including 2020 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 under two rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the lars weather generator is used as a statistical model semenov et al 2002 to downscale the outputs of the gcms and generate weather variables such as precipitation and temperature the criteria for selecting lars weather generator and the five gcms are based on their high acceptable performance in the previous studies on investigating climate change impacts on the hablehroud river basin e g salehpoor et al 2019 lotfirad et al 2019 baghbanan et al 2020 the performance of the lars weather generator is evaluated at two synoptic stations fig 1 for the baseline period from 1994 to 2015 accordingly the range of average temperature and precipitation changes is identified under different climate scenarios for each time period thus the climate uncertainty space is created through the discretization of the range of projected average precipitation and temperature changes this means that uncertain space of climate variables is divided into several blocks using the decision scaling in order to investigate the uncertainties in climate scenarios 2 2 2 swat model swat is a comprehensive watershed scale semi distributed model developed by the usda agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 it allows assessment of the impacts of various management measures on hydrology and water quality in a basin in the swat model a basin is subdivided into subbasins and then divided into hydrological response units hrus with the same soil type land use and slope characteristics the hydrological cycle is also simulated based on a water balance equation in this paper swat was used to assess climate change adaptation actions based on simulation of different water balance components spatial e g dem soil and land use hydro climate and agricultural management data were used as inputs to swat as mentioned in table 1 hablehroud s land use map and soil map as well as dem have been used for creating hrus accordingly hablehroud river basin was subdivided into 192 subbasins and 1535 hrus 2 2 3 adaptation pathways approach fig 3 shows the main steps of ap adopted for designing an adaptation pathways map in the study the first step is to specify objectives and uncertainties in this paper ensuring future adequate access to water in terms of time and space for the agricultural sector and no adverse effect on the ecosystem are considered the main objectives the uncertainties are provided from the gcm models section 2 2 1 in step 2 the current situations of a system are described step 3 identifies vulnerabilities developments that prevent the objectives from being achieved and opportunities developments that can help achieve the objectives based on assessing the current and possible situation in the future under specified objectives this analysis is carried out by the swat model under different climate scenarios it considers a composition of performance metrics and compares them with indicated threshold values these performance metrics include blue water scarcity groundwater scarcity environmental scarcity and agricultural calorie production a more detailed description is available in table 2 of section 2 3 1 in the light of opportunities and vulnerabilities identiﬁed and the current situation analysis of a system in steps 2 and 3 possible adaptation actions can be identified step 4 in this paper a series of adaptation actions are applied emphasizing water consumption reduction and increasing water productivity see section 2 3 furthermore step 5 it is necessary to reassess the agriculture water system in order to ensure that the actions from the previous step are able to effectively reduce vulnerabilities or create new opportunities in steps 6 and 7 the efficacy of these adaptation actions is assessed and the expiry date of each efficient adaptation action is also determined based on objectives and threshold values of performance metrics under diﬀerent climate scenarios however it is essential to identify robust adaptation action step 8 as each adaptation action can have an accountable performance to a certain extent under different climate scenarios thus identification of adaptation tipping points is carried out based on the igdt approach finally step 9 the results are used to sketch the ap map 2 3 adaptation actions in the agricultural sector through an international climate change adaptation project entitled adapt in 7 river basins including mekong south east asia walawe sri lanka rhine western europe sacramento basin usa syr darya central asia volta west africa and zayandeh iran it is showed that the most possible adaptation strategies for agricultural sector were somehow related to irrigation management and cropped area droogers and aerts 2005 therefore a number of these practices are identified and expanded as adaptation actions in this study then their performances are examined using the swat model and compared with business as usual bau management under different climate scenarios they are as follows deficit irrigation di is widely considered as a sustainable action to maintain food production and save water in arid and semi arid regions fereres and soriano 2007 domínguez et al 2012 montoya et al 2019 the rate of application of di are reported from 15 to 50 ates et al 2013 chen et al 2019 marek et al 2017 in the present study a di of 20 is investigated which has been applied in some other studies in iran too i e abbasi et al 2020 mosavi et al 2020 this strategy is applicable in different crops especially for alfalfa walnut and apple orchards which constitute about 70 of the total area of irrigated lands irrigation efficiency ie improvement is one of the main measures in the study area it is aimed to increase ie up to about 75 by means of pressurized rain and sprinkler system current conventional irrigation is about 40 cropping pattern change cp is where water intensive crops with less calorie products are changed to crops with lower irrigation need and more calorie products for instance tomato and alfalfa have shifted to potato and wheat respectively moreover shifting to potato and wheat is more tolerated to climate change ngigi 2009 akinnagbe and irohibe 2014 change in planting dates pd is reported as an adaption measure a suitable planting calendar can minimize water stresses during the growing period according to investigating the regional temperature conditions and comparing heat unit of regional crops earlier planting dates can be considered as an opportunity in the basin as a result of warmer regional temperatures under future climate change the frequency of heat stress is increased there is also the likelihood that crop yields will be decreased from higher temperatures leading to increased evapotranspiration therefore using the capabilities of swat model in crop growth simulation the planting date is shifted to colder months for both autumn and spring sown crops this measure causes that maturation phase happens earlier and before the occurrence of peak temperatures in summer this measure can eventually reduce evapotranspiration too positive reports about change in planting dates are also reported by zaman et al 2016 alizadeh dizaj et al 2019 and abbasi et al 2020 2 3 1 information gap decision theory in this paper igdt ben haim 2001 is applied in order to determine robust adaptation actions and their tipping points this approach seeks to maximize the robustness of an action with the minimum performance requirements r c under deep uncertainty ben haim 2001 2010 matrosov et al 2013 considering robustness and opportuneness in other words the robustness of an action x i is assessed by the maximum horizon of uncertainty α explored over a range of plausible scenarios u u that can maintain the specified minimum performance requirements r c 1 α x r c max α min u u α u r x u r c opportuneness criterion of an action is also measured by the minimum horizon of uncertainty α that can produce a level of performance r greater than a windfall reward level r w 2 α x r w min α max u u α u r x u r w the robustness and opportuneness of actions are assessed in the uncertainty space u which are determined by the discretization of climate scenarios based on two uncertain parameters including average precipitation u 1 and temperature u 2 as explained before performance requirements are also identified by blue water scarcity groundwater scarcity environmental scarcity and relative change in agricultural calorie production table 2 the values of the metrics are compared with their thresholds in current situation of the system in this paper the robustness of actions rob x is defined as the fraction of climate scenarios that result in an acceptable performance satisfied scenarios a by an adaptation action to the total climate uncertainty space u beh et al 2015 roach et al 2016 3 r o b x a u 100 note that the simple additive weighting saw approach is also used as a weighted linear combination method for calculating the evaluation score of robustness for each adaptation action as alternative based on all performance metrics criteria using the following formula 4 s i w j r i j f o r i 1 2 n where s i is the score of the ith alternative w j is the weight of the jth criterion and r ij denotes the normalized rate of the ith alternative for the jth criterion n and m represent the number of alternative and criteria respectively the normalized rate r ij is also calculated for positive i e the better performance the higher value and negative criteria i e the better performance the lower value as follows 5 r i j x i j max i x i j f o r p o s i t i v e c r i t e r i a 6 r i j 1 x i j max i 1 x i j f o r n e g a t i v e c r i t e r i a 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate change scenarios climate scenarios were generated using the lars weather generator model under cmip5 scenarios rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for three time periods 2020 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 historical data in the basin were used to generate average precipitation as well as minimum and maximum temperatures for the three time periods for this aim the results of lars were tested for precipitation and temperature using coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse at the synoptic stations fig 1 in the baseline period i e 1994 2015 table 3 also shows r2 significance at 1 level and nse higher than 0 74 which confirm acceptable performance of the model as expected the performance of the model for temperature is better than rainfall furthermore the ranges of average temperature and precipitation changes were determined in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over a ten year time period from 2020 to 2080 the range of average temperature changes varied from 0 to 2 c and 0 5 to 3 c under the rcps respectively similarly the range of average precipitation changes varied between 5 and 20 and from 0 to 30 the main reason for applying a ten year time period was to increase the accuracy of identifying the tipping points in ap accordingly the climate uncertainty spaces were created through the discretization of projected average precipitation and temperature and are shown in fig 4 they illustrate 22 and 36 combinations of the climate scenarios circle points to evaluate adaptation actions under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 3 2 swat model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation to evaluate the performance of the swat model the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the model have been carried out using swat cup with sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 table 4 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis as well as p value and t state of the parameters if a parameter has a larger t state value and its p value is also close to zero it is more effective on and sensitive to streamflows it shows that threshold temperature of snowfall sftmp and threshold temperature of snow melt smtmp are the most effective parameters affecting streamflows followed by curve number cn2 parameter the observed monthly streamflow data of four hydrometric stations including namroud simindasht dalichai and bonkouh for the period 1986 2015 were used to calibrate 1991 2008 and validate 2009 2015 the model the first five years were considered as the model warmup period table 5 shows the model performance for simulating streamflows in the four aforementioned hydrometric stations using coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and root mean square error to the standard deviation ratio rsr parameters according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is satisfactory if the values of monthly r2 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for streamflow simulation considering these criteria table 4 reveals the model performance is almost satisfactory however they reported that other factors like quality and quantity of measured data model calibration procedure evaluation time step and project scope and magnitude may affect the model evaluation as our results are affected by the high numbers of subbasins 192 and hrus 1535 the uncertainty bands of the simulated streamflow were also determined by r factor achievement of small uncertainty band and p factor the measured data bracketed by the prediction uncertainty in table 5 the results show that the p factor is larger than 50 in all stations except namroud while the r factor is less than 1 in dalichai simindasht and bonkouh and greater than 1 in namroud stations 3 3 changes in performance metrics for this section the validated swat model was run for the 58 climate scenario combinations section 3 1 with adaptation actions that are deficit irrigation di increasing irrigation efficiency ie changing planting dates pd and change in cropping pattern cp section 2 3 resulting in a total of 232 simulation runs in the next step the performance metrics including wsblue wsblack wsblue env and rcagr table 2 were calculated for each run figs 5 and 6 illustrate the box plots of the results over 10 year windows from 2020 to 2080 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 compared to bau bau as a reference point refers to the status of the basin in the baseline period this approach has been applied in similar studies too e g alcamo et al 2003 de janvry and sadoulet 2010 abbasi et al 2020 figs 5 and 6 show a decreasing trend in environmental and water resources scarcity indices for all the adaptation actions in both climate scenarios this may be due to the reduction of renewable water and reduced access to green and blue water in the future climate condition in this state the performance of adaptation actions on changing the wsblue wsblue env and wsblack decreased based on the decreasing available water mainly attributed to an increase in temperature figs 5a and 6a show that in the values of wsblue for adaptation actions such as ie pd and di are relatively higher compared to the values for cp over all ten year time periods and these adaptation actions can increase the overall state of blue water related to the bau this is mainly because of the role of the actions in decreasing real water consumption as shown in figs 5b and 6b there were minor changes in the values of wsblue env for all adaptation actions over ten year time periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 on the other hand the calculated wsblack figs 5c and 6c show a significant change from bau due to decreasing net withdrawal from ground water resources in all actions figs 5d and 6d show di results in relatively more water stress for crops as well as reduction in crop yields and agricultural calorie production however other adaptation actions including cp ie and pd cause more relative changes in agricultural calorie production cp has the highest relative values of rcagr as compared to other adaptation actions under the climate change conditions which agrees with the results of other studies such as abbasi et al 2020 in tashk bakhtegan basin iran and zaman et al 2016 in the siminroud basin iran they showed that changing the crop patterns is the best strategy under climate scenarios with respect to the agricultural indicators therefore changing in crop pattern could deliver socioeconomic benefits e g more incomes employment food security and prevent the migration of villagers it should be noted that di has little effect on agricultural calorie production as a result of reduction in crop yields whilst it saves considerable amounts of water according to improve water resources indices geerts and raes 2009 who reviewed many research from around the world confirmed that di is successful in increasing water productivity for various crops without causing severe yield reductions as mentioned by ali et al 2007 and kipkorir et al 2001 maximizing water productivity by di may be economically more profitable for the farmer than maximizing yield especially in regions where the available water supply limits agricultural production the results of water resources indices show that ie do not have high effectiveness in the basin the same results was reported by perry et al 2017 raeisi et al 2019 and delavar et al 2020 in the absence of controls on water allocations in the basin using pressurized irrigation will tend farmers to expand the irrigated area and pump more water from groundwater resources this may result in intensify the conflict between upstream and downstream stakeholders the lack of simulating social behaviors of stakeholders and socioeconomic uncertainties as the main limitations of this study need to be considered in the future studies further efforts are under process for a more accurate socio economic assessment of the measures 3 4 design adaptation pathway to design the adaptation pathways the robustness of each action is calculated using the results of performance metrics as presented in section 3 3 after identifying the climate uncertainty space fig 4 and evaluating the performance requirements a combined index is obtained as a normalized sum of the weighted performance metrics equal weights using saw approach eq 4 then igdt is used to calculate the robustness of each action through comparing the calculated index with its threshold the respective value in bau over each climate scenario combination in the 10 year time periods under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 an adaptation action over each climate scenario combination is robust if it has an acceptable performance based on comparing the calculated index to its threshold finally an evaluation score of robustness is calculated for each adaptation action over the 10 year time periods in the climate uncertainty space under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 using eq 3 fig 7 reveals an example of acceptable performances of di based on the combined index for the 10 year time periods under rcps the values of calculated robustness are classified in table 6 accordingly the results for the adaptation actions over climate scenarios are classified and shown in table 7 as listed in the table cp is more robust than other adaptation actions on the other hand other pd and di have fair robustness in the time period of 2041 2080 under rcp 4 5 while ie performs fairly in the time period 2041 2060 under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 di and pd have fair and good robustness during 2020 2080 and 2020 2070 respectively it is also seen that ie is only fairly robust in the time period of 2031 2040 finally adaptation pathways maps are designed based on the adaptation actions which have robustness more than 50 and 60 they are shown in figs 8 and 9 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 fig 8a reveals that cp is recommendable for the entire study timeline while other actions do not have acceptable robustness 60 in the first 20 years ie has an acceptable robustness over the time period of 20 years after 2040 di and pd have an acceptable robustness in the period of 2040 2080 in this case there are three decision points i e transfer to new action considering tipping points of the actions 1 after current situation 2 after the first 20 years in cp and 3 after expiry date of ie in 2060 the preferred pathways can be considered as combinations of these paths six pathways can be selected from the combinations of these paths that have been supported under rcp 4 5 as shown in table 8 fig 8b also shows a combination of the pathways with acceptable robustness 60 under rcp 8 5 in contrast to fig 8 a 3 adaptation actions are available in the first 10 years after that ie also can be acted but it just has the acceptable robustness 60 until 2040 di and cp have more than 60 of robustness until 2080 but cp reaches the expiry date in 2070 thus the preferred pathways are selected based on four decision points shown in table 8 similarly the preferred pathways were also identified for over 50 of robustness under both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 as shown in table 8 and fig 9 different preferred paths can be selected from the adaptation pathways map all of the paths presented in table 8 have an acceptable robustness more than 60 and 50 depending on the rcp scenarios among the different preferred paths in table 8 cp and cp ie di and cp ie cp can be selected as paths which are more robust in both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 on the other hand the cost beneﬁt analysis can be helpful to select affordable pathways and eliminating costly ones 4 conclusion the aim of this paper was to evaluate and design robust adaptable plans under deep climate uncertainties in the agricultural sector in this regard a methodology was developed and applied using a combination of the comprehensive hydrological simulation model swat with adaptation pathways ap approach on the river basin scale in this context the deep climate uncertainties were specified as plausible climate scenario combinations according to the future average precipitation and temperature changes in two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 over ten year time periods from 2020 to 2080 the calibrated and validated swat model was then used to assess the robustness of the proposed adaptation actions in different studies di ie cp and pd under different combinations of climate scenarios in the hablehroud river basin also the idea of an adaptation pathways map was applied to design robust adaptable pathways the results showed a decreasing trend in environmental and water resource scarcity indices change for all the adaptation actions in both climate scenarios this may be due to the expected reduction of renewable water and reduced access to green and blue water and on the other hand an increase in water demand in future climate conditions in this state the performance of adaptation actions on changing the water resource scarcity indices wsblue wsblue env and wsblack mainly depended to the decreasing the available water that mainly attributed to an increase in temperature in the case study the results also showed that cp was very effective with respect to the performance metrics than pd ie and di the calculated wsblue and wsblack and wsblue env decreased more for cp than for other adaptation actions also the values of rcagr were less for other adaptation actions than for cp thus cp was the most robust adaptation action under the climate change condition studies conducted by zaman et al 2016 abbasi et al 2020 and delavar et al 2020 have demonstrated the positive effects of cp on the hydrological and economic performance at the basin level assessing the robustness of other adaptations based on performance metrics showed that pd and di had fair robustness due to their greater sensitivity and poorer performance in different climatic conditions while ie was only fair robust because of its positive effects on increasing water productivity and crop yields but it should be noted improved irrigation systems can increase water consumption and have nearly the same problem with salt accumulation raeisi et al 2019 which can affect their performance in terms of water resource indices therefore the results of robust assessment revealed that the most effective adaptation actions mainly focused on basin consumption management by cropping pattern change and deﬁcit irrigation which is similar to abbasi et al 2020 and sabbaghi et al 2020 finally adaptation pathway maps were designed based on sequences of robust adaptation actions over the time periods from 2020 to 2080 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 adaptation pathways present not only the robust adaptation options but also show when and where they will fail among these different pathways cp can be selected as the most robust adaptation pathway robustness greater than 80 under deep climate uncertainty selection of other pathways among the proposed paths requires a cost beneﬁt analysis that can be helpful to select affordable pathways and eliminating costly ones also the maps show that for some adaption actions e g ie the shape of the pathways remains the same and time span does not differ much but more types of uncertainty are taken into account so the future variability and dynamic interactions between the water and social system become more explicit in performance analysis and policy decision making in addition adaptation implementation may face several barriers as stated by singh and chudasama 2021 lack of ﬁnance technological inputs and locally relevant information is the key adaptation barriers in arid and semi arid regions it is necessary to couple efficient adaptation actions with financial technological and institutional arrangements in order to reduce adaptation barriers the main strength of this study is its systematic methodology which helps more informed decision making and design comprehensive adaptive plans it also could be applicable to other basins considering varying objectives and indicators however future studies on climate change uncertainties and socio economical evaluation of adaptation measures are other scopes that can improve the analyses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10074,analysis of climate change impacts as well as conscious decision making and long term planning in complex water resources systems require use of innovative approaches under conditions of deep climate uncertainty this research aims to design and evaluate robust adaptable plans under deep climate uncertainties in the agricultural sector for this purpose a combination of the adaptation pathways ap approach in conjunction with the soil and water assessment tool swat model is used to evaluate the robustness of adaptation actions and to design robust adaptation pathways under future climate uncertainties in the hablehroud river basin iran deep climate uncertainties are specified as plausible climate scenario combinations according to the average precipitation and temperature changes in representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 2020 2080 according to the results changes in cropping patterns represent the most robust adaptation action across various combinations of climate scenarios other adaptation actions including deficit irrigation changes in crop planting dates and improving irrigation efficiency are fairly robust in the specific time period from 2020 to 2080 sequencing of these adaptation actions based on their robustness and expiry date results in designing adaptation pathway maps under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 finally different preferred pathways are identified based on the expiry date of each robust adaptation action changes in cropping patterns can be selected as the most robust adaptation pathway robustness greater than 80 under deep climate uncertainty among these different pathways suggesting other preferred pathways can be helpful to select reasonable pathways for implementation graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change deep uncertainty water management decision making adaptation pathways 1 introduction the complex and uncertain climate change impacts on socio physical processes pose a challenge for decision making and long term planning in water resources and agricultural systems the climate adaptation strategies and plans developed in these systems are limited when confronted by deep uncertainties about future socio economic and climatic changes thus it is crucial to pursue innovative decision making approaches for supporting policy and decision makers under such conditions various approaches and tools have been developed for planning under deep climate uncertainty in the literature some of them such as robust decision making matrosov et al 2013 groves et al 2015 information gap decision theory igdt ben haim 2006 decision scaling brown et al 2012 and robust optimization ben tal et al 2009 have been developed for assessing the robustness of a system action or decision in a wide range of plausible changes in the future nevertheless these approaches produce a static robust plan which will be likely to fail if the future is different from what is forecasted therefore a paradigm shift from the static robust approaches to new adaptive planning is necessary for this aim approaches such as real options analysis woodward et al 2014 adaptive policy making kwakkel et al 2010 adaptation pathways haasnoot et al 2012 2013 and dynamic adaptive policy pathways dapp haasnoot et al 2013 not only assess the robustness of plans in a wide range of plausible future changes but also analyze flexibility combined with the adaptive planning process thus the plans will be designed in such a manner that they can adapt with respect to changes over time this new paradigm has attracted a great deal of attention in various disciplines robust adaptive plans have been developed for flood management for the rhine delta in the netherlands haasnoot et al 2012 2013 river basin management groves et al 2013 bhave et al 2018 coastal adaptation rosenzweig et al 2011 lin et al 2017 climate risk adaptation wilby and dessai 2010 lawrence and manning 2012 rosenzweig and solecki 2014 and flood risk management in singapore buurman and babovic 2016 as well as new zealand lawrence and haasnoot 2017 the adaptation pathways ap as one of the robust adaptive planning approaches has great potential for framing climate adaptation strategy in addition to static robust approaches in which the possible actions are analyzed related to the impacts of different climate scenarios adaptation pathways analyze the possible extension of feasible options under the uncertain climate change condition over time zandvoort et al 2017 also the ap shows how portfolios of adaptation actions can be diversified through possible responses the ap approach claims to support climate change adaptation policy making by five contributions 1 handling deep uncertainty of climate change 2 incorporating multiple stakeholder preferences 3 structuring options with high adaptability 4 indicating the potential performance of actions and possible lock ins and 5 considering objective based thresholds for assessing actions haasnoot et al 2012 bloemen et al 2018 reported the same and showed that the ap approach can effectively improve the quality of decision making processes under deep uncertainty however despite growing application of ap only a few studies have evaluated it and its capability for decision and policy making lin et al 2017 furthermore haasnoot et al 2013 has modified and extended the ap they combined adaptive policy making and ap which resulted in the creation of the dynamic adaptive policy pathways dapp approach indeed ap constitutes the core of dapp for designing robust adaptive plans dapp extended ap by considering a monitoring system for implementation of actions or for reassessment of the plan in another study wise et al 2014 presented a broader conceptualization of ap considering the societal change aspects of adaptation they emphasized identifying institutional dimensions of governance in ap the important point is that assessing adaptation actions and pathways in the agriculture sector needs to be conducted at the basin scale delavar et al 2020 requiring an appropriate modeling tool various hydrological simulation and water allocation models such as vic weap mike basin and swat can be applied in this regard however the global use of swat arnold et al 1998 e g in north america and europe and other countries and regions including india brazil china iran south korea eastern africa and southeast asia has demonstrated the flexibility and capability of the model for investigating hydrologic and water quality problems at different basin scales and environmental conditions gassman et al 2010 2015 swat has also received the most attentions for simulation and assessment of climate scenarios and management measures e g baker and miller 2013 jha et al 2015 krysanova and srinivasan 2015 therefore linking swat and ap approaches makes it possible to propose reliable flexible plans that can be adapted over time and under unpredictable conditions the adaptable plans are presented as pathways which are obtained by sequencing a set of possible adaptation actions and assessing their expiry dates tipping points over time across a wide range of future plausible scenarios haasnoot et al 2012 2013 developing relevant methodology for such a linkage defines the objective of this study additionally an adaptation pathway map has been designed according to the determined robust adaptation actions and their tipping points to explore the developed methodology the hablehroud basin in iran is the case study water resources of the basin have considerably reduced in recent years due to the effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors such as land use change and agricultural extension etc as a result it has caused problems for stakeholders especially in the agricultural sector as the main water consumer in the basin smlwr 2014 moe ministry of energy 2012 thus providing suitable adaptation actions is essential for avoiding more serious problems in the basin accordingly the most robust actions in agricultural water management of the basin to adapt to climate change and the pathway to apply such actions in the future will be determined the paper is divided into 4 sections section 2 introduces the hablehroud river basin the study area and method including assessment of deep climate change uncertainty the swat model and associated data and the adaptation pathways approach the proposed adaptation actions in the agricultural sector and the igdt approach are explained in section 3 results and discussion are presented finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the hablehroud river basin is located in iran s central desert fig 1 with longitude of 52 20 to 53 10 e and latitude of 35 17 to 35 59 n the total area of the basin is about 3223 km2 its highest and lowest points are about 3878 m and 733 m above sea level respectively the annual rainfall in the basin varies from 142 8 mm to 444 6 mm in the period of 1982 2009 the hablehroud river is the main river of the basin and originates from alborz mountain in the north side of the basin and flows to the southwest this river is also the main source of agricultural water supply in the basin the area of irrigated lands is 11 274 ha over 30 different crops are cultivated in the basin that the main representative crops include wheat alfalfa potato tomato apple walnut and pomegranate current irrigation efficiency is about 38 for the areas using surface water and 50 for those that use groundwater the locations of two synoptic and eleven rain gauge stations as well as five hydrometric stations firouzkouh namroud simindasht dalichai and bonkouh are shown in fig 1 spatial e g dem soil and land use hydro climate and agricultural management data are as shown in table 1 2 2 methodology considering the objectives of this study the framework of the suggested methodology is presented in fig 2 it includes 3 main components first various climate scenarios are indicated based on temperature and precipitation rate as deeply uncertain factors extracted from the gsms global circulation models then the range of future average temperature and precipitation changes is determined through decision scaling brown et al 2012 the second component relates to parameterization calibration and validation of the hydrological model swat the model is then applied to assess the adaptation actions and pathways the third component and the core of our methodology is ap it requires evaluation of the efficacy and robustness of proposed adaptation actions on performance metrics where the information gap decision theory igdt ben haim 2006 is applied in the following subsections the descriptions of the components are described in more detail 2 2 1 climate change scenario generation to determine deep climate change uncertainty precipitation and temperature are estimated using five of the cmip5 gcms mpi esm mr hadgem2 es gfdl cm3 ec earth and miroc5 for three time periods including 2020 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 under two rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the lars weather generator is used as a statistical model semenov et al 2002 to downscale the outputs of the gcms and generate weather variables such as precipitation and temperature the criteria for selecting lars weather generator and the five gcms are based on their high acceptable performance in the previous studies on investigating climate change impacts on the hablehroud river basin e g salehpoor et al 2019 lotfirad et al 2019 baghbanan et al 2020 the performance of the lars weather generator is evaluated at two synoptic stations fig 1 for the baseline period from 1994 to 2015 accordingly the range of average temperature and precipitation changes is identified under different climate scenarios for each time period thus the climate uncertainty space is created through the discretization of the range of projected average precipitation and temperature changes this means that uncertain space of climate variables is divided into several blocks using the decision scaling in order to investigate the uncertainties in climate scenarios 2 2 2 swat model swat is a comprehensive watershed scale semi distributed model developed by the usda agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 it allows assessment of the impacts of various management measures on hydrology and water quality in a basin in the swat model a basin is subdivided into subbasins and then divided into hydrological response units hrus with the same soil type land use and slope characteristics the hydrological cycle is also simulated based on a water balance equation in this paper swat was used to assess climate change adaptation actions based on simulation of different water balance components spatial e g dem soil and land use hydro climate and agricultural management data were used as inputs to swat as mentioned in table 1 hablehroud s land use map and soil map as well as dem have been used for creating hrus accordingly hablehroud river basin was subdivided into 192 subbasins and 1535 hrus 2 2 3 adaptation pathways approach fig 3 shows the main steps of ap adopted for designing an adaptation pathways map in the study the first step is to specify objectives and uncertainties in this paper ensuring future adequate access to water in terms of time and space for the agricultural sector and no adverse effect on the ecosystem are considered the main objectives the uncertainties are provided from the gcm models section 2 2 1 in step 2 the current situations of a system are described step 3 identifies vulnerabilities developments that prevent the objectives from being achieved and opportunities developments that can help achieve the objectives based on assessing the current and possible situation in the future under specified objectives this analysis is carried out by the swat model under different climate scenarios it considers a composition of performance metrics and compares them with indicated threshold values these performance metrics include blue water scarcity groundwater scarcity environmental scarcity and agricultural calorie production a more detailed description is available in table 2 of section 2 3 1 in the light of opportunities and vulnerabilities identiﬁed and the current situation analysis of a system in steps 2 and 3 possible adaptation actions can be identified step 4 in this paper a series of adaptation actions are applied emphasizing water consumption reduction and increasing water productivity see section 2 3 furthermore step 5 it is necessary to reassess the agriculture water system in order to ensure that the actions from the previous step are able to effectively reduce vulnerabilities or create new opportunities in steps 6 and 7 the efficacy of these adaptation actions is assessed and the expiry date of each efficient adaptation action is also determined based on objectives and threshold values of performance metrics under diﬀerent climate scenarios however it is essential to identify robust adaptation action step 8 as each adaptation action can have an accountable performance to a certain extent under different climate scenarios thus identification of adaptation tipping points is carried out based on the igdt approach finally step 9 the results are used to sketch the ap map 2 3 adaptation actions in the agricultural sector through an international climate change adaptation project entitled adapt in 7 river basins including mekong south east asia walawe sri lanka rhine western europe sacramento basin usa syr darya central asia volta west africa and zayandeh iran it is showed that the most possible adaptation strategies for agricultural sector were somehow related to irrigation management and cropped area droogers and aerts 2005 therefore a number of these practices are identified and expanded as adaptation actions in this study then their performances are examined using the swat model and compared with business as usual bau management under different climate scenarios they are as follows deficit irrigation di is widely considered as a sustainable action to maintain food production and save water in arid and semi arid regions fereres and soriano 2007 domínguez et al 2012 montoya et al 2019 the rate of application of di are reported from 15 to 50 ates et al 2013 chen et al 2019 marek et al 2017 in the present study a di of 20 is investigated which has been applied in some other studies in iran too i e abbasi et al 2020 mosavi et al 2020 this strategy is applicable in different crops especially for alfalfa walnut and apple orchards which constitute about 70 of the total area of irrigated lands irrigation efficiency ie improvement is one of the main measures in the study area it is aimed to increase ie up to about 75 by means of pressurized rain and sprinkler system current conventional irrigation is about 40 cropping pattern change cp is where water intensive crops with less calorie products are changed to crops with lower irrigation need and more calorie products for instance tomato and alfalfa have shifted to potato and wheat respectively moreover shifting to potato and wheat is more tolerated to climate change ngigi 2009 akinnagbe and irohibe 2014 change in planting dates pd is reported as an adaption measure a suitable planting calendar can minimize water stresses during the growing period according to investigating the regional temperature conditions and comparing heat unit of regional crops earlier planting dates can be considered as an opportunity in the basin as a result of warmer regional temperatures under future climate change the frequency of heat stress is increased there is also the likelihood that crop yields will be decreased from higher temperatures leading to increased evapotranspiration therefore using the capabilities of swat model in crop growth simulation the planting date is shifted to colder months for both autumn and spring sown crops this measure causes that maturation phase happens earlier and before the occurrence of peak temperatures in summer this measure can eventually reduce evapotranspiration too positive reports about change in planting dates are also reported by zaman et al 2016 alizadeh dizaj et al 2019 and abbasi et al 2020 2 3 1 information gap decision theory in this paper igdt ben haim 2001 is applied in order to determine robust adaptation actions and their tipping points this approach seeks to maximize the robustness of an action with the minimum performance requirements r c under deep uncertainty ben haim 2001 2010 matrosov et al 2013 considering robustness and opportuneness in other words the robustness of an action x i is assessed by the maximum horizon of uncertainty α explored over a range of plausible scenarios u u that can maintain the specified minimum performance requirements r c 1 α x r c max α min u u α u r x u r c opportuneness criterion of an action is also measured by the minimum horizon of uncertainty α that can produce a level of performance r greater than a windfall reward level r w 2 α x r w min α max u u α u r x u r w the robustness and opportuneness of actions are assessed in the uncertainty space u which are determined by the discretization of climate scenarios based on two uncertain parameters including average precipitation u 1 and temperature u 2 as explained before performance requirements are also identified by blue water scarcity groundwater scarcity environmental scarcity and relative change in agricultural calorie production table 2 the values of the metrics are compared with their thresholds in current situation of the system in this paper the robustness of actions rob x is defined as the fraction of climate scenarios that result in an acceptable performance satisfied scenarios a by an adaptation action to the total climate uncertainty space u beh et al 2015 roach et al 2016 3 r o b x a u 100 note that the simple additive weighting saw approach is also used as a weighted linear combination method for calculating the evaluation score of robustness for each adaptation action as alternative based on all performance metrics criteria using the following formula 4 s i w j r i j f o r i 1 2 n where s i is the score of the ith alternative w j is the weight of the jth criterion and r ij denotes the normalized rate of the ith alternative for the jth criterion n and m represent the number of alternative and criteria respectively the normalized rate r ij is also calculated for positive i e the better performance the higher value and negative criteria i e the better performance the lower value as follows 5 r i j x i j max i x i j f o r p o s i t i v e c r i t e r i a 6 r i j 1 x i j max i 1 x i j f o r n e g a t i v e c r i t e r i a 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate change scenarios climate scenarios were generated using the lars weather generator model under cmip5 scenarios rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for three time periods 2020 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 historical data in the basin were used to generate average precipitation as well as minimum and maximum temperatures for the three time periods for this aim the results of lars were tested for precipitation and temperature using coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse at the synoptic stations fig 1 in the baseline period i e 1994 2015 table 3 also shows r2 significance at 1 level and nse higher than 0 74 which confirm acceptable performance of the model as expected the performance of the model for temperature is better than rainfall furthermore the ranges of average temperature and precipitation changes were determined in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over a ten year time period from 2020 to 2080 the range of average temperature changes varied from 0 to 2 c and 0 5 to 3 c under the rcps respectively similarly the range of average precipitation changes varied between 5 and 20 and from 0 to 30 the main reason for applying a ten year time period was to increase the accuracy of identifying the tipping points in ap accordingly the climate uncertainty spaces were created through the discretization of projected average precipitation and temperature and are shown in fig 4 they illustrate 22 and 36 combinations of the climate scenarios circle points to evaluate adaptation actions under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 3 2 swat model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation to evaluate the performance of the swat model the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the model have been carried out using swat cup with sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 table 4 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis as well as p value and t state of the parameters if a parameter has a larger t state value and its p value is also close to zero it is more effective on and sensitive to streamflows it shows that threshold temperature of snowfall sftmp and threshold temperature of snow melt smtmp are the most effective parameters affecting streamflows followed by curve number cn2 parameter the observed monthly streamflow data of four hydrometric stations including namroud simindasht dalichai and bonkouh for the period 1986 2015 were used to calibrate 1991 2008 and validate 2009 2015 the model the first five years were considered as the model warmup period table 5 shows the model performance for simulating streamflows in the four aforementioned hydrometric stations using coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and root mean square error to the standard deviation ratio rsr parameters according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is satisfactory if the values of monthly r2 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for streamflow simulation considering these criteria table 4 reveals the model performance is almost satisfactory however they reported that other factors like quality and quantity of measured data model calibration procedure evaluation time step and project scope and magnitude may affect the model evaluation as our results are affected by the high numbers of subbasins 192 and hrus 1535 the uncertainty bands of the simulated streamflow were also determined by r factor achievement of small uncertainty band and p factor the measured data bracketed by the prediction uncertainty in table 5 the results show that the p factor is larger than 50 in all stations except namroud while the r factor is less than 1 in dalichai simindasht and bonkouh and greater than 1 in namroud stations 3 3 changes in performance metrics for this section the validated swat model was run for the 58 climate scenario combinations section 3 1 with adaptation actions that are deficit irrigation di increasing irrigation efficiency ie changing planting dates pd and change in cropping pattern cp section 2 3 resulting in a total of 232 simulation runs in the next step the performance metrics including wsblue wsblack wsblue env and rcagr table 2 were calculated for each run figs 5 and 6 illustrate the box plots of the results over 10 year windows from 2020 to 2080 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 compared to bau bau as a reference point refers to the status of the basin in the baseline period this approach has been applied in similar studies too e g alcamo et al 2003 de janvry and sadoulet 2010 abbasi et al 2020 figs 5 and 6 show a decreasing trend in environmental and water resources scarcity indices for all the adaptation actions in both climate scenarios this may be due to the reduction of renewable water and reduced access to green and blue water in the future climate condition in this state the performance of adaptation actions on changing the wsblue wsblue env and wsblack decreased based on the decreasing available water mainly attributed to an increase in temperature figs 5a and 6a show that in the values of wsblue for adaptation actions such as ie pd and di are relatively higher compared to the values for cp over all ten year time periods and these adaptation actions can increase the overall state of blue water related to the bau this is mainly because of the role of the actions in decreasing real water consumption as shown in figs 5b and 6b there were minor changes in the values of wsblue env for all adaptation actions over ten year time periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 on the other hand the calculated wsblack figs 5c and 6c show a significant change from bau due to decreasing net withdrawal from ground water resources in all actions figs 5d and 6d show di results in relatively more water stress for crops as well as reduction in crop yields and agricultural calorie production however other adaptation actions including cp ie and pd cause more relative changes in agricultural calorie production cp has the highest relative values of rcagr as compared to other adaptation actions under the climate change conditions which agrees with the results of other studies such as abbasi et al 2020 in tashk bakhtegan basin iran and zaman et al 2016 in the siminroud basin iran they showed that changing the crop patterns is the best strategy under climate scenarios with respect to the agricultural indicators therefore changing in crop pattern could deliver socioeconomic benefits e g more incomes employment food security and prevent the migration of villagers it should be noted that di has little effect on agricultural calorie production as a result of reduction in crop yields whilst it saves considerable amounts of water according to improve water resources indices geerts and raes 2009 who reviewed many research from around the world confirmed that di is successful in increasing water productivity for various crops without causing severe yield reductions as mentioned by ali et al 2007 and kipkorir et al 2001 maximizing water productivity by di may be economically more profitable for the farmer than maximizing yield especially in regions where the available water supply limits agricultural production the results of water resources indices show that ie do not have high effectiveness in the basin the same results was reported by perry et al 2017 raeisi et al 2019 and delavar et al 2020 in the absence of controls on water allocations in the basin using pressurized irrigation will tend farmers to expand the irrigated area and pump more water from groundwater resources this may result in intensify the conflict between upstream and downstream stakeholders the lack of simulating social behaviors of stakeholders and socioeconomic uncertainties as the main limitations of this study need to be considered in the future studies further efforts are under process for a more accurate socio economic assessment of the measures 3 4 design adaptation pathway to design the adaptation pathways the robustness of each action is calculated using the results of performance metrics as presented in section 3 3 after identifying the climate uncertainty space fig 4 and evaluating the performance requirements a combined index is obtained as a normalized sum of the weighted performance metrics equal weights using saw approach eq 4 then igdt is used to calculate the robustness of each action through comparing the calculated index with its threshold the respective value in bau over each climate scenario combination in the 10 year time periods under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 an adaptation action over each climate scenario combination is robust if it has an acceptable performance based on comparing the calculated index to its threshold finally an evaluation score of robustness is calculated for each adaptation action over the 10 year time periods in the climate uncertainty space under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 using eq 3 fig 7 reveals an example of acceptable performances of di based on the combined index for the 10 year time periods under rcps the values of calculated robustness are classified in table 6 accordingly the results for the adaptation actions over climate scenarios are classified and shown in table 7 as listed in the table cp is more robust than other adaptation actions on the other hand other pd and di have fair robustness in the time period of 2041 2080 under rcp 4 5 while ie performs fairly in the time period 2041 2060 under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 di and pd have fair and good robustness during 2020 2080 and 2020 2070 respectively it is also seen that ie is only fairly robust in the time period of 2031 2040 finally adaptation pathways maps are designed based on the adaptation actions which have robustness more than 50 and 60 they are shown in figs 8 and 9 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 fig 8a reveals that cp is recommendable for the entire study timeline while other actions do not have acceptable robustness 60 in the first 20 years ie has an acceptable robustness over the time period of 20 years after 2040 di and pd have an acceptable robustness in the period of 2040 2080 in this case there are three decision points i e transfer to new action considering tipping points of the actions 1 after current situation 2 after the first 20 years in cp and 3 after expiry date of ie in 2060 the preferred pathways can be considered as combinations of these paths six pathways can be selected from the combinations of these paths that have been supported under rcp 4 5 as shown in table 8 fig 8b also shows a combination of the pathways with acceptable robustness 60 under rcp 8 5 in contrast to fig 8 a 3 adaptation actions are available in the first 10 years after that ie also can be acted but it just has the acceptable robustness 60 until 2040 di and cp have more than 60 of robustness until 2080 but cp reaches the expiry date in 2070 thus the preferred pathways are selected based on four decision points shown in table 8 similarly the preferred pathways were also identified for over 50 of robustness under both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 as shown in table 8 and fig 9 different preferred paths can be selected from the adaptation pathways map all of the paths presented in table 8 have an acceptable robustness more than 60 and 50 depending on the rcp scenarios among the different preferred paths in table 8 cp and cp ie di and cp ie cp can be selected as paths which are more robust in both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 on the other hand the cost beneﬁt analysis can be helpful to select affordable pathways and eliminating costly ones 4 conclusion the aim of this paper was to evaluate and design robust adaptable plans under deep climate uncertainties in the agricultural sector in this regard a methodology was developed and applied using a combination of the comprehensive hydrological simulation model swat with adaptation pathways ap approach on the river basin scale in this context the deep climate uncertainties were specified as plausible climate scenario combinations according to the future average precipitation and temperature changes in two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 over ten year time periods from 2020 to 2080 the calibrated and validated swat model was then used to assess the robustness of the proposed adaptation actions in different studies di ie cp and pd under different combinations of climate scenarios in the hablehroud river basin also the idea of an adaptation pathways map was applied to design robust adaptable pathways the results showed a decreasing trend in environmental and water resource scarcity indices change for all the adaptation actions in both climate scenarios this may be due to the expected reduction of renewable water and reduced access to green and blue water and on the other hand an increase in water demand in future climate conditions in this state the performance of adaptation actions on changing the water resource scarcity indices wsblue wsblue env and wsblack mainly depended to the decreasing the available water that mainly attributed to an increase in temperature in the case study the results also showed that cp was very effective with respect to the performance metrics than pd ie and di the calculated wsblue and wsblack and wsblue env decreased more for cp than for other adaptation actions also the values of rcagr were less for other adaptation actions than for cp thus cp was the most robust adaptation action under the climate change condition studies conducted by zaman et al 2016 abbasi et al 2020 and delavar et al 2020 have demonstrated the positive effects of cp on the hydrological and economic performance at the basin level assessing the robustness of other adaptations based on performance metrics showed that pd and di had fair robustness due to their greater sensitivity and poorer performance in different climatic conditions while ie was only fair robust because of its positive effects on increasing water productivity and crop yields but it should be noted improved irrigation systems can increase water consumption and have nearly the same problem with salt accumulation raeisi et al 2019 which can affect their performance in terms of water resource indices therefore the results of robust assessment revealed that the most effective adaptation actions mainly focused on basin consumption management by cropping pattern change and deﬁcit irrigation which is similar to abbasi et al 2020 and sabbaghi et al 2020 finally adaptation pathway maps were designed based on sequences of robust adaptation actions over the time periods from 2020 to 2080 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 adaptation pathways present not only the robust adaptation options but also show when and where they will fail among these different pathways cp can be selected as the most robust adaptation pathway robustness greater than 80 under deep climate uncertainty selection of other pathways among the proposed paths requires a cost beneﬁt analysis that can be helpful to select affordable pathways and eliminating costly ones also the maps show that for some adaption actions e g ie the shape of the pathways remains the same and time span does not differ much but more types of uncertainty are taken into account so the future variability and dynamic interactions between the water and social system become more explicit in performance analysis and policy decision making in addition adaptation implementation may face several barriers as stated by singh and chudasama 2021 lack of ﬁnance technological inputs and locally relevant information is the key adaptation barriers in arid and semi arid regions it is necessary to couple efficient adaptation actions with financial technological and institutional arrangements in order to reduce adaptation barriers the main strength of this study is its systematic methodology which helps more informed decision making and design comprehensive adaptive plans it also could be applicable to other basins considering varying objectives and indicators however future studies on climate change uncertainties and socio economical evaluation of adaptation measures are other scopes that can improve the analyses declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
