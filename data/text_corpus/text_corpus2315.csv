expression programming gep model for estimating mean monthly et o by using minimal amount of climatic data the data used in the analysis are collected from 32 weather stations in egypt through the climwat database the results showed that the accuracy of the gep model significantly improved when either mean relative humidity rh or wind speed at 2 m height u 2 was used as additional input variables the gep model with the inputs as maximum and minimum air temperature rh and u 2 showed the lowest root mean square error 0 426 mm d 1 and 0 430 mm d 1 and the highest coefficient of determination 0 963 and 0 962 overall index of model performance 0 960 and 0 960 and index of agreement 0 991 and 0 990 for training and testing sets respectively comparing the results of gep models

programming penman monteith empirical models 1 introduction over the last few decades one of the critical problems encountered in water management was the decrease in water availability in some parts of the world and obtaining accurate information on the agricultural demand overcoming these problems and improving the efficiency of water use can be achieved through an accurate irrigation schedule that identifies the required water and the right time for irrigation irrigation scheduling targets are meeting crop water requirements as specified in the amounts of evapotranspiration under certain climatic conditions hunsakar and pinter 2003 reference evapotranspiration et o is a demonstration of the environmental demand for evaporation that is independent of crop type and development and is both spatially and temporally variable et o is function of weather variables i e wind speed immediately above the surface air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity these variables depend primarily on the latitude and geographical site of the concerned area consequently et o values can be calculated or estimated by using hydro meteorological methods which are either physically based equations or empirical relationships between meteorological variables one of these methods is the penman monteith method physically based which estimates the monthly and daily et o the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommended this method as the standard equation allen et al 1998 naoum and tsanis 2003 saghravani et al 2009 it will be referred hereafter as fao 56 the penman monteith fao 56 pmf 56 method is widely used to estimate the et o in environmental and agricultural research pmf 56 coincides well with field observations and calibrates other models under various climates all over the world allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 garcia et al 2004 popova et al 2006 a survey of the literature clearly indicated that the pmf 56 method is superior compared to all other commonly used empirical methods such as hargreaves semani hs blaney criddle priestley taylor pt jensen haise irmak ir and turc tr allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 yoder et al 2005 berengena and gavilán 2005 berti et al 2014 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2017 unfortunately the pmf 56 method requires complete climatic data that may be unavailable in certain locations particularly within developing countries and therefore is difficult to apply in these cases alternative methods that rely on a few climatic data are used recently artificial intelligence techniques like gene expression programming gep are proposed as alternative approach ferreira 2001a had developed gep gep is a computational technique which allows automatically generating algorithms and expressions to solve the problems this algorithm is used to implement symbolic regression to get a mathematical function that fits a data set sakthivel et al 2012 gep is the natural development of genetic algorithms gas goldberg 1989 and genetic programming gp koza 1992 gep involves encoded computer programs nonlinear entities of different shapes and sizes expression trees in linear strings of fixed lengths chromosomes ferreira 2001a 2001b many studies examined the application of gep in hydraulic and hydrological modeling whigham and crapper 2001 applied gep to model rainfall runoff in australia shiri and kişi 2011 used recorded climatic parameters to compare gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and artifical neural netwark estimating the daily pan evaporation shiri et al 2012 used gep to estimate the daily et o for four climatic stations in northern spain where the gep model s performance was better than the anfis hs and pt models traore and guven 2013 successfully used gep to model et o using climatic data from tropical dry regions in burkina faso terzi 2013 compared anfis wth gep to estimate daily pan evaporation in turkey shiri et al 2014a 2014b evaluated a gep model to estimate evaporation and et o by spatial and temporal data scanning techniques marti et al 2015 compared lysimetric vs penman monteith et o targets in gep models alazba et al 2016 and yassin et al 2016a 2016b used gep to estimate the daily et o under arid environment in saudi arabia shiri 2017 compared gep with empirical models to estimate daily et o in hyper arid regions of iran their results indicated that gep technique is the best methodology for estimating et o more water savings will definitely bring about the opportunity to expand the irrigated areas improve water resources management and increase food production this will be great in ensuring food security in countries effective and serious action programs are required to increase crop water productivity and reduce water losses accordingly et o needs to be calculated accurately the problem of incomplete or missing climatic data has a significant impact on the estimation of et o therefore et o must be simulated by using the available minimal number of climatic variables therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 study the feasibility of gep models with limited climatic variables to predict the mean monthly et o 2 evaluate the performance of gep models developed with pmf 56 set as the true reference values using statistical criteria and 3 compare the accuracy of the results obtained from these models with the results of other empirical equations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data egypt with area of about 1 002 450 km2 is located between 22 and 31 36 15 n latitude and between 24 41 49 and 36 53 42 e longitude the climate in egypt is characterized as being extremely dry all over the country except on the northern mediterranean coast that receives rainfall in winter extremely hot weather during summer months is a general climatic feature of egypt even though the daytime temperatures are obviously moderate along the northern coast in northern coast region the average minimum temperature vary from 9 5 c in winter to 23 c in summer and the average maximum temperature vary from 17 c in winter to 32 c in summer in the central and the southern regions the daytime temperature is higher particularly in summers the average maximum temperature exceeds 40 c therefore different regions were considered in the study to cover all the areas in the country the climatic data used in this study were collected from 32 weather stations obtained from the united nations food and agriculture organization un fao database known as climwat smith 1993 from 2013 to 2015 the spatial distribution of the selected stations is shown in fig 1 the data include the long term mean monthly for the maximum and minimum air temperatures t max and t min c mean relative humidity rh solar radiation r s mj m 2 d 1 and wind speed at 2 m height u 2 m s 1 in addition to et o mm d 1 computed with the pmf 56 equation the pmf 56 equation is highly rated across a wide range of climate allen et al 1998 and is used to evaluate the results of mathematical et o models as a reference standerd irmak et al 2002 zanetti et al 2007 landeras et al 2008 jain et al 2008 dai et al 2009 traore et al 2010 the pmf 56 equation is defined by allen et al 1998 as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here et o is in mm d 1 r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean monthly air temperature at 2 m height c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve at mean air temperature kpa c 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 m 2 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa allen et al 1998 are used equations to calculate these parameters in this study gep models has at most five input variables t max t min rh r s and u 2 and et o the output variable is eto the data are divided into three sets first the training set consisted of 70 230 data points of data recorded by 27 weather stations the remaining 30 of the data from these weather stations were used as a set of test data the second set to run the trained models the third set included the extracted data from the remaining five weather stations 15 of the entire data it is used to validate and make the final check on the trained model s performance table 1 shows the monthly statistical parameters of the applied data sets where x mean x max x min s x c sx and k x denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient respectively combinations were used to estimate the mean monthly et o using the gep technique as represented in table 2 eight gep models were implemented to exam the performance of different climatic data combinations the first combination has two input climatic data points t max and t min this combination was designed as a temperature based model similar to the hargreaves and samani hs model by inserting rh and rs into the first combination respectively the second and third combinations were formed the irmak ir model shows the same inputs as those found in the third combination the fourth combination was made by adding u 2 into the first combination by inserting rs and u 2 into the second combination respectively the fifth and sixth combinations were formed this fifth combination s inputs are identical to those of the turc tr model the seventh combination was made by adding u 2 into the third combination the eighth combination included all climatic data except the temperature data 2 2 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep has been presented lately as a modification of gp ferreira 2001b in gep chromosomes individuals are linear entities with fixed length expressing the encoded genetic information subsequently the genetic information is converted at a later stage to non linear entities of varying length and sizes computer programs or expression trees the chromosomes can have one or more genes with each gene encoding genotype a smaller subprogram each chromosome in the initial population is then expressed phenotype through a random generation process a set of fitness function equations are used to evaluate the fitness of each individual chromosome ferreira 2006 these chromosomes with better solutions are then selected on the basis of their fitness values that are reproduced with modification and re evaluation by the genetic operators as mutation inversion transposition and recombination this process is repeated to find a correct solution i e chromosomes and achieve the required accuracy ferreira 2001a b in gep there are two languages one of the genes k expression and the other of expression trees each gene has a head and a tail the head includes symbols that represent terminals and functions whereas the tail includes only terminals 2 3 development of the gep models the computer program called genexprotools 5 0 gepsoft 2014 was used to implement gep just as the training set is selected the learning environment of the system is defined the remaining data from the selected weather stations were used as the testing set the first step is to determine the terminals set which includes some of the independent variables tmax tmin rh rs and u 2 to be used in individual computer programs the second step includes the set of functions some basic mathematical functions x 2 power ln x with four basic arithmetic operators were used in this study these functions were applied to provide better results for modeling evapotranspiration shiri et al 2012 the terminals and functions are the ingredients of the individual computer programs the third step is to choose an appropriate fitness function the root mean square error rmse function was used to calculate the overall fitness of the evolved programs the fourth step is to select the linking function an addition linking function was used to link the mathematical terms encoded in each gene algebraic sub trees the next step is to choose the genetic operators i e mutation inversion transposition and recombination which were all used mutation is the most efficient operator ferreira 2002 and can change genomes by replacing any symbol terminals and functions at any location and at any time in a chromosome in gep mutation the structural organization of chromosomes remains the same inversion can be easily implemented by inverting a small sequence within the head of gene ranging from at least two symbols to as big as the gene itself that is chosen randomly transposition has three types insertion sequence is root insertion sequence ris and gene transposition is transposition is restricted to operate on the gene heads only this operator chooses a chromosome randomly and short genomic segments with a function or terminal at the first position transposes to a accidentally selected position in the gene head excluding the root ris transposition is similar to is transposition however short genomic segments which have a function in the first position that transposes to the starting point of the gene in gene transposition an entire gene acts as a transposon that transposes itself through a random complete gene of a random chromosome to start point of this chromosome recombination or crossover has three types one point two point and gene recombination in one point recombination a pair of parent chromosomes is randomly selected and split up at exactly the same point to create two new chromosomes ferreira 2006 two point recombination is the same process the only difference is that two points are randomly chosen in the parent chromosome as crossover points guven and aytek 2009 guven and talu 2010 in gene recombination the entire genes are switched between two parent chromosomes including genes from both parents the new chromosomes created by recombination will always encode syntactically correct programs the parameters used in gep modeling are summarized in table 3 the final step is to determine the criteria to terminate the run when there was no improvement in the fitness function rmse value the program was stopped the final result is a mathematical expression that defines the relationship between variables inputs and results outputs which can be used to predict the outcomes a lot of climatic variable combinations were tried as input sets to gep for the models formulation the final equations obtained from gep are shown in table 4 for eight combinations the description for the expression trees of the gep6 formulation with the best performance after the training process is illustrated in fig 2 2 4 empirical et o models hs equation mean monthly et o was estimated by hargreaves and samani 1985 the hs equation is given by 2 e t o 0 0023 r a λ t max t min t 17 8 here et o is in mm d 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 ir equation irmak et al 2003 developed an equation for estimating et o in mm d 1 in the form 3 e t o 0 611 0 149 r s 0 079 t tr equation tr equation turc 1961 was developed in western europe and used moderately in the united states e g amatya et al 1995 this equation is written as 4 e t o a t 0 013 t t 15 23 8856 r s 50 λ here et o is in mm d 1 the value of a t equals unity when the relative humidity is higher than 50 otherwise a t is given by a t 1 50 r h 70 2 5 statistical evaluation the et o estimated using the gep and the other empirical models were compared with et o estimated using pmf 56 equation the coefficient of determination r2 rmse overall index of model performance oi and index of agreement ia were used for evaluating the performance of these models definitions of these parameters are as follows 5 r 2 i 1 n e i e c i c 2 i 1 n

is the gep estimated et o value n is the number of data points e is the average pmf 56 estimated value c is the average gep estimated value and e x and e n are the maximum and minimum pmf 56 estimated value respectively r2 measures the degree of correlation among the pmf 56 estimated and gep estimated et o values with values close to 1 0 indicating good model performance rmse is a measure of the residual variance licciardello et al 2007 the gep gives more accurate estimation when the rmse has low value oi ranges from to 1 and 1 indicates a perfect fit between the pmf 56 and gep estimated et o values alazba et al 2012 the ia was proposed by willmot 1981 to represent the ratio between the mean square error and the potential error ia takes values from 0 to 1 the worst and the perfect fits legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance analysis of gep in figs 3 and 4 the gep model estimates were compared with the pmf 56 estimated data via scatter plots for the training and testing sets additionally linear regression is applied for evaluating the models performance statistically table 5 presentsd the statistics of rmse oi and ia statistics in each gep model during training and testing processes as shown in figs 3 and 4 the gep2 and gep4 gep8 models results lie around the 45 straight line perfect line indicating that there are no bias effects as in the case of gep1 and gep 3 models gep1 and gep3 showed a bad correlation with pmf 56 estimated et o it can be also observed in the fit lines equations assuming that the equation is y αo x α1 that the slopes αo are closer to one and the intercepts α1 almost reach zero for all gep models excluding gep1 and gep3 the value of oi and ia for gep1 and gep3 was lower than that for the rest of the models however the rmse value was higher in the training and testing processes table 5 gep1 its inputs were the air temperatures only showed the largest intercepts 1 106 and 1 065 and lowest slopes 0 767 and 0 78 with r2 of 0 768 and 0 784 in training and testing processes figs 3 and 4 respectively gep3 in training and testing processes showed r2 values 5 6 and 3 19 higher than those resulted from gep1 the rmse values decreased by 9 81 and 5 89 for the training and testing processes respectively while the oi values gave an increase by 2 76 and 1 3 for the training and testing processes respectively the ia values increased by 1 5 and 0 85 for the training and testing processes respectively table 5 therefore the et o estimation accuracy was slightly improved when r s data were added to gep1 this is similar to results reported by traore and guven 2013 for burkina faso they reported that the performance slightly varied for gep models with t max t min and r s r2 0 598 than those from temperature data alone r2 0 588 conversely replacing r s data with rh or u 2 data resulted in a better performance for gep2 and gep4 than gep3 the intercept values for gep2 and gep4 were close to zero and the slope was close to one figs 3 and 4 the r2 values were 0 915 and 0 925 on average for gep2 and gep4 respectively during training and testing processes that is the values increased by 12 96 and 14 2 than those from gep2 this is also confirmed by the rmse oi and ia values in table 5 these models showed that the effect of rh and u 2 variable is significant contributing 48 58 and 18 07 respectively these results agreed with the results of fisher et al 2005 and of xiaoying and erda 2005 it was found that et o is sensitive to u 2 it is also observed that the r s data when incorporated together with rh or u 2 data as input parameters to gep5 or gep7 gave good estimates in term of r2 value it was improved for gep5 and gep7 on average by 17 47 and 16 91 respectively compared to gep3 in the training and testing processes gep5 for training and testing processes on average had oi and ia values that was about 11 35 and 4 55 which was more accurate than that from gep3 the corresponding values of oi and ia for gep7 increased by about 10 88 and 4 39 respectively compared to gep3 moreover rmse for gep5 or gep7 also decreased to about half the value recorded for gep3 table 5 when gep6 added rh and u 2 to gep1 it significantly increased the performance and resulted in the larger slope 0 96 and 0 95 and lower interception 0 195 and 0 239 in the training and testing processes figs 3 and 4 respectively in addition the low scattering of the data points was observed around the perfect line the values of r2 for gep6 increased drastically by 25 39 and 22 7 than that for gep1 the rmse value was extremely low while the oi and ia values were very close to one indicating excellent agreement between the et o estimated from pmf 56 and gep6 this implies that the rh and u 2 importance ratio of 23 52 and 22 96 respectively data are more effective in estimating the et o this result is consistent with kişi and ozturk 2007 traore et al 2010 ozkan et al 2011 and huo et al 2012 while t max and t min data are not available gep8 is the most suited model with slopes close to one 0 946 and 0 954 interception of 0 225 and r2 of 0 948 figs 3 and 4 this was indicated by the higher values of oi 0 948 and ia 0 986 for gep8 were close to one for the training set while rmse 0 508 mm d 1 value was close to zero similarly for the testing data set the lower values of the rmse was 0 546 mm d 1 close to zero while oi and ia values were 0 942 and 0 984 close to one the gep models behaved well with both the training and test data as there were no important differences in the r2 rmse oi and ia values given by the training and testing datasets table 5 3 2 spatial validation of the gep models validation was done in order to confirm the accuracy of the presented gep models the reference for this validation is the et o estimated by using the pmf 56 equation fig 5 compared the mean monthly values of the et o estimated by using the gep models with the et o estimated by using the pmf 56 for the five selected stations mersa matruh ismailia baharia asyut and kom ombo table 6 shows the statistical analysis of the et o for the validation performances in fig 5 for mersa matruh station the gep5 estimates were closer to the corresponding pmf 56 estimated et o values with a lower pmse value 0 165 and higher oi and ia values 0 968 and 0 994 than those of the other models table 6 performance wise gep2 and gep8 are ranked as the second and third best models respectively however gep4 and gep7 showed low accuracy in estimating et o as they contain the temperature and u 2 data with no rh data fig 5 shows that gep4 and gep7 had the highest deviation compared to gep2 and gep5 respectively indicating that there was gross overestimation among the gep models used the rmse oi and ia table 6 for gep4 and gep7 confirmed their poor performance it can be observed that for gep2 gep5 and gep8 models rh is a significant variable that affects the et o because mersa matruh station is located in a humid climate shiri et al 2013a also found that models including rh gave more accurate results when in a humid region because of the higher influence of rh on et o in such regions the gep2 model appears to be slightly better than the gep8 in robustness the other gep model overestimated the mean monthly pmf 56 et o at mersa matruh station with a rmse from 1 114 to 1 899 mm d 1 oi from 0 217 to 0 724 and ia from 0 738 to 0 835 for the three stations ismailia baharia and asyut the estimated et o values from gep models showed the same trend of the training and testing data it is clear from the scatter plots in fig 5 that the gep6 estimates are closer to the corresponding et o values when using pmf 56 than the other models from table 6 it can be observed that the estimated et o values show much better accuracies in gep6 than the other gep models gep6 gave values on average for rmse as 0 353 mm d 1 oi as 0 958 and ia as 0 993 the rmse value was close to zero while oi and ia values were very close to one indicating an excellent agreement between the pmf 56 results and estimated results from gep6 as shown in fig 5 and table 6 in kom ombo station all the gep models overestimated et o and gave large errors except for gep4 gep6 and gep7 these models exhibited very good performances which may be due to the amalgamated effects of u 2 this station however exhibited high precision with a rmse of 0 688 mm d 1 oi of 0 871 and ia of 0 959 for gep4 gep7 is ranked as the second best model gep2 and gep5 provided the worst results because of the presence of rh gep2 produced et o values with 131 26 and 40 77 lower accuracy in oi and ia values respectively than those from gep4 rmse for gep2 increased by a factor of 3 3 from 0 688 mm d 1 in gep4 to 2 967 mm d 1 in gep2 the rmse value for gep5 was almost 2 28 times that of the value for gep7 the oi and ia values from gep5 was 89 80 and 27 57 respectively lower than those from gep7 this shows the importance of u 2 data to calculate et o at a station located in arid region 3 3 performance of gep models compared to empirical methods table 7 presents comparison for the performances of the gep and the empirical models hs ir and tr it is obviously seen from the table that gep1 temperature based model estimates have better accuracy than those of the hs model according to r2 values it can be said that gep1 has the best estimates this confirms the oi and ia statistics that were about 7 8 and 4 85 more accurate than that of the hs the rmse value for the gep1 model was 15 82 more accurate this result agreed with the results of shiri et al 2012 2013b table 7 shows that gep3 has a better generalization ability in et o modeling when compared to the ir radiation based method consistent with yassin et al 2016b the ir model produced et o values that was 25 78 more accurate in rmse value than that from the gep3 model in terms of oi and ia gep3 were 16 53 and 14 26 respectively less accurate than the ir model it is clear from table 7 that gep5 is a suited model with a higher r2 value of 0 918 than that of the tr model the tr model exhibited the poorest performance with oi and ia that decreases drastically from 0 925 to 0 312 i e 133 74 decrease and from 0 978 to 0 535 i e 45 3 decrease respectively the rmse value for the tr model was almost 5 09 times than that for the gep5 model this is an agreement with shiri et al 2013b in table 7 the performance indices revealed that the gep models were superior among the overall empirical models this is because the gep models had the lowest rmse and the highest oi and ia for all stations therefore the gep technique can contribute in solving the climatic data unavailability problem in egypt 4 conclusions it is difficult to calculate reference evapotranspiration et o using climatic data that are sometimes missing in some developing countries e g egypt implementation of a gene expression programming gep technique for estimating the mean monthly et o using climatic variables was done in this study the gep models performances are studied by comparing with the penman monteith fao 56 which was the standard equation in situations in which only maximum and minimum air temperatures t max and t min data are available gep1 should be applied for estimating et o with t max and t min if neither mean relative humidity rh nor wind speed at 2 m height u 2 data are available the gep models i e gep2 and gep4 have a better performances than in the case of only t max t min and solar radiation values i e gep3 availability therefore when considering t max t min rh and u 2 i e gep6 in the estimation et o the gep model s performance has superiority thus rh and u 2 are the most effective variables and highly recommended for modeling et o on the other hand the gep models have a better performance when compared to the empirical hargreaves and samani irmak and turc models consequently the gep model is fairly a promising approach and a powerful tool to be used by irrigation schedulers and users without the recourse to the complete set of climatic data requirement for accurately estimating et o in egypt acknowledgement with sincere respect and gratitude we would like to express our deepest gratitude to the deanship of scientific research king saud university and agriculture research center college of food and agriculture sciences for the financial support and encouragement 
11575,the penman monteith fao 56 equation requires the complete climatic records for estimating reference evapotranspiration et o the present study is aimed at developing and evaluating a gene expression programming gep model for estimating mean monthly et o by using minimal amount of climatic data the data used in the analysis are collected from 32 weather stations in egypt through the climwat database the results showed that the accuracy of the gep model significantly improved when either mean relative humidity rh or wind speed at 2 m height u 2 was used as additional input variables the gep model with the inputs as maximum and minimum air temperature rh and u 2 showed the lowest root mean square error 0 426 mm d 1 and 0 430 mm d 1 and the highest coefficient of determination 0 963 and 0 962 overall index of model performance 0 960 and 0 960 and index of agreement 0 991 and 0 990 for training and testing sets respectively comparing the results of gep models

programming penman monteith empirical models 1 introduction over the last few decades one of the critical problems encountered in water management was the decrease in water availability in some parts of the world and obtaining accurate information on the agricultural demand overcoming these problems and improving the efficiency of water use can be achieved through an accurate irrigation schedule that identifies the required water and the right time for irrigation irrigation scheduling targets are meeting crop water requirements as specified in the amounts of evapotranspiration under certain climatic conditions hunsakar and pinter 2003 reference evapotranspiration et o is a demonstration of the environmental demand for evaporation that is independent of crop type and development and is both spatially and temporally variable et o is function of weather variables i e wind speed immediately above the surface air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity these variables depend primarily on the latitude and geographical site of the concerned area consequently et o values can be calculated or estimated by using hydro meteorological methods which are either physically based equations or empirical relationships between meteorological variables one of these methods is the penman monteith method physically based which estimates the monthly and daily et o the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommended this method as the standard equation allen et al 1998 naoum and tsanis 2003 saghravani et al 2009 it will be referred hereafter as fao 56 the penman monteith fao 56 pmf 56 method is widely used to estimate the et o in environmental and agricultural research pmf 56 coincides well with field observations and calibrates other models under various climates all over the world allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 garcia et al 2004 popova et al 2006 a survey of the literature clearly indicated that the pmf 56 method is superior compared to all other commonly used empirical methods such as hargreaves semani hs blaney criddle priestley taylor pt jensen haise irmak ir and turc tr allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 yoder et al 2005 berengena and gavilán 2005 berti et al 2014 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2017 unfortunately the pmf 56 method requires complete climatic data that may be unavailable in certain locations particularly within developing countries and therefore is difficult to apply in these cases alternative methods that rely on a few climatic data are used recently artificial intelligence techniques like gene expression programming gep are proposed as alternative approach ferreira 2001a had developed gep gep is a computational technique which allows automatically generating algorithms and expressions to solve the problems this algorithm is used to implement symbolic regression to get a mathematical function that fits a data set sakthivel et al 2012 gep is the natural development of genetic algorithms gas goldberg 1989 and genetic programming gp koza 1992 gep involves encoded computer programs nonlinear entities of different shapes and sizes expression trees in linear strings of fixed lengths chromosomes ferreira 2001a 2001b many studies examined the application of gep in hydraulic and hydrological modeling whigham and crapper 2001 applied gep to model rainfall runoff in australia shiri and kişi 2011 used recorded climatic parameters to compare gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and artifical neural netwark estimating the daily pan evaporation shiri et al 2012 used gep to estimate the daily et o for four climatic stations in northern spain where the gep model s performance was better than the anfis hs and pt models traore and guven 2013 successfully used gep to model et o using climatic data from tropical dry regions in burkina faso terzi 2013 compared anfis wth gep to estimate daily pan evaporation in turkey shiri et al 2014a 2014b evaluated a gep model to estimate evaporation and et o by spatial and temporal data scanning techniques marti et al 2015 compared lysimetric vs penman monteith et o targets in gep models alazba et al 2016 and yassin et al 2016a 2016b used gep to estimate the daily et o under arid environment in saudi arabia shiri 2017 compared gep with empirical models to estimate daily et o in hyper arid regions of iran their results indicated that gep technique is the best methodology for estimating et o more water savings will definitely bring about the opportunity to expand the irrigated areas improve water resources management and increase food production this will be great in ensuring food security in countries effective and serious action programs are required to increase crop water productivity and reduce water losses accordingly et o needs to be calculated accurately the problem of incomplete or missing climatic data has a significant impact on the estimation of et o therefore et o must be simulated by using the available minimal number of climatic variables therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 study the feasibility of gep models with limited climatic variables to predict the mean monthly et o 2 evaluate the performance of gep models developed with pmf 56 set as the true reference values using statistical criteria and 3 compare the accuracy of the results obtained from these models with the results of other empirical equations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data egypt with area of about 1 002 450 km2 is located between 22 and 31 36 15 n latitude and between 24 41 49 and 36 53 42 e longitude the climate in egypt is characterized as being extremely dry all over the country except on the northern mediterranean coast that receives rainfall in winter extremely hot weather during summer months is a general climatic feature of egypt even though the daytime temperatures are obviously moderate along the northern coast in northern coast region the average minimum temperature vary from 9 5 c in winter to 23 c in summer and the average maximum temperature vary from 17 c in winter to 32 c in summer in the central and the southern regions the daytime temperature is higher particularly in summers the average maximum temperature exceeds 40 c therefore different regions were considered in the study to cover all the areas in the country the climatic data used in this study were collected from 32 weather stations obtained from the united nations food and agriculture organization un fao database known as climwat smith 1993 from 2013 to 2015 the spatial distribution of the selected stations is shown in fig 1 the data include the long term mean monthly for the maximum and minimum air temperatures t max and t min c mean relative humidity rh solar radiation r s mj m 2 d 1 and wind speed at 2 m height u 2 m s 1 in addition to et o mm d 1 computed with the pmf 56 equation the pmf 56 equation is highly rated across a wide range of climate allen et al 1998 and is used to evaluate the results of mathematical et o models as a reference standerd irmak et al 2002 zanetti et al 2007 landeras et al 2008 jain et al 2008 dai et al 2009 traore et al 2010 the pmf 56 equation is defined by allen et al 1998 as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here et o is in mm d 1 r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean monthly air temperature at 2 m height c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve at mean air temperature kpa c 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 m 2 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa allen et al 1998 are used equations to calculate these parameters in this study gep models has at most five input variables t max t min rh r s and u 2 and et o the output variable is eto the data are divided into three sets first the training set consisted of 70 230 data points of data recorded by 27 weather stations the remaining 30 of the data from these weather stations were used as a set of test data the second set to run the trained models the third set included the extracted data from the remaining five weather stations 15 of the entire data it is used to validate and make the final check on the trained model s performance table 1 shows the monthly statistical parameters of the applied data sets where x mean x max x min s x c sx and k x denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient respectively combinations were used to estimate the mean monthly et o using the gep technique as represented in table 2 eight gep models were implemented to exam the performance of different climatic data combinations the first combination has two input climatic data points t max and t min this combination was designed as a temperature based model similar to the hargreaves and samani hs model by inserting rh and rs into the first combination respectively the second and third combinations were formed the irmak ir model shows the same inputs as those found in the third combination the fourth combination was made by adding u 2 into the first combination by inserting rs and u 2 into the second combination respectively the fifth and sixth combinations were formed this fifth combination s inputs are identical to those of the turc tr model the seventh combination was made by adding u 2 into the third combination the eighth combination included all climatic data except the temperature data 2 2 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep has been presented lately as a modification of gp ferreira 2001b in gep chromosomes individuals are linear entities with fixed length expressing the encoded genetic information subsequently the genetic information is converted at a later stage to non linear entities of varying length and sizes computer programs or expression trees the chromosomes can have one or more genes with each gene encoding genotype a smaller subprogram each chromosome in the initial population is then expressed phenotype through a random generation process a set of fitness function equations are used to evaluate the fitness of each individual chromosome ferreira 2006 these chromosomes with better solutions are then selected on the basis of their fitness values that are reproduced with modification and re evaluation by the genetic operators as mutation inversion transposition and recombination this process is repeated to find a correct solution i e chromosomes and achieve the required accuracy ferreira 2001a b in gep there are two languages one of the genes k expression and the other of expression trees each gene has a head and a tail the head includes symbols that represent terminals and functions whereas the tail includes only terminals 2 3 development of the gep models the computer program called genexprotools 5 0 gepsoft 2014 was used to implement gep just as the training set is selected the learning environment of the system is defined the remaining data from the selected weather stations were used as the testing set the first step is to determine the terminals set which includes some of the independent variables tmax tmin rh rs and u 2 to be used in individual computer programs the second step includes the set of functions some basic mathematical functions x 2 power ln x with four basic arithmetic operators were used in this study these functions were applied to provide better results for modeling evapotranspiration shiri et al 2012 the terminals and functions are the ingredients of the individual computer programs the third step is to choose an appropriate fitness function the root mean square error rmse function was used to calculate the overall fitness of the evolved programs the fourth step is to select the linking function an addition linking function was used to link the mathematical terms encoded in each gene algebraic sub trees the next step is to choose the genetic operators i e mutation inversion transposition and recombination which were all used mutation is the most efficient operator ferreira 2002 and can change genomes by replacing any symbol terminals and functions at any location and at any time in a chromosome in gep mutation the structural organization of chromosomes remains the same inversion can be easily implemented by inverting a small sequence within the head of gene ranging from at least two symbols to as big as the gene itself that is chosen randomly transposition has three types insertion sequence is root insertion sequence ris and gene transposition is transposition is restricted to operate on the gene heads only this operator chooses a chromosome randomly and short genomic segments with a function or terminal at the first position transposes to a accidentally selected position in the gene head excluding the root ris transposition is similar to is transposition however short genomic segments which have a function in the first position that transposes to the starting point of the gene in gene transposition an entire gene acts as a transposon that transposes itself through a random complete gene of a random chromosome to start point of this chromosome recombination or crossover has three types one point two point and gene recombination in one point recombination a pair of parent chromosomes is randomly selected and split up at exactly the same point to create two new chromosomes ferreira 2006 two point recombination is the same process the only difference is that two points are randomly chosen in the parent chromosome as crossover points guven and aytek 2009 guven and talu 2010 in gene recombination the entire genes are switched between two parent chromosomes including genes from both parents the new chromosomes created by recombination will always encode syntactically correct programs the parameters used in gep modeling are summarized in table 3 the final step is to determine the criteria to terminate the run when there was no improvement in the fitness function rmse value the program was stopped the final result is a mathematical expression that defines the relationship between variables inputs and results outputs which can be used to predict the outcomes a lot of climatic variable combinations were tried as input sets to gep for the models formulation the final equations obtained from gep are shown in table 4 for eight combinations the description for the expression trees of the gep6 formulation with the best performance after the training process is illustrated in fig 2 2 4 empirical et o models hs equation mean monthly et o was estimated by hargreaves and samani 1985 the hs equation is given by 2 e t o 0 0023 r a λ t max t min t 17 8 here et o is in mm d 1 r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 ir equation irmak et al 2003 developed an equation for estimating et o in mm d 1 in the form 3 e t o 0 611 0 149 r s 0 079 t tr equation tr equation turc 1961 was developed in western europe and used moderately in the united states e g amatya et al 1995 this equation is written as 4 e t o a t 0 013 t t 15 23 8856 r s 50 λ here et o is in mm d 1 the value of a t equals unity when the relative humidity is higher than 50 otherwise a t is given by a t 1 50 r h 70 2 5 statistical evaluation the et o estimated using the gep and the other empirical models were compared with et o estimated using pmf 56 equation the coefficient of determination r2 rmse overall index of model performance oi and index of agreement ia were used for evaluating the performance of these models definitions of these parameters are as follows 5 r 2 i 1 n e i e c i c 2 i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n c i c 2 6 r m s e i 1 n e i c i 2 n 7 o i 1 2 2 r m s e e x e n i 1 n e i c i 2 i 1 n e i e 2 8 i a 1 i 1 n e i c i 2 i 1 n c i e e i e 2 here e i is the pmf 56 estimated et o value c i is the gep estimated et o value n is the number of data points e is the average pmf 56 estimated value c is the average gep estimated value and e x and e n are the maximum and minimum pmf 56 estimated value respectively r2 measures the degree of correlation among the pmf 56 estimated and gep estimated et o values with values close to 1 0 indicating good model performance rmse is a measure of the residual variance licciardello et al 2007 the gep gives more accurate estimation when the rmse has low value oi ranges from to 1 and 1 indicates a perfect fit between the pmf 56 and gep estimated et o values alazba et al 2012 the ia was proposed by willmot 1981 to represent the ratio between the mean square error and the potential error ia takes values from 0 to 1 the worst and the perfect fits legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance analysis of gep in figs 3 and 4 the gep model estimates were compared with the pmf 56 estimated data via scatter plots for the training and testing sets additionally linear regression is applied for evaluating the models performance statistically table 5 presentsd the statistics of rmse oi and ia statistics in each gep model during training and testing processes as shown in figs 3 and 4 the gep2 and gep4 gep8 models results lie around the 45 straight line perfect line indicating that there are no bias effects as in the case of gep1 and gep 3 models gep1 and gep3 showed a bad correlation with pmf 56 estimated et o it can be also observed in the fit lines equations assuming that the equation is y αo x α1 that the slopes αo are closer to one and the intercepts α1 almost reach zero for all gep models excluding gep1 and gep3 the value of oi and ia for gep1 and gep3 was lower than that for the rest of the models however the rmse value was higher in the training and testing processes table 5 gep1 its inputs were the air temperatures only showed the largest intercepts 1 106 and 1 065 and lowest slopes 0 767 and 0 78 with r2 of 0 768 and 0 784 in training and testing processes figs 3 and 4 respectively gep3 in training and testing processes showed r2 values 5 6 and 3 19 higher than those resulted from gep1 the rmse values decreased by 9 81 and 5 89 for the training and testing processes respectively while the oi values gave an increase by 2 76 and 1 3 for the training and testing processes respectively the ia values increased by 1 5 and 0 85 for the training and testing processes respectively table 5 therefore the et o estimation accuracy was slightly improved when r s data were added to gep1 this is similar to results reported by traore and guven 2013 for burkina faso they reported that the performance slightly varied for gep models with t max t min and r s r2 0 598 than those from temperature data alone r2 0 588 conversely replacing r s data with rh or u 2 data resulted in a better performance for gep2 and gep4 than gep3 the intercept values for gep2 and gep4 were close to zero and the slope was close to one figs 3 and 4 the r2 values were 0 915 and 0 925 on average for gep2 and gep4 respectively during training and testing processes that is the values increased by 12 96 and 14 2 than those from gep2 this is also confirmed by the rmse oi and ia values in table 5 these models showed that the effect of rh and u 2 variable is significant contributing 48 58 and 18 07 respectively these results agreed with the results of fisher et al 2005 and of xiaoying and erda 2005 it was found that et o is sensitive to u 2 it is also observed that the r s data when incorporated together with rh or u 2 data as input parameters to gep5 or gep7 gave good estimates in term of r2 value it was improved for gep5 and gep7 on average by 17 47 and 16 91 respectively compared to gep3 in the training and testing processes gep5 for training and testing processes on average had oi and ia values that was about 11 35 and 4 55 which was more accurate than that from gep3 the corresponding values of oi and ia for gep7 increased by about 10 88 and 4 39 respectively compared to gep3 moreover rmse for gep5 or gep7 also decreased to about half the value recorded for gep3 table 5 when gep6 added rh and u 2 to gep1 it significantly increased the performance and resulted in the larger slope 0 96 and 0 95 and lower interception 0 195 and 0 239 in the training and testing processes figs 3 and 4 respectively in addition the low scattering of the data points was observed around the perfect line the values of r2 for gep6 increased drastically by 25 39 and 22 7 than that for gep1 the rmse value was extremely low while the oi and ia values were very close to one indicating excellent agreement between the et o estimated from pmf 56 and gep6 this implies that the rh and u 2 importance ratio of 23 52 and 22 96 respectively data are more effective in estimating the et o this result is consistent with kişi and ozturk 2007 traore et al 2010 ozkan et al 2011 and huo et al 2012 while t max and t min data are not available gep8 is the most suited model with slopes close to one 0 946 and 0 954 interception of 0 225 and r2 of 0 948 figs 3 and 4 this was indicated by the higher values of oi 0 948 and ia 0 986 for gep8 were close to one for the training set while rmse 0 508 mm d 1 value was close to zero similarly for the testing data set the lower values of the rmse was 0 546 mm d 1 close to zero while oi and ia values were 0 942 and 0 984 close to one the gep models behaved well with both the training and test data as there were no important differences in the r2 rmse oi and ia values given by the training and testing datasets table 5 3 2 spatial validation of the gep models validation was done in order to confirm the accuracy of the presented gep models the reference for this validation is the et o estimated by using the pmf 56 equation fig 5 compared the mean monthly values of the et o estimated by using the gep models with the et o estimated by using the pmf 56 for the five selected stations mersa matruh ismailia baharia asyut and kom ombo table 6 shows the statistical analysis of the et o for the validation performances in fig 5 for mersa matruh station the gep5 estimates were closer to the corresponding pmf 56 estimated et o values with a lower pmse value 0 165 and higher oi and ia values 0 968 and 0 994 than those of the other models table 6 performance wise gep2 and gep8 are ranked as the second and third best models respectively however gep4 and gep7 showed low accuracy in estimating et o as they contain the temperature and u 2 data with no rh data fig 5 shows that gep4 and gep7 had the highest deviation compared to gep2 and gep5 respectively indicating that there was gross overestimation among the gep models used the rmse oi and ia table 6 for gep4 and gep7 confirmed their poor performance it can be observed that for gep2 gep5 and gep8 models rh is a significant variable that affects the et o because mersa matruh station is located in a humid climate shiri et al 2013a also found that models including rh gave more accurate results when in a humid region because of the higher influence of rh on et o in such regions the gep2 model appears to be slightly better than the gep8 in robustness the other gep model overestimated the mean monthly pmf 56 et o at mersa matruh station with a rmse from 1 114 to 1 899 mm d 1 oi from 0 217 to 0 724 and ia from 0 738 to 0 835 for the three stations ismailia baharia and asyut the estimated et o values from gep models showed the same trend of the training and testing data it is clear from the scatter plots in fig 5 that the gep6 estimates are closer to the corresponding et o values when using pmf 56 than the other models from table 6 it can be observed that the estimated et o values show much better accuracies in gep6 than the other gep models gep6 gave values on average for rmse as 0 353 mm d 1 oi as 0 958 and ia as 0 993 the rmse value was close to zero while oi and ia values were very close to one indicating an excellent agreement between the pmf 56 results and estimated results from gep6 as shown in fig 5 and table 6 in kom ombo station all the gep models overestimated et o and gave large errors except for gep4 gep6 and gep7 these models exhibited very good performances which may be due to the amalgamated effects of u 2 this station however exhibited high precision with a rmse of 0 688 mm d 1 oi of 0 871 and ia of 0 959 for gep4 gep7 is ranked as the second best model gep2 and gep5 provided the worst results because of the presence of rh gep2 produced et o values with 131 26 and 40 77 lower accuracy in oi and ia values respectively than those from gep4 rmse for gep2 increased by a factor of 3 3 from 0 688 mm d 1 in gep4 to 2 967 mm d 1 in gep2 the rmse value for gep5 was almost 2 28 times that of the value for gep7 the oi and ia values from gep5 was 89 80 and 27 57 respectively lower than those from gep7 this shows the importance of u 2 data to calculate et o at a station located in arid region 3 3 performance of gep models compared to empirical methods table 7 presents comparison for the performances of the gep and the empirical models hs ir and tr it is obviously seen from the table that gep1 temperature based model estimates have better accuracy than those of the hs model according to r2 values it can be said that gep1 has the best estimates this confirms the oi and ia statistics that were about 7 8 and 4 85 more accurate than that of the hs the rmse value for the gep1 model was 15 82 more accurate this result agreed with the results of shiri et al 2012 2013b table 7 shows that gep3 has a better generalization ability in et o modeling when compared to the ir radiation based method consistent with yassin et al 2016b the ir model produced et o values that was 25 78 more accurate in rmse value than that from the gep3 model in terms of oi and ia gep3 were 16 53 and 14 26 respectively less accurate than the ir model it is clear from table 7 that gep5 is a suited model with a higher r2 value of 0 918 than that of the tr model the tr model exhibited the poorest performance with oi and ia that decreases drastically from 0 925 to 0 312 i e 133 74 decrease and from 0 978 to 0 535 i e 45 3 decrease respectively the rmse value for the tr model was almost 5 09 times than that for the gep5 model this is an agreement with shiri et al 2013b in table 7 the performance indices revealed that the gep models were superior among the overall empirical models this is because the gep models had the lowest rmse and the highest oi and ia for all stations therefore the gep technique can contribute in solving the climatic data unavailability problem in egypt 4 conclusions it is difficult to calculate reference evapotranspiration et o using climatic data that are sometimes missing in some developing countries e g egypt implementation of a gene expression programming gep technique for estimating the mean monthly et o using climatic variables was done in this study the gep models performances are studied by comparing with the penman monteith fao 56 which was the standard equation in situations in which only maximum and minimum air temperatures t max and t min data are available gep1 should be applied for estimating et o with t max and t min if neither mean relative humidity rh nor wind speed at 2 m height u 2 data are available the gep models i e gep2 and gep4 have a better performances than in the case of only t max t min and solar radiation values i e gep3 availability therefore when considering t max t min rh and u 2 i e gep6 in the estimation et o the gep model s performance has superiority thus rh and u 2 are the most effective variables and highly recommended for modeling et o on the other hand the gep models have a better performance when compared to the empirical hargreaves and samani irmak and turc models consequently the gep model is fairly a promising approach and a powerful tool to be used by irrigation schedulers and users without the recourse to the complete set of climatic data requirement for accurately estimating et o in egypt acknowledgement with sincere respect and gratitude we would like to express our deepest gratitude to the deanship of scientific research king saud university and agriculture research center college of food and agriculture sciences for the financial support and encouragement 
11576,rice oryza sativa l grown in uplands is exposed to variable soil water conditions and unpredictable periods of water stress ws the study was conducted to determine the impacts of ws imposed at different phenological stages of upland rice on growth phenology recovery of source size yield and water use efficiency wue the popular cv nerica 4 grown in africa was sown under a rain out shelter for two seasons treatments included a well watered control ct and stress imposed by withholding water for the duration of different stages tillering ti panicle initiation pi anthesis at and grain filling gf name codes used for treatments were thus ct sti spi sat and sgf when water was withheld soil water content in the 0 0 6 m soil layer dropped to approximately 50 of plant available water while stomatal conductance of the abaxial leaf surface and leaf area index decreased significantly suggesting that severe stress was experienced growing degree days to reach the different growth stages were roughly equal in both seasons even though sowing was in the mid summer of 2013 2014 and early summer of 2014 2015 respectively time to reach peak tillering could not be explained by temperatures and cumulative solar radiation during growth the onset of reproduction was highly significantly p 0001 delayed by water stress independent of whether tiller abortion occurred or not findings suggest that lower plant densities are recommended to cope with stress during pi to reduce water loss and control unproductive tillers at harvest it is concluded that stress during late reproductive stages unlike during pi does not alter crop duration and has a negligible effect on water loss and wue farmers with limited irrigation water can try to avoid ws by making sure they irrigate during pi and save water during later reproductive stages keywords delayed development plant available water water stress thermal time water use efficiency nerica 1 introduction about 11 of the global rice oryza sativa l cultivated area is in uplands irri 2002 growing rice in non puddled unsaturated and well drained soils upland systems kato and katsura 2014 is gaining popularity over flooded rice for various merits this share is likely to increase particularly because of growing recognition to save water in rice systems bouman 2001 kato et al 2006 growth in rice production and acreage in sub saharan africa ssa is estimated at 7 per annum and can be ascribed to the release of improved new rice for africa nerica cultivars arc 2007 these progenies are the result of interspecific crossings between african indigenous upland rice oryza glaberrima steud and asian lowland rice oryza sativa l japonica and were developed for low input systems jones et al 1997 the yield of rice in rainfed conditions is comparatively lower in uplands 1 5 2 5 mg ha 1 than for lowlands 2 5 4 5 mg ha 1 and approximately 30 lower under similar water supply conditions arc 2007 kato and katsura 2014 this yield difference among japonica rice cultivars was marginal when water supply was unlimited kato et al 2009 meaning that high potential cultivars need full irrigation although water saving technologies including aerobic systems have reduced water inputs compared to conventional flooded rice tuong et al 2004 levels of water application are still quite high the irrigation strategy practiced in aerobic rice systems is to raise soil water content to about field capacity if rainfall is insufficient bouman 2001 investigations are therefore needed to determine the minimum water requirements for maximum rice productivity in most parts of africa upland rice is rainfed kijoji et al 2014 and periods of ws are unpredictable due to poor rainfall distribution response of rice to ws generally varies with duration intensity of stress heinemann et al 2011 and most importantly the growth stage when stress occurs the three main growth phases of rice are the vegetative reproduction and ripening stages which are subdivided into 10 principle growth stages fageria 2007 and which overlap even within a single plant because the rice crop makes tillers of different chronological ages stress in rice plants was reported to develop at ψsoil 86 kpa for lowland conditions bouman et al 2001 and at ψsoil 100 kpa in potted upland soil asch et al 2005 but sensitivity of physiological processes such as transpiration and leaf expansion to ws differs along the crop cycle devatgar et al 2009 heinemann et al 2011 mechanisms to cope with ws in oryza sativa l are thus well documented for pot growth chamber and lysimeter studies although such conditions may not represent field conditions well parent et al 2010 kijoji et al 2014 for instance ψsoil between 60 and 140 kpa at 0 25 cm depth which are reported as threshold values for lowland rice growth in anaerobic soils bouman et al 2001 may be atypical of upland conditions where i surface soil can be dryer than 600 kpa jensen et al 1998 and ii roots can exploit soil layers deeper than 30 cm lilley and fukai 1994 drought effects on rice growth depends on the timing thereof stress between germination and flowering was reported to delay development in lowland and in upland rice wopereis et al 1996 boojung and fukai 1996 but the delay in development was much more pronounced in direct seeded upland rice compared to transplanted lowland rice kijoji et al 2014 water stress during the ripening stage reportedly also hastens development dingkuhn and le gal 1996 the duration of these phases can also be altered by excess water dingkuhn and asch 1999 and it remains to be investigated if upland rice is tolerant to some degree of soil saturation most studies such as the one by boojung and fukai 1996 did not quantify thermal time which makes it difficult to assess how sensitive the phenology of upland rice is to ws research that generates information on changes in growing degree day gdd requirements for different stages under water limited conditions will be useful for optimising crop production systems that entirely depend on rainfall of which the distribution is usually uneven in addition to changes in the duration of different developmental stages drought affects rice plants in various other ways stress between flowering and grain filling increases spikelet sterility matsuo et al 2010 and during panicle initiation pi it inhibits panicle exertion okada et al 2002 but asch et al 2005 reported that when stressed during vegetative growth dry matter partioning was not affected stress at one stage can also have cumulative effects on subsequent components for instance tiller abortion with stress during early growth wopereis et al 1996 may reduce panicle number associated with tiller number and the final spikelet number per unit area no investigation considered the duration of developmental stages and demonstrated such effects with ws at all above stages in a single field study thus relative yield loss due to stress during different phenological stages and ideal traits to cope with stress at each growth stage have not been studied well before with respect to alterations in phenology it has not been established if delay in flowering under vegetative stress may be a result of new tillers developing after relieve of severe stress tiller abortion tiller inhibition without death after mild stress or due to alteration in dry matter partitioning between plant organs it is noteworthy that rice tillering is spread over time delays in phenology has been related to size of source or canopy and recovery dry matter partitioning and growth stage in relation to leaf number boojung and fukai 1996 prasertsak and fukai 1997 bouman et al 2001 with some contrasting reports an aspect that has not been well reported is whether recovery of source capacity e g canopy size after stress will be to the same level as for a well watered control and whether it will affect the final grain yield clarification of source sink relations is needed since ws during vegetative growth is known to slow development of rice the crop therefore continues to grow accumulates dry matter but at a decreasing rate it is noteworthy that crop development is different from growth a crop that has recovered from stress can be of the same canopy size and similar height as a well watered one but at a different developmental stage it is also important to identify desirable traits for yield improvement with stress during different developmental stages in view of variable and cumulative effects of ws on growth and changes after recovery there is lack of information on effects of drought stress during different developmental stages on phenology thermal time accumulation sink source relations when the stressed crop attains a similar development stage as a well watered crop and water use efficiency wue this information is scarce because of a paucity of field studies on ws in rice especially in unsaturated uplands kato et al 2006 despite the significance of the crop the overall objective of this study was to determine the effects of water stress on upland rice cv nerica 4 crop growth and phenology and to identify the contribution of plant characteristics to yield at each developmental stage the specific objectives were i to evaluate dry matter partitioning and leaf n content when a crop has recovered from ws compared to a well watered control and ii to quantify water use and wue when a rice crop was stressed at different developmental stages it is envisaged that this research will inform upland rice growers on best management practices to minimise yield loss under water stress and breeders on traits for adapting rice to water limitations 2 materials and methods 2 1 planting material upland rice cultivar nerica 4 wab450 i b p 91 hb jones et al 1997 ndjiondjop et al 1998 seed was acquired from the national crop resources research institute nacrri in uganda cultivar nerica 4 is widely adopted in west and east africa arc 2007 and was chosen because of its high grain yield estimated at around 4 7 mg ha 1 under rainfed conditions and because it is still the top ranked cultivar in tropical rice producing areas such as uganda lamo et al 2010 imanywoha et al 2004 furthermore farmers prefer nerica 4 to other nerica cultivars for its heavy grains and medium growth duration 2 2 study site and rain out shelter experimental set up the trial was conducted in a rain out shelter on the hatfield experimental farm of the university of pretoria south africa located at 25 45 s 28 16 e and 1370 m a s l from december 2013 to june 2014 season 1 and from october 2014 to april 2015 season 2 the sowing dates are within the planting window of summer crops in south africa and other parts of ssa daily solar radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures and relative humidity and wind speed were recorded and short grass reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated by an automatic weather station located approximately 100 m from the rain out shelter vapour pressure was calculated from relative humidity and temperature daily weather parameters during

was laid out on the opposite side of the rain out shelter which was rested in the first season 2 3 agronomic practices seeds of nerica 4 were manually sown directly at about 0 03 m depth in dry soil sowing was done on 5 december 2013 mid summer and 7 october 2014 early summer in the respective seasons an inter row spacing of 0 25 m was used in plots measuring 3 75 m 2 75 m and separated by 0 75 m walkways before sowing n p k 4 3 4 30 zn fertilizer was applied at a rate of 54 kg n 40 5 kg p and 54 kg k per hectare and incorporated into the soil limestone ammonium nitrate 28 n was top dressed on

the africa rice centre arc and timing of top dressing was done to optimise n uptake arc 2007 fageria 2007 prior to implementation of drip irrigation sprinklers were used to irrigate about 15 mm weekly

0 04 m equivalent to a population of 1 106 plants ha 1 soil water deficit in the 0 0 4 m soil layer was replenished to field capacity twice weekly except for water stress treatments until a month before harvest using a high density drip irrigation system profile soil water content θ was estimated at 0 2 m depth intervals from readings of a neutron probe water metre model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear california usa that was calibrated for the site weeds were regularly removed by hand malathion active ingredient o o dimethyl phosphorodithioate was sprayed once for aphids and tiforine active ingredient azoxystrobin for rice blast according to manufacturer instructions symptoms of the disease were mild and aphid damage was minimal because spraying was done at an early stage of incidence 2 4 identification of developmental stages visual observations were made to characterize crop phenology the zadoks decimal code for cereals was used to describe the developmental stages zadoks et al 1974 fageria et al 2010 before and after introduction of stress treatments developmental stages of rice as described by irri 2002 were identified based on morphological features for instance mean tiller number during the active tillering stage and grain colour and texture during physiological maturity the panicle initiation stage was marked by the observation of a furry tip of panicle primordium above the growing points under a light microscope four main stems were weekly randomly sampled from three well watered plots from the day of second tiller appearance about 21 dae until peak tillering stems were cut just above the crown hydrated in glycerol for 24 h and dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol for subsequent days james and tas 1984 longitudinal sections were prepared and examined under a microscope the number of folded and open leaves counted under a microscope was used to confirm stages 2 5 experimental design and water stress treatments the trial was laid out as a completely randomized block design crbd with three replications the five water treatments were randomly allocated to each replicate giving a total of 15 plots all plots were well irrigated until a growth stage gs of interest was reached whereafter water was withheld completely to induce ws from the onset of the following development stages dvs tillering panicle initiation anthesis or 50 flowering and grain filling the five treatments were as follows i ct well watered control irrigating twice weekly 2 4 day interval to replenish the soil water content in the top 0 0 4 m soil layer to field capacity ii sti stress during tillering or early vegetative stage or dvs 0 4 from gs 2 3 two tillers per plant on average to gs 6 0 iii spi stress during panicle initiation or early reproductive stage or dvs 0 53 from gs 6 0 panicle primordium visible under a microscope to gs 10 3 iv sat stress around anthesis or dvs 0 90 from gs 10 3 50 of the stems have flowered flowers may just be emerging for some tillers to gs 11 2 v sgf stress around grain filling stage ii or soft dough stage or dvs 1 0 from gs 10 2 grains are turning from green to brown and are not milky anymore to gs 11 3 or dvs 2 0 physiological maturity pm flag leaf drying and 90 grains are brown initiation of the stress treatments above was based on crop development under well watered conditions irrigation in all plots was terminated on the same day during both seasons the periods of stress days after emergence in season 1 were sti 43 66 spi 66 95 sat 95 117 and sgf 117 144 and in season 2 were sti 51 75 spi 78 101 sat 101 121 and sgf 121 138 due to one incident in season 2 when the rain out shelter failed to close during a rainfall event stress was ended prematurely during tillering and slightly delayed in panicle initiation temporary portable rain out structures were then constructed and placed over each of the plots that was stressed during pi whenever there was a threat of rain the structures were used for five days only until the shelter was repaired 2 6 plant growth analysis yield and leaf n uptake plant height and number of tillers was monitored weekly on 10 plants in the centre row of each plot plant height was measured from the ground surface to the tallest green leaf tillering was monitored at least weekly from the date of first tiller appearance gs 2 0 at 19 and 17 dae in the respective seasons but more frequently in the earlier stages before anthesis tillers were also counted on sampled plants during biomass measurements for destructive growth analysis sampling 14 plants were sampled weekly from 30 to 130 dae from an area of 0 5 m 0 25 m per treatment by carefully cutting off the plants at ground level in some occasions biomass harvests were done after 10 days from the previous date of harvest leaf blades were separated from the stems and passed through an li 3100 leaf area metre licor lincoln nebraska usa to determine leaf area and to calculate leaf area index lai stems leaves panicles and grains were separated and dm yields were determined after oven drying the samples at 65 70 c for at least 48 h or until constant mass at final harvest aboveground dry matter adm yield was determined by cutting off all the plants at ground level from a net plot area of 1 75 m 1 50 m excluding border rows total biomass was weighed fresh for moisture content determination and grains were separated from the stover after threshing the mass of grains less empty grains and stover was weighed on a scale 0 1 kg precision sub samples of the stover 90 120 g and grain 20 g from each plot were oven dried at 65 c for at least 48 h total dry biomass yields were then calculated from the fresh yields and dry matter contents of the different components grain yield was adjusted to a 12 moisture content for comparison with commercial harvests to assess n uptake of stress recovered and well watered crops flag leaves from the main stems of 25 plants in each plot were sampled 25 30 days after heading dah and before grain filling this stage marks peak n accumulation in rice flag leaves which is critical during grain filling shiratsuchi et al 2006 leaves were dried and analysed for total n content using the dumas method in n pro rapid nitrogen protein analyzer equipment dumatherm c gerhardt gmbh co königswinter germany yield components were assessed by considering plants sampled from a 0 75 m 0 5 m subplot stems were counted and recorded as either non productive tillers without panicles or tillers with panicles ten panicles were randomly selected from each plot and their lengths measured the spikelets in each panicle were detached and counted to determine the number of spikelets and panicle size the mean number of spikelets from 10 panicles was then expressed per unit area spikelets were floated in water to separate empty and full grains oven dried and weighed full grain ratio and sterility were computed as the ratio of full or empty grain mass to the total spikelet mass full grains were counted using a seed counter numigral triplette and renaud paris france and the mass of 1000 grains was weighed the mass was standardized to 12 moisture content to determine the 1000 grain mass 2 7 measurement of radiation interception water stress and soil water content interception of photosynthetically active radiation par 0 4 0 7 μm by the canopy was determined at least three times every month by measuring photosynthetic par above and below the canopy at ground level with a 1 m long decagon sunfleck ceptometer decagon devices pullman washington usa four points were measured diagonally across rows in each plot and the average value was computed profile soil water content θ at 0 2 m depth intervals was estimated from the readings of a neutron probe model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear california usa that was calibrated for the site at the start of the experiment and before planting soil samples were taken at 0 2 m depth increments using an auger composite samples from each depth were analysed for soil chemical and physical properties a soil water retention curve swrc for the top 1 m soil layer was also determined using a wp4 t dewpoint hygrometer wp4 t potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman washington usa with an accuracy of 0 1 mpa after calibration with the gravimetric method van genuchten et al 1991 the swrc was also plotted on a log scale log pressure head cm using retc software for describing hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils scientific software group salt lake city utah usa the curves for different depths were used to calculate the actual values of ψsoil during dry periods soil water pressure head h was estimated from values of θ mm using a graph of θ vs h and h was then converted into soil ψsoil using the following equation ψ soil ρ w g h where ρw the density of water 1000 kg m 3 g acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s 1 and h m pressure head is a negative value field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were then estimated from the swrc evapotranspiration et was calculated using the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 i p et δs d r where i irrigation p precipitation d drainage and r runoff p d and r were considered negligible a high density drip irrigation system with water meters was used to apply the applicable water amount to each treatment irrigation water was summed from sowing to maturity during stress periods irrigation water was completely withheld except for one event when the shelter failed to close in 2014 15 the change in storage δs was calculated as the difference in θ between consecutive neutron probe readings during stress periods the first neutron probe readings were taken about three days after the last irrigation this was considered as the start of stress when calculating the initial θ soil water content calculated at the end of the water stress period was taken as terminal θ stomatal conductance gs on the upper adaxial and lower abaxial surfaces of the uppermost fully expanded leaf was occasionally measured using a decagon sc 1 leaf porometer decagon devices inc pullman washington usa four replicate stomatal conductance measurements per plot were taken at around 11 45 15 20 range of time for all readings made in both seasons on the same plants from the start to the end of stress periods a measurement in a plot under stress was followed by a measurement in a well watered plot to avoid any bias that could arise by delayed timing of measurements stomatal response to ws was later expressed as the mean relative value that is the ratio of mean gs under stress to mean gs for the ct to normalise variations in atmospheric demand between stages during stress it was not possible to take frequent measurements of gs due to unavailability of the porometer and therefore the number of measurements during stress was not equal between growth stages 2 8 computation of crop growth parameters crop growth parameters were calculated using equations described by watson 1952 lopes and reynolds 2010 and fageria et al 2010 crop dry matter accumulation rate g m 2 d 1 was calculated as the increase in adm from the harvested land area per unit time the total one sided leaf area m2 was divided by the sampling area m2 to obtain the leaf area index lai on days of growth analysis sampling leaf area duration lad between harvests was calculated as the area under the lai curve over time which mathematically is an integral of lai over time thermal time to reach different growth stages was calculated by accumulating daily growing degree days cd from sowing using a base temperature of 8 2 c for african rice and crosses thereof shrestha et al 2011 dry masses of individual plant parts were summed to obtain adm the apparent contribution of photosynthesis or reserve assimilates from pre reproductive stages to grain filling dmc was calculated using the equation by yoshida et al 1972 dm c adm m adm xi where admm is the aboveground dry matter yield at maturity and admxi is the aboveground dry matter yield at either pre flowering or pre anthesis in the case of this study the apparent contribution was then expressed as a percentage of ii admm and ii the final grain yield grain harvest index hi was computed as the ratio of grain mass fully developed grains to total adm on a dry mass basis sink size was calculated as the product of the mass of 1000 grains and number of grains per metre square kato et al 2006 dry matter efficiency dme was calculated as the hi divided by the number of days to crop maturity watson 1952 dry matter efficiency was calculated because of delay in physiological maturity for one treatment the relative decline in growth and yield was calculated as the difference in the parameter between a water stress treatment and the ct divided by the yield for the ct stress index water use efficiency was calculated during stress periods and for the entire season during stress wue was calculated as the difference in adm kg m 2 between the start and end of stress divided by et mm and for the entire season as grain yield in kg ha 1 on dry mass basis divided by total et mm 2 9 statistical analysis the general linear model glm procedure in sas 9 3 version 6 1 7061 for windows cary nc sas institute inc 2012 was used to perform statistical analyses correlation analysis were performed on selected growth variables and derived parameters during stress for crop growth rate and final yield components under stress and well watered conditions to determine the degree of relationship and their contribution to variation in yields pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to indicate the most consistently related yield component to grain yield analysis of variance anova was performed with treatments and seasons as factors and growth yield and water status indicators as variables means for main and interaction effects were separated using tukey s studentized range test at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels of significance in order to test for statistical differences in weather parameters that determine crop water use between seasons the f test two sample for variances was applied for every pair of daily temperatures eto and vpd 3 results 3 1 weather conditions crop phenology and development the measured mean maximum and minimum air temperatures of 27 4 c and 14 9 c season 1 and 29 2 c and 15 6 c season 2 were optimal for rice growth especially during critical stages of booting to flowering evaporative demand during the experimental period was fairly similar between years average reference evapotranspiration from sowing to physiological maturity pm period of approximately 149 days was 3 93 and 4 59 mm day 1 in seasons 1 and 2 respectively table 1 further shows that the seasonal means were similar although variances for seasonal averages were significant except for vpd unequal variances in the weather parameters is expected since sowing was on different julian calendar days of the year doy the similar vpd between seasons and during periods of water stress suggests similar intensities of stress the duration of stress periods per growth stage was approximately equal for each season except for the sgf treatment in season 2 which was 10 days shorter as grain filling coincided with hotter weather conditions thermal time requirements to reach the different growth stages were similar between seasons for the well watered control growing degree days to emergence was 140 0 8 cd 389 1 0 cd to first tiller appearance and 1780 24 cd to grain filling averaged across years at the time of imposing ws plants were already past the first two stages while for grain filling gdd was similar across treatments growing degree days to reach peak tillering dvs 0 2 differed between seasons under well watered conditions table 2 peak tillering stage in both years was characterised by the same mean number of tillers approximately the same gdds were required in both seasons to reach first flower appearance 1219 68 cd and anthesis 1544 36 cd for tillering stage maximum tiller number was attained around flowering 71 dae in season 1 and slightly earlier at around booting 53 dae in season 2 table 1 this was equivalent to 368 cd more in the 2013 2014 season than in 2014 2015 stress imposed before first flower appearance delayed booting flowering and anthesis highly significantly p 0001 in particular stress during early reproductive growth increased gdds to booting first flower and anthesis stages more than stress during tillering table 2 the increase in thermal time to first flower 197 2 cd and to anthesis 120 45 cd averaged over the two seasons was therefore considerable due to stress during pi in contrast the gdd to anthesis with stress during tillering was almost the same 45 cd as for well watered plants to reach the same stage in spite of considerable delay in appearance of the first flowers for sti compared to the well watered control stress during anthesis and grain filling did not affect development except accelerated maturity for sgf as much as other treatments when compared to ct the interaction effect of stress and season on onset of developmental stages thus gdd was highly significant p 0001 with slightly longer durations under stress in season 2 than season 1 again there was little variation in gdd for ct between years stress generally did not alter the time to maturity and gdds were similar to that under well watered conditions except in season 2 when maturity for spi was about 23 days 285 cd longer than for ct leaf area index and fi of solar radiation during 120 139 dae were significantly higher for treatments that were stressed during ti and pi than for the ct results not shown 3 2 crop growth and recovery flowering duration tillering and plant height although plants exposed to the spi treatment took longer to flower in season 2 some flowering was observed during the stress in all replicate plots this was not anticipated but it might have been that thermal time to flowering accrued while still under stress and plants extracted water from deeper soil layers fig 1 indicates that flowering duration measured as a percentage of stems with flowers on each sampling date was significantly p 001 longer for stress during pi than for stress during ti stress during flowering sat did not affect flowering rates plot to plot variation in ontogeny of plants and in flowering rates was negligible between replicates most plant growth parameters were affected by stress and the interaction of treatment and season on growth during stress was also significant p 05 except for plant height results of both seasons are shown in fig 2 tillering was suppressed by stress in season 1 only but mean number of tillers for spi was similar to ct fig 2a it is apparent in fig 2a and table 2 season 1 that first peak of tiller growth for spi was at 71 dae and after the relieve of stress it peaked again at around 108 dae however in season 2 tillering ability was not significantly p 05 suppressed by stress relative to ct and tillers were not aborted as a result the number of tillers per plant and tillers m 2 under early reproductive stress was similar to that of ct in season 2 data on latter not presented this can probably be explained as follows by the time water was withheld for spi plots in season 2 plants had already attained maximum tiller number and consequently there was virtually no tiller abortion due to stress as can be seen in the growth analysis results presented in fig 2b during plant growth analysis significant differences in tillers m 2 between spi and ct were detected only at the termination of stress 95 dae and the first flowers had already appeared in plants under stress the average tiller number grand mean 4 13 0 42 per plant in stressed and well watered treatments was similar at 118 dae but the number of panicles m 2 at harvest was significantly p 028 lower for sti and spi in season 2 only therefore more tillers did not produce panicles under stress compared to well watered conditions because of more mutual shading by the canopy of the recovering crop i e larger green lai and fi values than ct post anthesis plant height increased albeit at a decreasing rate for the rest of the stress period of sti plant height was reduced by 30 in season 1 and by 17 8 in season 2 for the sti treatment compared to only 20 8 and 14 3 for the spi treatment relative to ct respectively reduction in green lai was substantial compared to reduction in leaf dry matter during stress for the sat and sgf treatments unlike for the sti and spi treatments table 3 thus these changes mean that specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 greatly reduced for especially sat treatments crop recovery from stress was more visible for tiller number than plant height as at harvest tiller densities were similar but plants significantly shorter for stress treatments than the ct aboveground biomass yield was not affected during stress periods but several days after resumption of irrigation differences relative to the control were significant pearson correlation analysis revealed that biomass production was well explained p 05 r 0 48 by lad during stress periods the overall relationship between biomass yield and lad for an entire season was strong in season 1 p 05 r2 0 78 but weak in season 2 r2 0 30 3 3 soil water status and consumption trends leaf stress symptoms and stomatal conductance the initial θ before onset of stress was similar across all treatments with small differences ranging 2 5 mm 2013 2014 and 2 7 mm 2014 2015 per soil layer fig 3 soils for all treatments then dried to the following ranges percent plant available water remaining per layer 34 45 at 0 0 2 m 49 51 at 0 2 0 4 m and 55 69 at 0 4 0 6 m on average across seasons the amount of soil water depleted was generally similar between treatments but in 2014 2015 depletion from the 0 4 0 6 m soil layer for sti and sgf was approximately 7 mm less than other treatments results not shown the estimated ψsoil at termination of stress in each season using the swrc ranged as follows 0 18 0 22 mpa in season 1 and 0 30 0 58 mpa in season 2 at 0 0 2 m 0 11 0 13 mpa in season 1 and 0 11 0 19 mpa in season 2 at 0 2 0 4 m and 0 17 0 22 mpa in season 1 and 0 11 0 09 mpa in season 2 at 0 4 0 6 m depth soil water consumption during stress for some treatments and under well watered ct for the same period is shown in fig 3 changes in θ were limited to the 0 0 4 m soil layer throughout the growth period except during early reproductive stress when a decline in θ was measured in deeper layers stress during this stage had a unique trend fig 3 characterised by i a fairly stable level in θ at 0 0 2 m layer and ii a considerable decline in θ in the 0 4 0 6 m layer the trends in θ for spi suggest little water was extracted at shallower depths on the basis of roughly equal available θ 40 mm during the first days of stress relative to the ct later as the soil became dryer roots grew deeper into sub soil layers during stress at anthesis θ for the surface layer was virtually constant in season 2 while in season 1 there was a sharp decline for the first 12 days after anthesis where after θ remained virtually constant for the rest of the flowering period the sharp decline in θ shortly after anthesis observed under ct in season 1 as well represents a critical period of water extraction this initial decline indicates increased root activity while the fairly constant trend later could mean that water uptake was limited due to root death otherwise if it is not root death the θ pattern for ct during anthesis should at least be on a downward trend at all depths there were moderate to strong linear relationships r2 0 44 0 97 between the soil water depleted mm during stress periods and some yield components at harvest during both years mean grain yield decreased r2 0 86 and 0 71 and spikelet sterility increased r2 0 44 and 0 97 linearly with increase in amount of soil water depleted from each treatment during years correlation between the number of panicles m 2 at harvest and δθ during stress was negative p 0019 r2 0 43 only in 2013 2014 and δθ for 0 0 6 m layer was positive p 017 r2 0 63 in both years these two relationships showed that panicle number which differed significantly between treatments at least partly depended on the amount of water extracted during stress initial stress symptoms were mild e g wilting after termination of irrigation water but later about seven days of stress more severe symptoms were observed e g leaf size was reduced symptoms of stress were distinct in each stage leaf senescence in tillering stage leaf rolling into bristle like shapes in early reproductive stage leaf wilting and gradual drying of flag leaves in anthesis and accelerated leaf drying in grain filling stage stress during most developmental stages reduced gs on abaxial lower leaf surfaces and consequently the relative ratios of mean gs under stress mean gs for ct it was unexpected to measure slightly higher gs values on abaxial leaf surfaces from four replicate plants with stress during anthesis than corresponding measurements for the ct thus gs ratios were greater than 1 0 this was common during most occasions when stomatal conductance was measured under well watered conditions the gs values on adaxial 206 443 mmol m 2 s 1 and abaxial 143 384 mmol m 2 s 1 surfaces of the flag leaf were roughly similar suggesting equal distribution of stomata on both surfaces gs values were either higher on abaxial or on adaxial surfaces stomatal conductance values for adaxial upper surfaces were generally higher under stress than under well watered conditions probably because of inward leaf rolling results not shown the upper leaf surface was thus less exposed to the atmosphere due to modification of the microclimate around the leaf the frequency of gs measurements was irregular between stages due to unavailability of equipment and unfavourable weather thus only initial and terminal measurements were used to calculate gs ratios to indicate severity of stress the gs ratios for abaxial flag leaf surfaces ranged between 0 8 and 0 9 after the initial withholding of irrigation to between 0 41 and 0 35 at termination of stress in all treatments however during stress at ti gs did not decrease as much as during other stages gs ratio of 0 79 towards termination of stress relative to the ct 3 4 growth dry matter yield and leaf n content per developmental stage comparing growth attained under stress and well watered conditions at the same developmental stage lai was only different at first flowering but shortly after anthesis values of lai were surprisingly similar in fact after the alleviation of stress during early reproductive growth spi lai exceeded that of ct in the subsequent developmental stages table 4 this phenomenon was also apparent in season 2 even when tiller abortion did not occur increase in canopy size was thus not as a result of new tillers emerging after stress relieve as was likely in season 1 further when plants were at the same developmental stage of grain filling lai for spi was again higher than that of ct plants in the spi treatment were also able to maintain higher fractions of intercepted radiation than the well watered control this overgrowth increase in lai and fi after the relieve of stress suggests that highly elastic growth occurs with stress during the early reproductive stage this kind of elastic growth was not apparent with stress during tillering because the great reduction in lai table 3 for spi was due to wilting as opposed to senescence at first flower appearance plants which had been stressed attained lower adm than the well watered ct aboveground dry matter yield for sti and for spi were half and two thirds of that achieved by the well watered ct respectively thus when the crop was stressed during early growth sti the source at first flower appearance was comparatively smaller than when stressed later at early reproductive stage spi in both years however later on the adm yield at anthesis was similar between the two treatments table 4 the differences in adm then diminished towards maturity such that the spi treatment achieved almost 100 of the adm value recorded by ct during both years adm at final harvest was statistically similar p 05 between the well watered ct and stress treatments although on average over years adm for ct 13 11 mg ha 1 was higher than for spi 9 54 mg ha 1 sti 10 09 mg ha 1 sat 11 27 mg ha 1 and sgf 11 53 mg ha 1 it is noteworthy that maximum tillering for sti was delayed by approximately 24 and 14 days in the two seasons meaning a longer tillering duration relative to the control it can be argued that plants under sti and spi compensated for adm loss through increase in leaf number per plant following longer vegetative growth duration than ct number of tillers was not a distinguishing contributor to biomass between stress treatments and well watered conditions as was reported in previous sections development was slowed down by ws so it was important to clarify the indicators of source size when the crop attained the same developmental stages under different treatments the contribution of reserve assimilates pre flowering 16 1 1 9 and pre anthesis 54 3 0 07 to final adm under well watered conditions and when not under stress was identical between years pre flowering and pre anthesis reserves contributed more to final adm under stress than for ct although results were variable between seasons for example 45 5 9 5 of the final crop yield for sti and 51 6 9 5 for spi was contributed from pre anthesis assimilates while the contribution was only 42 5 3 2 averaged across seasons under well watered conditions this contribution to grain yield for sti and spi was exceptionally high it is clear that the grain dry mass yield for these two treatments at harvest was on average 2 4 times the adm at anthesis and approximately 4 6 times for ct tables 4 and 5 considering that the proportion of adm at anthesis to the final grain yield is similar for sti and ct results suggest that partitioning of dry matter rather than the source size at the same developmental stage affected final yield table 6 when plants were unstressed except for plants of sat which were under stress at sampling time and at the same development stage leaf nitrogen uptake g 100 g 1 d w basis was higher in plants that were previously stressed than in plants of the control mean flag leaf n content for spi 3 74 and for sti 3 07 were significantly p 0001 higher than for ct 2 80 and sat 2 70 the significant increase in flag leaf n concentration after stress over well watered conditions at 101 106 dae plants for sti and spi had fully recovered was consistent in both seasons as leaf sampling was done during the stress period of sat treatment a lower leaf n content was thus expected total leaf n was not measured but based on leaf dry matter per unit area at sampling date which was similar across treatments we can thus assume that leaf n content was higher after relieving stress than without stress 3 5 relationship between grain yield yield components and growth parameters water stress significantly p 05 affected grain yield and some yield components except 1000 grain mass sink size and tillers m 2 which are not presented the treatment season interaction effect on yield components was highly significant p 001 table 5 however in season 1 grain yield was reduced by bird damage which resulted in lower overall yields growth analysis before ripening of grains some grains had not filled yet showed higher yield overall than was measured at final harvest mean grain yields on dry mass basis at the last growth analysis were sti 2 18 spi 2 38 sat 3 65 sgf 3 59 and ct 5 46 mg ha 1 it is therefore likely that final grain yield was underestimated in season 1 considering that stover yield was similar for both seasons grain yield components were not considerably affected by ws during the anthesis and grain filling stages when stress was imposed during ti the number of spikelets per panicle estimated spikelet number per unit area and panicle length significantly reduced and spikelet sterility increased p 05 table 5 stress during pi had a severely negative effect on panicle length and hi but to a lesser extent on spikelet sterility and this trend was consistent in both seasons thinner panicles were also observed at harvest notably for plants that were stressed during pi sterility of spikelets was common across all ws treatments but based on mean full grain ratio values for the two seasons spikelet sterility was more pronounced for spi than for sat the high percentage of unfilled grains in season 1 was common to all water treatments inclusive of the control but sterility could not be associated with ambient weather conditions as temperatures were generally favourable during booting table 1 the most highly correlated yield components with grain yield were spikelets per unit area and spikelet sterility table 5 pearson correlation analysis therefore showed that variation in grain yield was explained best by the number of spikelets per panicle as the number of panicles m 2 was quite similar several growth parameters like adm plant height and lai or lad were also related to grain yield results not shown however there were no good relationships between lad grain yield and sink indicators or yield components the mass of 1000 grains was positively related p 018 r 0 44 to lad while dry matter accumulation rate was weakly related to panicle length p 019 r 0 43 and to 1000 grain mass p 009 r 0 47 3 6 water use and water use efficiency of treatments since treatment means did not differ significantly between seasons water use related parameters were averaged across the two seasons table 7 water applied as irrigation was considerably lower under stress compared to well watered conditions with minimal yield penalty especially if water was withheld during gf the amount of water irrigated to stress treatments was on average 130 mm per season less than for the well watered control water used as et was higher under stress notably for sti 72 mm and spi 53 mm than under well watered conditions the higher et under stress could be mostly from soil evaporation e and less transpiration because of smaller canopies during stress periods due to leaf rolling and senescence which exposed the soil surface to ambient conditions water use efficiency for grain yield kg ha 1 mm 1 or kg m 3 yield per et did therefore not increase under stress table 7 compared to well watered conditions water use efficiency was higher in season 2 than in season 1 due to a higher grain yield response especially for two treatments for the respective seasons wue values for ct were 0 88 and 0 66 kg m 3 and 0 46 and 0 30 kg m 3 for sat stress during grain filling did not affect wue as much as during ti and pi mean values averaged across seasons for sgf 0 64 kg m 3 and for ct 0 75 kg m 3 were similar while for sti and spi wue values were very different from the ct table 7 these overall results indicated that the crop was less efficient in utilising water as water inputs were reduced results on wue and water input indicate a possibility of reducing irrigation water with minimal yield loss if water is withheld during late developmental stages 4 discussion 4 1 water stress effects on crop performance growth was clearly affected by ws during each stage however the lack of significant reduction in adm indicates that not only water stress but also factors such as tiller number leaf expansion and rooting affect biomass production asch et al 2005 kato et al 2006 below ground biomass was not measured in the present study the initial decrease in adm about eight days after withholding water during tillering was because plants were source limited at this stage due to fewer leaves which limited dm production dingkuhn et al 1989 constant soil water regimes or staggering of planting dates have previously been used to achieve ws in screening trials when the staggering sowing dates was used and a delay in reproduction was considerable in a study by boojung and fukai 1996 unfavourable temperatures was blamed for confounding ws effects on rice growth this unwanted effect did not occur in our study despite delay to reproduction for spi besides the daily temperatures during sensitive growth stages of rice were within the optimum range for all treatments shrestha et al 2011 this study used progressive drying of the soil to achieve intermittent ws which is typical of natural field conditions vadez 2014 and resulted in fairly equal initial θ using a similar water regime in potted rice okada et al 2002 also found that roots were able to exploit water reserves from sub soil layers when rice plants maximise soil water uptake during stress enhancement of biomass production occurs during stress blum 2009 these two mechanisms increased rooting and optimal water use explain the lack of significant response in adm for most of the stress periods during tillering and early reproductive stages in terms of desirable traits to cope with stage specific stress tillering ability was not critical in determining biomass and grain yield under stress comparing tillering and biomass responses in each season fig 2 adm was not significantly affected whether tillers were aborted or not again comparing the responses between treatments at a specific time point for instance at 95 dae mean tiller number was lower for spi than for sti although total biomass was similar furthermore despite similar tiller number m 2 at harvest stressed treatments had less productive panicles than the control this study established that when ws occurs before flowering there is no strong linkage between tillering ability and delay in reproduction stage although tillering was slightly suppressed by stress in the early reproductive stage relative to the control fig 2 and no tillers were aborted on individual plants in season 2 the delay in flowering was still considerable conversely tiller abortion was apparent with stress during tillering stage although not significant in season 2 fig 2 otherwise if an association between tiller abortion and delay to flowering and anthesis exists then increase in gdd to first flowering and anthesis under spi should have been negligible at least in 2014 2015 when peak tillering stage occurred days before stress further flowering occurred during the stress period for spi in 2014 2015 without additional tillers thereafter these two evidences thus also rule out the possibility of new tillers increasing gdd to reproduction under stress we suggest this to be a result of preferential partitioning of assimilates to the roots even though below ground biomass was not sampled the proposition is however based on the increase in water uptake from sub soil layers under spi and findings by price et al 2002 who associated deep rooting in rice with more investment of c into the roots explanations in literature for the changes in the time to peak tillering in rice under non limiting conditions are rare clerget and bueno 2013 reported that average number of tillers of potted grown lowland rice cultivars changed with sowing dates and it was related to duration of the vegetative phase in our study stress resulted in an extension of the time to reach peak tillering and therefore an extension of the vegetative phase but the maximum number of tillers was still similar between treatments asch et al 2005 reported that peak tillering in upland rice cultivars cg14 and wab 56 104 which are parents of cv nerica grown in chambers occurred around flowering our findings show that the time to peak tillering under well watered and non limiting conditions can also considerably change with season it was difficult to explain why plants attained peak tillering development stage 0 2 zadoks et al 1974 earlier in season 2 as daily temperatures between sowing and about 60 dae were similar in both seasons more investigation for possible causes of changes in thermal time to peak tillering is needed we expected that biomass production will be lower when stressed in the early reproductive stage spi rather than tillering sti stage because of a greater reduction in lad and also because stress during pi enhances rooting depth okada et al 2002 the positive correlation between adm and lad and the lowest mean values of adm and lad for spi confirmed this expectation furthermore we anticipated that the longer the delay to reproduction stage under stress the higher the biomass would be at reproductive stage findings do not support this latter speculation because the delay of the reproductive stage was considerable while the differences in biomass between sti and spi were small delay in flowering due to ws has been reported in previous studies in relation to soil water content number of leaves produced and canopy size for instance boojung and fukai 1996 reported a delay in flowering for rice plants stressed at full canopy late vegetative growth bouman et al 2001 also stated that a delay in flowering occurs when the soil is too dry for plants to produce leaves their explanation can be interpreted as stress during late vegetative growth full canopy delays flowering because few leaves are produced thereafter in contrast to our study plants were still producing new leaves at the time of imposing stress the spi treatment started with a canopy intercepting 45 of solar radiation about half the maximum fi and lai of 0 38 m2 m 2 about 17 of the maximum value these results confirmed that the delay in flowering occurred irrespective of the number of leaves attained or canopy size at that stage high grain yield in the present study was due to the high contribution 42 of pre anthesis assimilates to grain dry mass yoshida et al 1972 reported that depending on the rice cultivar 20 40 of pre anthesis assimilate contribution is needed to attain high grain yields the introduction of stress during pi resulted in considerable yield loss due to lower panicle size shorter panicles plus lower number of spikelets on the panicle similar results including pronounced spikelet sterility has been reported with stress during panicle initiation in lowland rice garrity and o toole 1994 bouman et al 2001 hsiao and xu 2000 kato et al 2006 kumar et al 2006 the new finding in our study is that spikelet sterility in rice is also common with stress during tillering as was observed in 2013 2014 when tiller abortion was severe tiller abortion could have resulted in low assimilate supply for sti because spikelet sterility of more than 20 indicates that assimilate supply from photosynthetic tissues source to the grains limited yield fageria 2007 in contrast negligible effects of ws during late reproductive stages on grain yield yield components and wue implies an opportunity to save irrigation water it is important to highlight the adaptation to stress during anthesis that may have led to better grain yield under sat treatment than was expected results of table 3 showed that stress during anthesis resulted in the greatest reduction in sla compared to other treatments this increase in leaf thickness indicative of high sla indicates preferred allocation of assimilates to the stems than to leaves asch et al 2005 consequently plants for sat treatment could have remobilised assimilates more than those for spi there is a great potential for yield improvement of upland rice and to save water under irrigated systems results from this study showed that yield components and hi were not affected by water stress while irrigation water could be saved by withholding water during anthesis and grain filling table 7 water use efficiency did not decline significantly for treatments that were water stressed during anthesis and grain filling because although total et increased considerably for these two treatments grain yield was not much affected fertility of rice grains in our study was less affected by ws compared to values reported in literature under well watered conditions kato et al 2009 documented grain fertility values of 68 73 27 32 sterility in lowland o indica and o japonica cultivars while arai sanoh et al 2014 reported at least 80 fertility in o japonica cultivars grain sterility in upland rice is generally higher than in lowland rice with a difference of 5 10 on average between the two rice systems under well watered conditions kato et al 2006 fageria 2007 since canopy shading likely contributed to pronounced sterility for the spi and sti treatments low plant densities may reduce sterility in situations vulnerable to stress during tillering and panicle initiation 4 2 implications for coping with stress under water limited conditions rice is very sensitive to mild soil water deficits partly because its root system is largely confined to the top about 0 2 0 3 m surface soil layers lilley and fukai 1993 okada et al 2002 kato and okami 2010 in anaerobic soils stress in lowland rice can develop at ψsoil below 86 kpa at shallow depths which is only slightly below the lower limit of the optimum range reported for lowland rice bouman et al 2001 soil matric potentials estimated in our study during stress were lower than these generic values indicating that the crop can adapt to drier soil conditions growth and morphological responses to stress namely changes in leaf morphology tillering ability and regeneration deep rooting and increased leaf n uptake before grain filling of upland rice during and after stress in different developmental stages were distinct these are useful traits in the adaptation of upland rice to water limited environments it is noteworthy that in most upland rice growing areas in ssa where nerica genotypes are popular that ws is prevalent and can occur at any stage during crop growth jones et al 1997 arc 2007 this makes it important to consider stage specific responses and adaptations to ws leaf rolling associated with reduction in leaf transpiring surface wopereis et al 1996 was peculiar during early reproductive stress while leaf senescence was marked when stress occurred during tillering greater reductions in leaf area or lai were measured with stress during tillering stage than stress during early reproductive stage these results demonstrate that coping with stress during tillering or which occurs around this stage will be better for cultivars which retain some green leaves stay green trait than otherwise this could be beneficial in minimising water loss as e because our results showed that fractional interception of radiation was greatly reduced during stress periods and seasonal et was thus higher due to higher e under stress than under well watered conditions crop recovery after stress had negative and positive impacts on the final yield with respect to stage bounce back ability and highly elastic recovery of canopy growth green lai and fi was observed irrespective of whether tillering abortion occurred under stress thus the low number of productive panicles m 2 under early reproductive stress despite similar tillers m 2 at harvest as ct could be improved by lowering plant density this result also suggests that a low tillering ability would be desirable for coping with stress during the early reproductive stage as the crop recovered to larger green canopies than the ct post flowering stage following resumption of irrigation mutual shading likely affected flowering of some existing tillers the slower recovery of plants after stress during tillering than during early reproductive stage resulted in shorter plants and consequently also shorter panicles improving recovery in plant height if stress occurs around early growth stages seems to be important for yield enhancement and is more convenient for manual harvesting harvesting using sickles is common among smallholder farmers and is difficult in short plants changes in soil water content over time at different depths has been used in several studies to indicate the impact of drought on the extent of root activity kondo et al 2000 lopes and reynolds 2010 yoyoongwech et al 2013 the observed deeper extraction of water during early reproductive stage when root depth is likely at its peak for well watered rice kato and okami 2010 could have helped to avoid leaf senescence maintenance of leaves despite rolling in contrast to stress during tillering increase in rooting depth in well watered conditions has been shown to increase leaf n concentrations 20 days after heading approximately 98 dae with higher n levels in deep than shallow rooting lowland rice cultivars arai sanoh et al 2014 arai sanoh et al 2014 attributed this difference to absorption of nutrients from lower soil layers by deep rooting cultivars in our study soil mineral n at sowing particularly no3 n in the 0 4 0 6 m layer where deep rooting was observed for spi was very low and plants did probably not benefit from that these findings have implications on agronomic practices breeding objectives and cultivar selection by farmers for improving rice yield under water stress further investigations are needed on allowable depletion levels for minimal yield loss in irrigated upland rice and on plant density optimisation to control unproductive tillers during early reproductive stress 5 conclusions thermal time to the onset of specific developmental stages except for the time to peak tillering in upland rice was generally stable over seasons under stress free conditions however upland rice phenology was very sensitive to water stress during early reproductive growth stress during this stage increased growing degree days greatly not only to reach subsequent developmental stages but also to reach maturity and thus it altered crop duration delay in flowering was not related to the effect of water stress during vegetative and reproductive stages on tiller development even without suppression of tillers or death of apical buds under stress gdds to flowering and anthesis still increased water stress before flowering resulted in a greater recovery of source size canopy size than for a well watered crop at the same developmental stage this bounce back ability is specific to stress during early reproduction and is not related to tiller number during and after the relieve of stress grain yield loss under stress was largely as a result of fewer grains per panicle and spikelet sterility results suggest that improvements in spikelet number may be achieved through manipulating plant density in rice growing areas that are prone to a high risk of stress during early reproductive stages low plant densities may be recommended to minimise excessive unproductive tillers at harvest stress during anthesis and grain filling resulted in no substantial yield and water use efficiency penalty while a considerable amount of irrigation water could be saved the yields achieved in our study match typical grain yields reported for lowland rice systems suggesting that there is considerable room for increased upland rice yields the information gained in this study will help upland rice farmers to optimise water management practices for example to irrigate only during a critical stage and save water during late reproductive stages dryland farmers

11576,rice oryza sativa l grown in uplands is exposed to variable soil water conditions and unpredictable periods of water stress ws the study was conducted to determine the impacts of ws imposed at different phenological stages of upland rice on growth phenology recovery of source size yield and water use efficiency wue the popular cv nerica 4 grown in africa was sown under a rain out shelter for two seasons treatments included a well watered control ct and stress imposed by withholding water for the duration of different stages tillering ti panicle initiation pi anthesis at and grain filling gf name codes used for treatments were thus ct sti spi sat and sgf when water was withheld soil water content in the 0 0 6 m soil layer dropped to approximately 50 of plant available water while stomatal conductance of the abaxial leaf surface and leaf area index decreased significantly suggesting that severe stress was experienced growing degree days to reach the different growth stages were roughly equal in both seasons even though sowing was in the mid summer of 2013 2014 and early summer of 2014 2015 respectively time to reach peak tillering could not be explained by temperatures and cumulative solar radiation during growth the onset of reproduction was highly significantly p 0001 delayed by water stress independent of whether tiller abortion occurred or not findings suggest that lower plant densities are recommended to cope with stress during pi to reduce water loss and control unproductive tillers at harvest it is concluded that stress during late reproductive stages unlike during pi does not alter crop duration and has a negligible effect on water loss and wue farmers with limited irrigation water can try to avoid ws by making sure they irrigate during pi and save water during later reproductive stages keywords delayed development plant available water water stress thermal time water use efficiency nerica 1 introduction about 11 of the global rice oryza sativa l cultivated area is in uplands irri 2002 growing rice in non puddled unsaturated and well drained soils upland systems kato and katsura 2014 is gaining popularity over flooded rice for various merits this share is likely to increase particularly because of growing recognition to save water in rice systems bouman 2001 kato et al 2006 growth in rice production and acreage in sub saharan africa ssa is estimated at 7 per annum and can be ascribed to the release of improved new rice for africa nerica cultivars arc 2007 these progenies are the result of interspecific crossings between african indigenous upland rice oryza glaberrima steud and asian lowland rice oryza sativa l japonica and were developed for low input systems jones et al 1997 the yield of rice in rainfed conditions is comparatively lower in uplands 1 5 2 5 mg ha 1 than for lowlands 2 5 4 5 mg ha 1 and approximately 30 lower under similar water supply conditions arc 2007 kato and katsura 2014 this yield difference among japonica rice cultivars was marginal when water supply was unlimited kato et al 2009 meaning that high potential cultivars need full irrigation although water saving technologies including aerobic systems have reduced water inputs compared to conventional flooded rice tuong et al 2004 levels of water application are still quite high the irrigation strategy practiced in aerobic rice systems is to raise soil water content to about field capacity if rainfall is insufficient bouman 2001 investigations are therefore needed to determine the minimum water requirements for maximum rice productivity in most parts of africa upland rice is rainfed kijoji et al 2014 and periods of ws are unpredictable due to poor rainfall distribution response of rice to ws generally varies with duration intensity of stress heinemann et al 2011 and most importantly the growth stage when stress occurs the three main growth phases of rice are the vegetative reproduction and ripening stages which are subdivided into 10 principle growth stages fageria 2007 and which overlap even within a single plant because the rice crop makes tillers of different chronological ages stress in rice plants was reported to develop at ψsoil 86 kpa for lowland conditions bouman et al 2001 and at ψsoil 100 kpa in potted upland soil asch et al 2005 but sensitivity of physiological processes such as transpiration and leaf expansion to ws differs along the crop cycle devatgar et al 2009 heinemann et al 2011 mechanisms to cope with ws in oryza sativa l are thus well documented for pot growth chamber and lysimeter studies although such conditions may not represent field conditions well parent et al 2010 kijoji et al 2014 for instance ψsoil between 60 and 140 kpa at 0 25 cm depth which are reported as threshold values for lowland rice growth in anaerobic soils bouman et al 2001 may be atypical of upland conditions where i surface soil can be dryer than 600 kpa jensen et al 1998 and ii roots can exploit soil layers deeper than 30 cm lilley and fukai 1994 drought effects on rice growth depends on the timing thereof stress between germination and flowering was reported to delay development in lowland and in upland rice wopereis et al 1996 boojung and fukai 1996 but the delay in development was much more pronounced in direct seeded upland rice compared to transplanted lowland rice kijoji et al 2014 water stress during the ripening stage reportedly also hastens development dingkuhn and le gal 1996 the duration of these phases can also be altered by excess water dingkuhn and asch 1999 and it remains to be investigated if upland rice is tolerant to some degree of soil saturation most studies such as the one by boojung and fukai 1996 did not quantify thermal time which makes it difficult to assess how sensitive the phenology of upland rice is to ws research that generates information on changes in growing degree day gdd requirements for different stages under water limited conditions will be useful for optimising crop production systems that entirely depend on rainfall of which the distribution is usually uneven in addition to changes in the duration of different developmental stages drought affects rice plants in various other ways stress between flowering and grain filling increases spikelet sterility matsuo et al 2010 and during panicle initiation pi it inhibits panicle exertion okada et al 2002 but asch et al 2005 reported that when stressed during vegetative growth dry matter partioning was not affected stress at one stage can also have cumulative effects on subsequent components for instance tiller abortion with stress during early growth wopereis et al 1996 may reduce panicle number associated with tiller number and the final spikelet number per unit area no investigation considered the duration of developmental stages and demonstrated such effects with ws at all above stages in a single field study thus relative yield loss due to stress during different phenological stages and ideal traits to cope with stress at each growth stage have not been studied well before with respect to alterations in phenology it has not been established if delay in flowering under vegetative stress may be a result of new tillers developing after relieve of severe stress tiller abortion tiller inhibition without death after mild stress or due to alteration in dry matter partitioning between plant organs it is noteworthy that rice tillering is spread over time delays in phenology has been related to size of source or canopy and recovery dry matter partitioning and growth stage in relation to leaf number boojung and fukai 1996 prasertsak and fukai 1997 bouman et al 2001 with some contrasting reports an aspect that has not been well reported is whether recovery of source capacity e g canopy size after stress will be to the same level as for a well watered control and whether it will affect the final grain yield clarification of source sink relations is needed since ws during vegetative growth is known to slow development of rice the crop therefore continues to grow accumulates dry matter but at a decreasing rate it is noteworthy that crop development is different from growth a crop that has recovered from stress can be of the same canopy size and similar height as a well watered one but at a different developmental stage it is also important to identify desirable traits for yield improvement with stress during different developmental stages in view of variable and cumulative effects of ws on growth and changes after recovery there is lack of information on effects of drought stress during different developmental stages on phenology thermal time accumulation sink source relations when the stressed crop attains a similar development stage as a well watered crop and water use efficiency wue this information is scarce because of a paucity of field studies on ws in rice especially in unsaturated uplands kato et al 2006 despite the significance of the crop the overall objective of this study was to determine the effects of water stress on upland rice cv nerica 4 crop growth and phenology and to identify the contribution of plant characteristics to yield at each developmental stage the specific objectives were i to evaluate dry matter partitioning and leaf n content when a crop has recovered from ws compared to a well watered control and ii to quantify water use and wue when a rice crop was stressed at different developmental stages it is envisaged that this research will inform upland rice growers on best management practices to minimise yield loss under water stress and breeders on traits for adapting rice to water limitations 2 materials and methods 2 1 planting material upland rice cultivar nerica 4 wab450 i b p 91 hb jones et al 1997 ndjiondjop et al 1998 seed was acquired from the national crop resources research institute nacrri in uganda cultivar nerica 4 is widely adopted in west and east africa arc 2007 and was chosen because of its high grain yield estimated at around 4 7 mg ha 1 under rainfed conditions and because it is still the top ranked cultivar in tropical rice producing areas such as uganda lamo et al 2010 imanywoha et al 2004 furthermore farmers prefer nerica 4 to other nerica cultivars for its heavy grains and medium growth duration 2 2 study site and rain out shelter experimental set up the trial was conducted in a rain out shelter on the hatfield experimental farm of the university of pretoria south africa

before harvest using a high density drip irrigation system profile soil water content θ was estimated at 0 2 m depth intervals from readings of a neutron probe water metre model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear california usa that was calibrated for the site weeds were regularly removed by hand malathion active ingredient o o dimethyl phosphorodithioate was sprayed once for aphids and tiforine active ingredient azoxystrobin for rice blast according to manufacturer instructions symptoms of the disease were mild and aphid damage was minimal because spraying was done at an early stage of incidence 2 4 identification of developmental stages visual observations were made to characterize crop phenology the zadoks decimal code for cereals was used to describe the developmental stages zadoks et al 1974 fageria et al 2010 before and after introduction of stress treatments developmental stages of rice as described by irri 2002 were identified based on morphological features for instance mean tiller number during the active tillering stage and grain colour and texture during physiological maturity the panicle initiation stage was marked by the observation of a furry tip of panicle primordium above the growing points under a light microscope four main stems were weekly randomly sampled from three well watered plots from the day of second tiller appearance about 21 dae until peak tillering stems were cut just above the crown hydrated in glycerol for 24 h and dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol for subsequent days james and tas 1984 longitudinal sections were prepared and examined under a microscope the number of folded and open leaves counted under a microscope was used to confirm stages 2 5 experimental design and water stress treatments the trial was laid out as a completely randomized block design crbd with three replications the five water treatments were randomly allocated to each replicate giving a total of 15 plots all plots were well irrigated until a growth stage gs of interest was reached whereafter water was withheld completely to induce ws from the onset of the following development stages dvs tillering panicle initiation anthesis or 50 flowering and grain filling the five treatments were as follows i ct well watered control irrigating twice weekly 2 4 day interval to replenish the soil water content in the

flowered flowers may just be emerging for some tillers to gs 11 2 v sgf stress around grain filling stage ii or soft dough stage or dvs 1 0 from gs 10 2 grains are turning from green to brown and are not milky anymore to gs 11 3 or dvs 2 0 physiological maturity pm flag leaf drying and 90 grains are brown initiation of the stress treatments above was based on crop development under well watered conditions irrigation in all plots was terminated on the same day during both seasons the periods of stress days after emergence in season 1 were sti 43 66 spi 66 95 sat 95 117 and sgf 117 144 and in season 2 were sti 51 75 spi 78 101 sat 101 121 and sgf 121 138 due to one incident in season 2 when the rain out shelter failed to close during a rainfall event stress was ended prematurely during tillering and slightly delayed in panicle initiation temporary portable rain out structures were then constructed and placed over each of the plots that was stressed during pi whenever there was a threat of rain the structures were used for five days only until the shelter was repaired 2 6 plant growth analysis yield and leaf n uptake plant height and number of tillers was monitored weekly on 10 plants in the centre row of each plot plant height was measured from the ground surface to the tallest green leaf tillering was monitored at least weekly from the date of first tiller appearance gs 2 0 at 19 and 17 dae in the respective seasons but more frequently in the earlier stages before anthesis tillers were also counted on sampled plants during biomass measurements for destructive growth analysis sampling 14 plants were sampled weekly from 30 to 130 dae from an area of 0 5 m 0 25 m per treatment by carefully cutting off the plants at ground level in some occasions biomass harvests were done after 10 days from the previous date of harvest leaf blades were separated from the stems and passed through an li 3100 leaf area metre licor lincoln nebraska usa to determine leaf area and to calculate leaf area index lai stems leaves panicles and grains were separated and dm yields were determined after oven drying the samples at 65 70 c for at least 48 h or until constant mass at final harvest aboveground dry matter adm yield was determined by cutting off all the plants at ground level from a net plot area of 1 75 m 1 50 m excluding border rows total biomass was weighed fresh for moisture content determination and grains were separated from the stover after threshing the mass of grains less empty grains and stover was weighed on a scale 0 1 kg precision sub samples of the stover 90 120 g and grain 20 g from each plot were oven dried at 65 c for at least 48 h total dry biomass yields were then calculated from the fresh yields and dry matter contents of the different components grain yield was adjusted to a 12 moisture content for comparison with commercial harvests to assess n uptake of stress recovered and well watered crops flag leaves from the main stems of 25 plants in each plot were sampled 25 30 days after heading dah and before grain filling this stage marks peak n accumulation in rice flag leaves which is critical during grain filling shiratsuchi et al 2006 leaves were dried and analysed for total n content using the dumas method in n pro rapid nitrogen protein analyzer equipment dumatherm c gerhardt gmbh co königswinter germany yield components were assessed by considering plants sampled from a 0 75 m 0 5 m subplot stems were counted and recorded as either non productive tillers without panicles or tillers with panicles ten panicles were randomly selected from each plot and their lengths measured the spikelets in each panicle were detached and counted to determine the number of spikelets and panicle size the mean number of spikelets from 10 panicles was then expressed per unit area spikelets were floated in water to separate empty and full grains oven dried and weighed full grain ratio and sterility were computed as the ratio of full or empty grain mass to the total spikelet mass full grains were counted using a seed counter numigral triplette and renaud paris france and the mass of 1000 grains was weighed the mass was standardized to 12 moisture content to determine the 1000 grain mass 2 7 measurement of radiation interception water stress and soil water content interception of photosynthetically active radiation par 0 4 0 7 μm by the canopy was determined at least three times every month by measuring photosynthetic par above and below the canopy at ground level with a 1 m long decagon sunfleck ceptometer decagon devices pullman washington usa four points were measured diagonally across rows in each plot and the average value was computed profile soil water content θ at 0 2 m depth intervals was estimated from the readings of a neutron probe model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear california usa that was calibrated for the site at the start of the experiment and before planting soil samples were taken at 0 2 m depth increments using an auger composite samples from each depth were analysed for soil chemical and physical properties a soil water retention curve swrc for the top 1 m soil layer was also determined using a wp4 t dewpoint hygrometer wp4 t potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman washington usa with an accuracy of 0 1 mpa after calibration with the gravimetric method van genuchten et al 1991 the swrc was also plotted on a log scale log pressure head cm using retc software for describing hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils scientific software group salt lake city utah usa the curves for different depths were used to calculate the actual values of ψsoil during dry periods soil water pressure head h was estimated from values of θ mm using a graph of θ vs h and h was then converted into soil ψsoil using the following equation ψ soil ρ w g h where ρw the density of water 1000 kg m 3 g acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s 1 and h m pressure head is a negative value field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were then estimated from the swrc evapotranspiration et was calculated using the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 i p et δs d r where i irrigation p precipitation d drainage and r runoff p d and r were considered negligible a high density drip irrigation system with water meters was used to apply the applicable water amount to each treatment irrigation water was summed from sowing to maturity during stress periods irrigation water was completely withheld except for one event when the shelter failed to close in 2014 15 the change in storage δs was calculated as the difference in θ between consecutive neutron probe readings during stress periods the first neutron probe readings were taken about three days after the last irrigation this was considered as the start of stress when calculating the initial θ soil water content calculated at the end of the water stress period was taken as terminal θ stomatal conductance gs on the upper adaxial and lower abaxial surfaces of the uppermost fully expanded leaf was occasionally measured using a decagon sc 1 leaf porometer decagon devices inc pullman washington usa four replicate stomatal conductance measurements per plot were taken at around 11 45 15 20 range of time for all readings made in both seasons on the same plants from the start to the end of stress periods a measurement in a plot under stress was followed by a measurement in a well watered plot to avoid any bias that could arise by delayed timing of measurements stomatal response to ws was later expressed as the mean relative value that is the ratio of mean gs under stress to mean gs for the ct to normalise variations in atmospheric demand between stages during stress it was not possible to take frequent measurements of gs due to unavailability of the porometer and therefore the number of measurements during stress was not equal between growth stages 2 8 computation of crop growth parameters crop growth parameters were calculated using equations described by watson 1952 lopes and reynolds 2010 and fageria et al 2010 crop dry matter accumulation rate g m 2 d 1 was calculated as the increase in adm from the harvested land area per unit time the total one sided leaf area m2 was divided by the sampling area m2 to obtain the leaf area index lai on days of growth analysis sampling leaf area duration lad between harvests was calculated as the area under the lai curve over time which mathematically is an integral of lai over time thermal time to reach different growth stages was calculated by accumulating daily growing degree days cd from sowing using a base temperature of 8 2 c for african rice and crosses thereof shrestha et al 2011 dry masses of individual plant parts were summed to obtain adm the apparent contribution of photosynthesis or reserve assimilates from pre reproductive stages to grain filling dmc was calculated using the equation by yoshida et al 1972 dm c adm m adm xi where admm is the aboveground dry matter yield at maturity and admxi is the aboveground dry matter yield at either pre flowering or pre anthesis in the case of this study the apparent contribution was then expressed as a percentage of ii admm and ii the final grain yield grain harvest index hi was computed as the ratio of grain mass fully developed grains to total adm on a dry mass basis sink size was calculated as the product of the mass of 1000 grains and number of grains per metre square kato et al 2006 dry matter efficiency dme was calculated as the hi divided by the number of days to crop maturity watson 1952 dry matter efficiency was calculated because of delay in physiological maturity for one treatment the relative decline in growth and yield was calculated as the difference in the parameter between a water stress treatment and the ct divided by the yield for the ct stress index water use efficiency was calculated during stress periods and for the entire season during stress wue was calculated as the difference in adm kg m 2 between the start and end of stress divided by et mm and for the entire season as grain yield in kg ha 1 on dry mass basis divided by total et mm 2 9 statistical analysis the general linear model glm procedure in sas 9 3 version 6 1 7061 for windows cary nc sas institute inc 2012 was used to perform statistical analyses correlation analysis were performed on selected growth variables and derived parameters during stress for crop growth rate and final yield components under stress and well watered conditions to determine the degree of relationship and their contribution to variation in yields pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to indicate the most consistently related yield component to grain yield analysis of variance anova was performed with treatments and seasons as factors and growth yield and water status indicators as variables means for main and interaction effects were separated using tukey s studentized range test at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels of significance in order to test for statistical differences in weather parameters that determine crop water use between seasons the f test two sample for variances was applied for every pair of daily temperatures eto and vpd 3 results 3 1 weather conditions crop phenology and development the measured mean maximum and minimum air temperatures of 27 4 c and 14 9 c season 1 and 29 2 c and 15 6 c season 2 were optimal for rice growth especially during critical stages of booting to flowering evaporative demand during the experimental period was fairly similar between years average reference evapotranspiration from sowing to physiological maturity pm period of approximately 149 days was 3 93 and 4 59 mm day 1 in seasons 1 and 2 respectively table 1 further shows that the seasonal means were similar although variances for seasonal averages were significant except for vpd unequal variances in the weather parameters is expected since sowing was on different julian calendar days of the year doy the similar vpd between seasons and during periods of water stress suggests similar intensities of stress the duration of stress periods per growth stage was approximately equal for each season except for the sgf treatment in season 2 which was 10 days shorter as grain filling coincided with hotter weather conditions thermal time requirements to reach the different growth stages were similar between seasons for the well watered control growing degree days to emergence was 140 0 8 cd 389 1 0 cd to first tiller appearance and 1780 24 cd to grain filling averaged across years at the time of imposing ws plants were already past the first two stages while for grain filling gdd was similar across treatments growing degree days to reach peak tillering dvs 0 2 differed between seasons under well watered conditions table 2 peak tillering stage in both years was characterised by the same mean number of tillers approximately the same gdds were required in both seasons to reach first flower appearance 1219 68 cd and anthesis 1544 36 cd for tillering stage maximum tiller number was attained around flowering 71 dae in season 1 and slightly earlier at around booting 53 dae in season 2 table 1 this was equivalent to 368 cd more in the 2013 2014 season than in 2014 2015 stress imposed before first flower appearance delayed booting flowering and anthesis highly significantly p 0001 in particular stress during early reproductive growth increased gdds to booting first flower and anthesis stages more than stress during tillering table 2 the increase in thermal time to first flower 197 2 cd and to anthesis 120 45 cd averaged over the two seasons was therefore considerable due to stress during pi in contrast the gdd to anthesis with stress during tillering was almost the same 45 cd as for well watered plants to reach the same stage in spite of considerable delay in appearance of the first flowers for sti compared to the well watered control stress during anthesis and grain filling did not affect development except accelerated maturity for sgf as much as other treatments when compared to ct the interaction effect of stress and season on onset of developmental stages thus gdd was highly significant p 0001 with slightly longer durations under stress in season 2 than season 1 again there was little variation in gdd for ct between years stress generally did not alter the time to maturity and gdds were similar to that under well watered conditions except in season 2 when maturity for spi was about 23 days 285 cd longer than for ct leaf area index and fi of solar radiation during 120 139 dae were significantly higher for treatments that were stressed during ti and pi than for the ct results not shown 3 2 crop growth and recovery flowering duration tillering and plant height although plants exposed to the spi treatment took longer to flower in season 2 some flowering was observed during the stress in all replicate plots this was not anticipated but it might have been that thermal time to flowering accrued while still under stress and plants extracted water from deeper soil layers fig 1 indicates that flowering duration measured as a percentage of stems with flowers on each sampling date was significantly p 001 longer for stress during pi than for stress during ti stress during flowering sat did not affect flowering rates plot to plot variation in ontogeny of plants and in flowering rates was negligible between replicates most plant growth parameters were affected by stress and the interaction of treatment and season on growth during stress was also significant p 05 except for plant height results of both seasons are shown in fig 2 tillering was suppressed by stress in season 1 only but mean number of tillers for spi was similar to ct fig 2a it is apparent in fig 2a and table 2 season 1 that first peak of tiller growth for spi was at 71 dae and after the relieve of stress it peaked again at around 108 dae however in season 2 tillering ability was not significantly p 05 suppressed by stress relative to ct and tillers were not aborted as a result the number of tillers per plant and tillers m 2 under early reproductive stress was similar to that of ct in season 2 data on latter not presented this can probably be explained as follows by the time water was withheld for spi plots in season 2 plants had already attained maximum tiller number and consequently there was virtually no tiller abortion due to stress as can be seen in the growth analysis results presented in fig 2b during plant growth analysis significant differences in tillers m 2 between spi and ct were detected only at the termination of stress 95 dae and the first flowers had already appeared in plants under stress the average tiller number grand mean 4 13 0 42 per plant in stressed and well watered treatments was similar at 118 dae but the number of panicles m 2 at harvest was significantly p 028 lower for sti and spi in season 2 only therefore more tillers did not produce panicles under stress compared to well watered conditions because of more mutual shading by the canopy of the recovering crop i e larger green lai and fi values than ct post anthesis plant height increased albeit at a decreasing rate for the rest of the stress period of sti plant height was reduced by 30 in season 1 and by 17 8 in season 2 for the sti treatment compared to only 20 8 and 14 3 for the spi treatment relative to ct respectively reduction in green lai was substantial compared to reduction in leaf dry matter during stress for the sat and sgf treatments unlike for the sti and spi treatments table 3 thus these changes mean that specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 greatly reduced for especially sat treatments crop recovery from stress was more visible for tiller number than plant height as at harvest tiller densities were similar but plants significantly shorter for stress treatments than the ct aboveground biomass yield was not affected during stress periods but several days after resumption of irrigation differences relative to the control were significant pearson correlation analysis revealed that biomass production was well explained p 05 r 0 48 by lad during stress periods the overall relationship between biomass yield and lad for an entire season was strong in season 1 p 05 r2 0 78 but weak in season 2 r2 0 30 3 3 soil water status and consumption trends leaf stress symptoms and stomatal conductance the initial θ before onset of stress was similar across all treatments with small differences ranging 2 5 mm 2013 2014 and 2 7 mm 2014 2015 per soil layer fig 3 soils for all treatments then dried to the following ranges percent plant available water remaining per layer 34 45 at 0 0 2 m 49 51 at 0 2 0 4 m and 55 69 at 0 4 0 6 m on average across seasons the amount of soil water depleted was generally similar between treatments but in 2014 2015 depletion from the 0 4 0 6 m soil layer for sti and sgf was approximately 7 mm less than other treatments results not shown the estimated ψsoil at termination of stress in each season using the swrc ranged as follows 0 18 0 22 mpa in season 1 and 0 30 0 58 mpa in season 2 at 0 0 2 m 0 11 0 13 mpa in season 1 and 0 11 0 19 mpa in season 2 at 0 2 0 4 m and 0 17 0 22 mpa in season 1 and 0 11 0 09 mpa in season 2 at 0 4 0 6 m depth soil water consumption during stress for some treatments and under well watered ct for the same period is shown in fig 3 changes in θ were limited to the 0 0 4 m soil layer throughout the growth period except during early reproductive stress when a decline in θ was measured in deeper layers stress during this stage had a unique trend fig 3 characterised by i a fairly stable level in θ at 0 0 2 m layer and ii a considerable decline in θ in the 0 4 0 6 m layer the trends in θ for spi suggest little water was extracted at shallower depths on the basis of roughly equal available θ 40 mm during the first days of stress relative to the ct later as the soil became dryer roots grew deeper into sub soil layers during stress at anthesis θ for the surface layer was virtually constant in season 2 while in season 1 there was a sharp decline for the first 12 days after anthesis where after θ remained virtually constant for the rest of the flowering period the sharp decline in θ shortly after anthesis observed under ct in season 1 as well represents a critical period of water extraction this initial decline indicates increased root activity while the fairly constant trend later could mean that water uptake was limited due to root death otherwise if it is not root death the θ pattern for ct during anthesis should at least be on a downward trend at all depths there were moderate to strong linear relationships r2 0 44 0 97 between the soil water depleted mm during stress periods and some yield components at harvest during both years mean grain yield decreased r2 0 86 and 0 71 and spikelet sterility increased r2 0 44 and 0 97 linearly with increase in amount of soil water depleted from each treatment during years correlation between the number of panicles m 2 at harvest and δθ during stress was negative p 0019 r2 0 43 only in 2013 2014 and δθ for 0 0 6 m layer was positive p 017 r2 0 63 in both years these two relationships showed that panicle number which differed significantly between treatments at least partly depended on the amount of water extracted during stress initial stress symptoms were mild e g wilting after termination of irrigation water but later about seven days of stress more severe symptoms were observed e g leaf size was reduced symptoms of stress were distinct in each stage leaf senescence in tillering stage leaf rolling into bristle like shapes in early reproductive stage leaf wilting and gradual drying of flag leaves in anthesis and accelerated leaf drying in grain filling stage stress during most developmental stages reduced gs on abaxial lower leaf surfaces and consequently the relative ratios of mean gs under stress mean gs for ct it was unexpected to measure slightly higher gs values on abaxial leaf surfaces from four replicate plants with stress during anthesis than corresponding measurements for the ct thus gs ratios were greater than 1 0 this was common during most occasions when stomatal conductance was measured under well watered conditions the gs values on adaxial 206 443 mmol m 2 s 1 and abaxial 143 384 mmol m 2 s 1 surfaces of the flag leaf were roughly similar suggesting equal distribution of stomata on both surfaces gs values were either higher on abaxial or on adaxial surfaces stomatal conductance values for adaxial upper surfaces were generally higher under stress than under well watered conditions probably because of inward leaf rolling results not shown the upper leaf surface was thus less exposed to the atmosphere due to modification of the microclimate around the leaf the frequency of gs measurements was irregular between stages due to unavailability of equipment and unfavourable weather thus only initial and terminal measurements were used to calculate gs ratios to indicate severity of stress the gs ratios for abaxial flag leaf surfaces ranged between 0 8 and 0 9 after the initial withholding of irrigation to between 0 41 and 0 35 at termination of stress in all treatments however during stress at ti gs did not decrease as much as during other stages gs ratio of 0 79 towards termination of stress relative to the ct 3 4 growth dry matter yield and leaf n content per developmental stage comparing growth attained under stress and well watered conditions at the same developmental stage lai was only different at first flowering but shortly after anthesis values of lai were surprisingly similar in fact after the alleviation of stress during early reproductive growth spi lai exceeded that of ct in the subsequent developmental stages table 4 this phenomenon was also apparent in season 2 even when tiller abortion did not occur increase in canopy size was thus not as a result of new tillers emerging after stress relieve as was likely in season 1 further when plants were at the same developmental stage of grain filling lai for spi was again higher than that of ct plants in the spi treatment were also able to maintain higher fractions of intercepted radiation than the well watered control this overgrowth increase in lai and fi after the relieve of stress suggests that highly elastic growth occurs with stress during the early reproductive stage this kind of elastic growth was not apparent with stress during tillering because the great reduction in lai table 3 for spi was due to wilting as opposed to senescence at first flower appearance plants which had been stressed attained lower adm than the well watered ct aboveground dry matter yield for sti and for spi were half and two thirds of that achieved by the well watered ct respectively thus when the crop was stressed during early growth sti the source at first flower appearance was comparatively smaller than when stressed later at early reproductive stage spi in both years however later on the adm yield at anthesis was similar between the two treatments table 4 the differences in adm then diminished towards maturity such that the spi treatment achieved almost 100 of the adm value recorded by ct during both years adm at final harvest was statistically similar p 05 between the well watered ct and stress treatments although on average over years adm for ct 13 11 mg ha 1 was higher than for spi 9 54 mg ha 1 sti 10 09 mg ha 1 sat 11 27 mg ha 1 and sgf 11 53 mg ha 1 it is noteworthy that maximum tillering for sti was delayed by approximately 24 and 14 days in the two seasons meaning a longer tillering duration relative to the control it can be argued that plants under sti and spi compensated for adm loss through increase in leaf number per plant following longer vegetative growth duration than ct number of tillers was not a distinguishing contributor to biomass between stress treatments and well watered conditions as was reported in previous sections development was slowed down by ws so it was important to clarify the indicators of source size when the crop attained the same developmental stages under different treatments the contribution of reserve assimilates pre flowering 16 1 1 9 and pre anthesis 54 3 0 07 to final adm under well watered conditions and when not under stress was identical between years pre flowering and pre anthesis reserves contributed more to final adm under stress than for ct although results were variable between seasons for example 45 5 9 5 of the final crop yield for sti and 51 6 9 5 for spi was contributed from pre anthesis assimilates while the contribution was only 42 5 3 2 averaged across seasons under well watered conditions this contribution to grain yield for sti and spi was exceptionally high it is clear that the grain dry mass yield for these two treatments at harvest was on average 2 4 times the adm at anthesis and approximately 4 6 times for ct tables 4 and 5 considering that the proportion of adm at anthesis to the final grain yield is similar for sti and ct results suggest that partitioning of dry matter rather than the source size at the same developmental stage affected final yield table 6 when plants were unstressed except for plants of sat which were under stress at sampling time and at the same development stage leaf nitrogen uptake g 100 g 1 d w basis was higher in plants that were previously stressed than in plants of the control mean flag leaf n content for spi 3 74 and for sti 3 07 were significantly p 0001 higher than for ct 2 80 and sat 2 70 the significant increase in flag leaf n concentration after stress over well watered conditions at 101 106 dae plants for sti and spi had fully recovered was consistent in both seasons as leaf sampling was done during the stress period of sat treatment a lower leaf n content was thus expected total leaf n was not measured but based on leaf dry matter per unit area at sampling date which was similar across treatments we can thus assume that leaf n content was higher after relieving stress than without stress 3 5 relationship between grain yield yield components and growth parameters water stress significantly p 05 affected grain yield and some yield components except 1000 grain mass sink size and tillers m 2 which are not presented the treatment season interaction effect on yield components was highly significant p 001 table 5 however in season 1 grain yield was reduced by bird damage which resulted in lower overall yields growth analysis before ripening of grains some grains had not filled yet showed higher yield overall than was measured at final harvest mean grain yields on dry mass basis at the last growth analysis were sti 2 18 spi 2 38 sat 3 65 sgf 3 59 and ct 5 46 mg ha 1 it is therefore likely that final grain yield was underestimated in season 1 considering that stover yield was similar for both seasons grain yield components were not considerably affected by ws during the anthesis and grain filling stages when stress was imposed during ti the number of spikelets per panicle estimated spikelet number per unit area and panicle length significantly reduced and spikelet sterility increased p 05 table 5 stress during pi had a severely negative effect on panicle length and hi but to a lesser extent on spikelet sterility and this trend was consistent in both seasons thinner panicles were also observed at harvest notably for plants that were stressed during pi sterility of spikelets was common across all ws treatments but based on mean full grain ratio values for the two seasons spikelet sterility was more pronounced for spi than for sat the high percentage of unfilled grains in season 1 was common to all water treatments inclusive of the control but sterility could not be associated with ambient weather conditions as temperatures were generally favourable during booting table 1 the most highly correlated yield components with grain yield were spikelets per unit area and spikelet sterility table 5 pearson correlation analysis therefore showed that variation in grain yield was explained best by the number of spikelets per panicle as the number of panicles m 2 was quite similar several growth parameters like adm plant height and lai or lad were also related to grain yield results not shown however there were no good relationships between lad grain yield and sink indicators or yield components the mass of 1000 grains was positively related p 018 r 0 44 to lad while dry matter accumulation rate was weakly related to panicle length p 019 r 0 43 and to 1000 grain mass p 009 r 0 47 3 6 water use and water use efficiency of treatments since treatment means did not differ significantly between seasons water use related parameters were averaged across the two seasons table 7 water applied as irrigation was considerably lower under stress compared to well watered conditions with minimal yield penalty especially if water was withheld during gf the amount of water irrigated to stress treatments was on average 130 mm per season less than for the well watered control water used as et was higher under stress notably for sti 72 mm and spi 53 mm than under well watered conditions the higher et under stress could be mostly from soil evaporation e and less transpiration because of smaller canopies during stress periods due to leaf rolling and senescence which exposed the soil surface to ambient conditions water use efficiency for grain yield kg ha 1 mm 1 or kg m 3 yield per et did therefore not increase under stress table 7 compared to well watered conditions water use efficiency was higher in season 2 than in season 1 due to a higher grain yield response especially for two treatments for the respective seasons wue values for ct were 0 88 and 0 66 kg m 3 and 0 46 and 0 30 kg m 3 for sat stress during grain filling did not affect wue as much as during ti and pi mean values averaged across seasons for sgf 0 64 kg m 3 and for ct 0 75 kg m 3 were similar while for sti and spi wue values were very different from the ct table 7 these overall results indicated that the crop was less efficient in utilising water as water inputs were reduced results on wue and water input indicate a possibility of reducing irrigation water with minimal yield loss if water is withheld during late developmental stages 4 discussion 4 1 water stress effects on crop performance growth was clearly affected by ws during each stage however the lack of significant reduction in adm indicates that not only water stress but also factors such as tiller number leaf expansion and rooting affect biomass production asch et al 2005 kato et al 2006 below ground biomass was not measured in the present study the initial decrease in adm about eight days after withholding water during tillering was because plants were source limited at this stage due to fewer leaves which limited dm production dingkuhn et al 1989 constant soil water regimes or staggering of planting dates have previously been used to achieve ws in screening trials when the staggering sowing dates was used and a delay in reproduction was considerable in a study by boojung and fukai 1996 unfavourable temperatures was blamed for confounding ws effects on rice growth this unwanted effect did not occur in our study despite delay to reproduction for spi besides the daily temperatures during sensitive growth stages of rice were within the optimum range for all treatments shrestha et al 2011 this study used progressive drying of the soil to achieve intermittent ws which is typical of natural field conditions vadez 2014 and resulted in fairly equal initial θ using a similar water regime in potted rice okada et al 2002 also found that roots were able to exploit water reserves from sub soil layers when rice plants maximise soil water uptake during stress enhancement of biomass production occurs during stress blum 2009 these two mechanisms increased rooting and optimal water use explain the lack of significant response in adm for most of the stress periods during tillering and early reproductive stages in terms of desirable traits to cope with stage specific stress tillering ability was not critical in determining biomass and grain yield under stress comparing tillering and biomass responses in each season fig 2 adm was not significantly affected whether tillers were aborted or not again comparing the responses between treatments at a specific time point for instance at 95 dae mean tiller number was lower for spi than for sti although total biomass was similar furthermore despite similar tiller number m 2 at harvest stressed treatments had less productive panicles than the control this study established that when ws occurs before flowering there is no strong linkage between tillering ability and delay in reproduction stage although tillering was slightly suppressed by stress in the early reproductive stage relative to the control fig 2 and no tillers were aborted on individual plants in season 2 the delay in flowering was still considerable conversely tiller abortion was apparent with stress during tillering stage although not significant in season 2 fig 2 otherwise if an association between tiller abortion and delay to flowering and anthesis exists then increase in gdd to first flowering and anthesis under spi should have been negligible at least in 2014 2015 when peak tillering stage occurred days before stress further flowering occurred during the stress period for spi in 2014 2015 without additional tillers thereafter these two evidences thus also rule out the possibility of new tillers increasing gdd to reproduction under stress we suggest this to be a result of preferential partitioning of assimilates to the roots even though below ground biomass was not sampled the proposition is however based on the increase in water uptake from sub soil layers under spi and findings by price et al 2002 who associated deep rooting in rice with more investment of c into the roots explanations in literature for the changes in the time to peak tillering in rice under non limiting conditions are rare clerget and bueno 2013 reported that average number of tillers of potted grown lowland rice cultivars changed with sowing dates and it was related to duration of the vegetative phase in our study stress resulted in an extension of the time to reach peak tillering and therefore an extension of the vegetative phase but the maximum number of tillers was still similar between treatments asch et al 2005 reported that peak tillering in upland rice cultivars cg14 and wab 56 104 which are parents of cv nerica grown in chambers occurred around flowering our findings show that the time to peak tillering under well watered and non limiting conditions can also considerably change with season it was difficult to explain why plants attained peak tillering development stage 0 2 zadoks et al 1974 earlier in season 2 as daily temperatures between sowing and about 60 dae were similar in both seasons more investigation for possible causes of changes in thermal time to peak tillering is needed we expected that biomass production will be lower when stressed in the early reproductive stage spi rather than tillering sti stage because of a greater reduction in lad and also because stress during pi enhances rooting depth okada et al 2002 the positive correlation between adm and lad and the lowest mean values of adm and lad for spi confirmed this expectation furthermore we anticipated that the longer the delay to reproduction stage under stress the higher the biomass would be at reproductive stage findings do not support this latter speculation because the delay of the reproductive stage was considerable while the differences in biomass between sti and spi were small delay in flowering due to ws has been reported in previous studies in relation to soil water content number of leaves produced and canopy size for instance boojung and fukai 1996 reported a delay in flowering for rice plants stressed at full canopy late vegetative growth bouman et al 2001 also stated that a delay in flowering occurs when the soil is too dry for plants to produce leaves their explanation can be interpreted as stress during late vegetative growth full canopy delays flowering because few leaves are produced thereafter in contrast to our study plants were still producing new leaves at the time of imposing stress the spi treatment started with a canopy intercepting 45 of solar radiation about half the maximum fi and lai of 0 38 m2 m 2 about 17 of the maximum value these results confirmed that the delay in flowering occurred irrespective of the number of leaves attained or canopy size at that stage high grain yield in the present study was due to the high contribution 42 of pre anthesis assimilates to grain dry mass yoshida et al 1972 reported that depending on the rice cultivar 20 40 of pre anthesis assimilate contribution is needed to attain high grain yields the introduction of stress during pi resulted in considerable yield loss due to lower panicle size shorter panicles plus lower number of spikelets on the panicle similar results including pronounced spikelet sterility has been reported with stress during panicle initiation in lowland rice garrity and o toole 1994 bouman et al 2001 hsiao and xu 2000 kato et al 2006 kumar et al 2006 the new finding in our study is that spikelet sterility in rice is also common with stress during tillering as was observed in 2013 2014 when tiller abortion was severe tiller abortion could have resulted in low assimilate supply for sti because spikelet sterility of more than 20 indicates that assimilate supply from photosynthetic tissues source to the grains limited yield fageria 2007 in contrast negligible effects of ws during late reproductive stages on grain yield yield components and wue implies an opportunity to save irrigation water it is important to highlight the adaptation to stress during anthesis that may have led to better grain yield under sat treatment than was expected results of table 3 showed that stress during anthesis resulted in the greatest reduction in sla compared to other treatments this increase in leaf thickness indicative of high sla indicates preferred allocation of assimilates to the stems than to leaves asch et al 2005 consequently plants for sat treatment could have remobilised assimilates more than those for spi there is a great potential for yield improvement of upland rice and to save water under irrigated systems results from this study showed that yield components and hi were not affected by water stress while irrigation water could be saved by withholding water during anthesis and grain filling table 7 water use efficiency did not decline significantly for treatments that were water stressed during anthesis and grain filling because although total et increased considerably for these two treatments grain yield was not much affected fertility of rice grains in our study was less affected by ws compared to values reported in literature under well watered conditions kato et al 2009 documented grain fertility values of 68 73 27 32 sterility in lowland o indica and o japonica cultivars while arai sanoh et al 2014 reported at least 80 fertility in o japonica cultivars grain sterility in upland rice is generally higher than in lowland rice with a difference of 5 10 on average between the two rice systems under well watered conditions kato et al 2006 fageria 2007 since canopy shading likely contributed to pronounced sterility for the spi and sti treatments low plant densities may reduce sterility in situations vulnerable to stress during tillering and panicle initiation 4 2 implications for coping with stress under water limited conditions rice is very sensitive to mild soil water deficits partly because its root system is largely confined to the top about 0 2 0 3 m surface soil layers lilley and fukai 1993 okada et al 2002 kato and okami 2010 in anaerobic soils stress in lowland rice can develop at ψsoil below 86 kpa at shallow depths which is only slightly below the lower limit of the optimum range reported for lowland rice bouman et al 2001 soil matric potentials estimated in our study during stress were lower than these generic values indicating that the crop can adapt to drier soil conditions growth and morphological responses to stress namely changes in leaf morphology tillering ability and regeneration deep rooting and increased leaf n uptake before grain filling of upland rice during and after stress in different developmental stages were distinct these are useful traits in the adaptation of upland rice to water limited environments it is noteworthy that in most upland rice growing areas in ssa where nerica genotypes are popular that ws is prevalent and can occur at any stage during crop growth jones et al 1997 arc 2007 this makes it important to consider stage specific responses and adaptations to ws leaf rolling associated with reduction in leaf transpiring surface wopereis et al 1996 was peculiar during early reproductive stress while leaf senescence was marked when stress occurred during tillering greater reductions in leaf area or lai were measured with stress during tillering stage than stress during early reproductive stage these results demonstrate that coping with stress during tillering or which occurs around this stage will be better for cultivars which retain some green leaves stay green trait than otherwise this could be beneficial in minimising water loss as e because our results showed that fractional interception of radiation was greatly reduced during stress periods and seasonal et was thus higher due to higher e under stress than under well watered conditions crop recovery after stress had negative and positive impacts on the final yield with respect to stage bounce back ability and highly elastic recovery of canopy growth green lai and fi was observed irrespective of whether tillering abortion occurred under stress thus the low number of productive panicles m 2 under early reproductive stress despite similar tillers m 2 at harvest as ct could be improved by lowering plant density this result also suggests that a low tillering ability would be desirable for coping with stress during the early reproductive stage as the crop recovered to larger green canopies than the ct post flowering stage following resumption of irrigation mutual shading likely affected flowering of some existing tillers the slower recovery of plants after stress during tillering than during early reproductive stage resulted in shorter plants and consequently also shorter panicles improving recovery in plant height if stress occurs around early growth stages seems to be important for yield enhancement and is more convenient for manual harvesting harvesting using sickles is common among smallholder farmers and is difficult in short plants changes in soil water content over time at different depths has been used in several studies to indicate the impact of drought on the extent of root activity kondo et al 2000 lopes and reynolds 2010 yoyoongwech et al 2013 the observed deeper extraction of water during early reproductive stage when root depth is likely at its peak for well watered rice kato and okami 2010 could have helped to avoid leaf senescence maintenance of leaves despite rolling in contrast to stress during tillering increase in rooting depth in well watered conditions has been shown to increase leaf n concentrations 20 days after heading approximately 98 dae with higher n levels in deep than shallow rooting lowland rice cultivars arai sanoh et al 2014 arai sanoh et al 2014 attributed this difference to absorption of nutrients from lower soil layers by deep rooting cultivars in our study soil mineral n at sowing particularly no3 n in the 0 4 0 6 m layer where deep rooting was observed for spi was very low and plants did probably not benefit from that these findings have implications on agronomic practices breeding objectives and cultivar selection by farmers for improving rice yield under water stress further investigations are needed on allowable depletion levels for minimal yield loss in irrigated upland rice and on plant density optimisation to control unproductive tillers during early reproductive stress 5 conclusions thermal time to the onset of specific developmental stages except for the time to peak tillering in upland rice was generally stable over seasons under stress free conditions however upland rice phenology was very sensitive to water stress during early reproductive growth stress during this stage increased growing degree days greatly not only to reach subsequent developmental stages but also to reach maturity and thus it altered crop duration delay in flowering was not related to the effect of water stress during vegetative and reproductive stages on tiller development even without suppression of tillers or death of apical buds under stress gdds to flowering and anthesis still increased water stress before flowering resulted in a greater recovery of source size canopy size than for a well watered crop at the same developmental stage this bounce back ability is specific to stress during early reproduction and is not related to tiller number during and after the relieve of stress grain yield loss under stress was largely as a result of fewer grains per panicle and spikelet sterility results suggest that improvements in spikelet number may be achieved through manipulating plant density in rice growing areas that are prone to a high risk of stress during early reproductive stages low plant densities may be recommended to minimise excessive unproductive tillers at harvest stress during anthesis and grain filling resulted in no substantial yield and water use efficiency penalty while a considerable amount of irrigation water could be saved the yields achieved in our study match typical grain yields reported for lowland rice systems suggesting that there is considerable room for increased upland rice yields the information gained in this study will help upland rice farmers to optimise water management practices for example to irrigate only during a critical stage and save water during late reproductive stages dryland farmers can minimise risks of high water losses by opting for low plant densities and selecting planting dates that reduce chances of early reproductive stress acknowledgements this work was supported with

11577,the north china plain ncp has a severe water shortage about 70 groundwater has been exploited for irrigation winter wheat summer maize and pears are typical representative cereal crops and commercial fruit trees in this area respectively water budget for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystems has a significant importance for agricultural production especially in the ncp therefore evapotranspiration et and water balance were studied in the annual winter wheat summer maize rotation cropland and pear orchard latent and sensible heat fluxes were measured by eddy covariance annual et for pear trees was 764 mm and for both crops was 690 mm the difference of et between these two ecosystems was about equal to one irrigation transpiration was the main loss with the mean proportion of 63 for crops and 76 for pear trees wheat growth period is in the dry season and requires much more irrigation than maize mainly transpiration 80 occurred from april through september in the both ecosystems which was also the growing period for pear trees the annual precipitation was 469 mm and 444 mm in the pear orchard and cropland respectively although 80 of it occurred from june to september compared with the precipitation annual mean water deficit was 294 mm for the pear trees and 244 mm for crops the water shortage was severe in may while surplus water presented in july and august energy and et fluxes were determined by atmospheric demand and the response of plants as controlled by plant phenology and crop selection as the water shortage situation becomes more serious in the ncp sustainability of the agricultural ecosystems could be improved by changing crop planting patterns specifically increasing the area ratio of maize to pear trees keywords pear orchard wheat maize evapotranspiration energy flux water balance 1 introduction more than a hundred countries are facing water shortage of varying severity in the world saeijs and van berkel 1995 roughly 40 of the global population is situated in heavily water deficit basins that are occasionally experienced agricultural failure due to a lack of water for irrigation shen et al 2014 meanwhile water shortage and agricultural production are large challenges for china about 20 of the cultivated land in china is in the north china plain ncp while the water resource accounts only for 3 of the country about 75 of cropland and 22 of orchard were irrigated by groundwater in the ncp therefore about 70 groundwater of the total exploitation were used in irrigation shen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 this status leads to groundwater depletion land subsidence and seawater intrusion in the ncp winter wheat summer maize and pears are typical representative cereal crops and commercial fruit trees with 40 and 22 of total harvest respectively given the extent of groundwater depletion in the ncp a quantitative study of water balance for two common agricultural production systems is an important step to explore information pertinent to decision making related to these production systems evapotranspiration et plays one of the important roles in the water and energy budget there are many methods for et measurement monitoring and modeling farahani et al 2007 shuttleworth 2008 the eddy covariance ec method is a reliable and widely used in the micrometeorological flux research schmidt et al 2012 shuttleworth 2007 twine et al 2000 it provides information on water energy and carbon dioxide fluxes by covariance calculation of atmospheric physical parameters e g temperature water vapors and co2 concentration and vertical wind velocity et depends on the atmospheric and water supply conditions soil characteristics and vegetation type in a comparison of five different irrigation treatments maximal yield was obtained when the optimal amount of irrigation was 298 mm yr 1 and et was 426 mm yr 1 for winter wheat during 1999 2002 in the ncp sun et al 2006 yuan and shen 2013 in contrast yang et al 2014 reported only 252 4 mm annual cumulative et during 2010 for spring wheat in semi arid farmland the loess plateau in china therefore finding a suitable method to measure et for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystems is required for more accurate water balance calculation in addition et partitioning is a fundamental factor to accurately hydrological monitoring system and water management practices kool et al 2014 in particular ratio of transpiration t to et reveals the fraction of water used for biomass production transpiration or evaporation can be calculated by

evaristo et al 2015 however few studies have been performed on the partition of et over an entire growing season and especially for the comparison of two typical irrigated ecosystems in the ncp in addition policy guidance plays an important role in the grain and fruit industries hebei province is located in the 38 n zone and comprises 80 of the ncp land area it is one of the best area in china for growing deciduous fruit trees fruit growth brings more economical benefit than crops however policies and government cannot just considered the financial benefits however a systematic water consumption data of crops and fruit trees is lacking for scientific decision that would help greater sustainability by changing various possible planting patterns to realize a reasonable and sustainable agricultural water management the main objectives of the present study were 1 to find out the differences of water balance and water consumption for pear trees and crops winter wheat summer maize ecosystems and 2 to give some reasonable suggestions for improved planting patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiments were conducted in the ncp of hebei

water depletion in the depth range 0 180 cm soil water depletion was calculated from the measured volumetric water content in the soil the runoff term was ignored because there is usually no runoff in cropland and pear orchards of the ncp as the farmlands in the ncp are flat soil evaporation of cropland were measured using three microlysimeters mls every day in the field from 1st may to 30th sep 2012 zhang et al 2011b a microlysimeter consists of a small isolated volume of soil same as the field mounted flush with or slightly above the soil surface daamen et al 1993 if irrigation or rainfall occurred soil in the mls was changed and reweighed generally we changed the soil per 3 5 days difference of soil moisture between the mls and the field did not reach significant level in 5 days sun et al 2003 allen 1990 transpiration of pear trees was calculated according to the liquid velocity heat dissipation theory granier 1987 from the heat pulse sap flow measurement details see zhang et al 2013 three trees were randomly selected for the sap flow measurement a probe set consisted of a heated needle above and a reference needle below the heated needle was inserted in a 1 2 mm diameter o d stainless steel tube that was 30 mm long the reference needle had no heating element lai was determined by measuring randomly collected samples for 10 wheat or 3 maize plants for each growing stage the total area of leaves was scaled to a unit area according to the plant density to calculate lai plant density was measured at the same time however the lai of pear trees was not measured vegetation coverage fv of plants has close relationship with lai to improve the consistency of comparison a camera fixed at 7 5 m height brinno garden watchcam was used to take pictures of trees at the frequency of 6 times day the gray level histogram method was used for vegetation coverage calculation of pear trees otsu 1979 yu and lin 2003 three original color red green and blue rgb separation processing was carried out for images of different growing periods rgb were instead by grey level value from 0 to 255 the greater of the grey level value the brighter of images gray value of the white sky was 255 and was 0 40 for the black leaves which was the basis of binary image the gray median of 128 was used as a criterion to separate a pixel from belonging to leaves to belonging to sky then the vegetation coverage was determined by the ratio of leaves to the total pixels for the crops the extinction coefficient k was determined by earlier research in the ncp relationship of k lai and fv was as following lindquist et al 2005 5 fv 1 e k lai 2 3 et data validation compared with the water balance method in order to evaluate the accuracy of eddy covariance measurements of et daily et of the cropland and pear orchard ecosystems during april and may when drainage could be ignored were selected for comparison between eddy covariance etec and the water balance etwb methods correlation coefficients of etec and etwb for cropland and pear orchard systems were both about 0 92 fig 2 a similar comparison between these two methods were conducted previously kolars et al 2013 scott 2010 soubie et al 2016 wilson et al 2001 but having variations changed from 10 to 17 therefore et measured by ec method was available in the present study 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions global radiation rd air temperature ta and relative humidity rh stand for aerodynamic aspects which influence water balance greatly annual rd in the pear orchard and the cropland were 4617 and 4194 mj m 2 respectively fig 3 peak of rd appeared in late june and early july around 29 mj m 2 d 1 for both of the ecosystems mean daily ta and rh in the four years were about 13 c and 68 for both sites respectively higher temperature and greater precipitation occurred from june to august which was very helpful for maize and pear trees growth from late march to the end of october mean daily ta was greater than 10 c enabling optimal growth of plants in general the radiation temperature and relative humidity were similar at these two sites due to their proximity in the typical irrigated cropland and orchard soil moisture was a variable that responds to both water inputs and withdrawal through soil evaporation drainage and root water uptake daily soil moisture of the wettest layer was selected as the maximum and the minimum represented the driest layer of 0 180 cm daily mean values of soil moisture 30 stand for the average water content level of all the layers for the both ecosystems the maximum 0 4 v v and the minimum 0 1 v v soil moisture appeared at 20 cm as precipitation irrigation and evaporation affected the shallow layer significantly fig 4 mean annual precipitation was 444 mm from 1st oct to 30th sep next year for the crops site it was about 25 mm less than the pear trees site during 2011 2015 tested periods these values were less than the long term average annual value because it included a dry year of 2014 which had approximately 255 mm precipitation at each site typically in the ncp 70 of the total precipitation occurs from june to august therefore there was enough water supply for the summer maize growth while serious water shortage occurred in the winter wheat season consequently 70 80 of irrigation was applied in the wheat season especially in the rapid growing periods from reviving to filling annual mean irrigation depth was 320 mm for the crops and 410 mm for the pear trees in these four years in contrast to the crops pear trees required more water especially in their early and late growing stages an adequate supply of water was necessary for the bud germination and fruit development while flowering stage needed relatively less water because of the less precipitation during 2013 2014 one more irrigation was applied at both sites however the added irrigation was still not enough to compensate the shortage of water therefore the total water consumption during 2013 2014 was still less than the other years plants phenology is an important factor caused the seasonal energy and water flux variations we calculated the vegetation coverage of plants to clarify the role of plants phenology fig 5 according to the development of plants growing stages of wheat were divided into six periods and five for maize shen et al 2013 a dormant stage during the overwintering periods of october to february in wheat is common while the other five stages were considered as the main research next year for the pear trees growing stages were divided into five growth periods table 1 generally april to september was considered as the growing period while the rest of months were the non growing periods there were the significant differences of coverage evolution for the crops and pear trees there were two peaks of vegetation cover during the annual rotation for the crops the first peak was appeared in may during the wheat growth periods of heading and filling vegetation coverage during this period reached almost 100 the other peak was appeared in august during the maize season however there was only one peak of 80 appeared in july for the pear trees which was smaller than the crops 3 2 energy partitioning net radiation rn is the difference of energy flux between incoming and outgoing radiation the mean annual rn was 2532 and 2567 mj m 2 y 1 for the crops and the pear trees respectively rn maintained a relatively high value of 12 18 mj m 2 d 1 from may to september for both ecosystems with exceptions on days having precipitation or significant cloud cover fig 6 the maximum of rn for the pear trees was 1 4 mj m 2 d 1 higher than the crops in july because maize was in the seeding stage annual sensible heat flux hs accounted for about 23 of rn for crops and about 27 for the pear trees seasonal hs of wheat was 334 mj m 2 it is 100 mj m 2 higher than maize because of its longer growth periods hs in the non growing season for pear trees accounted for 53 of rn annual soil heat flux g maintained a low value 2 9 mj m 2 y 1 for both crops and pear trees latent heat flux le was the most significant component in the energy partitioning in the cropland and pear orchard ecosystem le accounted for about 70 of rn fig 6 unlike rn it was closely correlated with the growth of crops and pear trees correlation coefficient of fv and rn was 0 50 while it was 0 85 for fv and le in the cropland system there were two le peaks in a growing year first in the winter wheat and the other for the summer maize 3 3 evapotranspiration and water balance et was calculated from le using eq 1 annual mean et was 690 mm for crops and 764 mm for pear trees fig 7 pear trees consumed more water than grain for fruit formation in july when water content of pears reached about 80 during the same period a transfer from wheat to maize in the cropland resulted in a lower et value the larger annual mean et for pears was primarily due to this difference in et between the two ecosystems in july the double cropping of winter wheat and maize caused two peaks in et for each growth year corresponding to the two peaks in fv previously identified in detail et for the wheat season and maize season were 400 and 290 mm respectively the maximum et consumption of crops was appeared in may for wheat 7 3 mm d 1 and august for maize 6 2 mm d 1 evapotranspiration was about 120 mm for the non growing season and about 650 mm for the growing season of pear trees and it was the maximum in july 7 8 mm d 1 the minimum et for both ecosystems appeared in january when the plants stopped growing partitioning of et is challenging but important for biomass production assessment and allocation of increasingly scarce water resources the standard deviation of et from 2011 to 2015 was approximately 13 mm accounting for only 1 8 of the annual mean value therefore annual et in 2012 a normal precipitation year was selected for analysis et was divided into evaporation e and transpiration t by microlysimeter and sap flow data combined with eddy covariance system and to generate the ratio of t et fig 7 due to the rotation between winter wheat and summer maize there was a separate peak of t et occurred during the filling stages of each crop in may and august the transpiration ratio remained high for pear trees over the growing season crops transpiration was a main loss in et with the mean t et of 63 for cropland 70 for winter wheat and 55 for summer maize the t et for pear orchard was 76 during the research periods therefore pear trees consumed more water in annual transpiration the annual and seasonal water balance is an important consideration for irrigation scheduling evapotranspiration estimation and planting pattern change the water sources for the crops and pear trees are groundwater irrigation and precipitation in these two ecosystem during 2011 2015 annual et of crops ranged from 674 to 702 mm and that of pears was 748 777 mm table 3 pear tree growth required about 75 mm more water than crops fig 8 precipitation p at these two sites varied from 248 to 627 mm during the study period the least precipitation appeared in 2013 2014 and the most serious water deficit wd occurred in the same period annual mean wd for the pear trees was 294 mm about 50 mm greater than the crops due to the excess water from precipitation and irrigation soil water drainage d occurred the four year average value of d was 103 mm for crops and 177 mm for pear trees which probably also could be related to the sand soil type of the orchard except for amount of precipitation and irrigation soil water depletion δw represented a negative dynamic change of soil reservoir mean value of δw was 29 mm for cropland and around 60 mm for pear orchard for crops negative value occurred in the wheat season as soil moisture always keep low in the middle of june however for pear trees there was usually an irrigation operated before blooming around april though the pear harvested after a rainy season in september so the variation of δw did not have obvious rule as crops water balance in the growing months also had significant importance for plant growth evapotranspiration occurred mainly from april to september when plants grow rapidly fig 9 more than 80 of the annual et occurred during these six months for both crops and pear trees it corresponded the shifting from dry season to rainy season for the ncp climate precipitation concentrated from june to september 80 for these two sites during 01 10 2011 30 09 2015 that was the reason why maize growth needed almost no irrigation irrigations were implemented in april and may about 80 mm per month which were the growing months for wheat during a dry season the mean irrigation during these two months accounted for 45 of the annual total amount winter irrigation was carried out to ensure that the soil temperature and moisture would be suitable for wheat growth in the next spring irrigations for the pear trees mainly occurred in the growing season the average value was about 270 mm applied in the growing season which accounted for 66 of the annual total irrigation in periods with less precipitation october may wd for pear trees were larger than for crops in general may was the most serious water shortage month and the average wd was 127 mm for crops and 94 mm for pear trees the largest water surplus happened in july 120 mm for crops therefore may and july were the two important months for crops and pear trees growth as well as irrigation scheduling and management 4 discussions this research quantified the water consumption of cropland and pear orchard ecosystems which play the important roles in the agro ecosystem of the ncp the highest daily et for crops and pear trees was almost 8 mm and it is agreement with almond ecosystem august n 35 30 37 w 119 40 3 califonia southern san joaquin vally spinelli et al 2016 in contrast pear trees consumed more water than apple trees at experiment conducted in the irta estaciò experimental de lleida spain it might occurred due to higher porosity in pear canopies than apple tree thus it improved air exchange light penetration and fluxes transfer girona et al 2011 umair et al 2017 reported that et was 430 mm yr 1 for winter wheat and 707 mm yr 1 for wheat and maize in ncp simulated by cropsyst model which were similar with this research et of mango orchard in brazil from flowering to maturation were from 370 mm to 480 mm while the irrigation treatments changed from 70 to 100 of reference evapotranspiration da silva et al 2009 the temperate deciduous forest in oak ridge tn located in the eastern of united states have higher net radiation than the crops and pear trees ecosystems while annual et 563 mm was lower than the current ecosystems and annual h accounted for 72 of le which was double of the agro ecosystems wilson and baldocchi 2000 research on the grassland and forest showed the annual patterns of phenology certainly affected the energy and et fluxes dynamic changes raddatz and cummine 2003 richardson et al 2013 therefore water consumption had strong relationship with the ecosystem types soil moisture the plant phenology and regional climates in the present research there were only 3 4 irrigations applied in wheat seasons and 0 2 irrigations in maize seasons while the total irrigation depth was about 320 mm for crops and 410 mm for pear trees water use efficiencies in the both sites were improved compared with decades ago because of the limited irrigation technologies and ditch irrigation application species changes economic development and other related measures zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011a b c shao et al 2009 the agreement between ec and water balance was also affected by water supply conditions and it was better in drier years for natural ecosystem such as grassland forest and savanna systems scott 2010 wilson et al 2001 therefore et only represented the specific management practices in this study if a surplus water was supplied such as the flood irrigation et of these two ecosystems probably had different results for example et of the winter wheat ranged from 120 mm to 550 mm under different irrigation treatment in the ncp during the past 30 years zhang et al 2017 irrigation also influenced soil moisture as precipitation or irrigation occurred in the similar days with the similar soil quality for each ecosystem only one site was selected for soil moisture measurement in this research vachaud et al 1985 however it should be noted that soil water content showed spatial heterogeneity especially for the orchard soil moisture measurement for the orchard was installed near the root water absorption area in this research in order to try to get a more accurate result actually it will be better to set several plots for soil moisture measurement galagedara et al 2000 kang et al 2002 the previous studies have successfully measured the partitioning between transpiration and evaporation general methods contained the microclimate model estimates isotope technology and heat pulse sap flow methods kool et al 2014 méndez barroso et al 2014 average t et of this study in 2012 was 63 for crops the contribution of wheat was 70 in it which was the agreement with research in 2009 zhang et al 2011b for instance t et values of the present studies on the same days of the year doy138 and doy149 were 85 and 68 while they were 83 and 60 in 2009 for the winter wheat by isotope technology the spring maize field showed 87 of et was used in transpiration zhang et al 2011a and the mean ratio was 53 for an irrigated vineyard in northwest china wen et al 2015 wu et al 2007 found about 4 5 of the soil water was evaporated mainly from the top 20 cm layer of a plastic film covered field in the same field as a result only 2 3 of soil water evaporated through plastic film holes therefore agronomic measures together with local climate affect et partitioning government policies constituted additional factors affecting regional water use and crop selection in the ncp the hebei province is one of the most representative in terms of agricultural production and was selected for further analysis the area of groundwater overdraft was 66779 km2 which constituted more than 91 of the hebei plain and the area of 73484 7 km2 was forbidden for groundwater exploitation the provincial government office 2014 about 70 of the groundwater was used for agricultural irrigation the consumption of grain almost 80 were maize and wheat is 47 and rest of 53 grains were transported to other provinces while this value was 68 for fruit meng and guo 2000 therefore it is not suitable to produce excessive grain and fruits in a serious water shortage area like the ncp recently the cultivated area has been increased including some areas with intercropped annual crops and fruit trees the pear orchard area has also been increased almost 4 folds from 51 2 103 ha to 200 9 103 ha department of rural social economic survey of the national bureau of statistics of china 2009 we compared the financial benefits of crops with pears in 2012 table 4 although the sowing area of pear orchard was far less than cropland accounted for about 8 the yield and financial income was 4 2 and 2 8 times larger than the crops however our research demonstrated a larger consumption of water resources by pear trees in comparison to wheat maize croplands per year the economically motivated increase in planting area of fruit trees cannot be maintained sustainably especially given the limited supply of water in the ncp food security is another issue in china the food production declined and food supply cannot meet the regional or national requirement due to the water shortage water savings can be realized by decreasing the planted area of wheat at the same time food production should be kept stable a breakthrough improvement in yield of summer maize had noticed from 3 5 ton ha in 1980s to 8 5 ton ha in the ncp chinese academy of agricultural sciences office 2014 this result had a great significance to the national food security therefore we will recommend the increase of cultivation area for maize because of less water consumption that ultimately recharge the groundwater maize production accounts for 50 of the total food production in the ncp liang et al 2011 and has extensive use so it probably can provide more guarantee for food security 5 conclusions in this study based on our 4 year analyses of water energy fluxes for the crops fields and pear orchard the water budgets for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystem in the ncp were compared the annual le accounted for 70 of rn for both ecosystems annual et for pear trees was 764 mm and was 690 mm for crops evapotranspiration in growing season contributed 85 of et while the ratio of t et was 76 for pear trees at the same time et of wheat and maize field were 400 mm and 290 mm while t et were 70 and 55 respectively pear orchard consumed more water than crops fields in this research more than 80 of et in both systems occurred during april to september from the dry season to the rainy season most precipitation concentrated in summer from june to september 80 for these two sites during the research years which was very helpful for maize growth almost no irrigation was needed annual mean water deficit for pear trees was 294 mm which was about 50 mm higher than that of the crops about 320 mm yr 1 and 410 mm yr 1 of irrigation water were applied for crop fields and pear orchard respectively water deficit was more serious in the winter wheat season but a water surplus occurred during the summer maize season therefore about 70 80 of the irrigation happened in the wheat season and the growing season of pear trees as the water shortage situation in the ncp is becoming more serious the government would carry out some reasonable policies and measures to ensure the sustainable use of water changing the planting patterns is an effective way to maintain water and food safety and can reduce the agricultural water usage according to the balance between water saving and financial benefits reducing the planting area of winter wheat and fruit orchards probably provide a possibility to sustainable usage of the groundwater acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key research and development plan 2016yfc0401403 national natural science fund of china grant no

11577,the north china plain ncp has a severe water shortage about 70 groundwater has been exploited for irrigation winter wheat summer maize and pears are typical representative cereal crops and commercial fruit trees in this area respectively water budget for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystems has a significant importance for agricultural production especially in the ncp therefore evapotranspiration et and water balance were studied in the annual winter wheat summer maize rotation cropland and pear orchard latent and sensible heat fluxes were measured by eddy covariance annual et for pear trees was 764 mm and for both crops was 690 mm the difference of et between these two ecosystems was about equal to one irrigation transpiration was the main loss with the mean proportion of 63 for crops and 76 for pear trees wheat growth period is in the dry season and requires much more irrigation than maize mainly transpiration 80 occurred from april through september in the both ecosystems which was also the growing period for pear trees the annual precipitation was 469 mm and 444 mm in the pear orchard and cropland respectively although 80 of it occurred from june to september compared with the precipitation annual mean water deficit was 294 mm for the pear trees and 244 mm for crops the water shortage was severe in may while surplus water presented in july and august energy and et fluxes were determined by atmospheric demand and the response of plants as controlled by plant phenology and crop selection as the water shortage situation becomes more serious in the ncp sustainability of the agricultural ecosystems could be improved by changing crop planting patterns specifically increasing the area ratio of maize to pear trees keywords pear orchard wheat maize evapotranspiration energy flux water balance 1 introduction more than a hundred countries are facing water shortage of varying severity in the world saeijs and van berkel 1995 roughly 40 of the global population is situated in heavily water deficit basins that are occasionally experienced agricultural failure due to a lack of water for irrigation shen et al 2014 meanwhile water shortage and agricultural production are large challenges for china about 20 of the cultivated land in china is in the north china plain ncp while the water resource accounts only for 3 of the country about 75 of cropland and 22 of orchard were irrigated by groundwater in the ncp therefore about 70 groundwater of the total exploitation were used in irrigation shen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 this status leads to groundwater depletion land subsidence and seawater intrusion in the ncp winter wheat summer maize and pears are typical representative cereal crops and commercial fruit trees with 40 and 22 of total harvest respectively given the extent of groundwater depletion in the ncp a quantitative study of water balance for two common agricultural production systems is an important step to explore information pertinent to decision making related to these production systems evapotranspiration et plays one of the important roles in the water and energy budget there are many methods for et measurement monitoring and modeling farahani et al 2007 shuttleworth 2008 the eddy covariance ec method is a reliable and widely used in the micrometeorological flux research schmidt et al 2012 shuttleworth 2007 twine et al 2000 it provides information on water energy and carbon dioxide fluxes by covariance calculation of atmospheric physical parameters e g temperature water vapors and co2 concentration and vertical wind velocity et depends on the atmospheric and water supply conditions soil characteristics and vegetation type in a comparison of five different irrigation treatments maximal yield was obtained when the optimal amount of irrigation was 298 mm yr 1 and et was 426 mm yr 1 for winter wheat during 1999 2002 in the ncp sun et al 2006 yuan and shen 2013 in contrast yang et al 2014 reported only 252 4 mm annual cumulative et during 2010 for spring wheat in semi arid farmland the loess plateau in china therefore finding a suitable method to measure et for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystems is required for more accurate water balance calculation in addition et partitioning is a fundamental factor to accurately hydrological monitoring system and water management practices kool et al 2014 in particular ratio of transpiration t to et reveals the fraction of water used for biomass production transpiration or evaporation can be calculated by subtracting one or the other from et uddin et al 2013 montoro et al 2016 microlysimeter is a classical method for soil evaporation e measurement boast and robertson 1982 combined the micrometeorological technique with microlysimeter method can be used in partitioning the et flux tree transpiration can be measured by heat pulse sap flow method granier 1987 the ratio of t et ranged from 0 64 to 0 74 for olive trees during november to april in chile lópez olivari et al 2016 measured transpiration was also used in the model parameterization and verification villegas et al 2015 evaristo et al 2015 however few studies have been performed on the partition of et over an entire growing season and especially for the comparison of two typical irrigated ecosystems in the ncp in addition policy guidance plays an important role in the grain and fruit industries hebei province is located in the 38 n zone and comprises 80 of the ncp land area it is one of the best area in china for growing deciduous fruit trees fruit growth brings more economical benefit than crops however policies and government cannot just considered the financial benefits however a systematic water consumption data of crops and fruit trees is lacking for scientific decision that would help greater sustainability by changing various possible planting patterns to realize a reasonable and sustainable agricultural water management the main objectives of the present study were 1 to find out the differences of water balance and water consumption for pear trees and crops winter wheat summer maize ecosystems and 2 to give some reasonable suggestions for improved planting patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiments were conducted in the ncp of hebei province at the zhaoxian site 37 47 44 n 114 55 57 e altitude 40 m and the luancheng agro ecosystem experimental station 37 53 22 n 114 41 34 e altitude 50 1 m which represent the typical irrigated pear orchard and cropland ecosystems respectively fig 1 the distance between these two sites was about 20 km the data were collected for four years from october 1 2011 to september 30 2015 seasonal division details see table 1 in hebei province pear cultivation and crops accounted for 20 and about 10 of the total cultivated areas for these commodities in china respectively hebei rural statistic yearbook 2013 more than 90 of the cropland and pear orchard were irrigated by groundwater in luancheng and zhaoxian water table fell by about 0 8 m y 1 shen et al 2013 and the total dissolved solids tdl of goundwater for these two site was about 285 mg l the winter wheat and summer maize are cultivated in rotation in a single year fields have been mulched with maize and wheat straws for about 20 years at the luancheng site for the pear orchard ecosystem mean height of the trees were 5 0 m and an interval of 5 0 m between rows and 4 0 m between trees the variety of pear pyrus bretschneideri rehd was planted in 1989 with a trunk diameter about 180 250 mm fruit thinning was performed from 15 to 20 days after flower drop fruit spacing was 15 25 cm soil textural data for the depth range 0 180 cm is provided in table 2 zhang et al 2011a b c zhang et al 2013 soil organic matter content at the top 20 cm layer was 1 8 for the cropland and 0 8 for the orchard field capacity was approximately 34 35 v v at the top 100 cm soil layer and the viable roots were mainly distributed in this layer for both systems sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 water table depth in the cropland and the orchard was 40 50 m 2 2 field measurement and calculations eddy covariance ec systems for flux measurements were installed at both the cropland and orchard sites each system consisted of a three

water depletion in the depth range 0 180 cm soil water depletion was calculated from the measured volumetric water content in the soil the runoff term was ignored because there is usually no runoff in cropland and pear orchards of the ncp as the farmlands in the ncp are flat soil evaporation of cropland were measured using three microlysimeters mls every day in the field from 1st may to 30th sep 2012 zhang et al 2011b a microlysimeter consists of a small isolated volume of soil same as the field mounted flush with or slightly above the soil surface daamen et al 1993 if irrigation or rainfall occurred soil in the mls was changed and reweighed generally we changed the soil per 3 5 days difference of soil moisture between the mls and the field did not reach significant level in 5 days sun et al 2003 allen 1990 transpiration of pear trees was calculated according to the liquid velocity heat dissipation theory granier 1987 from the heat pulse sap flow measurement details see zhang et al 2013 three trees were randomly selected for the sap flow measurement a probe set consisted of a heated needle above and a reference needle below the heated needle was inserted in a 1 2 mm diameter o d stainless steel tube that was 30 mm long the reference needle had no heating element lai was determined by measuring randomly collected samples for 10 wheat or 3 maize plants for each growing stage the total area of leaves was scaled to a unit area according to the plant density to calculate lai plant density was measured at the same time however the lai of pear trees was not measured vegetation coverage fv of plants has close relationship with lai to improve the consistency of comparison a camera fixed at 7 5 m height brinno garden watchcam was used to take pictures of trees at the frequency of 6 times day the gray level histogram method was used for vegetation coverage calculation of pear trees otsu 1979 yu and lin 2003 three original color red green and blue rgb separation processing was carried out for images of different growing periods rgb were instead by grey level value from 0 to 255 the greater of the grey level value the brighter of images gray value of the white sky was 255 and was 0 40 for the black leaves which was the basis of binary image the gray median of 128 was used as a criterion to separate a pixel from belonging to leaves to belonging to sky then the vegetation coverage was determined by the ratio of leaves to the total pixels for the crops the extinction coefficient k was determined by earlier research in the ncp relationship of k lai and fv was as following lindquist et al 2005 5 fv 1 e k lai 2 3 et data validation compared with the water balance method in order to evaluate the accuracy of eddy covariance measurements of et daily et of the cropland and pear orchard ecosystems during april and may when drainage could be ignored were selected for comparison between eddy covariance etec and the water balance etwb methods correlation coefficients of etec and etwb for cropland and pear orchard systems were both about 0 92 fig 2 a similar comparison between these two methods were conducted previously kolars et al 2013 scott 2010 soubie et al 2016 wilson et al 2001 but having variations changed from 10 to 17 therefore et measured by ec method was available in the present study 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions global radiation rd air temperature ta and relative humidity rh stand for aerodynamic aspects which influence water balance greatly annual rd in the pear orchard and the cropland were 4617 and 4194 mj m 2 respectively fig 3 peak of rd appeared in late june and early july around 29 mj m 2 d 1 for both of the ecosystems mean daily ta and rh in the four years were about 13 c and 68 for both sites respectively higher temperature and greater precipitation occurred from june to august which was very helpful for maize and pear trees growth from late march to the end of october mean daily ta was greater than 10 c enabling optimal growth of plants in general the radiation temperature and relative humidity were similar at these two sites due to their proximity in the typical irrigated cropland and orchard soil moisture was a variable that responds to both water inputs and withdrawal through soil evaporation drainage and root water uptake daily soil moisture of the wettest layer was selected as the maximum and the minimum represented the driest layer of 0 180 cm daily mean values of soil moisture 30 stand for the average water content level of all the layers for the both ecosystems the maximum 0 4 v v and the minimum 0 1 v v soil moisture appeared at 20 cm as precipitation irrigation and evaporation affected the shallow layer significantly fig 4 mean annual precipitation was 444 mm from 1st oct to 30th sep next year for the crops site it was about 25 mm less than the pear trees site during 2011 2015 tested periods these values were less than the long term average annual value because it included a dry year of 2014 which had approximately 255 mm precipitation at each site typically in the ncp 70 of the total precipitation occurs from june to august therefore there was enough water supply for the summer maize growth while serious water shortage occurred in the winter wheat season consequently 70 80 of irrigation was applied in the wheat season especially in the rapid growing periods from reviving to filling annual mean irrigation depth was 320 mm for the crops and 410 mm for the pear trees in these four years in contrast to the crops pear trees required more water especially in their early and late growing stages an adequate supply of water was necessary for the bud germination and fruit development while flowering stage needed relatively less water because of the less precipitation during 2013 2014 one more irrigation was applied at both sites however the added irrigation was still not enough to compensate the shortage of water therefore the total water consumption during 2013 2014 was still less than the other years plants phenology is an important factor caused the seasonal energy and water flux variations we calculated the vegetation coverage of plants to clarify the role of plants phenology fig 5 according to the development of plants growing stages of wheat were divided into six periods and five for maize shen et al 2013 a dormant stage during the overwintering periods of october to february in wheat is common while the other five stages were considered as the main research next year for the pear trees growing stages were divided into five growth periods table 1 generally april to september was considered as the growing period while the rest of months were the non growing periods there were the significant differences of coverage evolution for the crops and pear trees there were two peaks of vegetation cover during the annual rotation for the crops the first peak was appeared in may during the wheat growth periods of heading and filling vegetation coverage during this period reached almost 100 the other peak was appeared in august during the maize season however there was only one peak of 80 appeared in july for the pear trees which was smaller than the crops 3 2 energy partitioning net radiation rn is the difference of energy flux between incoming and outgoing radiation the mean annual rn was 2532 and 2567 mj m 2 y 1 for the crops and the pear trees respectively rn maintained a relatively high value of 12 18 mj m 2 d 1 from may to september for both ecosystems with exceptions on days having precipitation or significant cloud cover fig 6 the maximum of rn for the pear trees was 1 4 mj m 2 d 1 higher than the crops in july because maize was in the seeding stage annual sensible heat flux hs accounted for about 23 of rn for crops and about 27 for the pear trees seasonal hs of wheat was 334 mj m 2 it is 100 mj m 2 higher than maize because of its longer growth periods hs in the non growing season for pear trees accounted for 53 of rn annual soil heat flux g maintained a low value 2 9 mj m 2 y 1 for both crops and pear trees latent heat flux le was the most significant component in the energy partitioning in the cropland and pear orchard ecosystem le accounted for about 70 of rn fig 6 unlike rn it was closely correlated with the growth of crops and pear trees correlation coefficient of fv and rn was 0 50 while it was 0 85 for fv and le in the cropland system there were two le peaks in a growing year first in the winter wheat and the other for the summer maize 3 3 evapotranspiration and water balance et was calculated from le using eq 1 annual mean et was 690 mm for crops and 764 mm for pear trees fig 7 pear trees consumed more water than grain for fruit formation in july when water content of pears reached about 80 during the same period a transfer from wheat to maize in the cropland resulted in a lower et value the larger annual mean et for pears was primarily due to this difference in et between the two ecosystems in july the double cropping of winter wheat and maize caused two peaks in et for each growth year corresponding to the two peaks in fv previously identified in detail et for the wheat season and maize season were 400 and 290 mm respectively the maximum et consumption of crops was appeared in may for wheat 7 3 mm d 1 and august for maize 6 2 mm d 1 evapotranspiration was about 120 mm for the non growing season and about 650 mm for the growing season of pear trees and it was the maximum in july 7 8 mm d 1 the minimum et for both ecosystems appeared in january when the plants stopped growing partitioning of et is challenging but important for biomass production assessment and allocation of increasingly scarce water resources the standard deviation of et from 2011 to 2015 was approximately 13 mm accounting for only 1 8 of the annual mean value therefore annual et in 2012 a normal precipitation year was selected for analysis et was divided into evaporation e and transpiration t by microlysimeter and sap flow data combined with eddy covariance system and to generate the ratio of t et fig 7 due to the rotation between winter wheat and summer maize there was a separate peak of t et occurred during the filling stages of each crop in may and august the transpiration ratio remained high for pear trees over the growing season crops transpiration was a main loss in et with the mean t et of 63 for cropland 70 for winter wheat and 55 for summer maize the t et for pear orchard was 76 during the research periods therefore pear trees consumed more water in annual transpiration the annual and seasonal water balance is an important consideration for irrigation scheduling evapotranspiration estimation and planting pattern change the water sources for the crops and pear trees are groundwater irrigation and precipitation in these two ecosystem during 2011 2015 annual et of crops ranged from 674 to 702 mm and that of pears was 748 777 mm table 3 pear tree growth required about 75 mm more water than crops fig 8 precipitation p at these two sites varied from 248 to 627 mm during the study period the least precipitation appeared in 2013 2014 and the most serious water deficit wd occurred in the same period annual mean wd for the pear trees was 294 mm about 50 mm greater than the crops due to the excess water from precipitation and irrigation soil water drainage d occurred the four year average value of d was 103 mm for crops and 177 mm for pear trees which probably also could be related to the sand soil type of the orchard except for amount of precipitation and irrigation soil water depletion δw represented a negative dynamic change of soil reservoir mean value of δw was 29 mm for cropland and around 60 mm for pear orchard for crops negative value occurred in the wheat season as soil moisture always keep low in the middle of june however for pear trees there was usually an irrigation operated before blooming around april though the pear harvested after a rainy season in september so the variation of δw did not have obvious rule as crops water balance in the growing months also had significant importance for plant growth evapotranspiration occurred mainly from april to september when plants grow rapidly fig 9 more than 80 of the annual et occurred during these six months for both crops and pear trees it corresponded the shifting from dry season to rainy season for the ncp climate precipitation concentrated from june to september 80 for these two sites during 01 10 2011 30 09 2015 that was the reason why maize growth needed almost no irrigation irrigations were implemented in april and may about 80 mm per month which were the growing months for wheat during a dry season the mean irrigation during these two months accounted for 45 of the annual total amount winter irrigation was carried out to ensure that the soil temperature and moisture would be suitable for wheat growth in the next spring irrigations for the pear trees mainly occurred in the growing season the average value was about 270 mm applied in the growing season which accounted for 66 of the annual total irrigation in periods with less precipitation october may wd for pear trees were larger than for crops in general may was the most serious water shortage month and the average wd was 127 mm for crops and 94 mm for pear trees the largest water surplus happened in july 120 mm for crops therefore may and july were the two important months for crops and pear trees growth as well as irrigation scheduling and management 4 discussions this research quantified the water consumption of cropland and pear orchard ecosystems which play the important roles in the agro ecosystem of the ncp the highest daily et for crops and pear trees was almost 8 mm and it is agreement with almond ecosystem august n 35 30 37 w 119 40 3 califonia southern san joaquin vally spinelli et al 2016 in contrast pear trees consumed more water than apple trees at experiment conducted in the irta estaciò experimental de lleida spain it might occurred due to higher porosity in pear canopies than apple tree thus it improved air exchange light penetration and fluxes transfer girona et al 2011 umair et al 2017 reported that et was 430 mm yr 1 for winter wheat and 707 mm yr 1 for wheat and maize in ncp simulated by cropsyst model which were similar with this research et of mango orchard in brazil from flowering to maturation were from 370 mm to 480 mm while the irrigation treatments changed from 70 to 100 of reference evapotranspiration da silva et al 2009 the temperate deciduous forest in oak ridge tn located in the eastern of united states have higher net radiation than the crops and pear trees ecosystems while annual et 563 mm was lower than the current ecosystems and annual h accounted for 72 of le which was double of the agro ecosystems wilson and baldocchi 2000 research on the grassland and forest showed the annual patterns of phenology certainly affected the energy and et fluxes dynamic changes raddatz and cummine 2003 richardson et al 2013 therefore water consumption had strong relationship with the ecosystem types soil moisture the plant phenology and regional climates in the present research there were only 3 4 irrigations applied in wheat seasons and 0 2 irrigations in maize seasons while the total irrigation depth was about 320 mm for crops and 410 mm for pear trees water use efficiencies in the both sites were improved compared with decades ago because of the limited irrigation technologies and ditch irrigation application species changes economic development and other related measures zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011a b c shao et al 2009 the agreement between ec and water balance was also affected by water supply conditions and it was better in drier years for natural ecosystem such as grassland forest and savanna systems scott 2010 wilson et al 2001 therefore et only represented the specific management practices in this study if a surplus water was supplied such as the flood irrigation et of these two ecosystems probably had different results for example et of the winter wheat ranged from 120 mm to 550 mm under different irrigation treatment in the ncp during the past 30 years zhang et al 2017 irrigation also influenced soil moisture as precipitation or irrigation occurred in the similar days with the similar soil quality for each ecosystem only one site was selected for soil moisture measurement in this research vachaud et al 1985 however it should be noted that soil water content showed spatial heterogeneity especially for the orchard soil moisture measurement for the orchard was installed near the root water absorption area in this research in order to try to get a more accurate result actually it will be better to set several plots for soil moisture measurement galagedara et al 2000 kang et al 2002 the previous studies have successfully measured the partitioning between transpiration and evaporation general methods contained the microclimate model estimates isotope technology and heat pulse sap flow methods kool et al 2014 méndez barroso et al 2014 average t et of this study in 2012 was 63 for crops the contribution of wheat was 70 in it which was the agreement with research in 2009 zhang et al 2011b for instance t et values of the present studies on the same days of the year doy138 and doy149 were 85 and 68 while they were 83 and 60 in 2009 for the winter wheat by isotope technology the spring maize field showed 87 of et was used in transpiration zhang et al 2011a and the mean ratio was 53 for an irrigated vineyard in northwest china wen et al 2015 wu et al 2007 found about 4 5 of the soil water was evaporated mainly from the top 20 cm layer of a plastic film covered field in the same field as a result only 2 3 of soil water evaporated through plastic film holes therefore agronomic measures together with local climate affect et partitioning government policies constituted additional factors affecting regional water use and crop selection in the ncp the hebei province is one of the most representative in terms of agricultural production and was selected for further analysis the area of groundwater overdraft was 66779 km2 which constituted more than 91 of the hebei plain and the area of 73484 7 km2 was forbidden for groundwater exploitation the provincial government office 2014 about 70 of the groundwater was used for agricultural irrigation the consumption of grain almost 80 were maize and wheat is 47 and rest of 53 grains were transported to other provinces while this value was 68 for fruit meng and guo 2000 therefore it is not suitable to produce excessive grain and fruits in a serious water shortage area like the ncp recently the cultivated area has been increased including some areas with intercropped annual crops and fruit trees the pear orchard area has also been increased almost 4 folds from 51 2 103 ha to 200 9 103 ha department of rural social economic survey of the national bureau of statistics of china 2009 we compared the financial benefits of crops with pears in 2012 table 4 although the sowing area of pear orchard was far less than cropland accounted for about 8 the yield and financial income was 4 2 and 2 8 times larger than the crops however our research demonstrated a larger consumption of water resources by pear trees in comparison to wheat maize croplands per year the economically motivated increase in planting area of fruit trees cannot be maintained sustainably especially given the limited supply of water in the ncp food security is another issue in china the food production declined and food supply cannot meet the regional or national requirement due to the water shortage water savings can be realized by decreasing the planted area of wheat at the same time food production should be kept stable a breakthrough improvement in yield of summer maize had noticed from 3 5 ton ha in 1980s to 8 5 ton ha in the ncp chinese academy of agricultural sciences office 2014 this result had a great significance to the national food security therefore we will recommend the increase of cultivation area for maize because of less water consumption that ultimately recharge the groundwater maize production accounts for 50 of the total food production in the ncp liang et al 2011 and has extensive use so it probably can provide more guarantee for food security 5 conclusions in this study based on our 4 year analyses of water energy fluxes for the crops fields and pear orchard the water budgets for the typical cropland and orchard ecosystem in the ncp were compared the annual le accounted for 70 of rn for both ecosystems annual et for pear trees was 764 mm and was 690 mm for crops evapotranspiration in growing season contributed 85 of et while the ratio of t et was 76 for pear trees at the same time et of wheat and maize field were 400 mm and 290 mm while t et were 70 and 55 respectively pear orchard consumed more water than crops fields in this research more than 80 of et in both systems occurred during april to september from the dry season to the rainy season most precipitation concentrated in summer from june to september 80 for these two sites during the research years which was very helpful for maize growth almost no irrigation was needed annual mean water deficit for pear trees was 294 mm which was about 50 mm higher than that of the crops about 320 mm yr 1 and 410 mm yr 1 of irrigation water were applied for crop fields and pear orchard respectively water deficit was more serious in the winter wheat season but a water surplus occurred during the summer maize season therefore about 70 80 of the irrigation happened in the wheat season and the growing season of pear trees as the water shortage situation in the ncp is becoming more serious the government would carry out some reasonable policies and measures to ensure the sustainable use of water changing the planting patterns is an effective way to maintain water and food safety and can reduce the agricultural water usage according to the balance between water saving and financial benefits reducing the planting area of winter wheat and fruit orchards probably provide a possibility to sustainable usage of the groundwater acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key research and development plan 2016yfc0401403 national natural science fund of china grant no

11578,subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a professional water distribution system for improved crop water use and conserving water selecting drip tape installation depths for different crops is the most critical decision with these systems hence the aim of this research was to examine the effects of different sdi depths and water amounts on the yield components and water use characteristics of green bean crop under unheated greenhouse conditions during two crop growing cycles three irrigation methods traditional drip irrigation di sdi at 10cm soil depth sdi10 and sdi at 20cm soil depth sdi20 and six irrigation water levels i based on crop pan coefficients i20 kcp 0 20 i40 kcp 0 40 i60 kcp 0 60 i80 kcp 0 80 i100 kcp 1 00 and i120 kcp 1 20 were evaluated in each growing cycle adequately watered crops i100 were accepted as control the seasonal evapotranspiration changed from 235 to 374mm in autumn and from 270 to 566mm in spring season different placement depths of drip tape had significant effects on green bean yields in spring growing cycle maximum yield 5 97kgm 2 was obtained in sdi10 irrigation method irrigation water levels also significantly p 0 001 affected green bean yield in both growing cycles the highest yield 1 66kgm 2 in autumn and 6 81kgm 2 in spring was obtained in i100 treatment sdi techniques improved water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the values of wue and iwue increased as the watering level was reduced maximum yield response factor in di method in autumn and spring seasons ky was found as 0 96 and 1 66 respectively general evaluation of the water management crop yield components and growth variables showed that the sdi10i100 treatment appears to be the most favorable irrigation practice for the green bean grown under greenhouse conditions water savings of up to 13 of seasonal irrigation water could be achieved using sdi method keywords subsurface drip irrigation deficit irrigation buried drippers water savings greenhouse green bean yield 1 introduction greenhouses are used to provide and sustain a sufficient environment for crops to obtain maximum yield in climate conditions unsuitable for plant production greenhouse crop production is widely practiced in many regions of the world including in areas with a temperate mediterranean climate since the market value of green bean phaselous vulgaris l is high compared to other vegetables it is grown extensively in greenhouses green bean is produced in the mediterranean greenhouses in two short product cycles from the early autumn to the end of spring autumn winter and spring in the region where all greenhouse crops are drip irrigated and the watering costs are relatively high the irrigation practices are still based on the growers experience and focused on maximizing yield and fruit quality regardless of the irrigation water consumption gonzalez et al 2009 world green bean production is 21 365 000t and turkey ranked fourth with the total production of 632 301t based on the data of 2013 fao 2013 irrigation management is very important in green bean production because the application method and the application program of irrigation water are crucial at all stages of crop growing from sowing or transplanting to harvesting for this reason sufficient water should be supplied to the crop in order to ensure high quality and the highest productivity in addition it is a necessity to provide water to the plants grown in the greenhouses by irrigation since the plants have a high water requirement and there is no other water inputs such as rainfall despite decreasing water resources increasing agricultural water needs require more careful management of available water resources the drip irrigation method will continue to be important in the future with its water saving benefits and contribution to the environmental sustainability it provides many unique agronomic water and energy conservation benefits that address many challenges seen in the irrigated agriculture patel and rajput 2007 moreover the trend in recent years has been towards changing the traditional surface drip irrigation di to subsurface drip irrigation sdi sdi systems can apply irrigation water needed by the plants directly to the root zone at low doses and short intervals to keep ideal moisture conditions in the soil they have significant advantages compared to the conventional drip irrigation systems such as minimizing evaporation from the soil and preventing surface runoff consequently sdi is the most efficient water distribution system to increase water use efficiency wue and save water on the other hand selecting drip tape installation depths for different crops is the most critical decision in this irrigation method it was reported that increasing the depth of the drip tube resulted in yield decreases in some plants and soil types for instance marouelli and silva 2002 reported that the increase in the depth of the dripper from 20cm to 40cm in tomato production in central brazil resulted in a 32 yield reduction another issue to be considered in the planning of irrigation is scheduling irrigation scheduling is very important in the use of drip systems as applying too much or insufficient water cause plant stress and crop yield reduction evaporation pans can be successfully used to plan irrigation using appropriate pan kp and plant kc coefficients sezen et al 2006 this technique can efficiently be used in irrigation programming by combining the two specific coefficients kcp different studies were carried out in this direction in the literature for example sezen et al 2005 examined the effect of irrigation frequency and crop pan coefficients in an open field and obtained a highest green bean yield of 20 558kgha 1 with a pan coefficient of 1 0 as is known from previous studies the most critical decision for the sdi applications is the drip tape placement depth depending on irrigation program and crop type experiments should be conducted in both open fields and greenhouses because the conditions of these areas are different however the studies are inadequate in the literature on the application of sdi in the cultivation of green beans in greenhouses in light of all these facts the aims of this study were 1 to find out the effect of irrigation water amounts on yield and quality of green bean grown in greenhouse 2 to determine the optimal placement depth of drip tape and 3 to find out the relationship between water use properties such as crop water consumption water use efficiency wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and yield response factor of green bean in the mediterranean coastal area of turkey 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site conditions a greenhouse research was carried out during two short crop cycles autumn 2009 and spring 2010 in the research and training farm of mustafa kemal university located in hatay province turkey latitude 36 08 n longitude 35 54 e altitude 10m experimental greenhouse with a 0 2mm thick thermal polyethylene cover had a size of 54m length 36m width the greenhouse was not heated and side panels and roof vents were used for passive ventilation the experimental site had typical mediterranean climate conditions according to the data of the turkish state meteorological service tsms long term 1975 2009 annual mean maximum and minimum daily temperatures in the region were 19 0 22 9 and 15 7 c respectively the mean relative humidity and annual total rainfall were 75 3 and 902 9mm respectively climatic data of the experimental greenhouse for the two growing seasons are given in table 1 mean temperatures changed from 15 2 c to 27 0 c in the autumn growing cycle and from 23 2 c to 29 9 c in the spring growing cycle table 1 for soil texture analysis with hydrometer method samples were collected at intervals of 30cm from the surface to a depth of 90cm the soil was deep clay loam comprising 43 0 sand 20 3 silt and 36 7 clay the bulk density of the soil was 1 49gcm 3 and available water holding capacity was determined as 223mm in a 90cm soil depth the fertilizers with a total of 75kgnha 1 100kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100kgk2oha 1 were applied equally to all parcels based on soil analysis results since the flowering and harvesting periods of green beans are simultaneous and last about four to five weeks the nitrogen application was divided into two parts to meet the requirements of the new pod formations the fertilizers as pure matter were applied at transplanting at a rate of 30kgnha 1 100kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100kgk2oha 1 while the remaining part of the n ammonium nitrate 33 n was applied at the beginning of the flowering and at the middle of the harvesting periods equally by the fertigation system 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was a split plot with three replications each block contained three main plots with three drip tape placement depth as irrigation methods traditional drip irrigation di subsurface drip irrigation at 10cm depth sdi10 and 20cm depth sdi20 in soil profile and six subplots irrigated at different irrigation water i levels based on crop pan coefficients i20 kcp 0 20 i40 kcp 0 40 i60 kcp 0 60 i80 kcp 0 80 i100 kcp 1 00 and i120 kcp 1 20 in general the green beans are grown both from the seeds and from the seedlings in greenhouses in turkey it is a common application to transplant seedlings in small greenhouses as the bigger ones use seeds instead of transplanting in the current study bean seeds were germinated in peat material in viols and transferred to the greenhouse after two true leaves emerged the green bean seedlings of cv alman ayşe were transplanted on 14 october 2009 in the first experimental crop cycle and on 02 march 2010 in the second experimental crop cycle even if tuarira and moses 2014 suggested narrower in row planting distances 0 10 0 20m in green bean seed production in zimbabwe it is widely accepted to plant this crop in wider in row spacing in greenhouse production due to fungal diseases caused by the high humidity and low ventilation problem in the local greenhouses therefore the experimental plants were transplanted to a wider distance of 0 30m 0 50m on the subplots as suggested by onder et al 2006 the subplots designed as 1 00m apart from each other had double crop rows with 0 5m width and 12 0m length fig 1 traditional greenhouse green bean production techniques were carried out for the other agronomic practices 2 3 experimental setup and methodology the irrigation water obtained from a well had a c2s1 quality classification ussl 1954 with a ph of 7 9 and an average electrical conductivity of 0 72dsm 1 for each plant line a drip irrigation lateral having in line drippers with a spacing of 20cm and having a 2lh 1 discharge rate was used drip tapes in the subsurface drip irrigation treatment were buried manually to 10cm and 20cm soil depths irrigation system had a central control unit combined with a by pass fertigation system water applications were controlled by using manual valves and monitored using water meters soil matric potential was monitored daily by using manual tensiometers irrometer barcelona spain irrigation scheduling was carried out based on soil water status of full irrigation dii100 plot watering was initiated when the reading of the tensiometer placed at a depth of 30cm in the soil approached to about 30kpa the irrigation water amount i was calculated with the following equation 1 i aepankcp where kcp is the crop pan coefficient epan is the total amount of class a pan evaporation between two consecutive irrigation events mm and a is the irrigation area m2 daily evaporation in the class a pan was routinely measured with a digital micrometer at 9 am to minimize the effect of soil water differences in different plots on the establishment of plantlets in both crop cycles the soil water was balanced to the field capacity at 30cm profile depth at the transplantation of plants in all treatment plots seasonal measured evapotranspiration et mm was estimated using soil water balance according to jovanovic and annandale 1999 using following equation 2 et p i r dr δq the components of the soil water balance are rainfall p irrigation i runoff r and drainage dr δq represents soil water storage all terms are expressed in mm since the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse there was no precipitation p because of the use of drip irrigation system the runoff r was assumed to be zero before each irrigation throughout the season the water content of the soil was determined by gravimetric method in increments of 30cm from the surface up to 90cm depth mass soil moisture contents were converted to equivalent depths using bulk density and layer depth if available water in the root zone 0 60cm and total applied water amount by irrigation were above the field capacity it was assumed that the water amount above field capacity leaked into the deeper soil zones and this was called deep percolation or drainage dp or dr available total water amount at 0 60cm soil depth before irrigation applied irrigation water field capacity ertek et al 2006 2 4 measurements and determinations green bean pods were hand harvested 11 times in autumn and 14 times in spring period between the 40th day and the 90th day after the transplanting in both production periods in the 6m sections of the two adjacent rows in each plot the harvest area in each plot was 3m2 yield parameters such as pod yield kgm 2 mean pod mass g pod 1 and pod number per plant were determined in each factorial plot the pod quality properties such as pod width pw thickness pt and length pl were determined by a digital micrometer for 20 green beans randomly selected from the harvested beans in each subplot the sampled beans were milled to remove water and the total soluble solid content brix and ph were determined in the juice of the bean pods with a refractometer n o w co model 507 i tokyo japan and a ph meter respectively leaf area index lai m2 m 2 leaf chlorophyll content and above ground biomass agb g plant 1 of the crop were also determined at the last harvest time in each subplot leaf chlorophyll content was determined as descripted by nageswara rao et al 2001 using spad chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta corp ramsey nj usa on four plants per plot and three leaves per plant total of 12 leaves and the average value was calculated placom electronic planimeter model kp90n koizumi mfg co ltd niigata japan was used for leaf area measurements of the plants that have been removed for biomass measurements the total leaf area of a plant was multiplied by the number of plants in the area of a 1m2 to obtain the lai value in order to quantify the effect of the water stress on yield reduction it is necessary to drive the relationship between relative yield decrease and relative evapotranspiration deficit given by the empirically derived yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 the yield response factor ky was determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 using the stewart model 3 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya is the actual green bean yield tha 1 ym is the maximum green bean yield tha 1 eta is the actual crop water consumption mm and etm is the maximum crop water consumption mm in addition to these in order to evaluate the productivity of the irrigation water total water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue values were determined as follows wue was calculated as the ratio between green bean yield kgha 1 and seasonal evapotranspiration mm while iwue was calculated as the ratio between green bean yield kgha 1 and total irrigation water applied mm 2 5 statistical analysis a randomized split plot design with three replications was used with lateral placement depths as main plots and irrigation water levels as subplots in the experiment mstat c statistical software version 2 1 was used for statistical analysis duncan s multiple range test was used at a probability of 0 05 to compare the mean values determined in the experiment since the yield data between the seasons were not homogeneous as shown by the homogeneity tests seasons were analyzed separately 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water use characteristics and yield the use of pan evaporation technique for estimating the crop water requirement is a highly simple method that can be easily practiced by farmers because it does not require complex data there have been various studies made in this direction for green bean with different irrigation water applications in the literature for example gencoglan et al 2006 sezen et al 2008 and camoglu and genc 2013 studied irrigation for field grown green bean in these studies irrigation water levels varied approximately from 260 to 680mm depending on kcp coefficients additionally onder et al 2006 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 studied the same crop under greenhouse conditions table 2 shows the water use characteristics such as i et wue iwue and yield values of green bean plants obtained in the current study i and et values were calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively same irrigation water amounts were applied to the three drip tape placement depths as irrigation method treatments in the study however seasonal irrigation water applied with time intervals changing from 3 to 10days differed from 55 to 328mm based on the kcp coefficients in each lateral depth in the autumn crop cycle on the other hand in the spring crop cycle seasonal irrigation water applied with intervals changing from 3 to 6days varied from 87 to 524mm table 2 because of the higher evaporative demands due to high temperature in the spring season the amount of irrigation water calculated by pan evaporation was naturally higher than the autumn season amounts of crop water use were influenced by the irrigation water level and drip tape placement depths in the experiment seasonal crop water use differed from 235mm in sdi10i20 to 374mm in sdi10i120 plots in autumn and from 270mm in sdi20i20 to 566mm in dii120 plots in spring season table 2 similarly buyukcangaz et al 2008 reported drip irrigated green bean water use varying from 47mm to 582mm in different treatments in greenhouse conditions minimum et values in our study were determined in i20 irrigation treatments in three irrigation methods in both seasons there was a significant linear relationship between the applied water amount and the et r2 0 98 in di r2 0 99 in sdi10 and r2 1 0 in sdi20 in autumn and r2 1 0 in di r2 0 99 in sdi10 and r2 0 99 in sdi20 in spring in both crop cycles et values increased with higher kcp coefficient for each drip tape placement depths however the deeper the drip tapes were placed the lower seasonal et values were obtained in other words because of the higher evaporative potential of wetted soil surface than the drier one di method had higher et values than the sdi methods which had buried drip tape and had dryer soil surface in both experimental seasons seasonal et values in the sdi treatments were found to be lower 8 13 than the di treatment in the study similarly evett et al 2005 reported that the sdi limited the soil surface wetting and could lead to an overall reduction in evapotranspiration crop water use as much as 10 different drip tape placement depths in spring growing cycle had statistically significant effect on green bean yields highest yield 5 97kgm 2 was obtained in the sdi10 irrigation methods among all irrigation methods this increase in yield may be due to the better use of fertilizer by reducing the deep percolation or volatilization losses compared to other two methods di sdi20 it might also be caused by the better water usage and better soil water air combination with higher aeration of the root zone than deeper lateral placement depth it was reported by other researchers that increasing the depth of the drip tube resulted in yield decreases in some plants and soil types for instance bryla et al 2003 found that faba bean production was higher when drip laterals were located at 0 30 or 0 45m than 0 60m depth in california similarly marouelli and silva 2002 reported that the increase in the depth of the dripper from 20cm to 40cm for tomato in central brazil resulted in a 32 yield reduction although gencoglan et al 2006 reported that irrigation amounts by kcp did not significantly affect yield in green beans in the current study different irrigation water levels based on kcp significantly affected the green bean yield in both growing cycles considering only different water application rates the highest yield 1 66kgm 2 in autumn and 6 81kgm 2 in spring was obtained in i100 treatment plots data not shown sezen et al 2008 declared that yield of field grown green bean was 2 43kgm 2 under kcp 1 level irrigation which equaled to full class a pan evaporation combined effect of experimental treatments on green bean yield was found statistically significant only in spring season p 0 001 table 2 maximum yields were obtained from i100 8 63kgm 2 and i120 8 31kgm 2 irrigation levels in 10cm drip tape placement depth sdi10 treatment therefore it is recommended to irrigate greenhouse grown green beans with sdi10 treatment using a kcp 1 coefficient of class a pan evaporation relationships among irrigation water applied i crop water use et and green bean yield y were given for each drip tape placement depth in table 3 a significant polynomial relationship was found between the yield and the irrigation water applied except for sdi10 treatment in autumn growing season irrigation water versus yield relationship showed that a reduction of 20 87mm of irrigation amount i80 compared to full irrigation i100 decreased green bean yield by 26 5 2 29kgm 2 for sdi10 treatment a similar yield response versus varying irrigation amount was reported by gencoglan et al 2006 also the yield of the i120 treatment was found to be 4 320gm 2 lower than that of the i100 plot this might be caused by the poor water usage and poor soil water air combination with lower aeration of the root zone caused by excessive irrigation water in i120 plots researchers often use the wue and the iwue values to evaluate water productivity in crop production in this study the increase of irrigation water in all three irrigation methods resulted in a decrease in iwue values the lowest iwue 4 5kgm 3 in autumn and wue 4 0kgm 3 in autumn values were determined in the di irrigation method which had the highest water application but with the highest evaporation loss due to surface wetness however the highest iwue value 27 1kgm 3 in spring was found in the lowest water application plots in the sdi methods which had relatively low evaporation loss due to embedded drip tapes the highest wue value in the study was found as 17 5kgm 3 in the sdi10i100 treatment table 2 it was observed that the sdi techniques increased both wue and iwue values in the study also it was observed that the wue and iwue values in spring season were generally higher than the values of the autumn season buyukcangaz et al 2008 declared that the wue values differed from 26 46kgm 3 to 32 44kgm 3 and iwue values ranged from 16 46kgm 3 to 26 98kgm 3 in their greenhouse grown green bean experiment green bean yield response factor ky under three irrigation methods was also determined in each season table 3 the values of ky changed from 0 74 to 1 66 under different drip tape placement depths in the experiment maximum ky values were found in di method in autumn and spring seasons as 0 96 and 1 66 respectively the values of ky factor in autumn season were lower than the values of spring season doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported that the crop growth and yield were affected by the total radiation received during the growing period and crops differed in their response to how much of the total radiation received can be converted into growth and yield and this difference has an important effect on how efficiently water can be utilized by the crop the current research results showed that the green bean yield showed less reduction based on the increased water deficit during the autumn growing period which was received insufficient total radiation compared to the spring period therefore water management is more important in spring season in which the plants are more sensitive to water deficit than the autumn growing periods on the other hand the deeper drip tape placement depths resulted in lower ky values in both seasons there were several ky values reported for the field grown green bean irrigated with traditional surface drip tape irrigation di in literature for instance doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported a ky value of 1 15 and sezen et al 2005 as 1 23 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 as 1 07 for greenhouse grown green bean in our experiment di methods gave the highest ky value as 0 96 and 1 66 for autumn and spring seasons respectively similarly gencoglan et al 2006 reported that the ky value was 1 55 for the field grown green bean irrigated with subsurface drip irrigation 3 2 crop growth responses vegetative growth responses of the green beans to the experimental treatments were also determined in the study table 4 the above ground biomass agb were affected by the drip tape placements and watering levels in both seasons highest agb value was obtained from di i80 944 3g plant 1 treatment in autumn and sdi10i120 2924g plant 1 treatment in spring season lowest agb values were found for the i20 water level treatments in all drip tape placement depths in both seasons while the agb values showed a steady increase from i20 to the i80 irrigation level a similar trend was not observed at higher water levels this was thought to be caused by a number of uncontrollable factors such as soil aeration and the possibility of water and fertilizer leakage into the deeper soil layer this case which was also evident in the leaf area index lai values was more obvious in the autumn period than in the spring treatments did not show any statistically significant effect on lai values in autumn season however in the spring season significant differences were determined among lai values highest lai value 6 53 was obtained from di i100 treatment plots as in agb values lowest values of lai were found in i20 water level treatments in all drip tape placement depths in spring season as in a good agreement with our study gonzalez et al 2009 found that the lower soil water matric potential values measured in the autumn winter green bean crop under restricted irrigation clearly lowered the biomass compared to the well watered one but they did not affect lai or yield values they also reported that the spring green bean crop under regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment created a lower final agb a lower lai and a lower total and marketable yield than the well watered crop in the present study experimental treatments did not show any statistically significant effect on leaf chlorophyll values of the green beans in both seasons table 4 however leaf chlorophyll values in spring season were higher than the values of the autumn season 3 3 pod quality responses as the green bean quality components total soluble solids brix and ph of pod juices pod dimensions pod thickness pt pod width pw and pod length pl pod weight pwg and the number of pod per plant pn were determined in the experiment tables 5 and 6 the brix values did not differ significantly according to the irrigation method in the autumn season table 5 however those values differed under different irrigation water levels in both seasons table 6 while the highest brix value 5 23 of the bean pod juice under different irrigation methods was found in the sdi10 plots in the spring season regarding the irrigation water levels the i40 irrigation level gave the highest brix value as 5 57 in the same season therefore higher water applications had negative effects on the brix value of the pod juice similar results were reported by bryla et al 2003 for faba bean irrigation methods and water level treatments had significant effects on ph value of pod juice in both seasons while the highest ph values 6 47 in autumn and 6 13 in spring were found in sdi20 treatments table 5 the i20 water level treatment resulted in the highest ph value in the autumn season on the other hand i100 treatment gave the highest ph value in the spring season table 6 generally deeper drip tape placement depths resulted in less ph value in the spring season according to the seed company specifications the variety of the green bean used in the study has 20 25cm pod length and 1 6cm pod width however kar et al 2005 found that this variety had 17 7cm pod length 1 26cm pod width and 6 96mm pod thickness under unheated glasshouse conditions in the current study the interaction effects of sdi depths and water amounts being the main factors were not statistically significant therefore only main factor effects have been discussed the pod thickness pt and pod width pw as pod dimension properties were not significantly affected by the drip lateral depths in both seasons table 5 however the irrigation water level had statistically significant effects on those pod values in both seasons table 6 highest pt values were found in i80 plot as 6 72mm in autumn and in i40 plot as 6 97mm in spring season similarly the highest pw values were found in i80 19 41mm plot in the autumn and in i40 16 93mm plot in the spring season it was observed that the irrigation methods had significant effects on pl values in both seasons the highest pl values were found in sdi20 19 76cm in the autumn and in sdi10 20 51cm in the spring season table 5 however irrigation water level did not have significant effects on pl values in the autumn season while in the spring season lowest water application i20 had lowest pl value 16 88cm and the pl values of the other water levels were in same mean group table 6 generally adequate or higher irrigation water amounts increased the quality of the green beans as reported earlier by sezen et al 2005 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 the pwg and pn values were not affected by the irrigation methods in the autumn season but significantly affected in the spring season table 5 the sdi10 irrigation method resulted in highest pwg 14 64g and pn 116 6 pod values in the spring season on the other hand irrigation water levels had statistically significant effects on pwg and pn values in both seasons except for the pn values in the autumn season the i20 irrigation water level had the lowest pwg values in both seasons 7 17g pod 1 for autumn and 9 75g pod 1 for spring and lowest pn 58 63 pod plant 1 value in the spring season table 6 the highest water application i120 had the highest pwg value 9 62g for autumn and 14 99g for spring season in the study 4 conclusion the study results showed that the pan evaporation technique was a suitable method for predicting the green bean water requirement in unheated greenhouse cultivation the watering amounts and drip tape placement depths influenced amounts of crop water use water consumption values increased with higher kcp coefficient in each drip tape placement depths however the deeper drip type placement depths caused the reduction of seasonal et values the study showed that water savings of up to 13 of seasonal irrigation water could be achieved using subsurface drip irrigation sdi method irrigation scheduling based on a kcp of 1 0 i100 is recommended for sdi10 with 0 8 being more appropriate for 20cm or deeper drip tape placement depths because of the possible deep percolation of soil water green bean yield was not affected statistically by drip line depths under unheated greenhouse conditions in the autumn season while in the spring season the yield was higher with sdi10 to sum up a general assessment of water management product yield pod qualities and growth variables revealed that sdi10i100 treatment was the most appropriate irrigation strategy for green beans growing under greenhouse conditions the results of this study could be applicable to any region where similar greenhouse conditions exist acknowledgements we are grateful to mustafa kemal

11578,subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a professional water distribution system for improved crop water use and conserving water selecting drip tape installation depths for different crops is the most critical decision with these systems hence the aim of this research was to examine the effects of different sdi depths and water amounts on the yield components and water use characteristics of green bean crop under unheated greenhouse conditions during two crop growing cycles three irrigation methods traditional drip irrigation di sdi at 10cm soil depth sdi10 and sdi at 20cm soil depth sdi20 and six irrigation water levels i based on crop pan coefficients i20 kcp 0 20 i40 kcp 0 40 i60 kcp 0 60 i80 kcp 0 80 i100 kcp 1 00 and i120 kcp 1 20 were evaluated in each growing cycle adequately watered crops i100 were accepted as control the seasonal evapotranspiration changed from 235 to 374mm in autumn and from 270 to 566mm in spring season different placement depths of drip tape had significant effects on green bean yields in spring growing cycle maximum yield 5 97kgm 2 was obtained in sdi10 irrigation method irrigation water levels also significantly p 0 001 affected green bean yield in both growing cycles the highest yield 1 66kgm 2 in autumn and 6 81kgm 2 in spring was obtained in i100 treatment sdi techniques improved water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the values of wue and iwue increased as the watering level was reduced maximum yield response factor in di method in autumn and spring seasons ky was found as 0 96 and 1 66 respectively general evaluation of the water management crop yield components and growth variables showed that the sdi10i100 treatment appears to be the most favorable irrigation practice for the green bean grown under greenhouse conditions water savings of up to 13 of seasonal irrigation water could be achieved using sdi method keywords subsurface drip irrigation deficit irrigation buried drippers water savings greenhouse green bean yield 1 introduction greenhouses are used to provide and sustain a sufficient environment for crops to obtain maximum yield in climate conditions unsuitable for plant production greenhouse crop production is widely practiced in many regions of the world including in areas with a temperate mediterranean climate since the market value of green bean phaselous vulgaris l is high compared to other vegetables it is grown extensively in greenhouses green bean is produced in the mediterranean greenhouses in two short product cycles from the early autumn to the end of spring autumn winter and spring in the region where all greenhouse crops are drip irrigated and the watering costs are relatively high the irrigation practices are still based on the growers experience and focused on maximizing yield and fruit quality regardless of the irrigation water consumption gonzalez et al 2009 world green bean production is 21 365 000t and turkey ranked fourth with the total production of 632 301t based on the data of 2013 fao 2013 irrigation management is very important in green bean production because the application method and the application program of irrigation water are crucial at all stages of crop growing from sowing or transplanting to harvesting for this reason sufficient water should be supplied to the crop in order to ensure high quality and the highest productivity in addition it is a necessity to provide water to the plants grown in the greenhouses by irrigation since the plants have a high water requirement and there is no other water inputs such as rainfall despite decreasing water resources increasing agricultural water needs require more careful management of available water resources the drip irrigation method will continue to be important in the future with its water saving benefits and contribution to the environmental sustainability it provides many unique agronomic water and energy conservation benefits that address many challenges seen in the irrigated agriculture patel and rajput 2007 moreover the trend in recent years has been towards changing the traditional surface drip irrigation di to subsurface drip irrigation sdi sdi systems can apply irrigation water needed by the plants directly to the root zone at low doses and short intervals to keep ideal moisture conditions in the soil they have significant advantages compared to the conventional drip irrigation systems such as minimizing evaporation from the soil and preventing surface runoff consequently sdi is the most efficient water distribution system to increase water use efficiency wue and save water on the other hand selecting drip tape installation depths for different crops is the most critical decision in this irrigation method it was reported that increasing the depth of the drip tube resulted in yield decreases in some plants and soil types for instance marouelli and silva 2002 reported that the increase in the depth of the dripper from 20cm to 40cm in tomato production in central brazil resulted in a 32 yield reduction another issue to be considered in the planning of irrigation is scheduling irrigation scheduling is very important in the use of drip systems as applying too much or insufficient water cause plant stress and crop yield reduction evaporation pans can be successfully used to plan irrigation using appropriate pan kp and plant kc coefficients sezen et al 2006 this technique can efficiently be used in irrigation programming by combining the two specific coefficients kcp different studies were carried out in this direction in the literature for example sezen et al 2005 examined the effect of irrigation frequency and crop pan coefficients in an open field and obtained a highest green bean yield of 20 558kgha 1 with a pan coefficient of 1 0 as is known from previous studies the most critical decision for the sdi applications is the drip tape placement depth depending on irrigation program and crop type experiments should be conducted in both open fields and greenhouses because the conditions of these areas are different however the studies are inadequate in the literature on the application of sdi in the cultivation of green beans in greenhouses in light of all these facts the aims of this study were 1 to find out the effect of irrigation water amounts on yield and quality of green bean grown in greenhouse 2 to determine the optimal placement depth of drip tape and 3 to find out the relationship between water use properties such as crop water consumption water use efficiency wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and yield response factor of green bean in the mediterranean coastal area of turkey 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site conditions a greenhouse research was carried out during two short crop cycles autumn 2009 and spring 2010 in the research and training farm of mustafa kemal university located in hatay province turkey latitude 36 08 n longitude 35 54 e altitude 10m experimental greenhouse with a 0 2mm thick thermal polyethylene cover had a size of 54m length 36m width the greenhouse was not heated and side panels and roof vents were used for passive ventilation the experimental site had typical mediterranean climate conditions according to the data of the turkish state meteorological service tsms long term 1975 2009 annual mean maximum and minimum daily temperatures in the region were 19 0 22 9 and 15 7 c respectively the mean relative humidity and annual total rainfall were 75 3 and 902 9mm respectively climatic data of the experimental greenhouse for the two growing seasons are given in table 1 mean temperatures changed from 15 2 c to 27 0 c in the autumn growing cycle and from 23 2 c to 29 9 c in the spring growing cycle table 1 for soil texture analysis with hydrometer method samples were collected at intervals of 30cm from the surface to a depth of 90cm the soil was deep clay loam comprising 43 0 sand 20 3 silt and 36 7 clay the bulk density of the soil was 1 49gcm 3 and available water holding capacity was determined as 223mm in a 90cm soil depth the fertilizers with a total of 75kgnha 1 100kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100kgk2oha 1 were applied equally to all parcels based on soil analysis results since the flowering and harvesting periods of green beans are simultaneous and last about four to five weeks the nitrogen application was divided into two parts to meet the requirements of the new pod formations the fertilizers as pure matter were applied at transplanting at a rate of 30kgnha 1 100kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100kgk2oha 1 while the remaining part of the n ammonium nitrate 33 n was applied at the beginning of the flowering and at the middle of the harvesting periods equally by the fertigation system 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was a split plot with three replications each block contained three main plots with three drip tape placement depth as irrigation methods traditional drip irrigation di subsurface drip irrigation at 10cm depth sdi10 and 20cm depth sdi20 in soil profile and six subplots irrigated at different irrigation water i levels based on crop pan coefficients i20 kcp 0 20 i40 kcp 0 40 i60 kcp 0 60 i80 kcp 0 80 i100 kcp 1 00 and i120 kcp 1 20 in general the green beans are grown both from the seeds and from the seedlings in greenhouses in turkey it is a common application to transplant seedlings in small greenhouses as the bigger ones use seeds instead of transplanting in the current study bean seeds were germinated in peat material in viols and transferred to the greenhouse after two true leaves emerged the green bean seedlings of cv alman ayşe were transplanted on 14 october 2009 in the first experimental crop cycle and on 02 march 2010 in the second experimental crop cycle even if tuarira and moses 2014 suggested narrower in row planting distances 0 10 0 20m in green bean seed production in zimbabwe it is widely accepted to plant this crop in wider in row spacing in greenhouse production due to fungal diseases caused by the high humidity and low ventilation problem in the local greenhouses therefore the experimental plants were transplanted to a wider distance of 0 30m 0 50m on the subplots as suggested by onder et al 2006 the subplots designed as 1 00m apart from each other had double crop rows with 0 5m width and 12 0m length fig 1 traditional greenhouse green bean production techniques were carried out for the other agronomic practices 2 3 experimental setup and methodology the irrigation water obtained from a well had a c2s1 quality classification ussl 1954 with a ph of 7 9 and an average electrical conductivity of 0 72dsm 1 for each plant line a drip irrigation lateral having in line drippers with a spacing of 20cm and having a 2lh 1 discharge rate was used drip tapes in the subsurface drip irrigation treatment were buried manually to 10cm and 20cm soil depths irrigation system had a central control unit combined with a by pass fertigation system water applications were controlled by using manual valves and monitored using water meters soil matric potential was monitored daily by using manual tensiometers irrometer barcelona spain irrigation scheduling was carried out based on soil water status of full irrigation dii100 plot watering was initiated when the reading of the tensiometer placed at a depth of 30cm in the soil approached to about 30kpa the irrigation water amount i was calculated with the following equation 1 i aepankcp where kcp is the crop pan coefficient epan is the total amount of class a pan evaporation between two consecutive irrigation events mm and a is the irrigation area m2 daily evaporation in the class a pan was routinely measured with a digital micrometer at 9 am to minimize the effect of soil water differences in different plots on the establishment of plantlets in both crop cycles the soil water was balanced to the field capacity at 30cm profile depth at the transplantation of plants in all treatment plots seasonal measured evapotranspiration et mm was estimated using soil water balance according to jovanovic and annandale 1999 using following equation 2 et p i r dr δq the components of the soil water balance are rainfall p irrigation i runoff r and drainage dr δq represents soil water storage all terms are expressed in mm since the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse there was no precipitation p because of the use of drip irrigation system the runoff r was assumed to be zero before each irrigation throughout the season the water content of the soil was determined by gravimetric method in increments of 30cm from the surface up to 90cm depth mass soil moisture contents were converted to equivalent depths using bulk density and layer depth if available water in the root zone 0 60cm and total applied water amount by irrigation were above the field capacity it was assumed that the water amount above field capacity leaked into the deeper soil zones and this was called deep percolation or drainage dp or dr available total water amount at 0 60cm soil depth before irrigation applied irrigation water field capacity ertek et al 2006 2 4 measurements and determinations green bean pods were hand harvested 11 times in autumn and 14 times in spring period between the 40th day and the 90th day after the transplanting in both production periods in the 6m sections of the two adjacent rows in each plot the harvest area in each plot was 3m2 yield parameters such as pod yield kgm 2 mean pod mass g pod 1 and pod number per plant were determined in each factorial plot the pod quality properties such as pod width pw thickness pt and length pl were determined by a digital micrometer for 20 green beans randomly selected from the harvested beans in each subplot the sampled beans were milled to remove water and the total soluble solid content brix and ph were determined in the juice of the bean pods with a refractometer n o w co model 507 i tokyo japan and a ph meter respectively leaf area index lai m2 m 2 leaf chlorophyll content and above ground biomass agb g plant 1 of the crop were also determined at the last harvest time in each subplot leaf chlorophyll content was determined as descripted by nageswara rao et al 2001 using spad chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta corp ramsey nj usa on four plants per plot and three leaves per plant total of 12 leaves and the average value was calculated placom electronic planimeter model kp90n koizumi mfg co ltd niigata japan was used for leaf area measurements of the plants that have been removed for biomass measurements the total leaf area of a plant was multiplied by the number of plants in the area of a 1m2 to obtain the lai value in order to quantify the effect of the water stress on yield reduction it is necessary to drive the relationship between relative yield decrease and relative evapotranspiration deficit given by the empirically derived yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 the yield response factor ky was determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 using the stewart model 3 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya is the actual green bean yield tha 1 ym is the maximum green bean yield tha 1 eta is the actual crop water consumption mm and etm is the maximum crop water consumption mm in addition to these in order to evaluate the productivity of the irrigation water total water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue values were determined as follows wue was calculated as the ratio between green bean yield kgha 1 and seasonal evapotranspiration mm while iwue was calculated as the ratio between green bean yield kgha 1 and total irrigation water applied mm 2 5 statistical analysis a randomized split plot design with three replications was used with lateral placement depths as main plots and irrigation water levels as subplots in the experiment mstat c statistical software version 2 1 was used for statistical analysis duncan s multiple range test was used at a probability of 0 05 to compare the mean values determined in the experiment since the yield data between the seasons were not homogeneous as shown by the homogeneity tests seasons were analyzed separately 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water use characteristics and yield the use of pan evaporation technique for estimating the crop water requirement is a highly simple method that can be easily practiced by farmers because it does not require complex data there have been various studies made in this direction for green bean with different irrigation water applications in the literature for example gencoglan et al 2006 sezen et al 2008 and camoglu and genc 2013 studied irrigation for field grown green bean in these studies irrigation water levels varied approximately from 260 to 680mm depending on kcp coefficients additionally onder et al 2006 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 studied the same crop under greenhouse conditions table 2 shows the water use characteristics such as i et wue iwue and yield values of green bean plants obtained in the current study i and et values were calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively same irrigation water amounts were applied to the three drip tape placement depths as irrigation method treatments in the study however seasonal irrigation water applied with time intervals changing from 3 to 10days differed from 55 to 328mm based on the kcp coefficients in each lateral depth in the autumn crop cycle on the other hand in the spring crop cycle seasonal irrigation water applied with intervals changing from 3 to 6days varied from 87 to 524mm table 2 because of the higher evaporative demands due to high temperature in the spring season the amount of irrigation water calculated by pan evaporation was naturally higher than the autumn season amounts of crop water use were influenced by the irrigation water level and drip tape placement depths in the experiment seasonal crop water use differed from 235mm in sdi10i20 to 374mm in sdi10i120 plots in autumn and from 270mm in sdi20i20 to 566mm in dii120 plots in spring season table 2 similarly buyukcangaz et al 2008 reported drip irrigated green bean water use varying from 47mm to 582mm in different treatments in greenhouse conditions minimum et values in our study were determined in i20 irrigation treatments in three irrigation methods in both seasons there was a significant linear relationship between the applied water amount and the et r2 0 98 in di r2 0 99 in sdi10 and r2 1 0 in sdi20 in autumn and r2 1 0 in di r2 0 99 in sdi10 and r2 0 99 in sdi20 in spring in both crop cycles et values increased with higher kcp coefficient for each drip tape placement depths however the deeper the drip tapes were placed the lower seasonal et values were obtained in other words because of the higher evaporative potential of wetted soil surface than the drier one di method had higher et values than the sdi methods which had buried drip tape and had dryer soil surface in both experimental seasons seasonal et values in the sdi treatments were found to be lower 8 13 than the di treatment in the study similarly evett et al 2005 reported that the sdi limited the soil surface wetting and could lead to an overall reduction in evapotranspiration crop water use as much as 10 different drip tape placement depths in spring growing cycle had statistically significant effect on green bean yields highest yield 5 97kgm 2 was obtained in the sdi10 irrigation methods among all irrigation methods this increase in yield may be due to the better use of fertilizer by reducing the deep percolation or volatilization losses compared to other two methods di sdi20 it might also be caused by the better water usage and better soil water air combination with higher aeration of the root zone than deeper lateral placement depth it was reported by other researchers that increasing the depth of the drip tube resulted in yield decreases in some plants and soil types for instance bryla et al 2003 found that faba bean production was higher when drip laterals were located at 0 30 or 0 45m than 0 60m depth in california similarly marouelli and silva 2002 reported that the increase in the depth of the dripper from 20cm to 40cm for tomato in central brazil resulted in a 32 yield reduction although gencoglan et al 2006 reported that irrigation amounts by kcp did not significantly affect yield in green beans in the current study different irrigation water levels based on kcp significantly affected the green bean yield in both growing cycles considering only different water application rates the highest yield 1 66kgm 2 in autumn and 6 81kgm 2 in spring was obtained in i100 treatment plots data not shown sezen et al 2008 declared that yield of field grown green bean was 2 43kgm 2 under kcp 1 level irrigation which equaled to full class a pan evaporation combined effect of experimental treatments on green bean yield was found statistically significant only in spring season p 0 001 table 2 maximum yields were obtained from i100 8 63kgm 2 and i120 8 31kgm 2 irrigation levels in 10cm drip tape placement depth sdi10 treatment therefore it is recommended to irrigate greenhouse grown green beans with sdi10 treatment using a kcp 1 coefficient of class a pan evaporation relationships among irrigation water applied i crop water use et and green bean yield y were given for each drip tape placement depth in table 3 a significant polynomial relationship was found between the yield and the irrigation water applied except for sdi10 treatment in autumn growing season irrigation water versus yield relationship showed that a reduction of 20 87mm of irrigation amount i80 compared to full irrigation i100 decreased green bean yield by 26 5 2 29kgm 2 for sdi10 treatment a similar yield response versus varying irrigation amount was reported by gencoglan et al 2006 also the yield of the i120 treatment was found to be 4 320gm 2 lower than that of the i100 plot this might be caused by the poor water usage and poor soil water air combination with lower aeration of the root zone caused by excessive irrigation water in i120 plots researchers often use the wue and the iwue values to evaluate water productivity in crop production in this study the increase of irrigation water in all three irrigation methods resulted in a decrease in iwue values the lowest iwue 4 5kgm 3 in autumn and wue 4 0kgm 3 in autumn values were determined in the di irrigation method which had the highest water application but with the highest evaporation loss due to surface wetness however the highest iwue value 27 1kgm 3 in spring was found in the lowest water application plots in the sdi methods which had relatively low evaporation loss due to embedded drip tapes the highest wue value in the study was found as 17 5kgm 3 in the sdi10i100 treatment table 2 it was observed that the sdi techniques increased both wue and iwue values in the study also it was observed that the wue and iwue values in spring season were generally higher than the values of the autumn season buyukcangaz et al 2008 declared that the wue values differed from 26 46kgm 3 to 32 44kgm 3 and iwue values ranged from 16 46kgm 3 to 26 98kgm 3 in their greenhouse grown green bean experiment green bean yield response factor ky under three irrigation methods was also determined in each season table 3 the values of ky changed from 0 74 to 1 66 under different drip tape placement depths in the experiment maximum ky values were found in di method in autumn and spring seasons as 0 96 and 1 66 respectively the values of ky factor in autumn season were lower than the values of spring season doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported that the crop growth and yield were affected by the total radiation received during the growing period and crops differed in their response to how much of the total radiation received can be converted into growth and yield and this difference has an important effect on how efficiently water can be utilized by the crop the current research results showed that the green bean yield showed less reduction based on the increased water deficit during the autumn growing period which was received insufficient total radiation compared to the spring period therefore water management is more important in spring season in which the plants are more sensitive to water deficit than the autumn growing periods on the other hand the deeper drip tape placement depths resulted in lower ky values in both seasons there were several ky values reported for the field grown green bean irrigated with traditional surface drip tape irrigation di in literature for instance doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported a ky value of 1 15 and sezen et al 2005 as 1 23 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 as 1 07 for greenhouse grown green bean in our experiment di methods gave the highest ky value as 0 96 and 1 66 for autumn and spring seasons respectively similarly gencoglan et al 2006 reported that the ky value was 1 55 for the field grown green bean irrigated with subsurface drip irrigation 3 2 crop growth responses vegetative growth responses of the green beans to the experimental treatments were also determined in the study table 4 the above ground biomass agb were affected by the drip tape placements and watering levels in both seasons highest agb value was obtained from di i80 944 3g plant 1 treatment in autumn and sdi10i120 2924g plant 1 treatment in spring season lowest agb values were found for the i20 water level treatments in all drip tape placement depths in both seasons while the agb values showed a steady increase from i20 to the i80 irrigation level a similar trend was not observed at higher water levels this was thought to be caused by a number of uncontrollable factors such as soil aeration and the possibility of water and fertilizer leakage into the deeper soil layer this case which was also evident in the leaf area index lai values was more obvious in the autumn period than in the spring treatments did not show any statistically significant effect on lai values in autumn season however in the spring season significant differences were determined among lai values highest lai value 6 53 was obtained from di i100 treatment plots as in agb values lowest values of lai were found in i20 water level treatments in all drip tape placement depths in spring season as in a good agreement with our study gonzalez et al 2009 found that the lower soil water matric potential values measured in the autumn winter green bean crop under restricted irrigation clearly lowered the biomass compared to the well watered one but they did not affect lai or yield values they also reported that the spring green bean crop under regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment created a lower final agb a lower lai and a lower total and marketable yield than the well watered crop in the present study experimental treatments did not show any statistically significant effect on leaf chlorophyll values of the green beans in both seasons table 4 however leaf chlorophyll values in spring season were higher than the values of the autumn season 3 3 pod quality responses as the green bean quality components total soluble solids brix and ph of pod juices pod dimensions pod thickness pt pod width pw and pod length pl pod weight pwg and the number of pod per plant pn were determined in the experiment tables 5 and 6 the brix values did not differ significantly according to the irrigation method in the autumn season table 5 however those values differed under different irrigation water levels in both seasons table 6 while the highest brix value 5 23 of the bean pod juice under different irrigation methods was found in the sdi10 plots in the spring season regarding the irrigation water levels the i40 irrigation level gave the highest brix value as 5 57 in the same season therefore higher water applications had negative effects on the brix value of the pod juice similar results were reported by bryla et al 2003 for faba bean irrigation methods and water level treatments had significant effects on ph value of pod juice in both seasons while the highest ph values 6 47 in autumn and 6 13 in spring were found in sdi20 treatments table 5 the i20 water level treatment resulted in the highest ph value in the autumn season on the other hand i100 treatment gave the highest ph value in the spring season table 6 generally deeper drip tape placement depths resulted in less ph value in the spring season according to the seed company specifications the variety of the green bean used in the study has 20 25cm pod length and 1 6cm pod width however kar et al 2005 found that this variety had 17 7cm pod length 1 26cm pod width and 6 96mm pod thickness under unheated glasshouse conditions in the current study the interaction effects of sdi depths and water amounts being the main factors were not statistically significant therefore only main factor effects have been discussed the pod thickness pt and pod width pw as pod dimension properties were not significantly affected by the drip lateral depths in both seasons table 5 however the irrigation water level had statistically significant effects on those pod values in both seasons table 6 highest pt values were found in i80 plot as 6 72mm in autumn and in i40 plot as 6 97mm in spring season similarly the highest pw values were found in i80 19 41mm plot in the autumn and in i40 16 93mm plot in the spring season it was observed that the irrigation methods had significant effects on pl values in both seasons the highest pl values were found in sdi20 19 76cm in the autumn and in sdi10 20 51cm in the spring season table 5 however irrigation water level did not have significant effects on pl values in the autumn season while in the spring season lowest water application i20 had lowest pl value 16 88cm and the pl values of the other water levels were in same mean group table 6 generally adequate or higher irrigation water amounts increased the quality of the green beans as reported earlier by sezen et al 2005 and buyukcangaz et al 2008 the pwg and pn values were not affected by the irrigation methods in the autumn season but significantly affected in the spring season table 5 the sdi10 irrigation method resulted in highest pwg 14 64g and pn 116 6 pod values in the spring season on the other hand irrigation water levels had statistically significant effects on pwg and pn values in both seasons except for the pn values in the autumn season the i20 irrigation water level had the lowest pwg values in both seasons 7 17g pod 1 for autumn and 9 75g pod 1 for spring and lowest pn 58 63 pod plant 1 value in the spring season table 6 the highest water application i120 had the highest pwg value 9 62g for autumn and 14 99g for spring season in the study 4 conclusion the study results showed that the pan evaporation technique was a suitable method for predicting the green bean water requirement in unheated greenhouse cultivation the watering amounts and drip tape placement depths influenced amounts of crop water use water consumption values increased with higher kcp coefficient in each drip tape placement depths however the deeper drip type placement depths caused the reduction of seasonal et values the study showed that water savings of up to 13 of seasonal irrigation water could be achieved using subsurface drip irrigation sdi method irrigation scheduling based on a kcp of 1 0 i100 is recommended for sdi10 with 0 8 being more appropriate for 20cm or deeper drip tape placement depths because of the possible deep percolation of soil water green bean yield was not affected statistically by drip line depths under unheated greenhouse conditions in the autumn season while in the spring season the yield was higher with sdi10 to sum up a general assessment of water management product yield pod qualities and growth variables revealed that sdi10i100 treatment was the most appropriate irrigation strategy for green beans growing under greenhouse conditions the results of this study could be applicable to any region where similar greenhouse conditions exist acknowledgements we are grateful to mustafa kemal

11579,studying the effects of rainfall and irrigation water on spatiotemporal variability of root water uptake are critical for understanding water utilization processes by plants and their importance in hydrological ecosystem functions in this study the spatiotemporal patterns of δ 18o in soil water in the soil profile and proportion of root water uptake from different soil depths and irrigation water under three irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 i e 70 85 and 100 of design irrigation quota were analyzed during the growth period by detecting the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ 18o of soil water xylem sap rainfall and irrigation water local groundwater in a cherry orchard under drip irrigation during 2015 2016 results showed that mean δ 18o value of soil water in the profile was strongly linked with seasonal variation of soil water content and was positively correlated with irrigation quota rainfall and irrigation promoted significant cherry root access to soil water at shallower depths with the growth of cherries came changes in the proportion of water sources initially root water uptake was mainly from the middle soil layer 20 50cm then topsoil 0 20cm and finally the deep soil layer 50 100cm the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake decreased from the postharvest stage and the effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake also declined greatly therefore based on comprehensive consideration of the patterns of cherry water uptake and rainfall characteristics during the cherry growth period in beijing the optimal water regulation treatment was 100 of design irrigation quota before the end of fruit growth stage 85 at the postharvest stage and 70 during the end of the growth period keywords stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope cherry water uptake precipitation irrigation different growth period 1 introduction plant roots are available to absorb moisture from all potential water sources such as soil water irrigation water rainfall and groundwater shi et al 2003 sun et al 2005 there is a significant difference in the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes between rainfall soil water at different depths and groundwater due to physical processes such as evaporation infiltration and slow mineral chemical reactions allison 1982 dawson 1993 except for some coastal halophyte plants and multiple species under greenhouse conditions there is no hydrogen or oxygen isotope fractionation during plant root water uptake and sap transfer within the xylem tissue bertrand et al 2014 dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 zhao et al 2016 zimmermann et al 1967 the water absorbed by plant roots can be considered the mixture of water from all probable water sources and therefore we can obtain quantitatively the relative contribution of each water source to plant growth through comparing the relationship of the isotopic signatures between xylem water and other water sources flanagan and ehleringer 1991 williams and ehleringer 2000 this method provided a theoretical basis for the application of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope methods in evaluating plant water use with the growth of plants and changes in hydrometeorological situations root water uptake is influenced by several factors such as site characteristics williams and ehleringer 2000 tree species flanagan et al 1992 xu et al 2011 plant age and size dawson and ehleringer 1991 meinzer et al 1999 season variation dawson and pate 1996 meinzer et al 1999 nie et al 2011 life history stage feild and dawson 1998 wang et al 2010 availability and reliability of water e g the amount of recent precipitation and irrigation the proximity of groundwater the distance to river and soil moisture content root system distribution and maximum root depth bertrand et al 2014 chimner and cooper 2004 thorburn and walker 1994 xu et al 2011 zencich et al 2002 which make root water uptake complex in soil compared with traditional methods root excavations and measurements of soil moisture the stable isotopic technique is a more valuable tool with a relatively higher accuracy in assessing water uptake patterns and root function dawson and pate 1996 du et al 2011 ehleringer and dawson 1992 shi et al 2003 thorburn and ehleringer 1995 further it is also more protective for the root system living environment and suitable for long term research wang et al 2010 in recent years there has been a trend to study mechanisms of plant root water uptake with the stable isotopic technique previous studies revealed that root systems of plants mainly absorbed deep soil water or groundwater in dry periods however the utilization of shallow soil water derived from rainfall would increase with increase of summer rainfall dawson and pate 1996 deng et al 2013 schwinning et al 2002 west et al 2007 proposed that p edulis was more dependent on rainfall than j osteosperma and j osteosperma began to use rain water only when the rainfall was at a certain threshold furthermore the majority of these early related research efforts were on forests and grass in arid semi arid or coastal areas to clarify the influence of rainfall underground water and rivers on plant root water uptake cramer et al 1999 dawson and ehleringer 1991 flanagan et al 1992 zhang et al 1999 reported that lucerne prefers to absorb rainfall and irrigation water near the surface rather than soil water eggemeyer et al 2009 pointed out two c4 grasses extracted most of their water from the upper soil profile 0 05 0 5m soil water uptake from below 0 5m depth slightly increased during drought but appeared to be minimal in relation to total water use in contrast to grasses trees exhibited significant plasticity in sources of water uptake with the growing season and soil moisture conditions eggemeyer et al 2009 yang et al 2015 bertrand et al 2014 found that wild cherry poplar and willow showed different adaptability to reliability of groundwater river water and soil water and had a varied main water source in different water distribution regions the contrasting and flexible shifting water use strategies are advantageous for growth of roots which can improve water use efficiency by plants and plant survival rate dawson and pate 1996 this approach also helps some species face potential water stress caused by climate change and promote species co existence bertrand et al 2014 xu et al 2011 in addition several studies have also analyzed water uptake patterns for crops wu et al 2016 found that the distribution of stable oxygen isotope varied significantly between the ridge and furrow under rainfall and alternate furrow irrigation conditions and the contributions of sources to maize root water uptake were significantly different yano et al 2006 pointed out the stable hydrogen isotope composition in rainfed lowland rice fields fluctuated due to influence of rainfall and there were significant differences between above and below the hardpan with the rice absorbing more water below the hardpan in the dry season wang et al 2010 found that the main depth of root water uptake decreased first from the surface and then increased to the surface during the growth period of maize but it decreased continuously from the surface to the deep layer for cotton because competition for water resources increased due to the development of industry and other uses in recent decades the proportion of agricultural water use relative to total water consumption was reduced by 52 4 from 2007 35 75 to 2015 17 01 in beijing bulletin 2007 2015 this change of water use structure is similar with other cities in china and other countries jayakumar et al 2015 overall it is important to study how irrigation affects water uptake of plant roots and the water use efficiency for agricultural water conservation practices the majority of previous studies occurred on forests grass and field grown plants to clarify the influence of different water sources on root water uptake however there is little research carried out on fruit trees to assess how different water sources especially irrigation water affects root water uptake patterns and corresponding water utilization efficiency furthermore the alternative multiple source mass balance isotopic approach is more quantitative and objective to estimate the probable contribution of each water source from multiple sources to total plant water uptake asbjornsen et al 2007 which provides a theoretical basis in guiding precise management of water for orchards cherry is one of the most important economic fruit trees and its roots are mainly distributed in the 0 60cm soil layer li 2010 yang et al 2009 prunus avium is an early maturing and high quality variety with the largest cultivated area in china the soluble solids content in its nutritious fruit is up to 17 but the amount of irrigation water has significant effects on its growth yield and quality li et al 2016 therefore in this study from 2015 to 2016 the spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake from various water sources by prunus avium cherry were assessed quantitatively under different irrigation treatments during the growth period the aim of this study is to identify an optimal irrigation regime with the highest contribution of rainfall and irrigation water to total plant root water uptake for orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were conducted at xi feng yue water saving irrigation demonstration orchard 39 43 n 116 41 e altitude 23 73m located in tongzhou district in beijing in 2015 and 2016 the area has a typical semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by cool dry winters and hot wet summers it is rich in sunlight with a mean annual sunshine duration of 2562 2744h and annual average temperature of 11 5 c the average annual precipitation is 565mm the mean annual evaporation is 1140mm and the ground water table is about 25 75m below the ground surface the experimental period was from april to september because cherry growth is from april to june and the rainy season is from june to september where precipitation accounts for more than 75 of annual precipitation the physical parameters of soil in this area are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this study was carried out in a cherry prunus avium orchard where the trees were 5 years old and the plant density was 625 trees ha drip irrigation driplines were put in two rows along each side at a distance of 0 7m from a tree belt and the soil surface was covered with black gardening cloth which prevented the growth of grass the space between emitters was 30cm and the water flow was 2l h each irrigation occurred before and after fertilization and the amount of water used to dissolve and transport the fertilizer was taken into account during the process of drip fertigation fertilizer supply orchard pruning pest control and other management measures were consistent with local management in this experiment there were 3 treatments for the amount of irrigation water t1 t2 and t3 that were 70 85 and 100 of design irrigation quota respectively each treatment plot had 3 rows of cherry trees as replicates of the experiment the irrigation quota was calculated as follows zeng et al 2009 1 m 0 001zγθwp β 1 β 2 where z was the soil wetting depth which was recommended to be 70cm for 5 year old cherry trees it was assumed according to field results in similar orchards li 2010 yang et al 2009 γ was the mean bulk density of 1 41g cm3 θw was the mean field water holding capacity θfc of 26 57 p was the designed percentage of soil wetted area of 25 β1 was the upper threshold of soil moisture 0 95 β 2 was the lower threshold of soil moisture 0 60 η was the efficiency irrigation which recommended to be 0 9 for drip irrigation from the equation the irrigation quota was about 24 67mm the irrigation schedules for 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 2 where irrigation calendars were set according to soil water content measured daily by the time domain reflectrometry trime pico iph germany and gravimetric method across all treatments as well as considering comprehensively precipitation events and weather change the soil water content 20 40cm was always kept larger than 60 θfc and corresponding soil volumetric water content is 22 71 this method was also used by cui et al 2008 and wu et al 2016 the rainfall events and soil water content 20 40cm under t1 are shown in fig 1 and the precipitation was 380mm and 398mm during the experimental period from april to september in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements the sampling water included precipitation irrigation water local groundwater soil water at various depths and stem xylem sap which were collected from flowering stage to end of growth period each year 2 3 1 stem xylem sap about 3days after each irrigation when rainfall had not occurred for at least 3days cut stem sections with a length of 3 5cm from branches that appeared fully suberized without green photosynthetic tissue or bark to avoid possible isotope fractionation caused by plant transpiration they were then put into glass vials and each vial was sealed with parafilm and refrigerated immediately to prevent evaporation bertrand et al 2014 stem xylem sap was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system and put into a 5ml polyethylene air tight vial wang et al 2010 in order to ensure that the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap was not affected by light temperature and other external conditions each sampling time was 8 00 in the morning 2 3 2 soil water one day prior to each irrigation and with no rainfall for at least 3days three positions close to the drippers were chosen to take soil samples from each layer 0 20cm 20 40cm 40 60cm and 60 100cm using a soil auger the sampling time was also 8 00 in the morning the soil samples were stored and water samples were extracted using the same method as plant samples at the same time soil water content of soil layers 0 10cm 10 20cm 20 40cm 40 60cm 60 80cm and 80 100cm at the same position was measured by gravimetric method and soil volumetric water content was calculated according to the soil bulk density of the corresponding layer 2 3 3 other samples and data precipitation above 5mm and all irrigation water samples were gathered into polyethylene 20ml air tight vials during rain event or irrigation at different growth stages meteorological data including precipitation and temperature were monitored every 15min by an automatic weather station in the field 2 3 4 sample measurements all water samples were sealed with parafilm and refrigerated immediately at temperatures about 20 c before analysis the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions δ of the water samples were analyzed using liquid water isotope analyzer isoprime 100 isoprime ltd uk and quick chem 8500 lachat usa the ta ea method at the environmental stable isotope laboratory chinese academy of agricultural sciences the results were calculated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows 2 δ 18o orδd rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsimple is the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of sample water and rstandard is the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of the standard water the analytical precision was 0 1 2sd and 1 2sd for δ 18o and δd respectively 2 4 data analysis method two methods were used to analyze root water uptake of cherry in this study the first one was the direct reference method to compare directly the values of δ 18o and δd between the stem xylem sap and the soil water in each interval wang et al 2010 because there is no fractionation effect of stable hydrogen and oxygen during the process of root uptake and in the plant stem if the isotope values of stem xylem sap are equal to soil water in one layer this suggests that the root uptake water mainly occurred from this depth interval white et al 1985 zimmermann et al 1967 the second method was to use an isosource model based on multi source mass balance phillips and gregg 2003 for the soil and plant stem xylem sap sampled at the same stage the proportions of each water source to total water uptake can be calculated as follows 3 δx f1δx1 f 2 δx2 f 3 δx3 f 4 δx4 4 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 are the contributions of each water source to cherry root water uptake δx1 δx2 δx3 δx4 are the isotopic compositions of each water source included soil water samples in each interval 0 20cm 20 50cm and 50 100cm and irrigation water in this study δx is isotopic signatures of stem xylem sap considered as a mixture of these possible water sources similar analysis methods have been well documented by wu et al 2016 and wang et al 2010 all possible combinations of each source contribution 0 100 are examined in small increments an isotopic mass balance is performed at each increment to determine if the result fits well with the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap combinations that sum to the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap within a small tolerance are considered to be feasible combinations lastly the distribution of all such combinations is described and a range of feasible solutions rather than a discrete solution to contributions of water sources can be obtained the tolerance in this method was set at 0 01 the uncertainty levels at 0 2 and the increment at 1 spass statistics and excel 2007 were also used for data analysis and figures 3 results 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values of different water samples fig 2 shows the line fitting between δd and δ 18o of water samples under different treatment conditions from april to september in 2015 and 2016 the isotopic hydrogen and oxygen abundance of water samples were significantly and positively correlated with r2 up to 0 96 for cherry stem xylem sap δd 7 78δ 18o 9 68 which was close to other water source samples the linear fit between the isotopic composition in local precipitation was δd 7 50δ 18o 4 20 its slope and intercept were less than the globe meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ 18o 10 but it can be accepted because the relationship between δd and δ 18o can be easily affected by local regional climatic and geographic parameters such as latitude longitude and altitude precipitation amount temperature relative humidity and sources of water vapor liu et al 2008 wen et al 2010 moreover previous results in the beijing area δd 7 8δ 18o 6 2 li et al 2015 gansu province δd 7 2δ 18o 9 8 wu et al 2016 and shanxi province δd 7 45δ 18o 1 74 wang et al 2010 were similar to this finding it proved that there was good uniformity between the values of δd and δ 18o in the local rainfall irrigation water local groundwater stem xylem sap and soil water in different depth intervals due to similar fractionation of isotopes in the local water circle furthermore the fractionation of oxygen isotope was more robust and precision of measurement was more accurate because the difference of relative mass between d and h was higher than that between 16o and 18o and kinetic fractionation affects the vapor liquid phase interactions more for δ 18o than for δd brunel et al 1995 wen et al 2010 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2015 thus the distribution pattern of soil water at different depths was analyzed with the oxygen isotope data anova was used to analyze the variances of stable isotopic signatures of irrigation water there was no significant difference p 0 05 for the whole growth period so this paper selected the average of δd 8 80 and δ 18o 63 47 to estimate the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake fig 2 also shows that the values of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for local rainfall and irrigation water local groundwater were larger than those of soil water and stem xylem sap the δ 18o of soil water and stem xylem sap under different treatment conditions ranged from 17 46 to 9 05 and from 17 02 to 12 71 respectively this indicated that there were strong differences in isotopic signatures of soil water that originated from antecedent rainfall and irrigation due to water infiltration and evaporation the stable isotopic signatures of cherry stem xylem sap were generally between the stable isotopic values of soil water and irrigation water so cherry stem xylem sap can be considered as the mixture of soil water and irrigation water after water uptake it provided a theoretical basis to calculate the proportion of water sources to cherry root water uptake in this paper 3 2 oxygen isotopic profile of soil water after rainfall the infiltration of soil water will change the water distribution in the soil profile as well as the isotopic composition of soil water at the different depth intervals allison and hughes 1983 bertrand et al 2014 most rainfall in the tongzhou district in beijing occurs between june and september it is obvious that the effective rainfall was more abundant and mean soil water content was higher after june 10th fig 1 with the rainfall after june 10th accounting for about 83 and 90 of the total rainfall during the experimental period in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 3 thus the time of the study was divided into before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season to analyze the characteristics of the oxygen isotopic profile of soil water and cherry root water uptake fig 4 a and b describes δ 18o average for soil water in the profile and cherry stem water under different treatments before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season respectively δ 18o average of soil water between 0 and 30cm in the dry season were 13 72 13 60 and 13 34 for 70 85 and 100 irrigation treatment respectively in the wet season they increased to 13 58 13 31 and 12 94 in the topsoil accordingly the increments of δ 18o values in the 30 50cm soil layer were less and there was nearly no change in the 50 100cm soil layer p 0 05 fig 5 a and b describes the mean volumetric water content profile under different treatments before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season respectively it can be seen that the average of surface soil water content increased from 22 77 to 25 37 and there was a smaller change in the 30 100cm soil layer thus from a temporal point of view the change trend of δ 18o of soil water was in agreement with seasonal variation of soil water content at different depths fig 4 a and b shows the similarity in the vertical distribution change of δ 18o in the soil profile under different irrigation treatments between dry and rainy season the δ 18o was enriched in topsoil water and it decreased rapidly with increased depth in the 0 30cm soil layer however it decreased slowly and tended to remain stable in the 50 100cm soil layer at the same time the volumetric water content was least in the topsoil and it increased with increase of soil depth particularly it had the smallest trend of increase in the 20 40cm layer fig 5 thus from the view of soil depth there was an opposite change between the δ 18o average and soil water content in the soil profile it can be seen from fig 4 that the δ 18o value of soil water in each layer had a significant positive correlation with irrigation quota the δ 18o value of soil water was always higher with the increased quota which was most obvious in the 0 30cm soil layer in the rainy season 3 3 the main depth of cherry root water uptake from fig 4 a the δ 18o of soil water was similar to that of cherry stem xylem sap when it was at a depth of 42cm under t1 70 irrigation treatment 33cm under t2 85 irrigation treatment and 28cm under t3 100 irrigation treatment in the dry season from fig 4 b it was 33cm 28cm and 27cm under t1 t2 and t3 in the rainy season respectively it can be confirmed through the first direct inference method that possible main depth of root water uptake of cherry was around 42cm 33cm and 28cm under t1 t2 and t3 in the dry season which shifted to 33cm 28cm and 27cm in the rainy season respectively note that this change was most obvious for t1 followed by t2 and finally t3 combining figs 4 and 5 the corresponding mean volumetric soil water content of the main soil layer of root water uptake under t1 t2 and t3 are 26 4 26 2 and 27 2 respectively in the dry season they are 26 5 27 7 and 28 1 in the rainy season respectively it can be concluded that soil water between 27 and 42cm was the probable dominant source of cherry root water uptake and more precipitation and higher irrigation quota had a significant effect on decreasing the primary depth of root water uptake of cherry 3 4 the contribution of varied water source to cherry water uptake at different growth stages although the possible primary depth of root water uptake can be inferred initially based on the interception of δ 18o in soil water and stem xylem water from fig 4 the contribution of irrigation water to root uptake can t be obtained by the direct inference method frequency histographs figs 6 8 produced from the isosource model delineated quantitatively the range of the potential fractional contribution of water from each soil depth or irrigation water to total plant water uptake from fruit growth stage to the end of plant growth period and then provided an estimate of the effect of irrigation amount on root water uptake patterns however due to the extremely short cherry flowering stage and unexpected precipitation that occurred just 2 and 3days after irrigation in 2015 and 2016 stem xylem sap in the flowering stage can not be used in the model and the results at flowering stage will not be discussed the results of the isosource model based on the multiple source mass balance method will not be accurate if there are too many water sources in eq 3 thus the depth of 0 100cm was divided into 0 20 20 50 and 50 100cm to represent shallow middle and deep depths respectively the δ 18o difference of soil water between 0 and 20cm and below 20cm was obvious in both the dry and rainy seasons and it was not significant for the soil water at 50 100cm p 0 05 as shown in fig 6 cherry root water uptake from different soil depth intervals and irrigation was varied under the three irrigation treatments at the fruit growth stage under the 70 irrigation treatment t1 root water uptake was mainly from soil water at the 20 50cm layer accounting for 69 86 crest value was 84 of the total root water uptake and irrigation water accounted for 11 16 crest value was 14 similarly under the 85 irrigation treatment t2 soil water at the 20 50cm layer accounted for 39 76 crest value was 59 of the total root water uptake and irrigation water accounted for 14 27 crest value was 25 under the 100 irrigation treatment t3 soil water at the 20 50cm layer and irrigation water accounted for 47 76 crest value was 52 and 25 32 crest value was 29 of the total root water uptake respectively thus the contribution sum of soil water at the 20 50cm layer and irrigation water under t1 t2 and t3 reached crest values of 98 84 and 81 this suggested that cherry root uptake was mainly from the middle soil water depth 20 50cm and irrigation water at the fruit growth stage the contribution proportions of irrigation water and soil water in the 0 20cm layer increased with improved irrigation level whereas the contribution proportion of soil water for 20 50cm decreased this reflected that irrigation quota improved irrigation water utilization and promoted cherry root access to more water in the topsoil fig 7 shows proportions of water from each water source to cherry root water uptake at the postharvest stage under t1 the histogram patterns converged at the 0 20cm and 50 100cm layers and corresponding contributions were 37 68 crest value was 43 and 17 56 crest value was 40 respectively under t2 it showed bimodal water uptake at depths of 0 20cm and 20 50cm with the proportion crest values of 22 and 46 respectively under t3 the soil water for the 0 20cm layer had the highest contribution to the cherry root water uptake and the crest value was up to 69 under t1 t2 and t3 irrigation water only accounted for about 5 7 and 11 of the total root water uptake the results showed that main water sources were soil water at 0 20cm and 50 100cm layer for t1 0 50cm and 0 20cm for t2 and t3 respectively compared with the fruit growth stage surface soil water accounted for more cherry root water uptake at the postharvest stage at the same time the contribution of irrigation water decreased but it was still positively linked with irrigation quota as shown in fig 8 cherry root absorbed a large part of water from the soil water from the 50 100cm layer after august and the contribution was 78 89 62 92 and 25 62 corresponding crest value was 81 77 and 53 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively however the contributions of irrigation water to cherry root water uptake were all less than 7 in addition 23 of total cherry root water uptake was from topsoil for t3 higher than other treatments this showed that the deep soil water was the dominant source for cherry root water use and the effect of irrigation on root water uptake declined for the late growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of rainfall and irrigation quota on 18o distribution pattern at the soil profile from figs 4 and 5 the δ 18o average of soil water at the 0 30cm layer increased significantly under all irrigation treatments in the rainy season but there was no considerable change in deeper soil intervals this change in soil isotopic profile was consistent with the simultaneous seasonal variation of soil water content indicating that δ 18o average of soil water in the topsoil had good response to rainfall the heavy oxygen isotope was enriched in the soil surface and it decreased rapidly with the increase of soil depth in the 0 30cm soil layer then it gradually decreased and tended to be stable in the 50 100cm soil layer this trend of isotopic distribution is similar to results of meinzer et al 1999 and yang et al 2015 although there is slight deviation on the slope and the value of decline it is because the experiments were conducted at different experimental sites where soil isotopic profile can be affected by water sources infiltration rates plant water uptake rates and the process of hydraulic redistribution asbjornsen et al 2007 from fig 4 the δ 18o average of soil water in each layer had significant positive correlation with irrigation quota it increased with increased irrigation amount especially in the 0 30cm layer there are 3 comprehensive reasons that contributed to the patterns observed above 1 the upper soil water is always first recharged by antecedent rainfall or recent irrigation water because water infiltration is a relatively backward process bertrand et al 2014 and the δ 18o value of rainfall and irrigation water are higher than soil water resulting in 18o being more enriched in topsoil this was more obvious under the higher irrigation treatment or in rainy season because the enrichment effects of fresh water decreased with the increase of soil depth yang et al 2015 the soil isotopic profile method may be a good reference to study water movement and hydraulic redistribution 2 transpiration enrichment processes affected the isotopic signatures in the soil profile allison and hughes 1983 the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were more enriched in topsoil also because the heavy isotopes in liquid water were more difficult to evaporate than light isotopes and the enrichment degree of d and 18o decreased with the increase of soil depth 3 transpiration enrichment processes can be affected by local temperature bertrand et al 2014 the daily temperature increased greatly since april up to the highest value in mid july and then gradually declined because of higher temperature and more rainfall during june and september see fig 3 there was more evaporation from the upper soil in the rainy season than in the dry season which may cause a larger increment of 18o in upper soil intervals after rainfall and the isotope composition difference in topsoil is larger between different irrigation treatments in the rainy season 4 2 cherry water uptake from different water sources at different growth stages the direct inference approach indicated both more rainfall and higher irrigation quota decreased the possible main depth of cherry root water uptake because cherry root is shallow and sensitive to the water distribution and oxygen condition the physiological activities of cherry root will be affected when soil moisture content is changed so rainfall and irrigation may play an important role in the variation of main water uptake depth it can be seen from figs 4 and 5 mean soil water content between 0 and 30cm increased greatly after june 10th soil water content in the profile was higher under higher irrigation treatment except for soil surface that is to say more water was held per unit of soil at the original soil depth which may increase possible root water extraction rate and water uptake amount feddes et al 1976 feddes et al 2001 based on the cherry root investigations of yang et al 2009 and li 2010 and field experiments for mature apple trees of sokalska et al 2009 the roots of 5 year old cherry trees are mainly distributed in the 0 60cm soil layer and the root main parameters such as root length volume surface area and dry weight increase first and then decline with increase of depth at the profile and are highest between the vertical 20 40cm therefore percentage of shallower soil water acquisition to total cherry root water uptake increased when its soil water content became higher this tendency is consistent with the model results of guswa 2010 in wetter climates deep roots are not needed as water regularly available near the surface may be sufficient to meet plant demand although this direct inference method indicated the possible primary root water uptake depth was 27 42cm it ignored dynamic variation of root water uptake under changing meteorological condition along with plant growth and the possibility that stem water is a mixture of soil water from different layers in other words the water in the crops may not be absorbed from a single depth during the growth period and also may be mixed by water from several sources which has different values of isotopes in a fixed proportion wang et al 2010 the results of the isosource model showed the contribution of irrigation water and soil water to root water uptake was different at each growth stage cherry trees mainly used soil water at the 20 50cm depth and irrigation water at the fruit growth stage while the proportion of irrigation water and the soil water at 0 20cm in total water uptake was larger the soil water contribution to total water uptake in the 20 50cm soil layer was less with the increase of irrigation quota fig 6 it is probably because cherry has the greatest water requirement before postharvest stage water is critical to ensure the best reproduction and biomass accumulation at the beginning of the growth although irrigation water had less contribution than soil water to total roots water uptake it was still a significant source of root water uptake and beneficial for the activity of roots in the upper soil thus cherry trees tended to absorb more irrigation water and upper soil water because they are both more available for root water uptake under the higher irrigation treatment at the postharvest stage the average proportion of topsoil water to root water uptake increased to 45 however irrigation water accounted for less than 11 under the three irrigation treatments the reason why utilization of irrigation water declined is likely that sufficient rainfall in the rainy season improved the water content of surface soil and water uptake ability of lateral roots in the upper soil was largely activated after rainfall and irrigation so topsoil water originating from rainfall nearly met cherry growth requirements and the soil water replaced the contribution of irrigation water after the harvest period it was the final period of cherry growth in august and september and cherry required less water for slow growth when the temperature cooled and rainfall decreased the root main parameters such as root area index or physiological activity of shallow root may reduce while the deep root system was still increasing wang et al 2010 the root water uptake was mainly from the 50 100cm soil layer and irrigation water accounted for less than 7 of root water uptake from fig 7 and 8 the proportion of deep soil water 50 100cm to the root water uptake under t1 was greater than that under t2 it is also largely supported by the results obtained from fig 4 that possible main depth of root water uptake under t1 was deeper than t2 a similar relationship occurred between t2 and t3 sokalska et al 2009 also had similar findings in the drip irrigation experiment that found for the irrigated side of the trees the main concentration of roots was close to the soil surface in the wetted area and larger numbers of roots penetrated deeper soil layers on the side of the tree trunk opposite to the emitter thus decreasing irrigation amount may help root development more deeply williams and ehleringer 2000 in this study there was a trend of root water uptake from soil water between the growth periods of cherry initially it was mainly from the middle soil layer then topsoil and finally deep soil layer the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake decreased with the growth of cherry moreover it revealed that the contribution of irrigation water was positively correlated with irrigation quota at fruit growth stage but this effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake declined greatly and it seemed non influential at the end of plant growth stage during the growth period cherry roots can exhibit adaptation to water unreliability and growth strategy which could be advantageous to plant growth and reproduction under increasing water stress due to water conservation techniques or local climate changes bertrand et al 2014 ehleringer and dawson 1992 the contribution of potential water sources to root water uptake can reflect the temporal availability of irrigation water and rainfall by cherry under different external conditions based on results above using the variable irrigation quota at different growth stages is critical to save irrigation water this study has documented the effects of irrigation and rainfall on cherry root water uptake under drip irrigation however further field investigations and comparison with macroscopic approaches are needed to study how physical properties of the soil and characteristics of root systems affect root water uptake it can provide insight to understand the mechanisms of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac water circle and potential root zone adaptations to climate change and optimize irrigation regimes for shallow rooted species 5 conclusions through analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of soil isotopic profiles and root water uptake of cherry in different growth periods under three irrigation treatments in a cherry orchard the following conclusions can be reached 1 the mean value of soil water δ 18o in the soil profile responded to rainfall and irrigation quota and it had similar seasonal variation with soil water content in the profile and was positively correlated with irrigation quota 2 both rainfall and irrigation promoted cherry roots to access soil water at shallower depths 3 cherry water uptake from different soil depths and irrigation varied greatly in different growth stages there was a change in depth of root water uptake from soil water it was mainly from the 20 50cm soil layer at the fruit growth stage then it was from the soil water at depths of 0 20cm and 50 100cm for 70 irrigation treatment t1 0 50cm for 85 irrigation treatment t2 and 0 20cm for 100 irrigation treatment t3 finally it was mainly from the 50 100cm soil layer during the end of the growth period the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake gradually declined below 11 from the postharvest stage and the effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake also declined greatly therefore considering the characteristics of cherry water uptake and rainfall during the whole growth period in beijing variable irrigation is the key to improve the contribution of irrigation water to total plant water uptake and minimize useless agricultural water in these orchards the optimal water regulation treatment is to supply sufficient irrigation water i e 100 of irrigation quota before the end of the fruit growth stage middle irrigation i e 85 of irrigation quota at the postharvest stage and low irrigation i e 70 of irrigation quota at the end of the growth period acknowledgement this research was supported by

11579,studying the effects of rainfall and irrigation water on spatiotemporal variability of root water uptake are critical for understanding water utilization processes by plants and their importance in hydrological ecosystem functions in this study the spatiotemporal patterns of δ 18o in soil water in the soil profile and proportion of root water uptake from different soil depths and irrigation water under three irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 i e 70 85 and 100 of design irrigation quota were analyzed during the growth period by detecting the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ 18o of soil water xylem sap rainfall and irrigation water local groundwater in a cherry orchard under drip irrigation during 2015 2016 results showed that mean δ 18o value of soil water in the profile was strongly linked with seasonal variation of soil water content and was positively correlated with irrigation quota rainfall and irrigation promoted significant cherry root access to soil water at shallower depths with the growth of cherries came changes in the proportion of water sources initially root water uptake was mainly from the middle soil layer 20 50cm then topsoil 0 20cm and finally the deep soil layer 50 100cm the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake decreased from the postharvest stage and the effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake also declined greatly therefore based on comprehensive consideration of the patterns of cherry water uptake and rainfall characteristics during the cherry growth period in beijing the optimal water regulation treatment was 100 of design irrigation quota before the end of fruit growth stage 85 at the postharvest stage and 70 during the end of the growth period keywords stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope cherry water uptake precipitation irrigation different growth period 1 introduction plant roots are available to absorb moisture from all potential water sources such as soil water irrigation water rainfall and groundwater shi et al 2003 sun et al 2005 there is a significant difference in the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes between rainfall soil water at different depths and groundwater due to physical processes such as evaporation infiltration and slow mineral chemical reactions allison 1982 dawson 1993 except for some coastal halophyte plants and multiple species under greenhouse conditions there is no hydrogen or oxygen isotope fractionation during plant root water uptake and sap transfer within the xylem tissue bertrand et al 2014 dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 zhao et al 2016 zimmermann et al 1967 the water absorbed by plant roots can be considered the mixture of water from all probable water sources and therefore we can obtain quantitatively the relative contribution of each water source to plant growth through comparing the relationship of the isotopic signatures between xylem water and other water sources flanagan and ehleringer 1991 williams and ehleringer 2000 this method provided a theoretical basis for the application of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope methods in evaluating plant water use with the growth of plants and changes in hydrometeorological situations root water uptake is influenced by several factors such as site characteristics williams and ehleringer 2000 tree species flanagan et al 1992 xu et al 2011 plant age and size dawson and ehleringer 1991 meinzer et al 1999 season variation dawson and pate 1996 meinzer et al 1999 nie et al 2011 life history stage feild and dawson 1998 wang et al 2010 availability and reliability of water e g the amount of recent precipitation and irrigation the proximity of groundwater the distance to river and soil moisture content root system distribution and maximum root depth bertrand et al 2014 chimner and cooper 2004 thorburn and walker 1994 xu et al 2011 zencich et al 2002 which make root water uptake complex in soil compared with traditional methods root excavations and measurements of soil moisture the stable isotopic technique is a more valuable tool with a relatively higher accuracy in assessing water uptake patterns and root function dawson and pate 1996 du et al 2011 ehleringer and dawson 1992 shi et al 2003 thorburn and ehleringer 1995 further it is also more protective for the root system living environment and suitable for long term research wang et al 2010 in recent years there has been a trend to study mechanisms of plant root water uptake with the stable isotopic technique previous studies revealed that root systems of plants mainly absorbed deep soil water or groundwater in dry periods however the utilization of shallow soil water derived from rainfall would increase with increase of summer rainfall dawson and pate 1996 deng et al 2013 schwinning et al 2002 west et al 2007 proposed that p edulis was more dependent on rainfall than j osteosperma and j osteosperma began to use rain water only when the rainfall was at a certain threshold furthermore the majority of these early related research efforts were on forests and grass in arid semi arid or coastal areas to clarify the influence of rainfall underground water and rivers on plant root water uptake cramer et al 1999 dawson and ehleringer 1991 flanagan et al 1992 zhang et al 1999 reported that lucerne prefers to absorb rainfall and irrigation water near the surface rather than soil water eggemeyer et al 2009 pointed out two c4 grasses extracted most of their water from the upper soil profile 0 05 0 5m soil water uptake from below 0 5m depth slightly increased during drought but appeared to be minimal in relation to total water use in contrast to grasses trees exhibited significant plasticity in sources of water uptake with the growing season and soil moisture conditions eggemeyer et al 2009 yang et al 2015 bertrand et al 2014 found that wild cherry poplar and willow showed different adaptability to reliability of groundwater river water and soil water and had a varied main water source in different water distribution regions the contrasting and flexible shifting water use strategies are advantageous for growth of roots which can improve water use efficiency by plants and plant survival rate dawson and pate 1996 this approach also helps some species face potential water stress caused by climate change and promote species co existence bertrand et al 2014 xu et al 2011 in addition several studies have also analyzed water uptake patterns for crops wu et al 2016 found that the distribution of stable oxygen isotope varied significantly between the ridge and furrow under rainfall and alternate furrow irrigation conditions and the contributions of sources to maize root water uptake were significantly different yano et al 2006 pointed out the stable hydrogen isotope composition in rainfed lowland rice fields fluctuated due to influence of rainfall and there were significant differences between above and below the hardpan with the rice absorbing more water below the hardpan in the dry season wang et al 2010 found that the main depth of root water uptake decreased first from the surface and then increased to the surface during the growth period of maize but it decreased continuously from the surface to the deep layer for cotton because competition for water resources increased due to the development of industry and other uses in recent decades the proportion of agricultural water use relative to total water consumption was reduced by 52 4 from 2007 35 75 to 2015 17 01 in beijing bulletin 2007 2015 this change of water use structure is similar with other cities in china and other countries jayakumar et al 2015 overall it is important to study how irrigation affects water uptake of plant roots and the water use efficiency for agricultural water conservation practices the majority of previous studies occurred on forests grass and field grown plants to clarify the influence of different water sources on root water uptake however there is little research carried out on fruit trees to assess how different water sources especially irrigation water affects root water uptake patterns and corresponding water utilization efficiency furthermore the alternative multiple source mass balance isotopic approach is more quantitative and objective to estimate the probable contribution of each water source from multiple sources to total plant water uptake asbjornsen et al 2007 which provides a theoretical basis in guiding precise management of water for orchards cherry is one of the most important economic fruit trees and its roots are mainly distributed in the 0 60cm soil layer li 2010 yang et al 2009 prunus avium is an early maturing and high quality variety with the largest cultivated area in china the soluble solids content in its nutritious fruit is up to 17 but the amount of irrigation water has significant effects on its growth yield and quality li et al 2016 therefore in this study from 2015 to 2016 the spatiotemporal patterns of water uptake from various water sources by prunus avium cherry were assessed quantitatively under different irrigation treatments during the growth period the aim of this study is to identify an optimal irrigation regime with the highest contribution of rainfall and irrigation water to total plant root water uptake for orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were conducted at xi feng yue water saving irrigation demonstration orchard 39 43 n 116 41 e altitude 23 73m located in tongzhou district in beijing in 2015 and 2016 the area has a typical semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate characterized by cool dry winters and hot wet summers it is rich in sunlight with a mean annual sunshine duration of 2562 2744h and annual average temperature of 11 5 c the average annual precipitation is 565mm the mean annual evaporation is 1140mm and the ground water table is about 25 75m below the ground surface the experimental period was from april to september because cherry growth is from april to june and the rainy season is from june to september where precipitation accounts for more than 75 of annual precipitation the physical parameters of soil in this area are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this study was carried out in a cherry prunus avium orchard where the trees were 5 years old and the plant density was 625 trees ha drip irrigation driplines were put in two rows along each side at a distance of 0 7m from a tree belt and the soil surface was covered with black gardening cloth which prevented the growth of grass the space between emitters was 30cm and the water flow was 2l h each irrigation occurred before and after fertilization and the amount of water used to dissolve and transport the fertilizer was taken into account during the process of drip fertigation fertilizer supply orchard pruning pest control and other management measures were consistent with local management in this experiment there were 3 treatments for the amount of irrigation water t1 t2 and t3 that were 70 85 and 100 of design irrigation quota respectively each treatment plot had 3 rows of cherry trees as replicates of the experiment the irrigation quota was calculated as follows zeng et al 2009 1 m 0 001zγθwp β 1 β 2 where z was the soil wetting depth which was recommended to be 70cm for 5 year old cherry trees it was assumed according to field results in similar orchards li 2010 yang et al 2009 γ was the mean bulk density of 1 41g cm3 θw was the mean field water holding capacity θfc of 26 57 p was the designed percentage of soil wetted area of 25 β1 was the upper threshold of soil moisture 0 95 β 2 was the lower threshold of soil moisture 0 60 η was the efficiency irrigation which recommended to be 0 9 for drip irrigation from the equation the irrigation quota was about 24 67mm the irrigation schedules for 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 2 where irrigation calendars were set according to soil water content measured daily by the time domain reflectrometry trime pico iph germany and gravimetric method across all treatments as well as considering comprehensively precipitation events and weather change the soil water content 20 40cm was always kept larger than 60 θfc and corresponding soil volumetric water content is 22 71 this method was also used by cui et al 2008 and wu et al 2016 the rainfall events and soil water content 20 40cm under t1 are shown in fig 1 and the precipitation was 380mm and 398mm during the experimental period from april to september in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements the sampling water included precipitation irrigation water local groundwater soil water at various depths and stem xylem sap which were collected from flowering stage to end of growth period each year 2 3 1 stem xylem sap about 3days after each irrigation when rainfall had not occurred for at least 3days cut stem sections with a length of 3 5cm from branches that appeared fully suberized without green photosynthetic tissue or bark to avoid possible isotope fractionation caused by plant transpiration they were then put into glass vials and each vial was sealed with parafilm and refrigerated immediately to prevent evaporation bertrand et al 2014 stem xylem sap was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system and put into a 5ml polyethylene air tight vial wang et al 2010 in order to ensure that the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap was not affected by light temperature and other external conditions each sampling time was 8 00 in the morning 2 3 2 soil water one day prior to each irrigation and with no rainfall for at least 3days three positions close to the drippers were chosen to take soil samples from each layer 0 20cm 20 40cm 40 60cm and 60 100cm using a soil auger the sampling time was also 8 00 in the morning the soil samples were stored and water samples were extracted using the same method as plant samples at the same time soil water content of soil layers 0 10cm 10 20cm 20 40cm 40 60cm 60 80cm and 80 100cm at the same position was measured by gravimetric method and soil volumetric water content was calculated according to the soil bulk density of the corresponding layer 2 3 3 other samples and data precipitation above 5mm and all irrigation water samples were gathered into polyethylene 20ml air tight vials during rain event or irrigation at different growth stages meteorological data including precipitation and temperature were monitored every 15min by an automatic weather station in the field 2 3 4 sample measurements all water samples were sealed with parafilm and refrigerated immediately at temperatures about 20 c before analysis the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions δ of the water samples were analyzed using liquid water isotope analyzer isoprime 100 isoprime ltd uk and quick chem 8500 lachat usa the ta ea method at the environmental stable isotope laboratory chinese academy of agricultural sciences the results were calculated relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows 2 δ 18o orδd rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsimple is the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of sample water and rstandard is the 18o 16o or d h molar ratios of the standard water the analytical precision was 0 1 2sd and 1 2sd for δ 18o and δd respectively 2 4 data analysis method two methods were used to analyze root water uptake of cherry in this study the first one was the direct reference method to compare directly the values of δ 18o and δd between the stem xylem sap and the soil water in each interval wang et al 2010 because there is no fractionation effect of stable hydrogen and oxygen during the process of root uptake and in the plant stem if the isotope values of stem xylem sap are equal to soil water in one layer this suggests that the root uptake water mainly occurred from this depth interval white et al 1985 zimmermann et al 1967 the second method was to use an isosource model based on multi source mass balance phillips and gregg 2003 for the soil and plant stem xylem sap sampled at the same stage the proportions of each water source to total water uptake can be calculated as follows 3 δx f1δx1 f 2 δx2 f 3 δx3 f 4 δx4 4 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 are the contributions of each water source to cherry root water uptake δx1 δx2 δx3 δx4 are the isotopic compositions of each water source included soil water samples in each interval 0 20cm 20 50cm and 50 100cm and irrigation water in this study δx is isotopic signatures of stem xylem sap considered as a mixture of these possible water sources similar analysis methods have been well documented by wu et al 2016 and wang et al 2010 all possible combinations of each source contribution 0 100 are examined in small increments an isotopic mass balance is performed at each increment to determine if the result fits well with the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap combinations that sum to the isotopic composition of stem xylem sap within a small tolerance are considered to be feasible combinations lastly the distribution of all such combinations is described and a range of feasible solutions rather than a discrete solution to contributions of water sources can be obtained the tolerance in this method was set at 0 01 the uncertainty levels at 0 2 and the increment at 1 spass statistics and excel 2007 were also used for data analysis and figures 3 results 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values of different water samples fig 2 shows the line fitting between δd and δ 18o of water samples under different treatment conditions from april to september in 2015 and 2016 the isotopic hydrogen and oxygen abundance of water samples were significantly and positively correlated with r2 up to 0 96 for cherry stem xylem sap δd 7 78δ 18o 9 68 which was close to other water source samples the linear fit between the isotopic composition in local precipitation was δd 7 50δ 18o 4 20 its slope and intercept were less than the globe meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ 18o 10 but it can be accepted because the relationship between δd and δ 18o can be easily affected by local regional climatic and geographic parameters such as latitude longitude and altitude precipitation amount temperature relative humidity and sources of water vapor liu et al 2008 wen et al 2010 moreover previous results in the beijing area δd 7 8δ 18o 6 2 li et al 2015 gansu province δd 7 2δ 18o 9 8 wu et al 2016 and shanxi province δd 7 45δ 18o 1 74 wang et al 2010 were similar to this finding it proved that there was good uniformity between the values of δd and δ 18o in the local rainfall irrigation water local groundwater stem xylem sap and soil water in different depth intervals due to similar fractionation of isotopes in the local water circle furthermore the fractionation of oxygen isotope was more robust and precision of measurement was more accurate because the difference of relative mass between d and h was higher than that between 16o and 18o and kinetic fractionation affects the vapor liquid phase interactions more for δ 18o than for δd brunel et al 1995 wen et al 2010 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2015 thus the distribution pattern of soil water at different depths was analyzed with the oxygen isotope data anova was used to analyze the variances of stable isotopic signatures of irrigation water there was no significant difference p 0 05 for the whole growth period so this paper selected the average of δd 8 80 and δ 18o 63 47 to estimate the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake fig 2 also shows that the values of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for local rainfall and irrigation water local groundwater were larger than those of soil water and stem xylem sap the δ 18o of soil water and stem xylem sap under different treatment conditions ranged from 17 46 to 9 05 and from 17 02 to 12 71 respectively this indicated that there were strong differences in isotopic signatures of soil water that originated from antecedent rainfall and irrigation due to water infiltration and evaporation the stable isotopic signatures of cherry stem xylem sap were generally between the stable isotopic values of soil water and irrigation water so cherry stem xylem sap can be considered as the mixture of soil water and irrigation water after water uptake it provided a theoretical basis to calculate the proportion of water sources to cherry root water uptake in this paper 3 2 oxygen isotopic profile of soil water after rainfall the infiltration of soil water will change the water distribution in the soil profile as well as the isotopic composition of soil water at the different depth intervals allison and hughes 1983 bertrand et al 2014 most rainfall in the tongzhou district in beijing occurs between june and september it is obvious that the effective rainfall was more abundant and mean soil water content was higher after june 10th fig 1 with the rainfall after june 10th accounting for about 83 and 90 of the total rainfall during the experimental period in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 3 thus the time of the study was divided into before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season to analyze the characteristics of the oxygen isotopic profile of soil water and cherry root water uptake fig 4 a and b describes δ 18o average for soil water in the profile and cherry stem water under different treatments before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season respectively δ 18o average of soil water between 0 and 30cm in the dry season were 13 72 13 60 and 13 34 for 70 85 and 100 irrigation treatment respectively in the wet season they increased to 13 58 13 31 and 12 94 in the topsoil accordingly the increments of δ 18o values in the 30 50cm soil layer were less and there was nearly no change in the 50 100cm soil layer p 0 05 fig 5 a and b describes the mean volumetric water content profile under different treatments before june 10th dry season and after june 10th rainy season respectively it can be seen that the average of surface soil water content increased from 22 77 to 25 37 and there was a smaller change in the 30 100cm soil layer thus from a temporal point of view the change trend of δ 18o of soil water was in agreement with seasonal variation of soil water content at different depths fig 4 a and b shows the similarity in the vertical distribution change of δ 18o in the soil profile under different irrigation treatments between dry and rainy season the δ 18o was enriched in topsoil water and it decreased rapidly with increased depth in the 0 30cm soil layer however it decreased slowly and tended to remain stable in the 50 100cm soil layer at the same time the volumetric water content was least in the topsoil and it increased with increase of soil depth particularly it had the smallest trend of increase in the 20 40cm layer fig 5 thus from the view of soil depth there was an opposite change between the δ 18o average and soil water content in the soil profile it can be seen from fig 4 that the δ 18o value of soil water in each layer had a significant positive correlation with irrigation quota the δ 18o value of soil water was always higher with the increased quota which was most obvious in the 0 30cm soil layer in the rainy season 3 3 the main depth of cherry root water uptake from fig 4 a the δ 18o of soil water was similar to that of cherry stem xylem sap when it was at a depth of 42cm under t1 70 irrigation treatment 33cm under t2 85 irrigation treatment and 28cm under t3 100 irrigation treatment in the dry season from fig 4 b it was 33cm 28cm and 27cm under t1 t2 and t3 in the rainy season respectively it can be confirmed through the first direct inference method that possible main depth of root water uptake of cherry was around 42cm 33cm and 28cm under t1 t2 and t3 in the dry season which shifted to 33cm 28cm and 27cm in the rainy season respectively note that this change was most obvious for t1 followed by t2 and finally t3 combining figs 4 and 5 the corresponding mean volumetric soil water content of the main soil layer of root water uptake under t1 t2 and t3 are 26 4 26 2 and 27 2 respectively in the dry season they are 26 5 27 7 and 28 1 in the rainy season respectively it can be concluded that soil water between 27 and 42cm was the probable dominant source of cherry root water uptake and more precipitation and higher irrigation quota had a significant effect on decreasing the primary depth of root water uptake of cherry 3 4 the contribution of varied water source to cherry water uptake at different growth stages although the possible primary depth of root water uptake can be inferred initially based on the interception of δ 18o in soil water and stem xylem water from fig 4 the contribution of irrigation water to root uptake can t be obtained by the direct inference method frequency histographs figs 6 8 produced from the isosource model delineated quantitatively the range of the potential fractional contribution of water from each soil depth or irrigation water to total plant water uptake from fruit growth stage to the end of plant growth period and then provided an estimate of the effect of irrigation amount on root water uptake patterns however due to the extremely short cherry flowering stage and unexpected precipitation that occurred just 2 and 3days after irrigation in 2015 and 2016 stem xylem sap in the flowering stage can not be used in the model and the results at flowering stage will not be discussed the results of the isosource model based on the multiple source mass balance method will not be accurate if there are too many water sources in eq 3 thus the depth of 0 100cm was divided into 0 20 20 50 and 50 100cm to represent shallow middle and deep depths respectively the δ 18o difference of soil water between 0 and 20cm and below 20cm was obvious in both the dry and rainy seasons and it was not significant for the soil water at 50 100cm p 0 05 as shown in fig 6 cherry root water uptake from different soil depth intervals and irrigation was varied under the three irrigation treatments at the fruit growth stage under the 70 irrigation treatment t1 root water uptake was mainly from soil water at the 20 50cm layer accounting for 69 86 crest value was 84 of the total root water uptake and irrigation water accounted for 11 16 crest value was 14 similarly under the 85 irrigation treatment t2 soil water at the 20 50cm layer accounted for 39 76 crest value was 59 of the total root water uptake and irrigation water accounted for 14 27 crest value was 25 under the 100 irrigation treatment t3 soil water at the 20 50cm layer and irrigation water accounted for 47 76 crest value was 52 and 25 32 crest value was 29 of the total root water uptake respectively thus the contribution sum of soil water at the 20 50cm layer and irrigation water under t1 t2 and t3 reached crest values of 98 84 and 81 this suggested that cherry root uptake was mainly from the middle soil water depth 20 50cm and irrigation water at the fruit growth stage the contribution proportions of irrigation water and soil water in the 0 20cm layer increased with improved irrigation level whereas the contribution proportion of soil water for 20 50cm decreased this reflected that irrigation quota improved irrigation water utilization and promoted cherry root access to more water in the topsoil fig 7 shows proportions of water from each water source to cherry root water uptake at the postharvest stage under t1 the histogram patterns converged at the 0 20cm and 50 100cm layers and corresponding contributions were 37 68 crest value was 43 and 17 56 crest value was 40 respectively under t2 it showed bimodal water uptake at depths of 0 20cm and 20 50cm with the proportion crest values of 22 and 46 respectively under t3 the soil water for the 0 20cm layer had the highest contribution to the cherry root water uptake and the crest value was up to 69 under t1 t2 and t3 irrigation water only accounted for about 5 7 and 11 of the total root water uptake the results showed that main water sources were soil water at 0 20cm and 50 100cm layer for t1 0 50cm and 0 20cm for t2 and t3 respectively compared with the fruit growth stage surface soil water accounted for more cherry root water uptake at the postharvest stage at the same time the contribution of irrigation water decreased but it was still positively linked with irrigation quota as shown in fig 8 cherry root absorbed a large part of water from the soil water from the 50 100cm layer after august and the contribution was 78 89 62 92 and 25 62 corresponding crest value was 81 77 and 53 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively however the contributions of irrigation water to cherry root water uptake were all less than 7 in addition 23 of total cherry root water uptake was from topsoil for t3 higher than other treatments this showed that the deep soil water was the dominant source for cherry root water use and the effect of irrigation on root water uptake declined for the late growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of rainfall and irrigation quota on 18o distribution pattern at the soil profile from figs 4 and 5 the δ 18o average of soil water at the 0 30cm layer increased significantly under all irrigation treatments in the rainy season but there was no considerable change in deeper soil intervals this change in soil isotopic profile was consistent with the simultaneous seasonal variation of soil water content indicating that δ 18o average of soil water in the topsoil had good response to rainfall the heavy oxygen isotope was enriched in the soil surface and it decreased rapidly with the increase of soil depth in the 0 30cm soil layer then it gradually decreased and tended to be stable in the 50 100cm soil layer this trend of isotopic distribution is similar to results of meinzer et al 1999 and yang et al 2015 although there is slight deviation on the slope and the value of decline it is because the experiments were conducted at different experimental sites where soil isotopic profile can be affected by water sources infiltration rates plant water uptake rates and the process of hydraulic redistribution asbjornsen et al 2007 from fig 4 the δ 18o average of soil water in each layer had significant positive correlation with irrigation quota it increased with increased irrigation amount especially in the 0 30cm layer there are 3 comprehensive reasons that contributed to the patterns observed above 1 the upper soil water is always first recharged by antecedent rainfall or recent irrigation water because water infiltration is a relatively backward process bertrand et al 2014 and the δ 18o value of rainfall and irrigation water are higher than soil water resulting in 18o being more enriched in topsoil this was more obvious under the higher irrigation treatment or in rainy season because the enrichment effects of fresh water decreased with the increase of soil depth yang et al 2015 the soil isotopic profile method may be a good reference to study water movement and hydraulic redistribution 2 transpiration enrichment processes affected the isotopic signatures in the soil profile allison and hughes 1983 the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were more enriched in topsoil also because the heavy isotopes in liquid water were more difficult to evaporate than light isotopes and the enrichment degree of d and 18o decreased with the increase of soil depth 3 transpiration enrichment processes can be affected by local temperature bertrand et al 2014 the daily temperature increased greatly since april up to the highest value in mid july and then gradually declined because of higher temperature and more rainfall during june and september see fig 3 there was more evaporation from the upper soil in the rainy season than in the dry season which may cause a larger increment of 18o in upper soil intervals after rainfall and the isotope composition difference in topsoil is larger between different irrigation treatments in the rainy season 4 2 cherry water uptake from different water sources at different growth stages the direct inference approach indicated both more rainfall and higher irrigation quota decreased the possible main depth of cherry root water uptake because cherry root is shallow and sensitive to the water distribution and oxygen condition the physiological activities of cherry root will be affected when soil moisture content is changed so rainfall and irrigation may play an important role in the variation of main water uptake depth it can be seen from figs 4 and 5 mean soil water content between 0 and 30cm increased greatly after june 10th soil water content in the profile was higher under higher irrigation treatment except for soil surface that is to say more water was held per unit of soil at the original soil depth which may increase possible root water extraction rate and water uptake amount feddes et al 1976 feddes et al 2001 based on the cherry root investigations of yang et al 2009 and li 2010 and field experiments for mature apple trees of sokalska et al 2009 the roots of 5 year old cherry trees are mainly distributed in the 0 60cm soil layer and the root main parameters such as root length volume surface area and dry weight increase first and then decline with increase of depth at the profile and are highest between the vertical 20 40cm therefore percentage of shallower soil water acquisition to total cherry root water uptake increased when its soil water content became higher this tendency is consistent with the model results of guswa 2010 in wetter climates deep roots are not needed as water regularly available near the surface may be sufficient to meet plant demand although this direct inference method indicated the possible primary root water uptake depth was 27 42cm it ignored dynamic variation of root water uptake under changing meteorological condition along with plant growth and the possibility that stem water is a mixture of soil water from different layers in other words the water in the crops may not be absorbed from a single depth during the growth period and also may be mixed by water from several sources which has different values of isotopes in a fixed proportion wang et al 2010 the results of the isosource model showed the contribution of irrigation water and soil water to root water uptake was different at each growth stage cherry trees mainly used soil water at the 20 50cm depth and irrigation water at the fruit growth stage while the proportion of irrigation water and the soil water at 0 20cm in total water uptake was larger the soil water contribution to total water uptake in the 20 50cm soil layer was less with the increase of irrigation quota fig 6 it is probably because cherry has the greatest water requirement before postharvest stage water is critical to ensure the best reproduction and biomass accumulation at the beginning of the growth although irrigation water had less contribution than soil water to total roots water uptake it was still a significant source of root water uptake and beneficial for the activity of roots in the upper soil thus cherry trees tended to absorb more irrigation water and upper soil water because they are both more available for root water uptake under the higher irrigation treatment at the postharvest stage the average proportion of topsoil water to root water uptake increased to 45 however irrigation water accounted for less than 11 under the three irrigation treatments the reason why utilization of irrigation water declined is likely that sufficient rainfall in the rainy season improved the water content of surface soil and water uptake ability of lateral roots in the upper soil was largely activated after rainfall and irrigation so topsoil water originating from rainfall nearly met cherry growth requirements and the soil water replaced the contribution of irrigation water after the harvest period it was the final period of cherry growth in august and september and cherry required less water for slow growth when the temperature cooled and rainfall decreased the root main parameters such as root area index or physiological activity of shallow root may reduce while the deep root system was still increasing wang et al 2010 the root water uptake was mainly from the 50 100cm soil layer and irrigation water accounted for less than 7 of root water uptake from fig 7 and 8 the proportion of deep soil water 50 100cm to the root water uptake under t1 was greater than that under t2 it is also largely supported by the results obtained from fig 4 that possible main depth of root water uptake under t1 was deeper than t2 a similar relationship occurred between t2 and t3 sokalska et al 2009 also had similar findings in the drip irrigation experiment that found for the irrigated side of the trees the main concentration of roots was close to the soil surface in the wetted area and larger numbers of roots penetrated deeper soil layers on the side of the tree trunk opposite to the emitter thus decreasing irrigation amount may help root development more deeply williams and ehleringer 2000 in this study there was a trend of root water uptake from soil water between the growth periods of cherry initially it was mainly from the middle soil layer then topsoil and finally deep soil layer the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake decreased with the growth of cherry moreover it revealed that the contribution of irrigation water was positively correlated with irrigation quota at fruit growth stage but this effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake declined greatly and it seemed non influential at the end of plant growth stage during the growth period cherry roots can exhibit adaptation to water unreliability and growth strategy which could be advantageous to plant growth and reproduction under increasing water stress due to water conservation techniques or local climate changes bertrand et al 2014 ehleringer and dawson 1992 the contribution of potential water sources to root water uptake can reflect the temporal availability of irrigation water and rainfall by cherry under different external conditions based on results above using the variable irrigation quota at different growth stages is critical to save irrigation water this study has documented the effects of irrigation and rainfall on cherry root water uptake under drip irrigation however further field investigations and comparison with macroscopic approaches are needed to study how physical properties of the soil and characteristics of root systems affect root water uptake it can provide insight to understand the mechanisms of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac water circle and potential root zone adaptations to climate change and optimize irrigation regimes for shallow rooted species 5 conclusions through analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of soil isotopic profiles and root water uptake of cherry in different growth periods under three irrigation treatments in a cherry orchard the following conclusions can be reached 1 the mean value of soil water δ 18o in the soil profile responded to rainfall and irrigation quota and it had similar seasonal variation with soil water content in the profile and was positively correlated with irrigation quota 2 both rainfall and irrigation promoted cherry roots to access soil water at shallower depths 3 cherry water uptake from different soil depths and irrigation varied greatly in different growth stages there was a change in depth of root water uptake from soil water it was mainly from the 20 50cm soil layer at the fruit growth stage then it was from the soil water at depths of 0 20cm and 50 100cm for 70 irrigation treatment t1 0 50cm for 85 irrigation treatment t2 and 0 20cm for 100 irrigation treatment t3 finally it was mainly from the 50 100cm soil layer during the end of the growth period the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake gradually declined below 11 from the postharvest stage and the effect of irrigation amount on improving the contribution of irrigation water to root water uptake also declined greatly therefore considering the characteristics of cherry water uptake and rainfall during the whole growth period in beijing variable irrigation is the key to improve the contribution of irrigation water to total plant water uptake and minimize useless agricultural water in these orchards the optimal water regulation treatment is to supply sufficient irrigation water i e 100 of irrigation quota before the end of the fruit growth stage middle irrigation i e 85 of irrigation quota at the postharvest stage and low irrigation i e 70 of irrigation quota at the end of the growth period acknowledgement this research was supported by
