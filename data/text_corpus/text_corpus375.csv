1875,soil salinization is aggravated by evaporation resulting in salt crystallizing on the soil surface soil salinization is harmful to agriculture and has significant implications for the engineering and construction industry therefore this paper investigates water and salt transport in saline soils through comparison of numerical simulations with indoor evaporation tests based on darcy s law ideal gas law mass conservation law and energy conservation law a one dimensional transient mathematical model of coupled water heat salt transport is derived the bottom of the model represents a recharge boundary condition the sides of the soil column are insulated and impermeable and the top serves as a heat source the results show that the greater the salinity of the soil the more drastic the temperature change and at the same time the greater the water retention of the soil the temperature gradient along the height of the soil column provides a tremendous driving force for water salt transport and although the volumetric water content of the soil column at 3 4 cm dissipates quickly there is a gradient of increasing salt concentration towards the ends and decreasing towards the middle the modeled results agree with the experimental data indicating that the model can effectively simulate the water heat salt transport process for different saline sites under evaporation conditions the model is essential for the improvement of saline soils and for finding new methods to prevent further soil salinization keywords saline soil soil evaporation simultaneous water heat

soluble salts on the soil surface surface evaporation and infiltration play crucial roles in soil salt transport directly influencing how salts are distributed and present in the soil saline soil that exhibits engineering properties such as sinking and swelling can cause significant disasters in fields such as engineering and agriculture soil salinization is a process where salt dissolves in water and moves upward with soil moisture as the water reaches the surface layer it becomes water vapor and is expelled from the soil leaving the salt to accumulate at the surface and eventually precipitate to form a salt crust fig 1 a shows a diagram of the salinization process in soil under evaporative conditions the study of saline soil necessitates a thorough understanding of water salt migration patterns in soil the starting point for the study of soil water salt migration can be considered to be the emergence of darcy s law which describes the seepage pattern of gravity water in soil under low velocity conditions later buckingham 1907 introduced the concept of energy to the transport of capillary water in soils suggesting that capillary potential energy and capillary conductivity have an essential influence on the rise of capillary water and the water content of soil richards 1931 combined darcy s law and partial differential equations to describe the flow of liquid water in unsaturated soil and established the basic equations for water movement in porous media for a quantitative study of water movement salt transport is intimately linked to water movement and thus progress in hydrological research leads to advancements in water salt transport research corradini 2014 suggests that the increase in spatial and temporal data on soil moisture at different scales is significant in understanding the role of several processes in watershed hydrology in terms of solute transport in soil nielsen and biggar 1961 and eshel 1973 found through numerous experiments that convection and diffusion can coincide in the same or opposite directions and established a more classical convection dispersion equation for solute transport through fick s law genuchten 1982 suggested that solutes exist in both the moving and non moving water regions of the soil and can flow between the two areas this idea proposed a one dimensional moving and non moving water flow equation with a mass transport equation as the study of soil salinization progresses more and more researchers are beginning to add the temperature field to the study of water salt transport to form a three field coupled to water heat salt soil salinization research topic the temperature field is typically categorized into positive and negative temperature effects with evaporative conditions being classified as a positive temperature effect during evaporation the mechanism of water salt migration involves the absorption of sufficient heat by the liquid water in the soil causing it to undergo a phase change to water vapor this creates an imbalance between pore gas pressure and pore water pressure generating matrix suction that induces the movement of liquid water fig 1b shows a schematic representation of the driving forces of water salt migration under evaporative conditions there are many results for studying coupled water salt transport in saline bare soil under evaporative conditions the transport of water and salt is generally influenced by porosity which in turn is controlled by the compaction process man et al 2022 nassar and horton 1989b investigated the effects of salinity and compaction on water evaporation and solute distribution in soil test results have demonstrated that the presence of salt in saline soils reduces water evaporation compared to non saline soils compaction of soil increases water evaporation compared to uncompacted soil conditions as a result of evaporation solutes accumulate on the soil surface with significant solute accumulation in near surface soils and substantial soil drying rose et al 2005 studied the effect of water table depth on evaporation and salt accumulation in saline groundwater a vapor liquid two phase flow model has been developed to study the development of evaporation fronts below the surface of the three evaporation phases however this model does not account for the effect of salt on the vapor liquid phases gran et al 2011b developed a coupled evaporative water heat salt model for saline soil and simulated the evaporation process from saturated to over dry soil the model reproduces the experimental observations of soil temperature water content and salt concentration and confirms the complex and highly coupled nature of evaporation from saline soil hernández lópez et al 2014 conducted an indoor experiment using natural saline soil columns to estimate evaporation rates and liquid and water vapor flux at different water tables were determined by the water content at different depths conductivity rate and temperature were assessed zhang et al 2022b conducted a series of indoor evaporation tests on shallow saline soil considering initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater recharge to observe the heat water salt migration process under groundwater recharge conditions the salt accumulates rapidly at the surface of the soil column observation of the microstructure revealed the presence of flocculent structures in the soil before evaporation significant changes in surface microstructure such as the presence of pores and salt crystals were observed after evaporation it is clear from previous studies that the movement of liquid water water vapor and heat are closely coupled and strongly influence each other since fick s law of molecular diffusion and darcy s law of permeability researchers have conducted numerous qualitative and quantitative coupled studies on the movement of moisture temperature and salt in the soil the soil water characteristic curve swcc establishes a relationship between the soil matrix potential and the volumetric water content providing a fundamental basis for understanding soil moisture dynamics gao et al 2023 building on this relationship numerous researchers have developed mathematical models that couple water heat and vapor transport in soils under the influence of evaporation gran et al 2011b grifoll et al 2005 wen et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 however the presence of salt in the soil body dramatically increases the difficulty of building a coupled water vapor heat salt model of the soil body on the one hand this is because salt significantly alters the physical properties of the soil such as the dynamic viscosity and surface tension of the soil pores nayar et al 2014 on the other hand there are many different types of salt and their specific properties vary solutes increase the complexity of coupled systems in soils jambhekar et al 2016 shokri kuehni et al 2017 gran et al 2011a used four different salt solutions to set up a soil column experiment with an unfixed water table to study water vapor flux and solute transport during evaporation zhang et al 2014 developed a coupled water heat salt vapor model considering the evaporation process and behavior at different stages and applied the model to previous experiments on soil columns the model well established the relationship between salt precipitation and transport and evaporation however the effect of salt transport and precipitation on heating transfer is unclear wen et al 2020 incorporated the effects of salt migration and precipitation on heat transfer etc in a coupled water heat salt vapor model the effect of solid salt content on evaporation was examined in the calculation of evaporation rates however the revised model has more parameters and the solution process is more complicated teng et al 2019 developed an analytical model that considers the interaction of water heat and gas under evaporative conditions and compared it with experimental results which showed that the depth of the evaporation plane is independent of the soil hydraulic properties and depends only on the thermal diffusion coefficient of the soil and also revealed that the thermal diffusion coefficient has a significant influence on the evaporation process tan et al 2022 performed a sensitivity analysis of the thermal and hydraulic parameters in the repository using numerical simulation and proposed a new double layer buffer barrier from the sensitivity analysis results it can be concluded that thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity are high sensitivity parameters and specific heat capacity water density and water compressibility are low sensitivity parameters zhang et al 2021a studied the hot water dynamics and freezing depth characteristics during the freezing process a hot water coupling model was proposed to describe the hydrothermal coupling process during the freezing process which thoroughly considered the changes in unfrozen water the formation of the ice layer and the interaction between different elements the dynamics of hot water and freezing depth are simulated according to the boundary conditions of temperature variation the results show that hydrothermal dynamics can predict the freezing depth maximum well and that heat transfer plays an essential role in the modeling zhang et al 2021b established a mathematical model describing the fully coupled heat water solution gas mechanical multi field processes under temperature gradients based on porous media theory and the principle of continuous media mechanics the results show that the model can better reveal the water salt transfer mechanism and deformation mechanism of unsaturated saline soil under temperature gradient the effect of adsorption on the heat and mass transfer process and its deformation characteristics by affecting soil porosity for the study of water salt migration models in saline soils under evaporative conditions the water flow equations are typically based on mass conservation principles while the heat transfer equations are primarily based on energy conservation and surface energy balance theories additionally the salt migration equations are closely integrated with solute transport theories to account for the movement and behavior of various types of solutes in the soil zhang et al 2023 the mechanism of evaporation from soil without solutes is not the same as that of soil with solutes the presence of salt affects all stages of soil evaporation and therefore the coupling of salt with other physical fields must be considered when developing mathematical models for saline soil under evaporative conditions therefore based on previous research this paper derives a coupled water salt transport model from simulating the dynamics of water salt transport in bare soil under conditions without wind flow the model quantifies the evaporation process of saturated saline soils with different salt contents by simulating the changes of liquid water salt solutes and heat in the soil the model takes into account the impact of salt precipitation on the transport processes of each phase based on the existing water and salt transport model in soil the water and salt transport equation and related variables of the model are extended the extension of the model mainly considers the effects of thin film water temperature salt precipitation or dissolution on the water and salt transport of soil as well as the additional hydrothermal boundary conditions the effect of different salt content on water heat salt migration in soil was studied and analyzed by controlling different initial salt content the model lays the groundwork for including solid salt shape and mineral hygroscopicity essential for describing the mixed formation of soil particles and salt crystals and the related effects on liquid water and salt transport in the soil 2 mathematical models 2 1 model development the factors influencing water salt migration in saline soil under evaporation are very complex simplifying the water heat salt coupling phenomenon under soil evaporation conditions is necessary for deducing the relevant theoretical model theoretical modeling should take into account the following factors the first consideration is to establish model assumptions that can accurately reflect the laws of natural physics secondly the model should involve the selection of appropriate variables the use of balanced equations and the application of rigorous reasoning throughout the model building process finally the results of the model calculations need to demonstrate the usability and validity of the model the theoretical model presented in this paper is based on the following assumptions 1 neglect of solute migration due to thermal diffusion 2 the soil particles are homogeneous and rigid and the salt and pore distribution is also homogeneous 3 considering only water and salt transport in the vertical direction reducing the model to a one dimensional one 4 uniform distribution of water salt and soil pore in the pre calculation powdery clay and the absence of salt crystals 5 the effect of wind flow on evaporation is not considered 6 ignore the shrinkage effect caused by evaporation on the soil pore space the model assumes that water and heat are transferred only in the vertical direction and that the sides are insulated and do not drain the bottom of the model is fixed and includes a recharge channel while the model height is set to 20 cm 2 2 governing equations for water heat salt transports 2 2 1 water flow equation the model assumes that during the movement of water and water vapor the change in mass of water per unit time is equivalent to the change in mass of liquid water and the mass of migrating water vapor consequently based on the principle of mass conservation the governing equation for the motion of water can be derived fujimaki et al 2006 novak 2010 philip and de vries 1957 1 θ l ρ l t ρ l q l ρ v q v where θ l is volumetric water content of the soil m3 m3 ρ l ρ v is the density of liquid water and the density of water vapor kg m3 t is the time s z is the differential arithmetic z is the vertical space coordinate positive upward m q l is the liquid water flux m s q v is the vapor flux due to phase transition m s it is worth noting that equation 1 does not account for storage changes in local water vapor content this approximation is based on the assumption that the water vapor content is in equilibrium with the local liquid water content and that the water vapor content is lower than the liquid water content under this approximation the storage of liquid water contents comprises both liquid and vapor phases of water the formula for the water flux q l can be given by darcy s law bear 1972 2 q l k s k r ρ l g μ l φ m 1 where k s is the intrinsic permeability of the soil m2 k r is the relative permeability of liquid water in the soil the filling of soil pores by salt crystals is ignored here and is therefore a constant in the model m2 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 μ l is the dynamic viscosity of liquid water kg m s φ m is the soil matrix potential m in addition the influence of gravity on liquid water flow is considered water transport in soil is influenced by various factors including soil texture soil structure initial soil moisture content soil water solubility and soil temperature this paper specifically focuses on the effects of soil texture solutes in the soil and soil temperature on water transport in soil soil texture is indicative of the particle composition of soil which varies across different textures leading to variations in the size and distribution of soil pores consequently these variations in soil pore size and distribution directly affect the soil hydraulic conductivity and soil water potential the solutes in water interact physicochemically with soil particles and pre existing soil chemicals changing the pore distribution characteristics of the soil and affecting the soil s ability to conduct water soil temperature influences soil moisture patterns viscosity and surface tension considering the influence of temperature and solute on liquid water flow the formula of water flux can be rewritten according to the chain rule 3 q l k s k r ρ l g μ l φ m θ l θ l φ m t t φ m c c φ 0 c c 1 where t is the soil temperature k c is the solute concentration in liquid water of soil mass ratio of solute to solution kg kg φ 0 is the soil osmotic potential m in addition the density of liquid water in the soil is also related to the concentration of solution hughes and sanford 2004 idso 1977 4 ρ l ρ l 0 702 24 c where ρ l 0 is the density of liquid water in soil when there is no solute in liquid water the presence of solutes increases the potential energy of the solution in the liquid phase and higher temperatures can enhance the activity of liquid molecules therefore the dynamic viscosity of liquid water is related to solute concentration kestin et al 1981 5 μ l 239 4 10 248 37 t 140 7 3 25 10 3 c ρ l the liquid phase consists of water filled capillaries of different diameters and a thin film of liquid covering solid particles it is generally considered that the transferable water is composed of gravity water and capillary water without considering the influence of film water because water is a polar molecule it is bound to the surface of the soil by a thin film zhang et al 2022a under the action of external force the membrane water can move slowly from the area with a thick water film to the area with a thin water film therefore the water conductivity of unsaturated soil needs to be described by these two parameters the relative permeability of liquid water can simply be regarded as the sum of capillary flow and membrane flow contributions lebeau and konrad 2010 therefore the following formula can be obtained 6 k r k rc k rf where k rc is the relative permeability due to capillary flow m2 k rf is the relative permeability due to film flow m2 according to capillary theory and pore size distribution function the relative capillary permeability coefficient is obtained mualem 1976 7 k rc s l s lr 1 s lr 1 1 s l s lr 1 s lr

calculation of water and salt migration soil saturation can be calculated from soil water content formulas 8 and 9 to give the modified van genuchten swcc equation silty clay to describe the relationship between soil saturation and matrix potential gran et al 2011b fig 2 shows the fitting curve 8 s l 1 β s l r 1 α φ m m 1 1 m β s l r 9 β ln φ m z e r o ln φ m ln φ m z e r o where α m are

ζ is the soil film thickness it is worth noting that the influence of temperature on soil film thickness is not considered here m n is the soil porosity the volume ratio of soil pores to the sum of soil pores and soil particles and the calculation formula can be given below 11 n θ l s l the thickness of soil film is closely related to the separation pressure the separation pressure is usually a combination of ionic electrostatic and intermolecular forces to simplify the model the contributions of ionic electrostatic and intermolecular forces are assumed to be equal and the equations are given below 12 p i p m h c 6 π ζ 3 where p i p m are distributed as the disjoining pressure caused by ionic electrostatic and intermolecular force pa h c is the hamaker constant describing soil particle water vapor interaction through liquid water therefore thickness of soil film can be written as the following equation 13 ζ h c 3 π ρ l g φ m 3 kelvin equation can be used to describe the relationship between soil matrix water head and surface tension caused by capillary water sadeghi et al 2010 thus the matrix potential can be written as the formula 14 14 φ m 2 f t cos α 0 ρ l g r

273 15 the specific values of parameters are given in table 1 2 2 2 water vapor flux the transport of water vapor is determined by the gradient of vapor pressure and influenced by both the gradient of temperature and the gradient of solute concentration the uneven distribution of water vapor results in the formation of vapor pressure campbell 1985 water vapor flux which is determined by the gradient of water vapor density can be expressed using fick s law 17 q v d v τ θ a ρ v where d v is the molecular diffusivity of water vapor in air m2 s θ a is the volume air content m3 m3 τ is the

system with constant temperature and mass can be transformed using boyle s law to obtain the water vapor density equation used in this paper the ideal gas law by transformation provides the following formula for calculating the saturation density of water vapor fredlund and rahardjo 2015 24 ρ v s p v s m w rt where r is the ideal gas constant j mol k m w is the molecular weight of water kg mol p v s is the saturated water vapor pressure pa it is a function of temperature murray 1967 zhang et al 2015 in a system of pure water and air the saturation vapor pressure depends on the temperature and the total air pressure comparing temperature with total air pressure the effect of total air pressure on saturated vapor pressure is much smaller than that of temperature on saturated vapor pressure the saturation vapor pressure is negligibly influenced by the total air pressure for most shallow surface and atmospheric environments the effect of temperature on it is a factor that must be taken into account as the temperature can vary considerably in some practical situations and saturated vapor pressure is susceptible to changes in temperature by integrating the clausius clapeyron equation an exact analytical solution of the dependence of the saturation vapor pressure on the temperature variation can be obtained however the steps used to explain this mathematical solution are rather cumbersome and in practice empirical formulas are often used to describe such relationships 25 p v s 611 exp 17 27 t c t 38 85 based on the thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis of liquid water and

transfer equation soil thermal conduction can induce distinct temperature stresses depending on soil properties kong et al 2023 however in this study temperature stress is not considered due to the relatively small temperature gradient the governing equation for heat transport which neglects the latent heat caused by salt phase transformation is derived by considering the heat conduction between the soil skeleton and water the latent heat resulting from water vapor phase transformation and the heat flow due to soil conduction smits et al 2011 wu et al 2021 31 t ρ s c s θ s t ρ l c l θ l t λ t

evaporation process can be described as the absorption of heat during the conversion of water from liquid to the gaseous state there is no change in temperature in this process however there is a conversion of heat so the heat consumed by the evaporation process is called latent heat as opposed to sensible heat which is the change in temperature at the evaporation surface the latent heat equation suitable for clay was chosen in this paper the latent heat of water vapor is a function of temperature change henderson sellers 2010 nassar and horton 1997 33 l wv 2500 80 10 3 2358 t 2 2 4 salt migration equation salinized soil contains many salts which can be transported by solute dissolution at the micro scale advection diffusion and dispersion are typically the primary mechanisms influencing solute transport in porous media the law of mass conservation can be used to establish the solute equation in the same manner as the governing equation for water transport was derived advection refers to the movement of solute in the same direction and at the same speed as the flow of water therefore salt flux caused by advection can be expressed as 34 q salt a ρ l v l c the velocity of water can be obtained from the flux of water 35 v l q l hydrodynamic dispersion both mechanical and molecular is when the solute moves in a different direction than the water flows mechanical diffusion is essentially brownian motion whose motion is driven by a concentration gradient fick s law can be used to express the salt flux due to mechanical diffusion 36 q salt e d i c molecular dispersion is caused by the inconsistency of the flow velocity of salt ions when salt follows water which can be regarded as a reinforcing effect on mechanical diffusion the inconsistency in velocity is due to the variation in pore structure within the soil such as differences in pore size and path length the formula for salt flux caused by molecular dispersion is similar to equation 36 37 q salt m d m c 38 d m v av a l where d m is the mechanical diffusion coefficient m2 s v av is the mean linear velocity of liquid water a l is the longitudinal dispersion its recommended value is 0 35 delgado 2007 as the concentration of a salt solution approaches saturation the salt ceases to exist in ionic form and instead precipitates from the solution as crystals the morphological changes of the salt at different solute concentrations are shown schematically in fig 3 zhang et al 2021b this simplification ignores the case of supersaturation zhang et al 2014 fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of salt form hypothesis in the model the mass of precipitated salt particles can be expressed by the following formula 39 m c θ l ρ l c 0 c c s θ l ρ l c s ν c c s c c s 40 m sc 0 0 c c s ν c c s c c

1000 kg m3 m sc is the mass of salt crystal kg previous studies have developed one dimensional non reactive solute transport equations based on the principles of mass conservation bear and cheng 2010 as shown in equation 41 41 ρ l θ l c t q salt a ρ l θ l q salt e q salt m m sc substituting equations 34 36 and 37 into equations 41 and rearranging equations 41 the solute transport control equation can be obtained 42 ρ l θ l c t ρ l v c ρ l θ l d i d m c m sc 2 2 5 model boundary conditions the rate of soil evaporation typically progresses through three stages stage 1 s1 is primarily governed by atmospheric evaporation force during s1 the soil is saturated and the evaporation rate is at its highest but this stage is relatively short lived during stage 2 s2 the hydraulic properties of the soil control the evaporation rate and capillary water in the soil moves upward in the form of liquid water and steam to supplement surface water during stage 3 s3 the physical properties of the soil govern the evaporation rate during s3 the surface of the soil is extremely dry and water migration occurs primarily in the form of water vapor spreading upward through the wet layer below resulting in the lowest evaporation rate in this model the evaporation resistance in s1 does not take salt crystallization into account while in s2 and s3 the resistance term considers the effects of salt precipitation thus the resistance term becomes a variable that is related to the salt crystal content the schematic diagram of soil evaporation mechanism in three stages is shown in fig 4 fig 5 gives a diagram of the evaporation rate of the soil corresponding to fig 4 the difference of s1 s2 and s3 in the mathematical model depends on the calculation of resistance term and the dynamic change of soil surface temperature and moisture fujimaki et al 2006 the evaporation rate can be expressed as following 43 e ρ v ρ va ρ l r a r s r salt where e is the evaporation rate of soil m s ρ va is the

derivation of the model is based on the law of conservation of mass the law of conservation of energy darcy s law fick s law and solute crystallization and the derivation of a system of equations for water flow heat transport and salt transport each of which is a controlling equation for changes in the physical field a coupled water heat salt model for evaporative conditions in saline soils was derived by using the soil matrix potential soil temperature and soil salt concentration as dependent variables in the set of equations the governing equations for the one dimensional soil evaporation

considered in this paper is shown in the fig 7 and the coupling relationship is achieved through the mutual influence of various parameters the water heat salt transport in saline soil is an interactive feedback process and its control equation is closely related to nonlinear equations this is a one dimensional transient numerical model which is solved using the finite element method fem the fem is based on the variation principle and the weighted residual method the basic idea is to discretize the solution domain into a finite number of non overlapping cells and to select some suitable nodes as interpolation points within each cell the dependent variable in the partial differential equation to be solved is then rewritten as a system of linear equations based on interpolation functions of values at the nodes the desired solution can be obtained from there by appropriate numerical solving methods since the finite element method is relatively conventional its specific solving process can be referred to lai et al 2014 and zhang et al 2018 2 3 test data and methods 2 3 1 basic properties of soil samples in order to study the water and salt transport patterns of the soil under evaporative conditions indoor tests were carried out and compared with simulated data the indoor tests were conducted to measure some fundamental properties of the soil samples such as particle size composition basic physical and chemical properties as well as permeability coefficients the physical parameters of the soil samples are given in table 3 the properties of the soil depend on the relative content of the various particle size groups table 4 gives specific values for the composition of each grain group in the soil samples the soil sample parameters in tables 3 and 4 are from zhang et al 2022b from the data in tables 3 and 4 it is known that the soil sample is chalky clay the particle size distribution also provides the soil with good pore connectivity capillary water rise height and water holding capacity this makes the soil sample more sensitive to water aggregation and more suitable for this research topic of salt movement with water soil permeability is caused by the flow of pore water in the pore channels formed between the soil skeleton particles luo and song 2012 permeability coefficient k is a comprehensive indicator of soil permeability and the correct determination of its value is of great significance for calculating the permeability coefficient detailed procedures for measuring permeability coefficients and soil salinity can be found in zhang et al 2022b the properties of the soil sample under experimentation are intimately linked to the selection of parameters in the coupling model and the modifications made to the original equation 2 3 2 experimental methods the salt used in this experiment is carbonate the salt solution required for the test protocol is prepared to employ deionized water and anhydrous sodium carbonate powder which is then thoroughly mixed with the air dried and pulverized soil sample to form the test soil sample factors affecting water salt migration in saline soil include both external and internal factors external factors include the type and magnitude of the load on the soil the climatic conditions of the geographical location such as temperature humidity wind speed rainfall water table etc internal factors include the particle size composition salt content and initial water content of the soil sample this indoor evaporation model test investigated the effect of different levels of salt content on water salt migration in soil under evaporative conditions ω 0 is the initial water content of the soil θ c is the ratio of the mass of salt to the mass of dry soil the variable controlled for the test groups a and b was salt content the specific indoor test variables can be found in table 5 2 3 3 evaporation model test set the detailed experimental procedure and methodological steps for evaporation in this paper can be found in zhang et al 2022b and part of the results are used for model validation and deep discussion fig 8 illustrates the state of the indoor evaporation model at the completion of the preparation phase of the test an infra red lamp was used to simulate solar illumination to provide a stable heat source and the soil column was filled with an acrylic cylinder and wrapped with a layer of insulation the silver outer surface in the picture is the insulation foam the reason why insulation is needed is to block the heat transfer from the side of the earth column gran et al 2011a the material contains a backing insulation foam and a protective layer of aluminum foil the supply of shallow water in a natural environment is achieved using a transparent beaker with a scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of soil column temperature with height a test of an indoor evaporation model yielded data on temperature variation with irradiation time at different heights in soil columns a and b fig 9 displays the temperature variation with respect to the height of soil columns a and b in both indoor tests and simulations during the indoor test the initial temperature inside each soil column before infrared irradiation ranged from 19 to 21 c with an average temperature of 20 2 c which closely approximates the room temperature 22 23 c furthermore before the infrared light was applied both columns a and b exhibited higher temperatures at the bottom than at the top zhang et al 2022b considered that the possible reason was that the energy exchanged with the outside world above the soil column exceeded the energy at the bottom of the column which was a 2 cm thick glass plate that inhibited the energy exchange to some extent as shown in fig 9 the temperature of soil columns a and b increased overall as the irradiation time increased as evidenced by both experimental and numerical data with the rate of temperature increase being initially rapid before slowing down the temperature control of the atmosphere in test groups a and b was generally relatively stable in the experiment a constant temperature gradient was observed along the height of the soil column attributable to the absorption of heat generated by the infrared lamp at the top of the column in contrast the bottom of the column does not exchange heat with the surrounding atmosphere resulting in a persistent temperature gradient along the height of the column simultaneously the infrared lamp continually generates thermal energy that is transferred to the soil column along the temperature gradient providing the driving force for water salt transport within the soil in contrast numerical simulation primarily relied on a heat source placed on the top of the soil column to simulate test conditions which yielded favorable results fig 9 reveals that the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere near the surface of the soil column remained stable at approximately 45 c the soil column does not keep warming up because the temperature at the top of the column will be in equilibrium with the atmosphere within a specific temperature range observations of soil columns a and b indicate that the column with higher salt content exhibited a faster temperature response after exposure to the same amount of radiation for the same duration due to the presence of salt in the soil which increases its specific heat capacity and enables it to absorb more heat fig 9 illustrates a high degree of consistency between the model and experimental results 3 2 variation of volumetric water content along height after 11 days of infrared light exposure the volumetric water content curve of the soil column was plotted by measuring the water content of soil samples at various heights in the column on multiple occasions fig 10 shows the volumetric water content for the eleventh day of the indoor tests and numerical simulation for the purposes of this study soil layers with a water content of less than 10 are defined as dry soil layers while those with a water content greater than or equal to 10 are referred to as wet soil layers fig 10 illustrates that the initial moisture content of soil columns a and b was 35 moisture content in the upper 15 cm of the columns was very low ranging from 3 to 7 while the moisture content at the bottom of the columns was concentrated around 35 the water content distribution patterns of soil columns a and b are similar and the observed thickness of the dry soil layer after the test corresponds well to the water content distribution it is noteworthy that soil moisture content is higher at a depth of 2 13 cm with higher salinity levels corresponding to higher moisture content this phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of salt ions in the liquid water which increases the potential energy of the water and its dynamic viscosity leading to a decrease in flow rate and an increase in the soil s water holding capacity the water content of the wet soil layer during evaporation is highest in the soil column with the highest salt content as the presence of salt in the soil increases its water holding capacity the consistency between the experimental pattern and the numerical simulation results is apparent from fig 10 where the volumetric water content remains constant below the entire middle of the soil column under recharge conditions whereas above the middle of the column it rapidly decreases due to the effect of evaporation the indoor test had limitations and as a result the volumetric water content of the soil column was only recorded on the last day however this limitation was well compensated for by the numerical simulation fig 11 shows the variation of soil column moisture along the height in the numerical simulation while comparing it with the experimental phenomena the findings depicted in fig 11 reveal that during evaporation the pores of the soil experience compression from the surrounding soil resulting in the formation of cracks on the upper surface the cracks were formed around the barrel wall near the soil column because the barrel wall was fixed and the topsoil contracted radially due to evaporation so the cracks occurred around the barrel wall fig 11 also shows the development of cracks on the upper surface of each soil column at 1 3 and 11 days under infrared light as depicted in fig 11 the cracks developed rapidly on days 1 and 3 while the cracks on day 11 did not show significant differences from those formed on day 3 this suggests that evaporation from the upper surface of the soil column had mainly ceased by day 4 and the evaporation surface had shifted downward combining the numerical simulation results with the experimental data it can be observed that the volumetric water content of the upper half of the soil column dissipates rapidly in the first three days and slows down after the third day this volumetric water content trend also coincides with the experimental phenomenon which supports the conjecture that evaporation basically stops on the fourth day this also conforms to the general pattern of the evaporation stage on day 11 it was observed that some soil columns still had moist patches on their upper surface indicating that water was retained on the surface during evaporation moist patches were observed on the upper surface of some soil columns on day 11 which suggests that water may have remained trapped in some closed pores within the soil or that water vapor adhered to the upper surface of the soil column during upward movement resulting in the formation of a wet spot the difference in salt content between soil columns a and b did not have a significant effect on the development of the surface it is theoretically expected that a higher salt content in the soil would result in a lower rate of liquid water evaporation within the soil column which could potentially affect the development of cracks however this phenomenon was not observed in the tests and the difference in salt content between the soil columns a and b did not have a significant effect on crack development the numerical simulation results indicate that the volumetric water content of the soil column decreases with time along the height and the moisture dissipates more rapidly closer to the soil column surface furthermore the rate of water dissipation at the top of the soil column shown in fig 11 indicates that the evaporation rate of water is relatively high when the temperature is rising rapidly at the same time the variation of water content in the whole volume can verify that the higher the salt content of the soil proposed in the test phenomenon the stronger its water holding capacity 3 3 salt concentration varies along the height salt transport during the process of soil salinization is intrinsically linked to the flow of liquid water fig 12 depicts the variation of concentration along the height of a soil column following 11 days of irradiation alongside the corresponding numerical simulation results for both the concentration profile and the temporal variation of salt content along the height of the column these simulation results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between water flow and salt transport in the soil highlighting the significance of temporal and spatial variations in salinity concentration as a function of soil depth from fig 12 the irradiated soil column concentrations show an overall increasing trend compared to the initial values this indicates that the concentration of salt in the soil column increases as water evaporates and migrates towards the top of the soil column the experimental results indicate that the distribution of salt concentration follows an overall trend of being higher at both ends and lower in the middle the higher the initial salt content the more noticeable this phenomenon is the higher concentration at the top 19 cm of the soil column could be attributed to the high temperature gradient at the top of the column the intense evaporation leading to high water salt migration efficiency in the column and the rapid evaporation of water leading to salt crystallization at the top the simulation results indicate that the model is consistent with the experimental results in terms of the salt migration pattern it is worth noting that the deviation of the simulation results from the experiment is more significant in the soil columns with higher salt concentrations compared to those with lower concentrations one possible reason for the discrepancy between the simulation and experimental results is that the simulation model only considers salt crystallization and pore resistance in the high concentration soil columns while other factors such as adsorption and reaction may also play a role in the actual test as a result the simulation results may be overestimated compared to the experimental data at the same time it can be observed that the soil columns with different salt concentrations vary in their overall concentration pattern is worth analyzing the overall concentration variation value in the soil column with a small initial concentration is smaller than the overall concentration of the column with a large initial concentration because in the case of concentration less than the solubility the salt dissolved in water forms a non saturated solution therefore in the case of a concentration below the solubility limit each transport carries a lower amount of salt while for concentrations above the solubility limit each transport carries a saturated solution leading to a larger variation of concentration in the entire column the numerical simulation of salt migration over time in fig 12 demonstrates that the overall salt change reaches its peak after 7 days regardless of the initial salt concentration this can be explained in conjunction with the volumetric water content dissipation diagram as salt is transported along with water however the salt concentration becomes more prominent during water evaporation showing a lag in salt concentration change the simulation results match well with the experimental data indicating that the model is well suited for the study overall the simulation results demonstrate that the water heat salt migration pattern of the model is consistent with the experimental results however some differences between the two could be attributed to possible errors in the simulation and the experiment itself the constructed coupled water heat salt model makes idealized assumptions in many aspects some special effects and phenomena that may occur in the experiment such as hygroscopicity of soil minerals solutes being adsorbed in the soil etc are ignored in addition the one dimensional model does not account for axial variation in the soil columns which may lead to some discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results despite these differences the model was able to calculate the spatial and temporal variation of liquid water volumetric content temperature and solute concentration in saline lands under evaporative conditions addressing these issues is critical to improving the accuracy of the model further therefore more in depth improvements are needed in the following model studies 3 4 water and salt model validation discussion the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of different salinity levels on temperature gradients in soils fig 9 illustrates that the model aligns with the experimental data in terms of temperature gradient variation and reveals minimal impact of salt content on temperature gradient this paper does not delve into a detailed analysis of temperature measurement errors rather the focus is on exploring the impact of salt content changes during evaporation on salt transport patterns in water to verify the validity of the model root mean square error rmse was employed rmse is a method used to measure the magnitude of the error between the predicted and true values the smaller the value of rmse the more accurate the forecasting model compared to other measures of forecast error e g mae rmse is more sensitive and more indicative of large errors between forecast and true values the rmse values for soil column a under evaporation were 8 1 and 0 58 for volumetric water content and concentration respectively for soil column b the rmse values were 8 9 and 2 0 for volumetric water content and concentration respectively fig 13 presents the measured and simulated values plotted on the 1 1 line it can be seen from fig 13 that in the part of the soil column above about 15 cm the evaporation front the difference between the measured and simulated water content values is relatively significant possible reasons for this discrepancy include the gradual drying of the soil on the upper side of the evaporation front during the experiment and the resulting differences in thermal conduction characteristics compared to the lower part of the soil the variation of the thermal conduction characteristics of the soil was not considered in the numerical model the overall rmse values indicate that the model performs significantly better in simulating concentration compared to volumetric water content considering the salt content it can be seen that soil columns with low salt content are more stable in comparison the model s consideration of solute crystallization may have contributed to this observation as it is less affected by changes in salt phase state in soils with lower salinity consequently the model s simulations of water salt migration patterns in these soils are more consistent with the experimental results in highly saline soils the presence of salt crystals can significantly affect permeability by filling the pores while also altering the dynamic viscosity of the soil numerical validation results indicate that the water salt migration pattern in highly saline soils is considerably more complex the rmse error values for water salts fall within reasonable limits confirming the model s validity and applicability 4 conclusion to investigate the water salt migration behavior in saline soils with varying salt content under evaporation conditions a one dimensional transient mathematical model that considers the coupling of water heat and salt was developed the model is based on principles of mass conservation energy conservation darcy s law the ideal gas law and surface energy balance the distribution results of the simulated temperature moisture and salt fields of the soils are analyzed and discussed and compared to those obtained in indoor tests the following conclusions were drawn by comparing and analyzing the results with those obtained from the indoor tests 1 throughout the process of evaporation a temperature gradient formed along the height of the soil column which facilitated the migration of water and salt the temperature variation was most pronounced at the onset of irradiation the rate of temperature increase was found to be directly proportional to the salt content of the soil the changes in volumetric water content were found to be most concentrated in the surface layer of the soil at a depth of 4 6 cm the simulation results in conjunction with experimental observations suggest that evaporation nearly ceased by the third day of irradiation with the evaporation surface gradually moving downwards the water holding capacity of the soil increased with an increase in salinity content 2 the concentration changes in the soil column demonstrated that salt accumulates in the areas near the bottom recharge and the top surface during soil water salt migration moreover the salt concentration tends to be higher at the ends of the soil column and lower in the middle the concentration changes in soil with high initial salt content are more pronounced compared to soil with low salt content however there is a lag in the concentration changes compared to moisture changes 3 the numerical model addresses the limitation of real time monitoring of volumetric water content and salinity changes during the experiment the model s results were also compared and analyzed with the experimental results the comparison showed that the model was able to simulate the water and salt transport patterns of saline soil under evaporation conditions more accurately than the experiment alone credit authorship contribution statement

1875,soil salinization is aggravated by evaporation resulting in salt crystallizing on the soil surface soil salinization is harmful to agriculture and has significant implications for the engineering and construction industry therefore this paper investigates water and salt transport in saline soils through comparison of numerical simulations with indoor evaporation tests based on darcy s law ideal gas law mass conservation law and energy conservation law a one dimensional transient mathematical model of coupled water heat salt transport is derived the bottom of the model represents a recharge boundary condition the sides of the soil column are insulated and impermeable and the top serves as a heat source the results show that the greater the salinity of the soil the more drastic the temperature change and at the same time the greater the water retention of the soil the temperature gradient along the height of the soil column provides a tremendous driving force for water salt transport and although the volumetric water content of the soil column at 3 4 cm dissipates quickly there is a gradient of increasing salt concentration towards the ends and decreasing towards the middle the modeled results agree with the experimental data indicating that the model can effectively simulate the water heat salt transport process for different saline sites under evaporation conditions the model is essential for the improvement of saline soils and for finding new methods to prevent further soil salinization keywords saline soil soil evaporation simultaneous water heat

soluble salts on the soil surface surface evaporation and infiltration play crucial roles in soil salt transport directly influencing how salts are distributed and present in the soil saline soil that exhibits engineering properties such as sinking and swelling can cause significant disasters in fields such as engineering and agriculture soil salinization is a process where salt dissolves in water and moves upward with soil moisture as the water reaches the surface layer it becomes water vapor and is expelled from the soil leaving the salt to accumulate at the surface and eventually precipitate to form a salt crust fig 1 a shows a diagram of the salinization process in soil under evaporative conditions the study of saline soil necessitates a thorough understanding of water salt migration patterns in soil the starting point for the study of soil water salt migration can be considered to be the emergence of darcy s law which describes the seepage pattern of gravity water in soil under low velocity conditions later buckingham 1907 introduced the concept of energy to the transport of capillary water in soils suggesting that capillary potential energy and capillary conductivity have an essential influence on the rise of capillary water and the water content of soil richards 1931 combined darcy s law and partial differential equations to describe the flow of liquid water in unsaturated soil and established the basic equations for water movement in porous media for a quantitative study of water movement salt transport is intimately linked to water movement and thus progress in hydrological research leads to advancements in water salt transport research corradini 2014 suggests that the increase in spatial and temporal data on soil moisture at different scales is significant in understanding the role of several processes in watershed hydrology in terms of solute transport in soil nielsen and biggar 1961 and eshel 1973 found through numerous experiments that convection and diffusion can coincide in the same or opposite directions and established a more classical convection dispersion equation for solute transport through fick s law genuchten 1982 suggested that solutes exist in both the moving and non moving water regions of the soil and can flow between the two areas this idea proposed a one dimensional moving and non moving water flow equation with a mass transport equation as the study of soil salinization progresses more and more researchers are beginning to add the temperature field to the study of water salt transport to form a three field coupled to water heat salt soil salinization research topic the temperature field is typically categorized into positive and negative temperature effects with evaporative conditions being classified as a positive temperature effect during evaporation the mechanism of water salt migration involves the absorption of sufficient heat by the liquid water in the soil causing it to undergo a phase change to water vapor this creates an imbalance between pore gas pressure and pore water pressure generating matrix suction that induces the movement of liquid water fig 1b shows a schematic representation of the driving forces of water salt migration under evaporative conditions there are many results for studying coupled water salt transport in saline bare soil under evaporative conditions the transport of water and salt is generally influenced by porosity which in turn is controlled by the compaction process man et al 2022 nassar and horton 1989b investigated the effects of salinity and compaction on water evaporation and solute distribution in soil test results have demonstrated that the presence of salt in saline soils reduces water evaporation compared to non saline soils compaction of soil increases water evaporation compared to uncompacted soil conditions as a result of evaporation solutes accumulate on the soil surface with significant solute accumulation in near surface soils and substantial soil drying rose et al 2005 studied the effect of water table depth on evaporation and salt accumulation in saline groundwater a vapor liquid two phase flow model has been developed to study the development of evaporation fronts below the surface of the three evaporation phases however this model does not account for the effect of salt on the vapor liquid phases gran et al 2011b developed a coupled evaporative water heat salt model for saline soil and simulated the evaporation process from saturated to over dry soil the model reproduces the experimental observations of soil temperature water content and salt concentration and confirms the complex and highly coupled nature of evaporation from saline soil hernández lópez et al 2014 conducted an indoor experiment using natural saline soil columns to estimate evaporation rates and liquid and water vapor flux at different water tables were determined by the water content at different depths conductivity rate and temperature were assessed zhang et al 2022b conducted a series of indoor evaporation tests on shallow saline soil considering initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater recharge to observe the heat water salt migration process under groundwater recharge conditions the salt accumulates rapidly at the surface of the soil column observation of the microstructure revealed the presence of flocculent structures in the soil before evaporation significant changes in surface microstructure such as the presence of pores and salt crystals were observed after evaporation it is clear from previous studies that the movement of liquid water water vapor and heat are closely coupled and strongly influence each other since fick s law of molecular diffusion and darcy s law of permeability researchers have conducted numerous qualitative and quantitative coupled studies on the movement of moisture temperature and salt in the soil the soil water characteristic curve swcc establishes a relationship between the soil matrix potential and the volumetric water content providing a fundamental basis for understanding soil moisture dynamics gao et al 2023 building on this relationship numerous researchers have developed mathematical models that couple water heat and vapor transport in soils under the influence of evaporation gran et al 2011b grifoll et al 2005 wen et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 however the presence of salt in the soil body dramatically increases the difficulty of building a coupled water vapor heat salt model of the soil body on the one hand this is because salt significantly alters the physical properties of the soil such as the dynamic viscosity and surface tension of the soil pores nayar et al 2014 on the other hand there are many different types of salt and their specific properties vary solutes increase the complexity of coupled systems in soils jambhekar et al 2016 shokri kuehni et al 2017 gran et al 2011a used four different salt solutions to set up a soil column experiment with an unfixed water table to study water vapor flux and solute transport during evaporation zhang et al 2014 developed a coupled water heat salt vapor model considering the evaporation process and behavior at different stages and applied the model to previous experiments on soil columns the model well established the relationship between salt precipitation and transport and evaporation however the effect of salt transport and precipitation on heating transfer is unclear wen et al 2020 incorporated the effects of salt migration and precipitation on heat transfer etc in a coupled water heat salt vapor model the effect of solid salt content on evaporation was examined in the calculation of evaporation rates however the revised model has more parameters and the solution process is more complicated teng et al 2019 developed an analytical model that considers the interaction of water heat and gas under evaporative conditions and compared it with experimental results which showed that the depth of the evaporation plane is independent of the soil hydraulic properties and depends only on the thermal diffusion coefficient of the soil and also revealed that the thermal diffusion coefficient has a significant influence on the evaporation process tan et al 2022 performed a sensitivity analysis of the thermal and hydraulic parameters in the repository using numerical simulation and proposed a new double layer buffer barrier from the sensitivity analysis results it can be concluded that thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity are high sensitivity parameters and specific heat capacity water density and water compressibility are low sensitivity parameters zhang et al 2021a studied the hot water dynamics and freezing depth characteristics during the freezing process a hot water coupling model was proposed to describe the hydrothermal coupling process during the freezing process which thoroughly considered the changes in unfrozen water the formation of the ice layer and the interaction between different elements the dynamics of hot water and freezing depth are simulated according to the boundary conditions of temperature variation the results show that hydrothermal dynamics can predict the freezing depth maximum well and that heat transfer plays an essential role in the modeling zhang et al 2021b established a mathematical model describing the fully coupled heat water solution gas mechanical multi field processes under temperature gradients based on porous media theory and the principle of continuous media mechanics the results show that the model can better reveal the water salt transfer mechanism and deformation mechanism of unsaturated saline soil under temperature gradient the effect of adsorption on the heat and mass transfer process and its deformation characteristics by affecting soil porosity for the study of water salt migration models in saline soils under evaporative conditions the water flow equations are typically based on mass conservation principles while the heat transfer equations are primarily based on energy conservation and surface energy balance theories additionally the salt migration equations are closely integrated with solute transport theories to account for the movement and behavior of various types of solutes in the soil zhang et al 2023 the mechanism of evaporation from soil without solutes is not the same as that of soil with solutes the presence of salt affects all stages of soil evaporation and therefore the coupling of salt with other physical fields must be considered when developing mathematical models for saline soil under evaporative conditions therefore based on previous research this paper derives a coupled water salt transport model from simulating the dynamics of water salt transport in bare soil under conditions without wind flow the model quantifies the evaporation process of saturated saline soils with different salt contents by simulating the changes of liquid water salt solutes and heat in the soil the model takes into account the impact of salt precipitation on the transport processes of each phase based on the existing water and salt transport model in soil the water and salt transport equation and related variables of the model are extended the extension of the model mainly considers the effects of thin film water temperature salt precipitation or dissolution on the water and salt transport of soil as well as the additional hydrothermal boundary conditions the effect of different salt content on water heat salt migration in soil was studied and analyzed by controlling different initial salt content the model lays the groundwork for including solid salt shape and mineral hygroscopicity essential for describing the mixed formation of soil particles and salt crystals and the related effects on liquid water and salt transport in the soil 2 mathematical models 2 1 model development the factors influencing water salt migration in saline soil under evaporation are very complex simplifying the water heat salt coupling phenomenon under soil evaporation conditions is necessary for deducing the relevant theoretical model theoretical modeling should take into account the following factors the first consideration is to establish model assumptions that can accurately reflect the laws of natural physics secondly the model should involve the selection of appropriate variables the use of balanced equations and the application of rigorous reasoning throughout the model building process finally the results of the model calculations need to demonstrate the usability and validity of the model the theoretical model presented in this paper is based on the following assumptions 1 neglect of solute migration due to thermal diffusion 2 the soil particles are homogeneous and rigid and the salt and pore distribution is also homogeneous 3 considering only water and salt transport in the vertical direction reducing the model to a one dimensional one 4 uniform distribution of water salt and soil pore in the pre calculation powdery clay and the absence of salt crystals 5 the effect of wind flow on evaporation is not considered 6 ignore the shrinkage effect caused by evaporation on the soil pore space the model assumes that water and heat are transferred only in the vertical direction and that the sides are insulated and do not drain the bottom of the model is fixed and includes a recharge channel while the model height is set to 20 cm 2 2 governing equations for water heat salt transports 2 2 1 water flow equation the model assumes that during the movement of water and water vapor the change in mass of water per unit time is equivalent to the change in mass of liquid water and the mass of migrating water vapor consequently based on the principle of mass conservation the governing equation for the motion of water can be derived fujimaki et al 2006 novak 2010 philip and de vries 1957 1 θ l ρ l t ρ l q l ρ v q v where θ l is volumetric water content of the soil m3 m3 ρ l ρ v is the density of liquid water and the density of water vapor kg m3 t is the time s z is the differential arithmetic z is the vertical space coordinate positive upward m q l is the liquid water flux m s q v is the vapor flux due to phase transition m s it is worth noting that equation 1 does not account for storage changes in local water vapor content this approximation is based on the assumption that the water vapor content is in equilibrium with the local liquid water content and that the water vapor content is lower than the liquid water content under this approximation the storage of liquid water contents comprises both liquid and vapor phases of water the formula for the water flux q l can be given by darcy s law bear 1972 2 q l k s k r ρ l g μ l φ m 1 where k s is the intrinsic permeability of the soil m2 k r is the relative permeability of liquid water in the soil the filling of soil pores by salt crystals is ignored here and is therefore a constant in the model m2 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 μ l is the dynamic viscosity of liquid water kg m s φ m is the soil matrix potential m in addition the influence of gravity on liquid water flow is considered water transport in soil is influenced by various factors including soil texture soil structure initial soil moisture content soil water solubility and soil temperature this paper specifically focuses on the effects of soil texture solutes in the soil and soil temperature on water transport in soil soil texture is indicative of the particle composition of soil which varies across different textures leading to variations in the size and distribution of soil pores consequently these variations in soil pore size and distribution directly affect the soil hydraulic conductivity and soil water potential the solutes in water interact physicochemically with soil particles and pre existing soil chemicals changing the pore distribution characteristics of the soil and affecting the soil s ability to conduct water soil temperature influences soil moisture patterns viscosity and surface tension considering the influence of temperature and solute on liquid water flow the formula of water flux can be rewritten according to the chain rule 3 q l k s k r ρ l g μ l φ m θ l θ l φ m t t φ m c c φ 0 c c 1 where t is the soil temperature k c is the solute concentration in

hughes and sanford 2004 idso 1977 4 ρ l ρ l 0 702 24 c where ρ l 0 is the density of liquid water in soil when there is no solute in liquid water the presence of solutes increases the potential energy of the solution in the liquid phase and higher temperatures can enhance the activity of liquid molecules therefore the dynamic viscosity of liquid water is related to solute concentration kestin et al 1981 5 μ l 239 4 10 248 37 t 140 7 3 25 10 3 c ρ l the liquid phase consists of water filled capillaries of different diameters and a thin film of liquid covering solid particles it is generally considered that the transferable water is composed of gravity water and capillary water without considering the influence of film water because water is a polar molecule it is bound to the surface of the soil by a thin film zhang et al 2022a under the action of external force the membrane water can move slowly from the area with a thick water film to the area with a thin water film therefore the water conductivity of unsaturated soil needs to be described by these two parameters the relative permeability of liquid water can simply be regarded as the sum of capillary flow and membrane flow contributions lebeau and konrad 2010 therefore the following formula can be obtained 6 k r k rc k rf where k rc is the relative permeability due to capillary flow m2 k rf is the relative permeability due to film flow m2 according to capillary theory and pore size distribution function the relative capillary permeability coefficient is obtained mualem 1976 7 k rc s l s lr 1 s lr 1 1 s l s lr 1 s lr

soil pores and soil particles and the calculation formula can be given below 11 n θ l s l the thickness of soil film is closely related to the separation pressure the separation pressure is usually a combination of ionic electrostatic and intermolecular forces to simplify the model the contributions of ionic electrostatic and intermolecular forces are assumed to be equal and the equations are given below 12 p i p m h c 6 π ζ 3 where p i p m are distributed as the disjoining pressure caused by ionic electrostatic and intermolecular force pa h c is the hamaker constant describing soil

temperature and the gradient of solute concentration the uneven distribution of water vapor results in the formation of vapor pressure campbell 1985 water vapor flux which is determined by the

system with constant temperature and mass can be transformed using boyle s law to obtain the water vapor density equation used in this paper the ideal gas law by transformation provides the following

s is the saturated water vapor pressure pa it is a function of temperature murray 1967 zhang et al 2015 in a system of pure water and air the saturation vapor pressure depends on the temperature and the total air pressure comparing temperature with total air pressure the effect of total air pressure on saturated vapor pressure is much smaller than that of temperature on saturated vapor pressure the saturation vapor pressure is negligibly influenced by the total air pressure for most shallow surface and atmospheric environments the effect of temperature on it is a factor that must be taken into account as the temperature can vary considerably in some practical situations and saturated vapor pressure is susceptible to changes in temperature by integrating the clausius clapeyron equation an exact analytical solution of the dependence of the saturation vapor pressure on the temperature variation can be obtained however the steps used to explain this mathematical solution are rather cumbersome and in practice empirical formulas are often used to describe such relationships 25 p v s 611 exp 17 27 t c t 38 85 based on the thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis of liquid water and

transfer equation soil thermal conduction can induce distinct temperature stresses depending on soil properties kong et al 2023 however in this study temperature stress is not considered due to the relatively small temperature gradient the governing equation for heat transport which neglects the latent heat caused by salt phase transformation is derived by considering the heat conduction between the soil skeleton and water the latent heat resulting from water vapor phase transformation and the heat flow due to soil conduction smits et al 2011 wu et al 2021 31 t ρ s c s θ s t ρ l c l θ l t λ t

evaporation process can be described as the absorption of heat during the conversion of water from liquid to the gaseous state there is no change in temperature in this process however there is a conversion of heat so the heat consumed by the evaporation process is called latent heat as opposed to sensible heat which is the change in temperature at the evaporation surface the latent heat equation suitable for clay was chosen in this paper the latent heat of water vapor is a function of temperature change henderson sellers 2010 nassar and horton 1997 33 l wv 2500 80 10 3 2358 t 2 2 4 salt migration equation salinized soil contains many salts which can be transported by solute dissolution at the micro scale advection diffusion and dispersion are typically the primary mechanisms influencing solute transport in porous media the law of mass conservation can be used to establish the solute equation in the same manner as the governing equation for water transport was derived advection refers to the movement of solute in the same direction and at the same speed as the flow of water therefore salt flux caused by advection can be expressed as 34 q salt a ρ l v l c the velocity of water can be obtained from the flux of water 35 v l q l hydrodynamic dispersion both mechanical and molecular is when the solute moves in a different direction than the water flows mechanical diffusion is essentially brownian motion whose motion is driven by a concentration gradient fick s law can be used to express the salt flux due to mechanical diffusion 36 q salt e d i c molecular dispersion is caused by the inconsistency of the flow velocity of salt ions when salt follows water which can be regarded as a reinforcing effect on mechanical diffusion the inconsistency in velocity is due to the variation in pore structure within the soil such as differences in pore size and path length the formula for salt flux caused by molecular dispersion is similar to equation 36 37 q salt m d m c 38 d m v av a l where d m is the mechanical diffusion coefficient m2 s v av is the mean linear velocity of liquid water a l is the longitudinal dispersion its recommended value is 0 35 delgado 2007 as the concentration of a salt solution approaches saturation the salt ceases to exist in ionic form and instead precipitates from the solution as crystals the morphological changes of the salt at different solute concentrations are shown schematically in fig 3 zhang et al 2021b this simplification ignores the case of supersaturation zhang et al 2014 fig 3 shows a schematic diagram

as shown in equation 41 41 ρ l θ l c t q salt a ρ l θ l q salt e q salt m m sc substituting equations 34 36 and 37 into equations 41 and rearranging equations 41 the solute transport control equation can be obtained 42 ρ l θ l c t ρ l v c ρ l θ l d i d m c m sc 2 2 5 model boundary conditions the rate of soil evaporation typically progresses through three stages stage 1 s1 is primarily governed by atmospheric evaporation force during s1 the soil is saturated and the evaporation rate is at its highest but this stage is relatively short lived during stage 2 s2 the hydraulic properties of the soil control the evaporation rate and capillary water in the soil moves upward in the form of liquid water and steam to supplement surface water during stage 3 s3 the physical properties of the soil govern the evaporation rate during s3 the surface of the soil is extremely dry and water migration occurs primarily in the form of water vapor spreading upward through the wet layer below resulting in the lowest evaporation rate in this model the evaporation resistance in s1 does not take salt crystallization into account while in s2 and s3 the resistance term considers the effects of salt precipitation thus the resistance term becomes a variable that is related to the salt crystal content the schematic diagram of soil evaporation mechanism in three stages is shown in fig 4 fig 5 gives a diagram of the evaporation rate of the soil corresponding to fig 4 the difference of s1 s2 and s3 in the mathematical model depends on the calculation of resistance term and the dynamic change of soil surface temperature and moisture fujimaki et al 2006 the evaporation rate can be expressed as following 43 e ρ v ρ va ρ l r a r s r salt where e is the evaporation rate of soil m s ρ va is the density of water vapor in air kg m3 r a r s r salt are the air resistance of water vapor transport soil surface resistance and salt precipitation resistance s m to simplify the calculation air

influencing the soil surface are solar radiation the latent heat of soil evaporation and the convective heat between water vapor in soil pores and the atmosphere thus the surface energy balance equation can be used to describe the energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere under the assumption that the soil does not store heat saito et al 2006 47 r n g l wv ρ l e h where r n is

derivation of the model is based on the law of conservation of mass the law of conservation of energy darcy s law fick s law and solute crystallization and the derivation of a system of equations for water flow heat transport and salt transport each of which is a controlling equation for changes in the physical field a coupled water heat salt model for evaporative conditions in saline soils was derived by using the soil matrix potential soil temperature and soil salt concentration as dependent variables in the set of equations the governing equations for the one dimensional soil evaporation

considered in this paper is shown in the fig 7 and the coupling relationship is achieved through the mutual influence of various parameters the water heat salt transport in saline soil is an interactive feedback process and its control equation is closely related to nonlinear equations this is a one dimensional transient numerical model which is solved using the finite element method fem the fem is based on the variation principle and the weighted residual method the basic idea is to discretize the solution domain into a finite number of non overlapping cells and to select some suitable nodes as interpolation points within each cell the dependent variable in the partial differential equation to be solved is then rewritten as a system of linear equations based on interpolation functions of values at the nodes the desired solution can be obtained from there by appropriate numerical solving methods since the finite element method is relatively conventional its specific solving process can be referred to lai et al 2014 and zhang et al 2018 2 3 test data and methods 2 3 1 basic properties of soil samples in order to study the water and salt transport patterns of the soil under evaporative conditions indoor tests were carried out and compared with simulated data the indoor tests were conducted to measure some fundamental properties of the soil samples such as particle size composition basic physical and chemical properties as well as permeability coefficients the physical parameters of the soil samples are given in table 3 the properties of the soil depend on the relative content of the various particle size groups table 4 gives specific values for the composition of each grain group in the soil samples the soil sample parameters in tables 3 and 4 are from zhang et al 2022b from the data in tables 3 and 4 it is known that the soil sample is chalky clay the particle size distribution also provides the soil with good pore connectivity capillary water rise height and water holding capacity this makes the soil sample more sensitive to water aggregation and more suitable for this research topic of salt movement with water soil permeability is caused by the flow of pore water in the pore channels formed between the soil skeleton particles luo and song 2012 permeability coefficient k is a comprehensive indicator of soil permeability and the correct determination of its value is of great significance for calculating the permeability coefficient detailed procedures for measuring permeability coefficients and soil salinity can be found in zhang et al 2022b the properties of the soil sample under experimentation are intimately linked to the selection of parameters in the coupling model and the modifications made to the original equation 2 3 2 experimental methods the salt used in this experiment is carbonate the salt solution required for the test protocol is prepared to employ deionized water and anhydrous sodium carbonate powder which is then thoroughly mixed with the air dried and pulverized soil sample to form the test soil sample factors affecting water salt migration in saline soil include both external and internal factors external factors include the type and magnitude of the load on the soil the climatic conditions of the geographical location such as temperature humidity wind speed rainfall water table etc internal factors include the particle size composition salt content and initial water content of the soil sample this indoor evaporation model test investigated the effect of different levels of salt content on water salt migration in soil under evaporative conditions ω 0 is the initial water content of the soil θ c is the ratio of the mass of salt to the mass of dry soil the variable controlled for the test groups a and b was salt content the specific indoor test variables can be found in table 5 2 3 3 evaporation model test set the detailed experimental procedure and methodological steps for evaporation in this paper can be found in zhang et al 2022b and part of the results are used for model validation and deep discussion fig 8 illustrates the state of the indoor evaporation model at the completion of the preparation phase of the test an infra red lamp was used to simulate solar illumination to provide a stable heat source and the soil column was filled with an acrylic cylinder and wrapped with a layer of insulation the silver outer surface in the picture is the insulation foam the reason why insulation is needed is to block the heat transfer from the side of the earth column gran et al 2011a the material contains a backing insulation foam and a protective layer of aluminum foil the supply of shallow water in a natural environment is achieved using a transparent beaker with a scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of soil column temperature with height a test of an indoor evaporation model yielded data on temperature variation with irradiation time at different heights in soil columns a and b fig 9 displays the temperature variation with respect to the height of soil columns a and b in both indoor tests and simulations during the indoor test the initial temperature inside each soil column before infrared irradiation ranged from 19 to 21 c with an average temperature of 20 2 c which closely approximates the room temperature 22 23 c furthermore before the infrared light was applied both columns a and b exhibited higher temperatures at the bottom than at the top zhang et al 2022b considered that the possible reason was that the energy exchanged with the outside world above the soil column exceeded the energy at the bottom of the column which was a 2 cm thick glass plate that inhibited the energy exchange to some extent as shown in fig 9 the temperature of soil columns a and b increased overall as the irradiation time increased as evidenced by both experimental and numerical data with the rate of temperature increase being initially rapid before slowing down the temperature control of the atmosphere in test groups a and b was generally relatively stable in the experiment a constant temperature gradient was observed along the height of the soil column attributable to the absorption of heat generated by the infrared lamp at the top of the column in contrast the bottom of the column does not exchange heat with the surrounding atmosphere resulting in a persistent temperature gradient along the height of the column simultaneously the infrared lamp continually generates thermal energy that is transferred to the soil column along the temperature gradient providing the driving force for water salt transport within the soil in contrast numerical simulation primarily relied on a heat source placed on the top of the soil column to simulate test conditions which yielded favorable results fig 9 reveals that the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere near the surface of the soil column remained stable at approximately 45 c the soil column does not keep warming up because the temperature at the top of the column will be in equilibrium with the atmosphere within a specific temperature range observations of soil columns a and b indicate that the column with higher salt content exhibited a faster temperature response after exposure to the same amount of radiation for the same duration due to the presence of salt in the soil which increases its specific heat capacity and enables it to absorb more heat fig 9 illustrates a high degree of consistency between the model and experimental results 3 2 variation of volumetric water content along height after 11 days of infrared light exposure the volumetric water content curve of the soil column was plotted by measuring the water content of soil samples at various heights in the column on multiple occasions fig 10 shows the volumetric water content for the eleventh day of the indoor tests and numerical simulation for the purposes of this study soil layers with a water content of less than 10 are defined as dry soil layers while those with a water content greater than or equal to 10 are referred to as wet soil layers fig 10 illustrates that the initial moisture content of soil columns a and b was 35 moisture content in the upper 15 cm of the columns was very low ranging from 3 to 7 while the moisture content at the bottom of the columns was concentrated around 35 the water content distribution patterns of soil columns a and b are similar and the observed thickness of the dry soil layer after the test corresponds well to the water content distribution it is noteworthy that soil moisture content is higher at a depth of 2 13 cm with higher salinity levels corresponding to higher moisture content this phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of salt ions in the liquid water which increases the potential energy of the water and its dynamic viscosity leading to a decrease in flow rate and an increase in the soil s water holding capacity the water content of the wet soil layer during evaporation is highest in the soil column with the highest salt content as the presence of salt in the soil increases its water holding capacity the consistency between the experimental pattern and the numerical simulation results is apparent from fig 10 where the volumetric water content remains constant below the entire middle of the soil column under recharge conditions whereas above the middle of the column it rapidly decreases due to the effect of evaporation the indoor test had limitations and as a result the volumetric water content of the soil column was only recorded on the last day however this limitation was well compensated for by the numerical simulation fig 11 shows the variation of soil column moisture along the height in the numerical simulation while comparing it with the experimental phenomena the findings depicted in fig 11 reveal that during evaporation the pores of the soil experience compression from the surrounding soil resulting in the formation of cracks on the upper surface the cracks were formed around the barrel wall near the soil column because the barrel wall was fixed and the topsoil contracted radially due to evaporation so the cracks occurred around the barrel wall fig 11 also shows the development of cracks on the upper surface of each soil column at 1 3 and 11 days under infrared light as depicted in fig 11 the cracks developed rapidly on days 1 and 3 while the cracks on day 11 did not show significant differences from those formed on day 3 this suggests that evaporation from the upper surface of the soil column had mainly ceased by day 4 and the evaporation surface had shifted downward combining the numerical simulation results with the experimental data it can be observed that the volumetric water content of the upper half of the soil column dissipates rapidly in the first three days and slows down after the third day this volumetric water content trend also coincides with the experimental phenomenon which supports the conjecture that evaporation basically stops on the fourth day this also conforms to the general pattern of the evaporation stage on day 11 it was observed that some soil columns still had moist patches on their upper surface indicating that water was retained on the surface during evaporation moist patches were observed on the upper surface of some soil columns on day 11 which suggests that water may have remained trapped in some closed pores within the soil or that water vapor adhered to the upper surface of the soil column during upward movement resulting in the formation of a wet spot the difference in salt content between soil columns a and b did not have a significant effect on the development of the surface it is theoretically expected that a higher salt content in the soil would result in a lower rate of liquid water evaporation within the soil column which could potentially affect the development of cracks however this phenomenon was not observed in the tests and the difference in salt content between the soil columns a and b did not have a significant effect on crack development the numerical simulation results indicate that the volumetric water content of the soil column decreases with time along the height and the moisture dissipates more rapidly closer to the soil column surface furthermore the rate of water dissipation at the top of the soil column shown in fig 11 indicates that the evaporation rate of water is relatively high when the temperature is rising rapidly at the same time the variation of water content in the whole volume can verify that the higher the salt content of the soil proposed in the test phenomenon the stronger its water holding capacity 3 3 salt concentration varies along the height salt transport during the process of soil salinization is intrinsically linked to the flow of liquid water fig 12 depicts the variation of concentration along the height of a soil column following 11 days of irradiation alongside the corresponding numerical simulation results for both the concentration profile and the temporal variation of salt content along the height of the column these simulation results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between water flow and salt transport in the soil highlighting the significance of temporal and spatial variations in salinity concentration as a function of soil depth from fig 12 the irradiated soil column concentrations show an overall increasing trend compared to the initial values this indicates that the concentration of salt in the soil column increases as water evaporates and migrates towards the top of the soil column the experimental results indicate that the distribution of salt concentration follows an overall trend of being higher at both ends and lower in the middle the higher the initial salt content the more noticeable this phenomenon is the higher concentration at the top 19 cm of the soil column could be attributed to the high temperature gradient at the top of the column the intense evaporation leading to high water salt migration efficiency in the column and the rapid evaporation of water leading to salt crystallization at the top the simulation results indicate that the model is consistent with the experimental results in terms of the salt migration pattern it is worth noting that the deviation of the simulation results from the experiment is more significant in the soil columns with higher salt concentrations compared to those with lower concentrations one possible reason for the discrepancy between the simulation and experimental results is that the simulation model only considers salt crystallization and pore resistance in the high concentration soil columns while other factors such as adsorption and reaction may also play a role in the actual test as a result the simulation results may be overestimated compared to the experimental data at the same time it can be observed that the soil columns with different salt concentrations vary in their overall concentration pattern is worth analyzing the overall concentration variation value in the soil column with a small initial concentration is smaller than the overall concentration of the column with a large initial concentration because in the case of concentration less than the solubility the salt dissolved in water forms a non saturated solution therefore in the case of a concentration below the solubility limit each transport carries a lower amount of salt while for concentrations above the solubility limit each transport carries a saturated solution leading to a larger variation of concentration in the entire column the numerical simulation of salt migration over time in fig 12 demonstrates that the overall salt change reaches its peak after 7 days regardless of the initial salt concentration this can be explained in conjunction with the volumetric water content dissipation diagram as salt is transported along with water however the salt concentration becomes more prominent during water evaporation showing a lag in salt concentration change the simulation results match well with the experimental data indicating that the model is well suited for the study overall the simulation results demonstrate that the water heat salt migration pattern of the model is consistent with the experimental results however some differences between the two could be attributed to possible errors in the simulation and the experiment itself the constructed coupled water heat salt model makes idealized assumptions in many aspects some special effects and phenomena that may occur in the experiment such as hygroscopicity of soil minerals solutes being adsorbed in the soil etc are ignored in addition the one dimensional model does not account for axial variation in the soil columns which may lead to some discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results despite these differences the model was able to calculate the spatial and temporal variation of liquid water volumetric content temperature and solute concentration in saline lands under evaporative conditions addressing these issues is critical to improving the accuracy of the model further therefore more in depth improvements are needed in the following model studies 3 4 water and salt model validation discussion the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of different salinity levels on temperature gradients in soils fig 9 illustrates that the model aligns with the experimental data in terms of temperature gradient variation and reveals minimal impact of salt content on temperature gradient this paper does not delve into a detailed analysis of temperature measurement errors rather the focus is on exploring the impact of salt content changes during evaporation on salt transport patterns in water to verify the validity of the model root mean square error rmse was employed rmse is a method used to measure the magnitude of the error between the predicted and true values the smaller the value of rmse the more accurate the forecasting model compared to other measures of forecast error e g mae rmse is more sensitive and more indicative of large errors between forecast and true values the rmse values for soil column a under evaporation were 8 1 and 0 58 for volumetric water content and concentration respectively for soil column b the rmse values were 8 9 and 2 0 for volumetric water content and concentration respectively fig 13 presents the measured and simulated values plotted on the 1 1 line it can be seen from fig 13 that in the part of the soil column above about 15 cm the evaporation front the difference between the measured and simulated water content values is relatively significant possible reasons for this discrepancy include the gradual drying of the soil on the upper side of the evaporation front during the experiment and the resulting differences in thermal conduction characteristics compared to the lower part of the soil the variation of the thermal conduction characteristics of the soil was not considered in the numerical model the overall rmse values indicate that the model performs significantly better in simulating concentration compared to volumetric water content considering the salt content it can be seen that soil columns with low salt content are more stable in comparison the model s consideration of solute crystallization may have contributed to this observation as it is less affected by changes in salt phase state in soils with lower salinity consequently the model s simulations of water salt migration patterns in these soils are more consistent with the experimental results in highly saline soils the presence of salt crystals can significantly affect permeability by filling the pores while also altering the dynamic viscosity of the soil numerical validation results indicate that the water salt migration pattern in highly saline soils is considerably more complex the rmse error values for water salts fall within reasonable limits confirming the model s validity and applicability 4 conclusion to investigate the water salt migration behavior in saline soils with varying salt content under evaporation conditions a one dimensional transient mathematical model that considers the coupling of water heat and salt was developed the model is based on principles of mass conservation energy conservation darcy s law the ideal gas law and surface energy balance the distribution results of the simulated temperature moisture and salt fields of the soils are analyzed and discussed and compared to those obtained in indoor tests the following conclusions were drawn by comparing and analyzing the results with those obtained from the indoor tests 1 throughout the process of evaporation a temperature gradient formed along the height of the soil column which facilitated the migration of water and salt the temperature variation was most pronounced at the onset of irradiation the rate of temperature increase was found to be directly proportional to the salt content of the soil the changes in volumetric water content were found to be most concentrated in the surface layer of the soil at a depth of 4 6 cm the simulation results in conjunction with experimental observations suggest that evaporation nearly ceased by the third day of irradiation with the evaporation surface gradually moving downwards the water holding capacity of the soil increased with an increase in salinity content 2 the concentration changes in the soil column demonstrated that salt accumulates in the areas near the bottom recharge and the top surface during soil water salt migration moreover the salt concentration tends to be higher at the ends of the soil column and lower in the middle the concentration changes in soil with high initial salt content are more pronounced compared to soil with low salt content however there is a lag in the concentration changes compared to moisture changes 3 the numerical model addresses the limitation of real time monitoring of volumetric water content and salinity changes during the experiment the model s results were also compared and analyzed with the experimental results the comparison showed that the model was able to simulate the water and salt transport patterns of saline soil under evaporation conditions more accurately than the experiment alone credit authorship contribution statement

1876,identifying the spatio temporal variation in water use by co occurring species in mixed forests can determine whether there is hydrological niche partitioning or niche overlapping i e whether plant co occurrence brings about resource complementation or interspecific competition and provides a reference for plantation management water stable isotopic compositions in precipitation soil and four plants xylem and leaf in ecological and economic forests and hydrometeorological factors were continuously monitored for a year and the water uptake by plants was determined using a bayesian mixsir model the isotopic compositions of soil water and plant water in the ecological forest camphora camphora and cunninghamia lanceolate and economic forest castanea mollissima and camellia pitardii showed similar seasonal variation and no significant difference between their mean isotopic values was found p 0 05 the isotopic compositions in leaf water of different plants in the two forests were controlled by xylem water isotope and meteorological factors rather than soil moisture conditions with decreasing soil water availability the water sources of c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii changed from shallow to deep while the water use pattern of c mollissima was insensitive to changing soil moisture conditions the water source overlapping between c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest might generate water resource competition during the dry period limiting their ecological functions on the other hand the water source partitioning between c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest facilitated the water resource allocation our study suggested that the overlapping and partitioning of hydrological niches among species in mixed forests were species specific and provided a scientific basis for fully exploiting the ecological and economic benefits of silviculture ecosystems keywords plant water use convergence seasonal drought

play an important role in maintaining the water and energy balance of terrestrial ecosystems dai et al 2023 zhang et al 2020 as the largest land water flux plant transpiration accounts for 80 90 of land evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 water absorption by plants through their roots provides power for transpiration photosynthesis and metabolism zhao and wang 2021a however in the context of global warming both the intensity and frequency of droughts will increase in the future bello et al 2019 yang et al 2015 which has a great impact on the hydrological cycle of forest ecosystems water availability is the basic condition for plants to maintain cell turgidity allow cell growth and keep stomata open for physiological activities brinkmann et al 2018 thus it is one of the vital factors that determine the evolution direction of plant characteristics and species distribution in an ecosystem brum et al 2019 studies have shown that subtropical regions controlled by subtropical high

2016 and reducing forest ecosystem carbon fluxes saigusa et al 2010 xie et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to clarify the interaction between spatio temporal variations in plant water use and soil water resources under climate change for dynamic prediction of vegetation species and maintenance of ecosystem water balance grossiord et al 2019 west et al 2008 previous studies have found that plants can develop a variety of morphological and physiological regulatory mechanisms to adapt to changes in water availability under water stress moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 wang et al 2020 many plants can carry out dual morphological root transformation to obtain water i e shallow soil water is mainly absorbed by shallow roots in wet periods and deep soil water or groundwater is mainly absorbed by deep roots in dry periods barbeta et al 2015 dai et al 2020 liu et al 2019 it is generally believed that deep rooted plants tend to overcome seasonal drought stress more than shallow rooted plants that rely on recent precipitation dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in addition plants can mitigate the negative effects of drought by closing stomata reducing leaf water potential and improving water use efficiency ding et al 2021 in the course of community succession spatial and temporal heterogeneities of resources and environmental conditions promote niche separation which is conducive to the co occurrence of species wang et al 2020 during periods of drought or in arid ecosystems co occurring species are often assumed to rely on distinct water use strategies to avoid water competition and achieve a reasonable spatio temporal allocation of resources to improve productivity schwendenmann et al 2015 or to survive severe drought conditions moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 yang et al 2015 according to the view of niche complementarity in mixed species ecosystems there is less competition between species for resources and physiological activities such as transpiration and photosynthesis can be maintained at higher levels than in single species environments bello et al 2019 grossiord et al 2014 schwendenmann et al 2015 niche separation of co occurring plants has been observed in various ecosystems such as afforestation ecosystems on the loess plateau tang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 rocky mountainous ecosystems liu et al 2019 tropical rainforest ecosystems brum et al 2019 desert ecosystems tiemuerbieke et al 2018 grassland ecosystems yang et al 2011 and other water limited ecosystems bello et al 2019 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 instead water competition caused by niche overlapping of co occurring plants was observed in subtropical coniferous forest ecosystems yang et al 2015 the loess plateau afforestation ecosystems tang et al 2018 and temperate mixed coniferous broadleaved forest ecosystems grossiord et al 2014 although many studies have shown that co occurring plants have complementary resources or interspecific competition in different ecosystems it is still unclear which plant co occurrence acts as facilitators or inhibitors in the new phase of artificial vegetation regeneration the mixed species pattern was considered to be a good choice because biodiversity was one of the important factors to improve ecosystem productivity stability resilience and nutrient dynamics gong et al 2021 but unreasonable mixed planting may accelerate resource depletion gao et al 2018 in addition most previous studies have analyzed co occurrence between different species of the same life form which may bring about overlapping ecological niches more easily than those with different life forms therefore it was necessary to study the occurrence of different life forms which required us to fill the knowledge gap of temporal and spatial variation of water use of co occurring species in a mixed forest as a natural tracer stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen 2h 18o have been widely used to identify the spatio temporal variation of plant water use

soil water movement and groundwater recharge mechanisms gazis and feng 2004 zhao and wang 2021b past studies generally assumed that except for individual halophytes and xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and sternberg 1993 isotopic fractionation does not occur in plant root water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 by comparing the isotopic composition of plant xylem water with that of potential water sources it is possible to determine the depth of water absorption by plants bello et al 2019 moreover the absorption proportion of plants to potential water sources can be quantitatively calculated based on the isotopic mass conservation method phillips and gregg 2003 rong et al 2011 the analysis of the relationship between plant root water uptake patterns and soil water availability could provide some references for determining the adaptation mechanisms of plants in future climate change due to the differences in root distribution as well as physiological structure the root water uptake patterns of different plants may not respond consistently to varying water availability however limited by the cost of isotope measurements insufficient sampling frequency in previous studies of plant water use strategies has often constrained the quantitative analysis of root water uptake patterns of different plants in relation to soil water availability plant leaves the medium for water vapor exchange between plants and the atmosphere provide an important place for the water carbon cycle in the ecosystem and the variation of water stable isotope can directly communicate the material and energy connection between plant leaf interior and exterior kahmen et al 2009 although soil water and plant xylem water stable isotopes enabled the investigation of co occurring plant root water uptake patterns this water use process did not involve the release of water back to the atmosphere through the plant atmosphere interface complementarily the leaf water isotopic composition was a good record of this hydrological process as reflected in the leaf water isotope enrichment relative to plant water sources the investigation of the isotopic variation characteristics of plant leaf water can help to reveal plant growth environment and ecological information such as temperature zhou et al 2011 relative humidity barbour and farquhar 2000 vapor pressure deficit li et al 2006 and transpiration rate sheshshayee et al 2005 and stomatal conductance farquhar et al 2007 temperature determines the equilibrium fractionation effect relative humidity affects leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration rate farquhar et al 2007 stomatal conductance influences transpiration rate and kinetic fractionation effect cernusak et al 2008 while transpiration rate has an impact on leaf water turnover rate lee et al 2007 however relatively few comparative studies have been conducted in the past on the water isotopic characteristics of leaves of different plants in the same climatic zone or growing environment and the drivers of isotopic composition although these studies have contributed to an enhanced understanding of the physiological ecological properties among different plants in this study an ecological forest created by camphora camphora and cunninghamia lanceolate and an economic forest constructed by castanea mollissima and camellia pitardii were selected as experimental sites in the subtropical monsoon region all four species are widespread in the subtropical monsoon zone c camphora and c lanceolate are evergreen broadleaf and evergreen coniferous trees respectively making them excellent urban greenery and shade trees dai et al 2022 wang et al 2021 c mollissima is a deciduous tree and its fruit is one of the important sources of income for local farmers zhang et al 2022 c pitardii is an evergreen shrub which is a traditional chinese ornamental flower and also has high therapeutic and medicinal values li et al 2013 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water and leaf water of the four common plants mentioned above representing a wide range of biological species and life types including trees and shrubs broadleaf and coniferous plants and evergreen and deciduous plants and hydrometeorological variables were observed at semi monthly time scale from october 2018 to september 2019 and plant root distribution was analyzed the objectives of the study were to 1 compare the isotopic compositions of soil water and plant xylem water in mixed forests 2 determine the characteristics and driving factors of leaf water isotope 3 explore the water use strategies of co occurring plants in the ecological and economic forests under varying water conditions we hypothesized that co occurring plants in the ecological and economic forests both differed in the water use strategies which results in their hydrological niche partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site is located in the suburban area of changsha city hunan province 28 22 09 n 112 45 43 e altitude of 50 m which is a low hill slope with relatively flat topography and a slope of 3 under the influence of the east asian monsoon the climate of the study area is well defined in four seasons the multi year average precipitation is 1380 mm 2010 2019 and there is an obvious seasonal difference in precipitation during the year precipitation is usually highest in may or june in summer july august and autumn september october precipitation tends to be lower than potential evapotranspiration making it a vulnerable period for seasonal drought wang et al 2016 the multi year average temperature is 17 4 the annual frost free period is 272 d and the plant growing period is 330 d the soil is red loam with a chalky clay loam texture the vegetation types are largely mixed ecological forests of c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forests of c mollissima and c pitardii the planting densities of the tree c camphora c lanceolate and c mollissima and shrub species were 800 and 1500 ind hm 2 respectively their basic information is shown in table 1 2 2 sample and data collection a 20 20 m2 plot in each of the artificial ecological and economic forests was selected as a long term monitoring sample site the spatial distance between the selective two forests was 100 m and their topographic conditions and soil physicochemical properties are assumed consistent plant xylem leaf soil and precipitation samples were collected from october 2018 to september 2019 the sampling frequency was 1 to 3 times per month for a total of 23 times to avoid precipitation disturbance samples were generally collected within 3 10 days after precipitation three well grown individual plants were selected for sampling in each species on each sampling date plant xylem samples with three replicates for each species were obtained by cutting suberized twigs 4 6 cm in length and 0 3 0 5 cm in diameter from the south then the outer bark and phloem tissue were removed from these twigs and the xylem was immediately placed into 12 ml glass bottles for leaf samples three replicates for each species mature and healthy leaves from the twigs of the sample plants were cut and mixed and quickly filled into glass bottles for soil samples two soil cores of 130 cm depth were drilled using a mechanical auger near the sample plants in each of the two forests the intervals of 5 cm and 10 cm were taken at 0 20 cm and 20 130 cm depths respectively and fresh soil samples were quickly packed into glass bottles both plant and soil samples were sealed with parafilm after bottling numbered and brought back to the laboratory for storage 15 we collected a total of 276 xylem samples 276 leaf samples and 1380 soil samples during the study period both plant and soil samples were extracted with a cryogenic vacuum distillation extraction system li 2100 lica inc china for plant xylem water leaf water and soil water to be measured for isotopic compositions comparison with the oven drying method revealed that the water extraction rate of these samples was 99 so the soil samples were weighed before and after extraction to calculate the soil gravimetric water content swc precipitation samples were collected continuously in the study area by a rain collector modified by a siphon rain gauge for precipitation 0 1 mm one sample was taken at 08 00 or 20 00 beijing time on the day of precipitation and the samples were packed into 30 ml polyethylene bottles sealed numbered and stored 4 we collected a total of 262 precipitation samples during the study period a soil auger with an inner diameter of 40 mm and a length of 150 cm was used to collect the root system of each sample plant the collection location was 0 5 m from the main stem of each plant and one soil column was drilled every 30 in the counterclockwise direction to reduce the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the root collection root sampling depth was the same as the soil sampling depth and the sampling interval was every 10 cm it was notable that in the ecological forest the roots of c camphora have a camphor odor but cunninghamia lanceolate does not in the economic forest the roots of c mollissima are darker in color and larger in diameter and root length than those of c pitardii the collected roots were selected into sealed bags numbered and left for indoor processing for indoor processing the roots were cleaned and picked out of the debris the fine roots 2 mm in diameter were picked out placed in paper bags dried at 105 for 24 h until the mass was constant weighed and entered into the data for analysis meteorological factors such as air temperature t relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs w m 2 were long term monitored by a micro automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa installed in an open space 50 m away from the sample site the monitoring frequency was every 30 min vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was obtained from empirical equations for t and rh hayat et al 2020 tetens 1930 1 vpd 0 611 exp 17 27 t 237 3 t 1 r h 2 3 isotopic analysis all water samples were filtered and the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions were determined using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer dlt iwa 35ep lgr usa the measured stable isotope abundances are expressed as stable isotope ratios relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 2 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 where rsample and rv smow represent the stable isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o in water samples and standard mean ocean water respectively hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o were measured with a precision of 0 6 and 0 2 respectively spectral contamination correction of raw xylem and leaf water isotope data is required due to the presence of alcoholic organic matter in both plant xylem and leaf water that affects isotope measuring while spectral contamination of organic matter in precipitation and soil water samples is negligible luo et al 2019 schultz et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 methanol and ethanol are the main organic contaminants in extracted water samples and can be corrected for measured isotopic values by establishing a calibration curve schultz et al 2011 first according to wu et al 2014 we determined the isotopic values of methanol and ethanol water samples with known concentrations then the spectral contamination of the water samples was identified and quantified using the contamination identification lwia sci post processing software and finally the calibration curves were established in this study we found only methanol contamination in the xylem water and leaf water of the selected plants with the following error correction equation 3 δ δ 2 h 0 38 ln n b 2 1 05 ln n b 2 26 p 0 001 4 δ δ 18 o 0 21 ln n b 2 0 45 ln n b 0 98 p 0 001 where δδ2h and δδ18o represent the errors in isotope values due to methanol contamination respectively nb is a narrow band coefficient and varies with the type of water sample which mainly reflects the degree of methanol contamination in the water sample the corrected stable isotope values are the measured values minus the error values schultz et al 2011 2 4 potential water source partitioning a bayesian mixture model mixsir 1 0 4 was used to calculate the proportion of plant water uptake to each potential water source based on the principle of isotopic mass conservation dai et al 2020 moore and semmens 2008 tang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the model takes into account the variability and isotopic fractionation of the isotopic signal of plant xylem water and potential water sources wang et al 2019 with the following equation 5 δ p σ p i 1 n f i δ s i σ s i 6 1 i 1 n f i where δp and δs i are the δ2h or δ18o of plant xylem water and potential water sources respectively and σp and σ s i are the standard deviation of δ2h or δ18o of plant xylem water and potential water sources respectively i denotes the ith water source n denotes the total number of water sources fi denotes the proportion of plant use of the ith water source since the farmers did not irrigate the plants in the experimental site and the water table within the forests estimated from the farmers groundwater well was 18 m the source of water for plants in the two forests was soil water for the subsequent analysis and comparison the plant water sources were divided into the surface 0 10 cm shallow 10 40 cm middle 40 80 cm and deep 80 130 cm layers according to the variability in isotopic compositions and swc of the soil water wang et al 2020 four layers were identified by the following wu et al 2022 1 surface layer had the most variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was most susceptible to rainfall pulses and evaporation 2 shallow layer had relatively large variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was vulnerable to heavy rainfall events and strong evaporation 3 middle layer had lower variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc than shallow layer 4 deep layer had relatively stable variations in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was poorly influenced by precipitation and evaporation then the mean and standard deviation of δ2h and δ18o in soil water of different soil layers and xylem water for each plant c camphora c lanceolate c mollissima and c pitardii were entered into the mixsir model in the form of data files mix data txt mean source txt and sd source txt the fractionation factor was set to 0 in the corresponding data file mean frac txt and sd frac txt because plants in this study area do not undergo isotopic fractionation during water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 before running the mixsir model we should ensure that the matlab run time library files and mixsir program are correctly installed the number of model iterations was set to 1 000 000 in the graphical user interface gui of mixsir finally the posterior probability density distribution of the proportion of plant uptake by each potential water source was output and averaged in the analysis of the results 2 5 statistics analysis the line conditioned excess lc excess in the water pools is often used to observe isotopic fractionation in hydrological components subject to the relative difference between 2h and 18o fractionation at non equilibrium landwehr et al 2014 sprenger et al 2017 with the following equation 7 lc e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line lmwl originated from craig 1961 calculated from δ2h versus δ18o in precipitation during the observation period in the study area more negative values of lc excess indicate that the isotope of this water pool is subject to greater fractionation sprenger et al 2017 water absorption plasticity is quantified using the coefficient variation sd mean of the uptake proportion of each water source liu et al 2021 the mean and sd are the average proportion and standard deviation of plant water uptake to a particular water source during the observation period plants with greater water absorption plasticity are more flexible in switching water sources in variable water conditions song et al 2022 statistical analysis of data was performed using spss 22 software ibm usa the lsd the least significant difference test in anova was used to analyze the differences in swc δ2h δ18o and lc excess in different water pools and the proportion of water use by different plants the significance of pearson s correlation coefficient in the correlation analysis was tested using the t test 3 results 3 1 root distribution of different plants the root distributions of c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest and c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest tend to decrease with increasing depth fig 1 the percentage of root systems of c camphora in the ecological forest is 49 1 34 1 and 16 8 in the depths of 0 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 130 cm respectively while the distribution of deeper root systems of c lanceolate increased compared with that of c camphora with 26 6 in the depth of 80 130 cm the root distributions of c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest are similar both concentrate in 0 40 cm and their root proportions are 74 1 and 66 4 respectively 3 2 hydrometeorological conditions the total precipitation in the study area during the observation period october 2018 to september 2019 is 1326 3 mm of which the highest cumulative precipitation is 247 7 mm in may followed by 210 4 mm in june however the cumulative precipitation from august to september is only 9 5 mm fig 2 a the average t varies within the range of 2 6 to 33 3 with the lowest average t of 4 0 in january and the highest average t of 30 8 in august and the accumulation of 42 d of hot weather with the average t exceeding 30 during august to september when precipitation is scarce fig 2a with increasing depth the seasonal variabilities of swc in both ecological and economic forests tend to decrease with the greatest range of variation in surface swc 16 2 33 9 and 13 3 34 8 respectively fig 2b c the swcs of the entire soil profile in both ecological and economic forests are at low values from august to september fig 2b c and the average swc 1sd from 0 to 130 cm during this period is 20 8 1 7 and 20 0 3 2 both significantly lower than that in other periods of 27 8 2 4 and 27 5 2 5 p 0 05 statistics show that there is no significant difference between the mean values of swc in the two forests p 0 05 combining the characteristics of meteorological elements and swc in the sample sites august to september 2019 is defined as the dry period and the other times as the wet period in this study to further explore plant water use in the ecological and economic forests under different moisture conditions 3 3 isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and xylem water influenced by the source of water vapor in the monsoon region the precipitation isotope in the study area exhibits obvious seasonal variation during the observation period with δ2h and δ18o ranging from 89 1 to 25 5 and 12 6 to 1 8 respectively fig 2d and the precipitation weighted average values of 26 1 22 7 and 5 3 2 6 where the maximum and minimum monthly values occur in march and july respectively the lmwl is δ2h 8 55δ18o 19 61 r2 0 96 p 0 001 during the observation period similar to the findings of luo et al 2019 the δ2h δ18o scatters of soil water and different plant xylem water in both ecological and economic forests are distributed below the lmwl and only the δ2h δ18o scatter of surface soil water deviates substantially from the lmwl during the dry period fig 3 the variation ranges of δ2h and δ18o in soil water in the ecological forest are 69 3 to 6 5 and 9 6 to 2 5 respectively fig 3a and that in the economic forest are 70 9 to 4 4 and 9 5 to 2 5 respectively fig 3b statistics show that δ2h and δ18o values in soil water at the same depth do not differ significantly p 0 05 between the two forests additionally a similar linear relationship of δ2h δ18o for soil water swl at each depth between the two forests is also found fig 3 the δ2h δ18o scatter of xylem water of four plants matches the distribution area of soil water isotope verifying that no significant isotopic fractionation occurs in these plants during root water uptake as well as water transport the seasonal variations of δ2h and δ18o in soil water are similar between the ecological and economic forests at the same depth fig 4 a d the maximum and minimum isotopic values of soil water at the surface layer appear in april and july while the peak values of soil water isotopes in other layers are delayed with increasing depth indicating a certain lag between different soil layers in precipitation recharge and infiltration processes the range of variation in δ2h and δ18o for soil water decreased gradually with increasing depth during the observation period fig 4a d the δ2h and δ18o in xylem water of four plants from the two forests have similar seasonal variations fig 4a d with the maximum value in april may and the minimum value in october the mean δ2h and δ18o values in xylem water of plants in the ecological and economic forests range from 38 7 to 34 7 and from 6 2 to 5 7 respectively and none of them are significantly different p 0 05 from the wet to dry period the isotopic values in xylem water of each plant except c mollissima in the economic forest gradually transition from close to that in shallow soil water to close to that in middle and deep soil water fig 4a d seasonal variations of lc excess in soil water and xylem water are not obvious except for surface soil water fig 4e f the lower lc excess values for surface soil water appear in the dry period the lc excess in xylem water of different plants ranges from 13 1 to 0 8 which is within the variation range of lc excess in soil water fig 4e f 3 4 isotopic composition of leaf water and its driving factors the seasonal variations of δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests converge with the highest values occurring in april but the lowest values of δ2h and δ18o occurred in july and december respectively fig 5 a b the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of plants in the two forests vary from 2 1 to 4 1 and 6 3 to 7 6 respectively and they are not significantly different from each other p 0 05 the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in leaf water are significantly enriched compared to the xylem water isotope p 0 05 the seasonal patterns of lc excess in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests are similar in contrast to those of δ2h and δ18o fig 5 the mean lc excess values in leaf water of different plants vary from 60 8 to 42 3 which is not significantly different between them p 0 05 but significantly lower than lc excess in xylem water p 0 05 the correlations of δ2h δ18o and lc excess in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests with the driving factors meteorological conditions swc and corresponding xylem water isotope are listed in table 2 both δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of all plants show a highly significant negative correlation with rh p 0 01 and δ18o in leaf water shows a significant positive correlation with both rs and vpd p 0 05 both δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of all plants show a weak correlation with swc at different depths p 0 05 in addition leaf water δ2h and xylem water δ2h of all plants show a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the lc excess in leaf water of all plants shows a significant positive correlation with rh p 0 05 and a significant negative correlation with both rs and vpd p 0 05 3 5 plant water source partitioning and water absorption plasticity in the ecological forest the main water source for c camphora and c lanceolate is surface soil water from december to may with an average water uptake proportion of 49 5 14 0 and 50 7 10 6 respectively fig 6 a b in june july and october november the uptake proportion of surface soil water by c camphora and c lanceolate decreases significantly while the uptake proportion of middle and deep soil water both increases somewhat making the absorption proportion of each water source relatively even in this period in august september dry period c camphora and c lanceolate mainly utilize deep soil water with an average uptake proportion of 33 3 6 1 and 42 8 6 4 respectively followed by the middle soil water in the economic forest the uptake proportion of each water source except the surface layer by c mollissima is relatively even in different months during the observation period the defoliation period is not observed fig 6c and the average uptake proportion of surface shallow middle and deep soil water is 18 7 6 1 25 1 7 8 27 5 4 8 and 28 7 9 3 respectively with no significant differences among them p 0 05 in contrast to the water use strategy of c mollissima the main water source for c pitardii is surface or shallow soil water from november to may and its average water uptake proportion is 50 5 16 3 and 31 9 19 1 respectively in june july and october the uptake proportion by c pitardii for surface soil water decreases significantly and the uptake proportion for each water source is relatively even during the dry period the main water source for c pitardii is deep soil water with an average uptake proportion of 39 4 3 9 followed by the middle soil water with an average uptake proportion of 29 0 0 2 in the ecological forest the water use strategies of c camphora and c lanceolate are largely the same mainly using surface soil water with an uptake proportion of 35 while in the economic forest the water use strategies of c mollissima and c pitardii are inconsistent fig 7 a specifically c mollissima absorbs a smaller proportion of shallow soil water 19 and is more dependent on other water sources however c pitardii mainly absorbs surface soil water 38 followed by shallow soil water 28 the water absorption plasticity of four plants is in order c pitardii 59 1 13 6 c lanceolate 48 5 9 7 c camphora 42 4 9 3 c mollissima 28 3 7 3 indicating that c lanceolate and c pitardii are more flexible in seasonal shifts of water sources in the ecological and economic forests respectively fig 7b the switch in plant water use sources is closely linked to the dynamics of swc fig 6 and fig 8 the absorption proportion of surface and shallow soil water by c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii is significantly positively correlated with swc p 0 05 and the absorption proportion of middle and deep soil water is significantly negatively correlated with swc p 0 05 which indicates that the main water absorption depth of the above three plants switch from 0 to 40 cm to depths below 40 cm as swc decreased however there is no significant correlation between the proportion of soil water uptake at all depths by c mollissima and swc p 0 05 according to the slope of the linear equation of water uptake proportion and swc fig 8 the water uptake by c lanceolate is more sensitive to varying soil moisture than c camphora in the ecological forest while the water uptake by c pitardii is more sensitive to varying soil moisture than c mollissima in the economic forest 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of isotopic compositions in soil water and xylem water based on 23 soil water and plant water isotope sampling activities during the observation period we found that δ2h and δ18o of soil water in the ecological and economic forests had similar seasonal variations and profile distributions fig 4 and there was no significant difference between the mean values p 0 05 this might be related to the similar hydro ecological environment of the two forests as they are geographically adjacent and essentially identical both in terms of topography and soil texture thus allowing for no differences in isotopic fractionation of soil water during precipitation infiltration as well as water redistribution sprenger et al 2017 and lyu et al 2021 suggested that the lc excess in soil water is an important indicator for determining the intensity of soil evaporation the lc excess in soil water was relatively stable during the observation period in both forests fig 4e f except for a significant decrease in surface soil during the dry period and was distinctly higher than in the dry area mccutcheon et al 2016 where the lc excess was below 20 this result reflected the weaker soil evaporation capacity of the forests in this study in addition the seasonal variation of swc was similar in both forests fig 2 and their mean values were not significantly different p 0 05 these results suggested that precipitation infiltration as well as water redistribution were similar between the two forests although c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest and c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest belonged to different living types table 1 none of their xylem water isotopic values were significant difference p 0 05 and similar results were found in pinus tabuliformis mixed forests with hippophae rhamnoides tang et al 2019 and in quercus petraea mixed with pinus sylvestris bello et al 2019 therefore the isotopic compositions of xylem water in different living plants did not necessarily differ and might converge under long term adaptation in the same habitat the use of isotopic techniques to identify plant water sources has been hampered by the increasing number of studies that have found isotopic offsets between xylem water and potential water sources i e xylem water cannot match any of the potential water sources in the dual isotopic space barbeta et al 2020 the isotopic deviation has been observed in field experiments in various biomes such as shrubs wang et al 2017 coniferous forests geris et al 2017 and broadleaf forests bowling et al 2017 however the isotope of xylem water and potential water source water matched well for different living plants in this study fig 3 which facilitated the comparison of water use strategies based on an isotopic approach since the uptake and transport of source water by a plant is widely recognized as an important component of the global water cycle chen et al 2020 future studies are highly warranted to examine the existence and causes of isotopic deviations of xylem water from source water in other plants in humid subtropical regions 4 2 isotopic fractionation and driving factors of leaf water plant leaf water is an essential aspect of the water cycle and understanding the isotopic composition of leaf water can help reveal its partitioning in the isotopic cycle of local water pools in this study leaf water isotope of all four plants was significantly enriched p 0 05 compared to xylem water isotope the larger the δ2h and δ18o in leaf water the smaller the lc excess in leaf water and the stronger the isotopic fractionation of leaf water fig 5 similar to xylem water isotope the differences in leaf water isotope were not significant p 0 05 among different plants in the ecological forest c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forest c mollissima and c pitardii indicating the convergence of leaf water isotope among multiple biological species and life types conifer broadleaf evergreen deciduous and tree shrub previous studies have shown that leaf water isotope is firstly affected by plant source water because plants absorb water from the soil through the root system for transpiration cernusak et al 2016 liu et al 2023 xylem water isotope can be used to characterize plant water source signals rothfuss and javaux 2017 when assuming that isotopic fractionation does not occur in plant root water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 both cernusak et al 2022 and liu et al 2023 found that leaf water δ2h was more closely correlated with xylem water isotope than leaf water δ18o which was consistent with our findings table 2 we found that all plants show a significant positive correlation between leaf water δ2h and xylem water δ2h p 0 05 and the correlation coefficients are greater than those between leaf water δ18o and xylem water δ18o the reasons may be that leaf water δ2h was ultimately influenced only by precipitation δ2h while leaf water δ18o was influenced by a mixture of precipitation δ18o and atmospheric factors o2 and co2 cernusak et al 2016 liu et al 2023 besides the effect of plant source water leaf water isotope was also related to ecological factors stomatal conductance and transpiration rate farquhar et al 2007 sheshshayee et al 2005 and environmental factors cernusak et al 2008 li et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 since stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were controlled by environmental factors kumagai et al 2008 hayat et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 this study examined the drive of external environmental factors on isotopic fractionation of leaf water in detail according to table 2 rh was significantly negatively correlated with δ2h and δ18o in leaf water p 0 01 for different plants with the σ slope of from 0 85 to 0 62 1 2h rh 1 and from 0 26 to 0 22 18o rh 1 respectively vpd was significantly positively correlated with δ18o in leaf water p 0 05 with the σ of 3 45 4 30 kpa 1 the findings were similar to those of barbour and farquhar 2000 farquhar and gan 2003 and butt et al 2010 when rh was larger and vpd was smaller the vapor pressure inside and outside the leaf is closed resulting in reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as the exchange of leaf water with canopy water vapor diminished the lower the isotopic fractionation in leaf water the smaller the δ2h and δ18o and vice versa similar to vpd rs showed significant positive correlations with δ18o in leaf water for different plants p 0 05 with the σ of 0 05 0 06 w m 2 rs might affect the isotopic fractionation of leaf water by influencing plant photosynthesis gillon and yakir 2000 guy et al 1993 it has been shown that isotopic fractionation of leaf water was related to t in addition to rh vpd and rs cooper and deniro 1989 dongmann et al 1974 zhou et al 2011 however cooper and deniro 1989 found that the response of leaf water isotope to t was not consistent across species and regions we only found a significant negative correlation between t and δ2h in leaf water of c camphora in the ecological forest p 0 05 with the σ of 2 98 1 while it did not appear in other plants moreover although soil water conditions were strongly associated with plant water use strategies fig 6 and fig 8 leaf water isotopes of different plants were less correlated with swc than meteorological factors rh vpd and rs 4 3 water resources apportionment in the ecological and economic forests a quantitative study of the water use sources under changing water conditions revealed that c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii can switch water sources flexibly through root dimorphism with decreasing swc from wet to dry periods these plants switched from mainly absorbing surface or shallow soil water to mainly using deep soil water similar to the findings of brinkmann et al 2019 yang et al 2015 and zhao and wang 2021a however the water uptake depth of c mollissima varied little under different moisture conditions and its uptake proportion to each water source except the surface layer was relatively even in different months fig 6 our findings rejected the original hypothesis in the ecological forest the water use strategies of c camphora and c lanceolate were convergent as shown by similar seasonal patterns of water use of them fig 6 similar average water uptake proportion to each source fig 7a water absorption plasticity without statistical differences p 0 05 fig 7b and similar water uptake proportion to each water source in relation to swc fig 8 the overlapping water use patterns among co occurring plants in the ecological forests may cause severe water competition with each other antunes et al 2019 peñuelas et al 2011 tang et al 2019 previous studies have found that soil and plant properties were essential factors affecting plant water use wang et al 2020 since soil properties were consistent in the ecological forest created by c camphora and c lanceolate the water source overlap between the two species was independent of soil properties rather plant properties e g fine root distribution height and stem diameter exerted a crucial effect on water use patterns of them in this study the root systems of both c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest were mainly distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer 73 with well developed lateral roots fig 1a moreover the two species had similar height and stem diameter table 1 however our findings were not consistent with the study of grossiord et al 2014 they found that coniferous trees had significantly deeper water uptake than broadleaved trees this difference may be related to distinct climatic and stand conditions as well as species specificity in contrast the water use strategies of c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest were divergent as evidenced by the contrasting seasonal patterns of water use fig 6 different mean water uptake proportion for each water source fig 7a different water uptake plasticity between them fig 7b and distinct water uptake proportion for each water source in relation to swc fig 8 the seasonal pattern of water use of c mollissima did not vary according to soil moisture conditions and the absorption proportion of soil water except for the surface layer was relatively even at all depths during the observation period even during the dry period resulting in its lower water uptake plasticity however the water use pattern of c pitardii was sensitive to swc and its water use sources underwent a shallow to deep transition from the wet to the dry period making it a higher water uptake plasticity on the one hand the differences in water use patterns of the two species might be related to their hydraulic strategies for adapting to changes in soil moisture studies have shown that species that tended to utilize more stable water sources from deep layer e g c mollissima often closed their stomata in response to water stress to prevent water loss while species that tended to utilize shallower water sources e g c pitardii usually maintained stomata open and allowed their water potentials to drop sharply with decreasing water availability to maintain physiological activities ding et al 2021 dubbert et al 2019 on the other hand the difference in phenology e g germination flowering and fruiting between c mollissima and c pitardii might also be responsible for the water source partitioning between them in the economic forest for example november to march was the deciduous period for c mollissima which coincided with the flowering period for c pitardii wu et al 2022 found that the mismatch between the phenology and water demand period led to differences in water use patterns between economic species in mixed forests 4 4 implications for forest management although subtropical monsoon regions receive more precipitation than arid and semi arid regions both long term meteorological data and climate models showed that the precipitation in the region was significantly reduced and the drought risk was increased song et al 2022 for example from early july to mid august 2013 the study area experienced a severe drought with frequent high temperatures which was the lowest mid summer precipitation and highest temperature in nearly 40 years luo et al 2016 to effectively evaluate the response of vegetation to climate change in the subtropical monsoon region in the future it is central to identify the water use patterns of co occurring plants in mixed species forests through the long term continuous sampling activity we found that there was hydrological niche overlapping and hydrological niche partitioning in the ecological forest and economic forest respectively water competition between c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest during the wet period was negligible due to relatively sufficient plant available water in the root zone soil fig 2b and their co occurrence might promote biodiversity and ecological functions of the community however during the dry period the persistent high temperature without precipitation in the study area led to soil water scarcity and then the similar water use patterns of c camphora and c lanceolate might lead to intense water competition studies have shown that severe seasonal drought in humid areas can be devastating to plants with weak drought tolerance luo et al 2016 song et al 2022 although some plants reduced water consumption during the dry period by regulating physiological structures such as closing stomata or defoliation these defenses undoubtedly limited productivity and ecological functions in addition the hydrological niche partitioning facilitated the resource allocation between c mollissima and c pitardii within the economic forest to achieve complementary coexistence or resist severe seasonal drought bello et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2019 martin gomez et al 2017 in artificial vegetation regeneration mixed plantation was often identified as a more suitable revegetation pattern than pure plantation due to improved ecosystem productivity stability resilience and nutrients gao et al 2018 gong et al 2021 although resource complementarity of co occurring plants in mixed forests was often expected competition for water resources due to niche overlapping between co occurring species was still found in some silvicultural ecosystems grossiord et al 2014 tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 therefore understanding which species co occurrence brought about facilitating or negative effects on artificial forest ecosystems was a meaningful research subject our study showed that the overlapping and partitioning of hydrological niches among species in mixed forests were species specific when selecting different plants for mixed plantations species with significantly distinct plant characteristics height stem diameter crown width etc and phenology should be considered to achieve spatial and temporal separation of water use patterns such as mixed tree shrub or mixed evergreen deciduous species planting our findings provided a scientific basis for fully exploiting the ecological and economic benefits and realizing sustainable development of silviculture ecosystems however this study lacked the observation of plant physiological indicators such as transpiration rate hydraulic characteristics photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance thus failing to closely integrate plant water use with plant physiological characteristics which made it difficult to systematically reveal the adaptation strategies of co occurring plants to seasonal drought and future climate change moreover we could not confirm that mixed species forests are more conducive to species adaptation to environmental changes than pure forests because the indicators of each species in pure forests were not observed therefore future studies on plant water use should combine multiple research methods and conduct diverse and multi site data observations 5 conclusions the water isotopes in different plants xylem and leaf tended to be consistent under long term adaptation in the same habitat leaf water isotope is significantly enriched compared to xylem water isotope for all the plants in the ecological forest c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forest c mollissima and c pitardii p 0 05 and leaf water isotope was driven by xylem water isotope and meteorological factors such as rh vpd and rs rather than soil water conditions although both c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest can switch water sources under changing moisture conditions there was a hydrological niche overlapping between them which might intensify water competition between them in the dry period additionally there was a hydrological niche partitioning between c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest the water absorption plasticity of c pitardii was larger than c mollissima p 0 05 the hydrological niche partitioning of c mollissima and c pitardii within the economic forest was conducive to water allocation and resistance to severe drought these findings suggested that plant water source partitioning was species specific in mixed forests and can provide scientific guidance

1876,identifying the spatio temporal variation in water use by co occurring species in mixed forests can determine whether there is hydrological niche partitioning or niche overlapping i e whether plant co occurrence brings about resource complementation or interspecific competition and provides a reference for plantation management water stable isotopic compositions in precipitation soil and four plants xylem and leaf in ecological and economic forests and hydrometeorological factors were continuously monitored for a year and the water uptake by plants was determined using a bayesian mixsir model the isotopic compositions of soil water and plant water in the ecological forest camphora camphora and cunninghamia lanceolate and economic forest castanea mollissima and camellia pitardii showed similar seasonal variation and no significant difference between their mean isotopic values was found p 0 05 the isotopic compositions in leaf water of different plants in the two forests were controlled by xylem water isotope and meteorological factors rather than soil moisture conditions with decreasing soil water availability the water sources of c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii changed from shallow to deep while the water use pattern of c mollissima was insensitive to changing soil moisture conditions the water source overlapping between c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest might generate water resource competition during the dry period limiting their ecological functions on the other hand the water source partitioning between c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest facilitated the water resource allocation our study suggested that the overlapping and partitioning of hydrological niches among species in mixed forests were species specific and provided a scientific basis for fully exploiting the ecological and economic benefits of silviculture ecosystems keywords plant water use convergence seasonal drought

land evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 water absorption by plants through their roots provides power for transpiration photosynthesis and metabolism zhao and wang 2021a however in the context of global warming both the intensity and frequency of droughts will increase in the future bello et al 2019 yang et al 2015 which has a great impact on the hydrological cycle of forest ecosystems water availability is the basic condition for plants to maintain cell turgidity allow cell growth and keep stomata open for physiological activities brinkmann et al 2018 thus it is one of the vital factors that determine the evolution direction of plant characteristics and species distribution in an ecosystem brum et al 2019 studies have shown that subtropical regions controlled by subtropical high pressure in the western pacific tend to experience high temperatures and droughts in summer he et al 2015 luo et al 2019 wen et al 2010 significantly affecting plant physiological behaviors luo et al 2016 and reducing forest ecosystem carbon fluxes saigusa et al 2010 xie et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to clarify the interaction between spatio temporal variations in plant water use and soil water resources under climate change for dynamic prediction of vegetation species and maintenance of ecosystem water balance grossiord et al 2019 west et al 2008 previous studies have found that plants can develop a variety of morphological and physiological regulatory mechanisms to adapt to changes in water availability under water stress moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 wang et al 2020 many plants can carry out dual morphological root transformation to obtain water i e shallow soil water is mainly absorbed by shallow roots in wet periods and deep soil water or groundwater is mainly absorbed by deep roots in dry periods barbeta et al 2015 dai et al 2020 liu et al 2019 it is generally believed that deep rooted plants tend to overcome seasonal drought stress more than shallow rooted plants that rely on recent precipitation dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in addition plants can mitigate the negative effects of drought by closing stomata reducing leaf water potential and improving water use efficiency ding et al 2021 in the course of community succession spatial and temporal heterogeneities of resources and environmental conditions promote niche separation which is conducive to the co occurrence of species wang et al 2020 during periods of drought or in arid ecosystems co occurring species are often assumed to rely on distinct water use strategies to avoid water competition and achieve a reasonable spatio temporal allocation of resources to improve productivity schwendenmann et al 2015 or to survive severe drought conditions moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 yang et al 2015 according to the view of niche complementarity in mixed species ecosystems there is less competition between species for resources and physiological activities such as transpiration and photosynthesis can be maintained at higher levels than in single species environments bello et al 2019 grossiord et al 2014 schwendenmann et al 2015 niche separation of co occurring plants has been observed in various ecosystems such as afforestation ecosystems on the loess plateau tang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 rocky mountainous ecosystems liu et al 2019 tropical rainforest ecosystems brum et al 2019 desert ecosystems tiemuerbieke et al 2018 grassland ecosystems yang et al 2011 and other water limited ecosystems bello et al 2019 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 instead water competition caused by niche overlapping of co occurring plants was observed in subtropical coniferous forest ecosystems yang et al 2015 the loess plateau afforestation ecosystems tang et al 2018 and temperate mixed coniferous broadleaved forest ecosystems grossiord et al 2014 although many studies have shown that co occurring plants have complementary resources or interspecific competition in different ecosystems it is still unclear which plant co occurrence acts as facilitators or inhibitors in the new phase of artificial vegetation regeneration the mixed species pattern was considered to be a good choice because biodiversity was one of the important factors to improve ecosystem productivity stability resilience and nutrient dynamics gong et al 2021 but unreasonable mixed planting may accelerate resource depletion gao et al 2018 in addition most previous studies have analyzed co occurrence between different species of the same life form which may bring about overlapping ecological niches more easily than those with different life forms therefore it was necessary to study the occurrence of different life forms which required us to fill the knowledge gap of temporal and spatial variation of water use of co occurring species in a mixed forest as a natural tracer stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen 2h 18o have been widely used to identify the spatio temporal variation of plant water use sources in various ecosystems ehleringer and dawson 1992 miguez macho and fan 2021 the mean transit times of different hydrological components in the critical zone dai et al 2022 sprenger et al 2019 soil water movement and groundwater recharge mechanisms gazis and feng 2004 zhao and wang 2021b past studies generally assumed that except for individual halophytes and xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and sternberg 1993 isotopic fractionation does not occur in plant root water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 by comparing the isotopic composition of plant xylem water with that of potential water sources it is possible to determine the depth of water absorption by plants bello et al 2019 moreover the absorption proportion of plants to potential water sources can be quantitatively calculated based on the isotopic mass conservation method phillips and gregg 2003 rong et al 2011 the analysis of the relationship between plant root water uptake patterns and soil water availability could provide some references for determining the adaptation mechanisms of plants in future climate change due to the differences in root distribution as well as physiological structure the root water uptake patterns of different plants may not respond consistently to varying water availability however limited by the cost of isotope measurements insufficient sampling frequency in previous studies of plant water use strategies has often constrained the quantitative analysis of root water uptake patterns of different plants in relation to soil water availability plant leaves the medium for water vapor exchange between plants and the atmosphere provide an important place for the water carbon cycle in the ecosystem and the variation of water stable isotope can directly communicate the material and energy connection between plant leaf interior and exterior kahmen et al 2009 although soil water and plant xylem water stable isotopes enabled the investigation of co occurring plant root water uptake patterns this water use process did not involve the release of water back to the atmosphere through the plant atmosphere interface complementarily the leaf water isotopic composition was a good record of this hydrological process as reflected in the leaf water isotope enrichment relative to plant water sources the investigation of the isotopic variation characteristics of plant leaf water can help to reveal plant growth environment and ecological information such as temperature zhou et al 2011 relative humidity barbour and farquhar 2000 vapor pressure deficit li et al 2006 and transpiration rate sheshshayee et al 2005 and stomatal conductance farquhar et al 2007 temperature determines the equilibrium fractionation effect relative humidity affects leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration rate farquhar et al 2007 stomatal conductance influences transpiration rate and kinetic fractionation effect cernusak et al 2008 while transpiration rate has an impact on leaf water turnover rate lee et al 2007 however relatively few comparative studies have been conducted in the past on the water isotopic characteristics of leaves of different plants in the same climatic zone or growing environment and the drivers of isotopic composition although these studies have contributed to an enhanced understanding of the physiological ecological properties among different plants in this study an ecological forest created by camphora camphora and cunninghamia lanceolate and an economic forest constructed by castanea mollissima and camellia pitardii were selected as experimental sites in the subtropical monsoon region all four species are widespread in the subtropical monsoon zone c camphora and c lanceolate are evergreen broadleaf and evergreen coniferous trees respectively making them excellent urban greenery and shade trees dai et al 2022 wang et al 2021 c mollissima is a deciduous tree and its fruit is one of the important sources of income for local farmers zhang et al 2022 c pitardii is an evergreen shrub which is a traditional chinese ornamental flower and also has high therapeutic and medicinal values li et al 2013 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water and leaf water of the four common plants mentioned above representing a wide range of biological species and life types including trees and shrubs broadleaf and coniferous plants and evergreen and deciduous plants and hydrometeorological variables were observed at semi monthly time scale from october 2018 to september 2019 and plant root distribution was analyzed the objectives of the study were to 1 compare the isotopic compositions of soil water and plant xylem water in mixed forests 2 determine the characteristics and driving factors of leaf water isotope 3 explore the water use strategies of co occurring plants in the ecological and economic forests under varying water conditions we hypothesized that co occurring plants in the ecological and economic forests both differed in the water use strategies which results in their hydrological niche partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site is located in the suburban area of changsha city hunan province 28 22 09 n 112 45 43 e altitude of 50 m which is a low hill slope with relatively flat topography and a slope of 3 under the influence of the east asian monsoon the climate of the study area is well defined in four seasons the multi year average precipitation is 1380 mm 2010 2019 and there is an obvious seasonal difference in precipitation during the year precipitation is usually highest in may or june in summer july august and autumn september october precipitation tends to be lower than potential evapotranspiration making it a vulnerable period for seasonal drought wang et al 2016 the multi year average temperature is 17 4 the annual frost free period is 272 d and the plant growing period is 330 d the soil is red loam with a chalky clay loam texture the vegetation types are largely mixed ecological forests of c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forests of c mollissima and c pitardii the planting densities of the tree c camphora c lanceolate and c mollissima and shrub species were 800 and 1500 ind hm 2 respectively their basic information is shown in table 1 2 2 sample and data collection a 20 20 m2 plot in each of the artificial ecological and economic forests was selected as a long term monitoring sample site the spatial distance between the selective two forests was 100 m and their topographic conditions and soil physicochemical properties are assumed consistent plant xylem leaf soil and precipitation samples were collected from october 2018 to september 2019 the sampling frequency was 1 to 3 times per month for a total of 23 times to avoid precipitation disturbance samples were generally collected within 3 10 days after precipitation three well grown individual plants were selected for sampling in each species on each sampling date plant xylem samples with three replicates for each species were obtained by cutting suberized twigs 4 6 cm in length and 0 3 0 5 cm in diameter from the south then the outer bark and phloem tissue were removed from these twigs and the xylem was immediately placed into 12 ml glass bottles for leaf samples three replicates for each species mature and healthy leaves from the twigs of the sample plants were cut and mixed and quickly filled into glass bottles for soil samples two soil cores of 130 cm depth were drilled using a mechanical auger near the sample plants in each of the two forests the intervals of 5 cm and 10 cm were taken at 0 20 cm and 20 130 cm depths respectively and fresh soil samples were quickly packed into glass bottles both plant and soil samples were sealed with parafilm after bottling numbered and brought back to the laboratory for storage 15 we collected a total of 276 xylem samples 276 leaf samples and 1380 soil samples during the study period both plant and soil samples were extracted with a cryogenic vacuum distillation extraction system li 2100 lica inc china for plant xylem water leaf water and soil water to be measured for isotopic compositions comparison with the oven drying method revealed that the water extraction rate of these samples was 99 so the soil samples were weighed before and after extraction to calculate the soil gravimetric water content swc precipitation samples were collected continuously in the study area by a rain collector modified by a siphon rain gauge for precipitation 0 1 mm one sample was taken at 08 00 or 20 00 beijing time on the day of precipitation and the samples were packed into 30 ml polyethylene bottles sealed numbered and stored 4 we collected a total of 262 precipitation samples during the study period a soil auger with an inner diameter of 40 mm and a length of 150 cm was used to collect the root system of each sample plant the collection location was 0 5 m from the main stem of each plant and one soil column was drilled every 30 in the counterclockwise direction to reduce the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the root collection root sampling depth was the same as the soil sampling depth and the sampling interval was every 10 cm it was notable that in the ecological forest the roots of c camphora have a camphor odor but cunninghamia lanceolate does not in the economic forest the roots of c mollissima are darker in color and larger in diameter and root length than those of c pitardii the collected roots were selected into sealed bags numbered and left for indoor processing for indoor processing the roots were cleaned and picked out of the debris the fine roots 2 mm in diameter were picked out placed in paper bags dried at 105 for 24 h until the mass was constant weighed and entered into the data for analysis meteorological factors such as air temperature t relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs w m 2 were long term monitored by a micro automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa installed in an open space 50 m away from the sample site the monitoring frequency was every 30 min vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was obtained from empirical equations for t and rh hayat et al 2020 tetens 1930 1 vpd 0 611 exp 17 27 t 237 3 t 1 r h 2 3 isotopic analysis all water samples were filtered and the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions were determined using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer dlt iwa 35ep lgr usa the measured stable isotope abundances are expressed as stable isotope ratios relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 2 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 where rsample and rv smow represent the stable isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o in water samples and standard mean ocean water respectively hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o were measured with a precision of 0 6 and 0 2 respectively spectral contamination correction of raw xylem and leaf water isotope data is required due to the presence of alcoholic organic matter in both plant xylem and leaf water that affects isotope measuring while spectral contamination of organic matter in precipitation and soil water samples is negligible luo et al 2019 schultz et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 methanol and ethanol are the main organic contaminants in extracted water samples and can be corrected for measured isotopic values by establishing a calibration curve schultz et al 2011 first according to wu et al 2014 we determined the isotopic values of methanol and ethanol water samples with known concentrations then the spectral contamination of the water samples was identified and quantified using the contamination identification lwia sci post processing software and finally the calibration curves were established in this study we found only methanol contamination in the xylem water and leaf water of the selected plants with the following error correction equation 3 δ δ 2 h 0 38 ln n b 2 1 05 ln n b 2 26 p 0 001 4 δ δ 18 o 0 21 ln n b 2 0 45 ln n b 0 98 p 0 001 where δδ2h and δδ18o represent the errors in isotope values due to methanol contamination respectively nb is a narrow band coefficient and varies with the type of water sample which mainly reflects the degree of methanol contamination in the water sample the corrected stable isotope values are the measured values minus the error values schultz et al 2011 2 4 potential water source partitioning a bayesian mixture model mixsir 1 0 4 was used to calculate the proportion of plant water uptake to each potential water source based on the principle of isotopic mass conservation dai et al 2020 moore and semmens 2008 tang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the model takes into account the variability and isotopic fractionation of the isotopic signal of plant xylem water and potential water sources wang et al 2019 with the following equation 5 δ p σ p i 1 n f i δ s i σ s i 6 1 i 1 n f i where δp and δs i are the δ2h or δ18o of plant xylem water and potential water sources respectively and σp and σ s i are the standard deviation of δ2h or δ18o of plant xylem water and potential water sources respectively i denotes the ith water source n denotes the total number of water sources fi denotes the proportion of plant use of the ith water source since the farmers did not irrigate the plants in the experimental site and the water table within the forests estimated from the farmers groundwater well was 18 m the source of water for plants in the two forests was soil water for the subsequent analysis and comparison the plant water sources were divided into the surface 0 10 cm shallow 10 40 cm middle 40 80 cm and deep 80 130 cm layers according to the variability in isotopic compositions and swc of the soil water wang et al 2020 four layers were identified by the following wu et al 2022 1 surface layer had the most variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was most susceptible to rainfall pulses and evaporation 2 shallow layer had relatively large variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was vulnerable to heavy rainfall events and strong evaporation 3 middle layer had lower variability in soil water isotopic compositions and swc than shallow layer 4 deep layer had relatively stable variations in soil water isotopic compositions and swc and was poorly influenced by precipitation and evaporation then the mean and standard deviation of δ2h and δ18o in soil water of different soil layers and xylem water for each plant c camphora c lanceolate c mollissima and c pitardii were entered into the mixsir model in the form of data files mix data txt mean source txt and sd source txt the fractionation factor was set to 0 in the corresponding data file mean frac txt and sd frac txt because plants in this study area do not undergo isotopic fractionation during water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 before running the mixsir model we should ensure that the matlab run time library files and mixsir program are correctly installed the number of model iterations was set to 1 000 000 in the graphical user interface gui of mixsir finally the posterior probability density distribution of the proportion of plant uptake by each potential water source was output and averaged in the analysis of the results 2 5 statistics analysis the line conditioned excess lc excess in the water pools is often used to observe isotopic fractionation in hydrological components subject to the relative difference between 2h and 18o fractionation at non equilibrium landwehr et al 2014 sprenger et al 2017 with the following equation 7 lc e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line lmwl originated from craig 1961 calculated from δ2h versus δ18o in precipitation during the observation period in the study area more negative values of lc excess indicate that the isotope of this water pool is subject to greater fractionation sprenger et al 2017 water absorption plasticity is quantified using the coefficient variation sd mean of the uptake proportion of each water source liu et al 2021 the mean and sd are the average proportion and standard deviation of plant water uptake to a particular water source during the observation period plants with greater water absorption plasticity are more flexible in switching water sources in variable water conditions song et al 2022 statistical analysis of data was performed using spss 22 software ibm usa the lsd the least significant difference test in anova was used to analyze the differences in swc δ2h δ18o and lc excess in different water pools and the proportion of water use by different plants the significance of pearson s correlation coefficient in the correlation analysis was tested using the t test 3 results 3 1 root distribution of different plants the root distributions of c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest and c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest tend to decrease with increasing depth fig 1 the percentage of root systems of c camphora in the ecological forest is 49 1 34 1 and 16 8 in the depths of 0 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 130 cm respectively while the distribution of deeper root systems of c lanceolate increased compared with that of c camphora with 26 6 in the depth of 80 130 cm the root distributions of c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest are similar both concentrate in 0 40 cm and their root proportions are 74 1 and 66 4 respectively 3 2 hydrometeorological conditions the total precipitation in the study area during the observation period october 2018 to september 2019 is 1326 3 mm of which the highest cumulative precipitation is 247 7 mm in may followed by 210 4 mm in june however the cumulative precipitation from august to september is only 9 5 mm fig 2 a the average t varies within the range of 2 6 to 33 3 with the lowest average t of 4 0 in january and the highest average t of 30 8 in august and the accumulation of 42 d of hot weather with the average t exceeding 30 during august to september when precipitation is scarce fig 2a with increasing depth the seasonal variabilities of swc in both ecological and economic forests tend to decrease with the greatest range of variation in surface swc 16 2 33 9 and 13 3 34 8 respectively fig 2b c the swcs of the entire soil profile in both ecological and economic forests are at low values from august to september fig 2b c and the average swc 1sd from 0 to 130 cm during this period is 20 8 1 7 and 20 0 3 2 both significantly lower than that in other periods of 27 8 2 4 and 27 5 2 5 p 0 05 statistics show that there is no significant difference between the mean values of swc in the two forests p 0 05 combining the characteristics of meteorological elements and swc in the sample sites august to september 2019 is defined as the dry period and the other times as the wet period in this study to further explore plant water use in the ecological and economic forests under different moisture conditions 3 3 isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and xylem water influenced by the source of water vapor in the monsoon region the precipitation isotope in the study area exhibits obvious seasonal variation during the observation period with δ2h and δ18o ranging from 89 1 to 25 5 and 12 6 to 1 8 respectively fig 2d and the precipitation weighted average values of 26 1 22 7 and 5 3 2 6 where the maximum and minimum monthly values occur in march and july respectively the lmwl is δ2h 8 55δ18o 19 61 r2 0 96 p 0 001 during the observation period similar to the findings of luo et al 2019 the δ2h δ18o scatters of soil water and different plant xylem water in both ecological and economic forests are distributed below the lmwl and only the δ2h δ18o scatter of surface soil water deviates substantially from the lmwl during the dry period fig 3 the variation ranges of δ2h and δ18o in soil water in the ecological forest are 69 3 to 6 5 and 9 6 to 2 5 respectively fig 3a and that in the economic forest are 70 9 to 4 4 and 9 5 to 2 5 respectively fig 3b statistics show that δ2h and δ18o values in soil water at the same depth do not differ significantly p 0 05 between the two forests additionally a similar linear relationship of δ2h δ18o for soil water swl at each depth between the two forests is also found fig 3 the δ2h δ18o scatter of xylem water of four plants matches the distribution area of soil water isotope verifying that no significant isotopic fractionation occurs in these plants during root water uptake as well as water transport the seasonal variations of δ2h and δ18o in soil water are similar between the ecological and economic forests at the same depth fig 4 a d the maximum and minimum isotopic values of soil water at the surface layer appear in april and july while the peak values of soil water isotopes in other layers are delayed with increasing depth indicating a certain lag between different soil layers in precipitation recharge and infiltration processes the range of variation in δ2h and δ18o for soil water decreased gradually with increasing depth during the observation period fig 4a d the δ2h and δ18o in xylem water of four plants from the two forests have similar seasonal variations fig 4a d with the maximum value in april may and the minimum value in october the mean δ2h and δ18o values in xylem water of plants in the ecological and economic forests range from 38 7 to 34 7 and from 6 2 to 5 7 respectively and none of them are significantly different p 0 05 from the wet to dry period the isotopic values in xylem water of each plant except c mollissima in the economic forest gradually transition from close to that in shallow soil water to close to that in middle and deep soil water fig 4a d seasonal variations of lc excess in soil water and xylem water are not obvious except for surface soil water fig 4e f the lower lc excess values for surface soil water appear in the dry period the lc excess in xylem water of different plants ranges from 13 1 to 0 8 which is within the variation range of lc excess in soil water fig 4e f 3 4 isotopic composition of leaf water and its driving factors the seasonal variations of δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests converge with the highest values occurring in april but the lowest values of δ2h and δ18o occurred in july and december respectively fig 5 a b the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of plants in the two forests vary from 2 1 to 4 1 and 6 3 to 7 6 respectively and they are not significantly different from each other p 0 05 the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in leaf water are significantly enriched compared to the xylem water isotope p 0 05 the seasonal patterns of lc excess in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests are similar in contrast to those of δ2h and δ18o fig 5 the mean lc excess values in leaf water of different plants vary from 60 8 to 42 3 which is not significantly different between them p 0 05 but significantly lower than lc excess in xylem water p 0 05 the correlations of δ2h δ18o and lc excess in leaf water of plants in the ecological and economic forests with the driving factors meteorological conditions swc and corresponding xylem water isotope are listed in table 2 both δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of all plants show a highly significant negative correlation with rh p 0 01 and δ18o in leaf water shows a significant positive correlation with both rs and vpd p 0 05 both δ2h and δ18o in leaf water of all plants show a weak correlation with swc at different depths p 0 05 in addition leaf water δ2h and xylem water δ2h of all plants show a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the lc excess in leaf water of all plants shows a significant positive correlation with rh p 0 05 and a significant negative correlation with both rs and vpd p 0 05 3 5 plant water source partitioning and water absorption plasticity in the ecological forest the main water source for c camphora and c lanceolate is surface soil water from december to may with an average water uptake proportion of 49 5 14 0 and 50 7 10 6 respectively fig 6 a b in june july and october november the uptake proportion of surface soil water by c camphora and c lanceolate decreases significantly while the uptake proportion of middle and deep soil water both increases somewhat making the absorption proportion of each water source relatively even in this period in august september dry period c camphora and c lanceolate mainly utilize deep soil water with an average uptake proportion of 33 3 6 1 and 42 8 6 4 respectively followed by the middle soil water in the economic forest the uptake proportion of each water source except the surface layer by c mollissima is relatively even in different months during the observation period the defoliation period is not observed fig 6c and the average uptake proportion of surface shallow middle and deep soil water is 18 7 6 1 25 1 7 8 27 5 4 8 and 28 7 9 3 respectively with no significant differences among them p 0 05 in contrast to the water use strategy of c mollissima the main water source for c pitardii is surface or shallow soil water from november to may and its average water uptake proportion is 50 5 16 3 and 31 9 19 1 respectively in june july and october the uptake proportion by c pitardii for surface soil water decreases significantly and the uptake proportion for each water source is relatively even during the dry period the main water source for c pitardii is deep soil water with an average uptake proportion of 39 4 3 9 followed by the middle soil water with an average uptake proportion of 29 0 0 2 in the ecological forest the water use strategies of c camphora and c lanceolate are largely the same mainly using surface soil water with an uptake proportion of 35 while in the economic forest the water use strategies of c mollissima and c pitardii are inconsistent fig 7 a specifically c mollissima absorbs a smaller proportion of shallow soil water 19 and is more dependent on other water sources however c pitardii mainly absorbs surface soil water 38 followed by shallow soil water 28 the water absorption plasticity of four plants is in order c pitardii 59 1 13 6 c lanceolate 48 5 9 7 c camphora 42 4 9 3 c mollissima 28 3 7 3 indicating that c lanceolate and c pitardii are more flexible in seasonal shifts of water sources in the ecological and economic forests respectively fig 7b the switch in plant water use sources is closely linked to the dynamics of swc fig 6 and fig 8 the absorption proportion of surface and shallow soil water by c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii is significantly positively correlated with swc p 0 05 and the absorption proportion of middle and deep soil water is significantly negatively correlated with swc p 0 05 which indicates that the main water absorption depth of the above three plants switch from 0 to 40 cm to depths below 40 cm as swc decreased however there is no significant correlation between the proportion of soil water uptake at all depths by c mollissima and swc p 0 05 according to the slope of the linear equation of water uptake proportion and swc fig 8 the water uptake by c lanceolate is more sensitive to varying soil moisture than c camphora in the ecological forest while the water uptake by c pitardii is more sensitive to varying soil moisture than c mollissima in the economic forest 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of isotopic compositions in soil water and xylem water based on 23 soil water and plant water isotope sampling activities during the observation period we found that δ2h and δ18o of soil water in the ecological and economic forests had similar seasonal variations and profile distributions fig 4 and there was no significant difference between the mean values p 0 05 this might be related to the similar hydro ecological environment of the two forests as they are geographically adjacent and essentially identical both in terms of topography and soil texture thus allowing for no differences in isotopic fractionation of soil water during precipitation infiltration as well as water redistribution sprenger et al 2017 and lyu et al 2021 suggested that the lc excess in soil water is an important indicator for determining the intensity of soil evaporation the lc excess in soil water was relatively stable during the observation period in both forests fig 4e f except for a significant decrease in surface soil during the dry period and was distinctly higher than in the dry area mccutcheon et al 2016 where the lc excess was below 20 this result reflected the weaker soil evaporation capacity of the forests in this study in addition the seasonal variation of swc was similar in both forests fig 2 and their mean values were not significantly different p 0 05 these results suggested that precipitation infiltration as well as water redistribution were similar between the two forests although c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest and c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest belonged to different living types table 1 none of their xylem water isotopic values were significant difference p 0 05 and similar results were found in pinus tabuliformis mixed forests with hippophae rhamnoides tang et al 2019 and in quercus petraea mixed with pinus sylvestris bello et al 2019 therefore the isotopic compositions of xylem water in different living plants did not necessarily differ and might converge under long term adaptation in the same habitat the use of isotopic techniques to identify plant water sources has been hampered by the increasing number of studies that have found isotopic offsets between xylem water and potential water sources i e xylem water cannot match any of the potential water sources in the dual isotopic space barbeta et al 2020 the isotopic deviation has been observed in field experiments in various biomes such as shrubs wang et al 2017 coniferous forests geris et al 2017 and broadleaf forests bowling et al 2017 however the isotope of xylem water and potential water source water matched well for different living plants in this study fig 3 which facilitated the comparison of water use strategies based on an isotopic approach since the uptake and transport of source water by a plant is widely recognized as an important component of the global water cycle chen et al 2020 future studies are highly warranted to examine the existence and causes of isotopic deviations of xylem water from source water in other plants in humid subtropical regions 4 2 isotopic fractionation and driving factors of leaf water plant leaf water is an essential aspect of the water cycle and understanding the isotopic composition of leaf water can help reveal its partitioning in the isotopic cycle of local water pools in this study leaf water isotope of all four plants was significantly enriched p 0 05 compared to xylem water isotope the larger the δ2h and δ18o in leaf water the smaller the lc excess in leaf water and the stronger the isotopic fractionation of leaf water fig 5 similar to xylem water isotope the differences in leaf water isotope were not significant p 0 05 among different plants in the ecological forest c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forest c mollissima and c pitardii indicating the convergence of leaf water isotope among multiple biological species and life types conifer broadleaf evergreen deciduous and tree shrub previous studies have shown that leaf water isotope is firstly affected by plant source water because plants absorb water from the soil through the root system for transpiration cernusak et al 2016 liu et al 2023 xylem water isotope can be used to characterize plant water source signals rothfuss and javaux 2017 when assuming that isotopic fractionation does not occur in plant root water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 sprenger et al 2016 both cernusak et al 2022 and liu et al 2023 found that leaf water δ2h was more closely correlated with xylem water isotope than leaf water δ18o which was consistent with our findings table 2 we found that all plants show a significant positive correlation between leaf water δ2h and xylem water δ2h p 0 05 and the correlation coefficients are greater than those between leaf water δ18o and xylem water δ18o the reasons may be that leaf water δ2h was ultimately influenced only by precipitation δ2h while leaf water δ18o was influenced by a mixture of precipitation δ18o and atmospheric factors o2 and co2 cernusak et al 2016 liu et al 2023 besides the effect of plant source water leaf water isotope was also related to ecological factors stomatal conductance and transpiration rate farquhar et al 2007 sheshshayee et al 2005 and environmental factors cernusak et al 2008 li et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 since stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were controlled by environmental factors kumagai et al 2008 hayat et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 this study examined the drive of external environmental factors on isotopic fractionation of leaf water in detail according to table 2 rh was significantly negatively correlated with δ2h and δ18o in leaf water p 0 01 for different plants with the σ slope of from 0 85 to 0 62 1 2h rh 1 and from 0 26 to 0 22 18o rh 1 respectively vpd was significantly positively correlated with δ18o in leaf water p 0 05 with the σ of 3 45 4 30 kpa 1 the findings were similar to those of barbour and farquhar 2000 farquhar and gan 2003 and butt et al 2010 when rh was larger and vpd was smaller the vapor pressure inside and outside the leaf is closed resulting in reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as the exchange of leaf water with canopy water vapor diminished the lower the isotopic fractionation in leaf water the smaller the δ2h and δ18o and vice versa similar to vpd rs showed significant positive correlations with δ18o in leaf water for different plants p 0 05 with the σ of 0 05 0 06 w m 2 rs might affect the isotopic fractionation of leaf water by influencing plant photosynthesis gillon and yakir 2000 guy et al 1993 it has been shown that isotopic fractionation of leaf water was related to t in addition to rh vpd and rs cooper and deniro 1989 dongmann et al 1974 zhou et al 2011 however cooper and deniro 1989 found that the response of leaf water isotope to t was not consistent across species and regions we only found a significant negative correlation between t and δ2h in leaf water of c camphora in the ecological forest p 0 05 with the σ of 2 98 1 while it did not appear in other plants moreover although soil water conditions were strongly associated with plant water use strategies fig 6 and fig 8 leaf water isotopes of different plants were less correlated with swc than meteorological factors rh vpd and rs 4 3 water resources apportionment in the ecological and economic forests a quantitative study of the water use sources under changing water conditions revealed that c camphora c lanceolate and c pitardii can switch water sources flexibly through root dimorphism with decreasing swc from wet to dry periods these plants switched from mainly absorbing surface or shallow soil water to mainly using deep soil water similar to the findings of brinkmann et al 2019 yang et al 2015 and zhao and wang 2021a however the water uptake depth of c mollissima varied little under different moisture conditions and its uptake proportion to each water source except the surface layer was relatively even in different months fig 6 our findings rejected the original hypothesis in the ecological forest the water use strategies of c camphora and c lanceolate were convergent as shown by similar seasonal patterns of water use of them fig 6 similar average water uptake proportion to each source fig 7a water absorption plasticity without statistical differences p 0 05 fig 7b and similar water uptake proportion to each water source in relation to swc fig 8 the overlapping water use patterns among co occurring plants in the ecological forests may cause severe water competition with each other antunes et al 2019 peñuelas et al 2011 tang et al 2019 previous studies have found that soil and plant properties were essential factors affecting plant water use wang et al 2020 since soil properties were consistent in the ecological forest created by c camphora and c lanceolate the water source overlap between the two species was independent of soil properties rather plant properties e g fine root distribution height and stem diameter exerted a crucial effect on water use patterns of them in this study the root systems of both c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest were mainly distributed in the 0 80 cm soil layer 73 with well developed lateral roots fig 1a moreover the two species had similar height and stem diameter table 1 however our findings were not consistent with the study of grossiord et al 2014 they found that coniferous trees had significantly deeper water uptake than broadleaved trees this difference may be related to distinct climatic and stand conditions as well as species specificity in contrast the water use strategies of c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest were divergent as evidenced by the contrasting seasonal patterns of water use fig 6 different mean water uptake proportion for each water source fig 7a different water uptake plasticity between them fig 7b and distinct water uptake proportion for each water source in relation to swc fig 8 the seasonal pattern of water use of c mollissima did not vary according to soil moisture conditions and the absorption proportion of soil water except for the surface layer was relatively even at all depths during the observation period even during the dry period resulting in its lower water uptake plasticity however the water use pattern of c pitardii was sensitive to swc and its water use sources underwent a shallow to deep transition from the wet to the dry period making it a higher water uptake plasticity on the one hand the differences in water use patterns of the two species might be related to their hydraulic strategies for adapting to changes in soil moisture studies have shown that species that tended to utilize more stable water sources from deep layer e g c mollissima often closed their stomata in response to water stress to prevent water loss while species that tended to utilize shallower water sources e g c pitardii usually maintained stomata open and allowed their water potentials to drop sharply with decreasing water availability to maintain physiological activities ding et al 2021 dubbert et al 2019 on the other hand the difference in phenology e g germination flowering and fruiting between c mollissima and c pitardii might also be responsible for the water source partitioning between them in the economic forest for example november to march was the deciduous period for c mollissima which coincided with the flowering period for c pitardii wu et al 2022 found that the mismatch between the phenology and water demand period led to differences in water use patterns between economic species in mixed forests 4 4 implications for forest management although subtropical monsoon regions receive more precipitation than arid and semi arid regions both long term meteorological data and climate models showed that the precipitation in the region was significantly reduced and the drought risk was increased song et al 2022 for example from early july to mid august 2013 the study area experienced a severe drought with frequent high temperatures which was the lowest mid summer precipitation and highest temperature in nearly 40 years luo et al 2016 to effectively evaluate the response of vegetation to climate change in the subtropical monsoon region in the future it is central to identify the water use patterns of co occurring plants in mixed species forests through the long term continuous sampling activity we found that there was hydrological niche overlapping and hydrological niche partitioning in the ecological forest and economic forest respectively water competition between c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest during the wet period was negligible due to relatively sufficient plant available water in the root zone soil fig 2b and their co occurrence might promote biodiversity and ecological functions of the community however during the dry period the persistent high temperature without precipitation in the study area led to soil water scarcity and then the similar water use patterns of c camphora and c lanceolate might lead to intense water competition studies have shown that severe seasonal drought in humid areas can be devastating to plants with weak drought tolerance luo et al 2016 song et al 2022 although some plants reduced water consumption during the dry period by regulating physiological structures such as closing stomata or defoliation these defenses undoubtedly limited productivity and ecological functions in addition the hydrological niche partitioning facilitated the resource allocation between c mollissima and c pitardii within the economic forest to achieve complementary coexistence or resist severe seasonal drought bello et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2019 martin gomez et al 2017 in artificial vegetation regeneration mixed plantation was often identified as a more suitable revegetation pattern than pure plantation due to improved ecosystem productivity stability resilience and nutrients gao et al 2018 gong et al 2021 although resource complementarity of co occurring plants in mixed forests was often expected competition for water resources due to niche overlapping between co occurring species was still found in some silvicultural ecosystems grossiord et al 2014 tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 therefore understanding which species co occurrence brought about facilitating or negative effects on artificial forest ecosystems was a meaningful research subject our study showed that the overlapping and partitioning of hydrological niches among species in mixed forests were species specific when selecting different plants for mixed plantations species with significantly distinct plant characteristics height stem diameter crown width etc and phenology should be considered to achieve spatial and temporal separation of water use patterns such as mixed tree shrub or mixed evergreen deciduous species planting our findings provided a scientific basis for fully exploiting the ecological and economic benefits and realizing sustainable development of silviculture ecosystems however this study lacked the observation of plant physiological indicators such as transpiration rate hydraulic characteristics photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance thus failing to closely integrate plant water use with plant physiological characteristics which made it difficult to systematically reveal the adaptation strategies of co occurring plants to seasonal drought and future climate change moreover we could not confirm that mixed species forests are more conducive to species adaptation to environmental changes than pure forests because the indicators of each species in pure forests were not observed therefore future studies on plant water use should combine multiple research methods and conduct diverse and multi site data observations 5 conclusions the water isotopes in different plants xylem and leaf tended to be consistent under long term adaptation in the same habitat leaf water isotope is significantly enriched compared to xylem water isotope for all the plants in the ecological forest c camphora and c lanceolate and economic forest c mollissima and c pitardii p 0 05 and leaf water isotope was driven by xylem water isotope and meteorological factors such as rh vpd and rs rather than soil water conditions although both c camphora and c lanceolate in the ecological forest can switch water sources under changing moisture conditions there was a hydrological niche overlapping between them which might intensify water competition between them in the dry period additionally there was a hydrological niche partitioning between c mollissima and c pitardii in the economic forest the water absorption plasticity of c pitardii was larger than c mollissima p 0 05 the hydrological niche partitioning of c mollissima and c pitardii within the economic forest was conducive to water allocation and resistance to severe drought these findings suggested that plant water source partitioning was species specific in mixed forests and can provide scientific guidance

1877,cryogenic vacuum extraction cve the most popular method for obtaining xylem water for isotopic analysis of ecosystems is known to cause δ2h offset and may lead to biased inference on transpiration while δ2h offset correction methods have been proposed recently their accuracy in identifying plant water sources remains uncertain in this study capitalizing on the latest cavitron centrifuge technique cact we evaluated the accuracy of three current δ2h offset correction methods cve bulk xylem water after the 8 1 correction method 8 1 mean correc cve bulk xylem water after the soil water isotope line correction method line correc and cve bulk xylem water after the rehydration correction method rehydr for plant water source identification we tested the three correction approaches on five apple malus pumila mill orchards our results revealed that although δ18o values of the cve bulk xylem water and the cact sap water matched the δ2h values differed p 0 05 with a mean difference of 10 23 3 75 by applying the available correction methods to the cve bulk xylem water the δ2h offset was reduced to 2 13 3 75 8 1 mean correc 4 43 4 48 line correc and 0 44 3 69 rehydr the corrections also improved the z score however substantial δ2h offset variations remained after the corrections moreover when applying the corrected xylem water isotopic compositions in plant water apportioning analysis the line correc method resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in 1 out of 80 cases while the 8 1 mean correc 0 80 and rehydr 0 80 methods did not our results suggest that for the available correction methods for cryogenic extraction to reduce δ2h offsets the rehydr and 8 1 mean correc methods outperformed the line correc method in plant water source identification thus we recommended that the rehydr method and 8 1 mean correc method be used to identify plant water sources of cve extracted bulk xylem water keywords plant water source identification stable isotopes cryogenic vacuum extraction centrifuge technique δ2h offset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding the earth s water carbon and energy cycles requires a better understanding of plant root water uptake miguez macho and fan 2021 while some methods are available for characterizing plant root water uptake such as root excavation and heat tracing čermák and nadezhdina 2011 jarvis 1989 the use of isotope tracing techniques 2h and 18o and or 3h is by far the most significant methodological advancement nie et al 2012 tao et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the stable isotope method for identifying root water uptake assumes that the isotopic composition of plant stem water is a mix of the plant water sources in the soil and or groundwater barbeta and peñuelas 2017 dawson and ehleringer 1991 based on this assumption once we measure the isotopic composition of the plant water and soil water sources we can determine the proportion of the contribution from a soil water source or layer however measuring the isotopic composition of plant water directly is challenging hence extracting plant water is a prerequisite for determining the isotopic composition of the water conventional methods for extracting plant water include cryogenic vacuum extraction cve song and barbour 2016 centrifugation peters and yakir 2008 scholander type pressure chamber zuecco et al 2022 direct vapor equilibration magh et al 2022 microwave extraction munksgaard et al 2014 and high pressure mechanical squeezing millar et al 2018 mounting evidence indicates that there is isotopic heterogeneity in stem water pools barbeta et al 2022 zhao et al 2016 raising the question on which is the best proxy of the isotopic composition of plant water sources only the sap water that exchanges with the plant water reservoirs and is transmitted in the xylem vessel or tracheid is the actual water involved in plant transpiration therefore for plant water apportioning the correct water in the xylem should be the sap water the cve direct vapor equilibration and high pressure mechanical squeezing methods extract not only the vessel tracheid water in the plant but also the intercellular water zhao et al 2016 making them inappropriate for extracting sap water currently 96 of plant water isotope extractions have been implemented using the cve method de la casa et al 2022 the cve method and its variants rely on high temperature extraction and the resulting isotopic composition can be affected by hydrogen exchange between the xylem water and xylem tissues chen et al 2020 chen et al 2020 reported that there is a hydrogen offset between the stem water extracted via cve and the source water which is likely due to the dynamic exchange between the organic h and the free bulk xylem water during the cve as a result they questioned the reliability of the cve method for extracting the hydrogen composition of stem water and argued that without some sort of compensation for the offsets biased inferences can result several attempts have been made to correct the hydrogen offset in plant water sourcing allen and kirchner 2022 barbeta et al 2019 chen et al 2020 li et al 2021 first based on a mean hydrogen offset of 8 1 obtained across saline xeric and mesic species chen et al 2020 applied a uniform 8 1 correction to all plant water in a global dataset evaristo et al 2015 subsequently allen and kirchner 2022 applied similar average hydrogen offset to the data from four previous studies they showed that a 6 1 δ2h offset was large enough to substantially affect plant water sourcing in two cases allen et al 2019 kerhoulas et al 2013 while it did not make a difference in the remaining two cases dawson and ehleringer 1991 goldsmith et al 2012 second based on the concept of line condition excess lc excess barbeta et al 2019 and li et al 2021 proposed the concepts of soil water excess sw excess and potential water excess pw excess respectively the sw excess and pw excess are used to quantify the deviation in the dual isotope space between any sample and the soil potential water line swl pwl although li et al 2021 evaluated the effects of the pw excess method on plant water sourcing they did not analyze sap water which recent research suggests is a better proxy for the isotopic composition of water sources thus they could not assess the accuracy of their method third chen et al 2020 found a good linear relationship between the relative stem water content and hydrogen offset for different plants through a stem rehydration experiment thus they recommended that the linear stem rehydration linear curves of specific species be used to correct the hydrogen offset of the cve extracted stem water these three methods are simple and easy to implement but their relative performances in plant water sourcing remain uncertain this is because in order to compare the methods the isotopic composition of the true plant water is a prerequisite but it is difficult to obtain notably chen et al 2020 showed that the steady state transpiration water vapor obtained in an controlled environmental chamber was identical in isotopic composition to the fed labeled water this suggests that the isotopic signature of the true plant source can be obtained by collecting transpiration vapor however the required steady state conditions are difficult to maintain and implement for field plants recently barbeta et al 2022 found that stem cavitron centrifuge technique cact sap water was consistent with labeled water in potted irrigation experiments and the isotopic composition of the sap water matched that of the mobile deep soil water in the field experiment wen et al 2022 provided further evidence that cact sap water represents the true source water through rehydration experiments therefore the cact extracted sap water may serve as reference water in this study we evaluated whether the three proposed correction methods are sufficiently accurate for plant water partitioning specifically we address the following questions 1 how do the stable isotope results of the cact sap water and cve bulk xylem water compare 2 do the three correction methods reduce the hydrogen offset 3 do the three correction methods ultimately improve the cve for plant water sourcing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling our experiment was conducted on the southeastern chinese loess plateau 35 14 n 107 41e elevation of 1200 m and the study site was characterized by flat surfaces and silt loam soil texture fig 1 the soil was developed over the thick aeolian deposits accumulated since the pleistocene the site has a continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 579 mm from 1960 to 2016 of which 50 occurs from july to september the land use was traditional farmland and annual crops such as spring wheat and maize were mainly grown since the 1990s about half of the land area has been converted to rainfed apple orchards li et al 2019 the groundwater in the region is 80 m below the soil surface which is beyond the root zone and thus the groundwater does not participate in plant transpiration five apple orchards were selected as our experimental sites labeled sites a b c d and e these apple orchards were planted in 2013 a 2008 b 2005 c 2001 d and 1998 e on clear and sunny days during the growing season in 2021 soil and plant samples were collected from the five sites for isotope analysis at each site we selected four neighboring apple trees with similar growth forming a rectangle along the diagonals of this rectangle we collected one profile of soil samples the soil core was extracted to a sampling depth of 5 m using a special auger considering that the surface soil water isotope composition can be altered greatly by evaporation and precipitation the vertical soil core was split into four sections top soil sampling intervals of 10 cm in the upper 0 0 4 m shallow sub soil sampling intervals of 20 cm in the 0 4 2 m soil layer deep soil 2 5 m sampling intervals of 1 m below 2 m and extremely deep soil 5 m soil layer we calculated the average isotopic composition of each soil layer by taking a volumetric water content weighted average of the measured isotopic compositions of all of the sampling intervals within that layer since seasonal precipitation water typically cannot reach the extremely deep soil and root water uptake does not alter the isotopic composition of the soil water we assumed that the isotopic composition of soil water in the 5 m soil layer remained unchanged during the study period consequently the isotopic values of extremely deep soil water collected in 2016 were used in this study tao et al 2021 the collected soil was partitioned into two parts one was placed in an aluminum box to obtain the soil water content via the oven drying method and the other was placed in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle and sealed with parafilm transported to the laboratory and stored at 20 c prior to the water extraction to measure the plant water isotopic composition four one year old twigs were collected from the selected four trees in an orchard the sampling generally took place in the afternoon when high sap flow velocity occurs the obtained twig sample was then wrapped in parafilm and stored in a container with ice packs to prevent evaporation the samples were then transported to the laboratory for immediate water extraction in addition to soil and plant samples the site for precipitation collection was located 2 km away from the study area at an elevation of 1200 m daily precipitation water samples directly flowed into a bottle connected to a funnel and a ping pong ball was placed in the funnel to avoid evaporation lu et al 2020 the precipitation samples were immediately transported to the lab filtered using a filter head and disposable syringe and analyzed to determine their isotopic compositions xiang et al 2020 the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed from precipitation isotope data collected daily from 2019 to 2021 in the experimental area 2 2 water extraction and analytical methods water from the soil samples was extracted using a cve system koeniger et al 2011 the soil samples were loaded into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd uk and were gradually heated to 205 c for 0 5 h with a system pressure of 10 pa the water collection bottle was connected through a 1 5 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle to a sample bottle that was immersed in liquid nitrogen the sample bottle was inserted into a customized heating module that was immersed in high temperature silicone oil the recovery rate was obtained by placing the post extraction sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the samples were discarded if the extraction efficiency was outside the range of 98 102 the isotopic compositions of the extracted water were measured using an off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy water isotope analyzer lgr iwa 45ep los gatos research san jose ca usa with measurement accuracies of 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the gravimetric soil water content of the soil samples was measured via oven drying at 105 c for 24 h a centrifugation method was used to extract plant sap water there are two types of such centrifuges du et al 2019 one is called cavitron which was remodeled based on an allegra x 22r beckman coulter at the university of vermont machine shop and the other is the chinatron remodeled after a model h2100r centrifuge in cooperation with xiang yi lab instr co ltd both centrifuges were developed to produce a vulnerability curve based on the cavitron technique for tree physiology the chinatron centrifuge was adopted in our research and it is referred to as the cavitron centrifuge technique with a rotor diameter of 30 cm the required twig length was 27 4 cm after cutting 2 cm from both twig ends before centrifugation each twig sample was inserted into a cuvette with the top wrapped in parafilm to avoid evaporation following the method of barbeta et al 2022 the centrifugal temperature was set at 10 c with a centrifugal time of 2 min and centrifugal speed of 7636 rpm 6 mpa subsequently the centrifuged plant water was collected into the sample bottle through a disposable syringe and it is referred to as sap water the plant water extracted using the cact is hereinafter referred to as the cact sap water the water samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to the isotope analyses we also extracted the plant water using cve after cutting off the 27 4 cm centrifugation part of the twigs the remaining twigs were rapidly peeled to remove leaves bark and phloem and were then placed into an exetainer the plant water extracted via cve is referred to as the bulk xylem water referred to as the cve bulk xylem water the cve had a distillation temperature of 105 c distillation time of 3 h and vacuum pressure of 10 pa to avoid spectral contamination introduced by organic compounds an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms 253 plus thermo fisher scientific inc bremen germany was used to analyze the isotopic compositions of the bulk xylem and sap water 2 3 δ2h offset correction methods 2 3 1 δ2h offset average correction method 8 1 method i e the 8 1 mean correc chen et al 2020 measured the hydrogen offsets δ2hoffset i e the difference between true δ2h δ2htrue and the cve measured δ2h δ2hcve of nine tree species the δ2hoffset ranged from 10 9 to 5 2 with an average of 8 1 1 δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve 8 1 where δ2hcorrection is the hydrogen isotope value after correction δ2hoffset 8 1 was used as the correction value in a recent study allen and kirchner 2022 2 3 2 soil water line method line correc inspired by the concept of lc excess barbeta et al 2019 defined the offset of the hydrogen isotopes between the xylem and soil water as the sw excess 2 sw e x c e s s δ 2 h a s δ 18 o b s where as and bs are the slope and intercept of soil water isotope line swl respectively considering that groundwater and rainwater can be sources of plant water li et al 2021 proposed the pw excess concept of hydrogen isotope offset between multiple potential water sources and plant water 3 pw e x c e s s δ 2 h a p δ 18 o b p δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve p w e x c e s s where ap and bp are the slope and intercept of the multiple potential water isotope lines pwl respectively for each sampling event in each orchard the soil water isotope values of the four soil layers were fitted using a linear equation therefore each orchard had a specific slope ap and intercept bp for each sampling event table s1 because the groundwater in our experimental site was deeper than the maximum rooting depth and there was no irrigation the soil water was the only water source for the plants therefore sw excess pw excess and the swl can be fitted to the δ2h and δ18o data for the different sampling events table s1 2 3 3 rehydration method rehydr spike experiment approximately 500 g of apple twig material was collected from the experimental trees the bark and phloem were removed and the twig was cut into 1 2 cm segments then plant materials were placed in 12 ml glass exetainer vials labco ltd uk and sealed for transportation to the lab the samples were oven dried at 105 c for at least 24 h chen et al 2020 after being oven dried and cooled to room temperature we added labeled water with a known isotopic composition δ2h 69 29 δ18o 9 46 to the glass exetainer vials labco ltd uk the specific amount of water added to each sample was calculated according to the designed gravimetric water contents 40 60 80 100 and saturation after reaching equilibrium at 4 c for 10 days the water in the rehydrated branches was extracted using the cve method the specific cve process is described in section 2 2 the deviations between the extracted plant water and labeled water were then calculated for the different stem water contents θstem the linear relationship between the stem water content swc and hydrogen deviation δ2hoffset was fitted to the measured data fig 2 three replicates were performed for each water content for a total of 15 samples the r2 value of the relationship between the δ2hoffset and stem water content was 0 889 fig 2 4 δ 2 h offset a s w c b δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve δ 2 h offset where a and b are the slope and intercept of the fitted line of the stem water content and hydrogen offset respectively a 5 855 b 13 776 δ2hoffset is the deviation between the plant water isotope values extracted via cve and the isotopic values of the labeled water all of the samples were corrected based on the stem water content following the established calibration relationship between stem water content and hydrogen offset some of the biases from the rehydration experiment were large due in part to the variability of the actual exchangeable hydrogen among the different organs chen et al 2020 schimmelmann 1991 the z score values reflect the isotopic deviation between the sap water and these xylem waters using the assigned measurement accuracy orlowski et al 2016 we calculated the z score for each of the corrected and uncorrected xylem water as follows 5 z δ sap δ xylem μ where δsap is the δ2h or δ18o value of the extracted cact sap water and δxylem is the δ2h or δ18o value of the cve xylem water including the uncorrected bulk xylem water 8 1 mean corrected bulk xylem water line corrected bulk xylem water and rehydr corrected bulk xylem water the measurement accuracies μ were set to 2 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o via irms absolute z scores of 2 2 5 and 5 were deemed to be acceptable questionable and unacceptable respectively wassenaar et al 2012 2 4 isotopic mixing model for quantification of tree water sources the relative contributions of the different soil layers to the apple tree root water uptake were calculated using the mixsiar statistical package which has a general bayesian framework stock and semmens 2013 based on the influences of evaporation rainfall and infiltration on the soil water isotopes the soil profile was divided into four layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m in this study tao et al 2021 plant water was used as the mixed source data for root water uptake and the soil water in the different layers was used as the potential water source data assuming no fractionation during the root water uptake and transport chen et al 2020 the fractionation parameter was set to 0 the length of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter in the mixsiar model was set to very long as the convergence condition the error structure was set using the residual process the mixing model error structures were caused by a combination of the process and residual errors furthermore the performance of residual process is a more ecologically realistic assumption stock and semmens 2016 in addition the root distribution and available soil water content were used as prior information to reduce the model uncertainty the fine root length density distribution in the soil profile was obtained in november 2020 assuming that the soil water content of aged orchards was the lowest limit of the root water uptake the available soil water content was obtained by subtracting the lower limit from the soil water content profile of the orchards in that year the average available soil water content and the average fine root length density within each layer are listed in table s2 and they were used as the weights for the isotopic compositions of the layers in the model to evaluate the effects of the hydrogen deviation correction methods on the calculation of the plant water source partitioning three corrected methods eqs 1 4 were compared with the cact sap water δ2h and δ18o and cve bulk xylem water δ2h and δ18o the dual isotope of the cact sap water was used as the true plant water the student s t test was used to detect the mean difference between the two groups with a confidence level of 95 the plant water source identification using different hydrogen deviation correction methods was evaluated using the root mean squared error rmse 6 rmse j 1 n y j y j λ n where yj and y j λ are the proportional contributions of the different soil layers to the dual sap water isotope and one of the three hydrogen correction methods respectively the paired t test was used to determine whether the cve bulk xylem water was significantly different from the cact sap water we also performed linear regression between the offsets and stem water content the statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 or t 1 96 all of the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics ibm spss statistics for windows version 26 0 the difference between the contributions of the two extracted plant waters in each of the four soil layers was also tested using the t test 7 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means and σ x and σ y are the standard errors of variables x and y respectively the statistical tests were considered significant when t 1 96 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 stable isotopic compositions of soil water sap water and xylem water the stable isotopic compositions of the soil water from the five sampling sites had similar distribution patterns with depth table s3 taking site c as an example the isotopic compositions of the soil water in the 0 0 4 and 0 4 2 m intervals were generally more enriched in heavy isotopes than the soil water in the 2 5 m and 5 m layers fig 3 a c below 2 m the isotopic composition of the soil water was stable because the isotopic composition of 2 5 m layer was similar to that of the 5 m soil layer moreover there were strong temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the shallow soil water in the dry period such as 30 june fig 3a the water isotopic composition of the 0 0 4 m layer was enriched in heavy isotopes relative to the other soil layers however in the wet periods such as 21 sep fig 3d the soil water in the 0 0 4 m layer was more depleted in heavy isotopes than the 0 4 m soil layer due to infiltration of depleted precipitation water all of the isotopic compositions of the sap water fell within the ranges of the soil water isotopes fig 3 the sap water and xylem water showed considerable variability in terms of the hydrogen isotopic offsets among the four sampling events and five sites with δ2h offsets ranging from 15 34 to 2 35 fig 4 a the hydrogen isotope composition of the sap water was greater than that of the xylem water p 0 05 for most of the sampling events and sites fig 4a the resulting hydrogen offsets between the xylem and sap water were statistically different from zero among all of the sites and sampling events p 0 05 however the mean oxygen isotope value of all of the sap water samples did not differ from that of the xylem water p 0 05 the oxygen offsets between the sap water and xylem water for the sampling events were consistently small in magnitude fig 4b most of the oxygen offsets were not statistically different from zero p 0 05 and were within the precision of the irms 0 2 3 2 compensations of three hydrogen correction methods fig 5 shows the δ2h values of the sap water bulk xylem water and the three corrected waters pooled across all of the sampling data the hydrogen isotopic composition of sap water did not differ significantly from that of the bulk xylem water after the 8 1 mean correc or rehydr correction p 0 05 but it did differ from that of the bulk xylem water after the line correc correction p 0 05 the bulk xylem water was significantly different from the sap water and the three corrected bulk xylem waters p 0 05 fig 5 the bulk xylem water corrected using the 8 1 and rehydration corrections was much closer to the sap water in terms of the δ2h value the δ2h offset was reduced to 2 13 3 75 mean value standard deviation by the 8 1 mean correc method and to 0 44 3 69 by the rehydr method however the line correc correction method performed poorly with an δ2h offset of 4 43 4 48 after correction the four xylem waters had a considerable number of z score points within the questionable range fig 6 for the uncorrected xylem water more than half of the z score points were within the unacceptable range fig 6a correction using any of the three methods substantially reduced the number of z scores within the unacceptable range and increased the number z score points within the acceptable region however more than a third of the points still fell within in the questionable range fig 6b d for the rehydr method 35 7 of the rehydr corrected data still fell within the questionable range and one point within the unacceptable range this was the lowest number among the three methods in this sense the rehydr performed the best among the three correction methods 3 3 performances of three correction methods in identification of plant water sources the proportional contributions of the different soil layers to transpiration varied significantly among the cact sap water cve bulk xylem water and cve bulk xylem water after correction using the three methods mentioned above fig 7 the performances of the correction methods varied among the multiple sampling events fig 7 for convenience we defined the proportional contribution of each soil layer among the different sites and sampling events as a case with a total of 80 cases first 8 75 7 out of 80 of the cve bulk xylem water samples differed significantly in the plant water partitioning compared to the cact sap water p 0 05 however after correction using any of the three methods the percentage was substantially reduced 0 0 out of 80 cases after 8 1 mean correc correction 1 25 1 out of 80 cases after line correc correction and 0 0 out of 80 cases after rehydr correction table 1 the three hydrogen correction methods yielded smaller rmses 13 8 16 5 than the cve method table 1 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic offsets between bulk xylem water and sap water the sap water was relatively enriched in δ2h compared to the xylem water δ2hxylem δ2hsap 0 fig 4a the reason for the δ2h offset may be twofold first stem water has different pools of water and each pool has a distinct δ2h value barbeta et al 2022 this is because cellulosic fibers and hydrophilic organics preferentially adsorb lighter plant water leaving the relatively heavier sap water to migrate in the vessel or tracheid creating stem δ2h isotopic heterogeneity chen et al 2016 second dynamic exchange of 1h and 2h between the plant cellulose and ambient water occurs during cve chen et al 2020 as a result the lighter 1h in the stem cellulose is transferred to the sap and tissue water filot et al 2006 which is subsequently extracted via cve the progressive evaporation during cve preferentially removes the 1h in the sap and tissue water enhancing the transfer of 1h from the cellulose to the sap and tissue water xylem water consequently cve makes the extracted plant water more depleted than the true sap and tissue water wen et al 2022 moreover there are two potential h exchange pathways one process occurs during rehydration and the other occurs during the extraction process diao et al 2022 for the twig samples obtained from the orchard under ambient conditions the exchangeable h in the stem organic matter had already reached isotopic equilibrium with the bulk xylem water through isotopic exchange however during the extraction the bulk xylem water was progressively evaporated and enriched in heavier isotopes which perturbed the isotopic equilibrium between the bulk xylem water and cell tissue this created a large concentration difference between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water additionally the temperature was as high as 105 during the extraction and the higher temperature increased the kinetic energy of the participating molecules thereby facilitating the isotope exchange reaction clark and fritz 1997 wen et al 2022 therefore the hydrogen exchange during the extraction process due to the high temperature and enhanced concentration difference between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water may have caused the isotopic offset diao et al 2022 demonstrated the obvious hydrogen exchange due to the rehydration process when the absolute water volume was small whereas when the absolute water volume was 1 ml the δ2h offset values due to rehydration tended to be stable δ2h offset of stem powder or stem cellulose powder close to 5 10 with a magnitude similar to those presented by chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 in addition the δ2h offset of celluslose triacetate and caffeine no cellulose was close to zero when the absolute water volume was 1 ml diao et al 2022 based on this we can reasonably assume that the hydrogen exchange of the cellulose occurred during the extraction process not during the rehydration phase in the rehydr method this dominated the cve induced hydrogen exchange and δ2h offsets in our study when the extracted water volume was 1 ml however our experiments suggest that the use of relatively small water volumes 1 ml for isotope analysis could result in hydrogen offset yu et al 2023 minor revisions and the obtained relationship between the isotopic deviation and absolute amount of extracted water measured via the vapour liquid equilibrium method matches the theory of rayleigh fractionation the effects of rehydration on the isotopic deviation presented in diao et al 2022 may by more pronounced when the extracted water volume is small in our study the amount of plant water 1 ml extracted from the field samples was much greater than that in study conducted by diao et al 2022 as such our results were not as greatly affected by the rehydration process as those of diao et al 2022 based on the above reasoning we concluded that the hydrogen exchange in the extraction process was the primary cause of the hydrogen bias when the volume of the extracted bulk xylem water was relatively large 1 ml this is consistent with the conclusion of chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 who suggested that the extraction process was the primary cause of the δ2h bias however this should be verified through further experiments which is beyond the scope of this study the average value of the δ2h offsets ranged from 15 34 to 2 35 fig 4a this large variability which was also reported by chen et al 2020 who found larger offsets for drier samples could not be explained solely by the stem water contents similar to barbeta et al 2022 we have shown that there is a non significant relationship between the bulk stem water and observed δ2h offset under field conditions fig s1 we conclude that the large variability of the δ2h offsets and their poor relationship with the stem water content are the collective result of the spatial variability of the tree hydraulics and the hydrogen exchange between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water during both the rehydration and extraction processes first the specific conductivity ks varies greatly between apple trees with a maximum difference of 0 5 kg m mpa 1 s 1 wang et al unpublished the distinct hydraulic tree traits can result in differing degrees of mixing varied residence time of xylem water and water sources from different soil depths due to differing root architecture bowers and williams 2022 obviously the greater the difference in the isotopic composition between the source water and cell tissue is the larger the δ2h offset is and the xylem water contents may not play a role in this case second the lower the stem water content is the larger the hydrogen offset between the extracted plant water and source water is which is supported by the results of chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 obtained through rehydration experiments in the lab and by those of bowers and williams 2022 obtained through field experiments the relationship between the xylem water content and the δ2h offset obtained through rehydration experiments is much stronger than the relationship obtained by sampling trees from the field as is the case for our field samples fig s1 this may be explained by the fact that the branch samples in our rehydration experiments were wetted with the same water source and were given enough time to equilibrate the water extracted through cve from those samples would have little variability due to the variable water source and differing degree of mixing between the cell water and sap water compared to field samples therefore our rehydr method cannot correct for the biases resulting from the field variability of the water sources and the xylem hydraulics but it can be used to correct δ2h offsets due to cve however the correction equation obtained from our rehydr method may be specific to branches of apple tree species as a previous study demonstrated that 30 of the hydrogen in pure cellulose is hydroxyl hydrogen epstein et al 1976 which can easily exchange with that in ambient water filot et al 2006 however cellulose is a fibrous closely knit agglomerate of biopolymers in practice and hence not all of the o h bonds are physically accessible for exchange with ambient water schimmelmann 1991 therefore the magnitude of the δ2h offset may be affected by the percentage of the exchangeable hydroxyl hydrogen in the cellulose epstein et al 1976 wilson and grinsted 1977 which may vary between plant species organs and organ water contents resulting in variability of δ2h offsets however we suspect that for branches from different trees of the same species the percentage of exchangeable hydroxyl hydrogen may not vary as much and thus the rehydr method can be used to correct for the δ2h offsets of branch samples from apple trees remarkably the oxygen isotopes of the sap water and xylem water did not differ significantly and the oxygen offset was virtually negligible fig 4b this is supported by the results of previous studies barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 4 2 validation of the correction methods for plant water source identification surprisingly when applied to plant water sourcing fig 7 none of the 8 1 mean correc corrected water caused significantly biased water sourcing and the rmse was only 14 8 table 1 the rmse is very close to the average uncertainty for the bayesian mixing model 14 evaristo et al 2017 this suggests that the 8 1 mean correc is practically reliable for water source partitioning for the apple trees we studied during the sampling season this is in partial agreement with the results of allen and kirchner 2022 based on four previous studies they showed that an δ2hoffset of 6 1 8 1 was also used as a bias correction value in allen and kirchner 2022 s revised edit and the results did not differ for 6 1 and 8 1 was large enough to substantially affect plant water sourcing in two out of four cases allen et al 2019 dawson and ehleringer 1991 goldsmith et al 2012 kerhoulas et al 2013 however due to the lack of a true value they could not evaluate whether the δ2hoffset 6 1 correction resulted in correct plant water sourcing the results of our study show that the uncorrected cve bulk xylem water isotopic compositions resulted in biased plant water sourcing but the same data with 8 1 mean correc produced statistically unbiased plant water sourcing over five orchards and four sampling events the disagreement with the results of allen et al 2019 could be because our average δ2hoffset 10 23 is relatively similar to the 8 1 value in such cases plant water apportioning based on such corrected data can be expected to be comparable to the true value fig 7 however the sampling event can have a much higher δ2hoffset than 8 1 for example barbeta et al 2022 showed that the δ2h offset ranged from 12 to 29 i e δ2h offsets far 8 1 in this case more precaution should be taken when applying the 8 1 mean correc the δ2h offset was reduced to 4 43 4 48 following by the line correc and the resulting plant water sources differed significantly from that of sap water in one out of 80 cases with an rmse of 16 5 table 1 more specifically one case had a considerable δ2h offset which led to significant deviation of the plant water sourcing even after the line correc correction for example for orchard a on 21 sep the δ2h value of the cve bulk xylem water after the line correc correction was 72 2 1 6 while the cact sap water had a δ2h value of 62 2 1 9 table s3 therefore the method resulted in an δ2h offset value of 10 0 to put this number in perspective this δ2h offset value 10 0 was greater than most of the differences between the different soil layers 0 0 4 m 96 9 27 4 0 4 2 m 61 8 7 1 2 5 m 66 0 2 4 5 m 67 8 2 0 this is inconsistent with the study conducted by li et al 2021 who treated the average plant water apportioning results of multiple methods as the correct result and evaluated different input data for plant water sourcing as they did not have access to true plant water isotope information they could only judge how close the pwl was to the average result of multiple methods therefore the accuracy of the pwl results could not be evaluated in this study the swl was established based on four soil layers each of which was sampled at a sufficient resolution to cover all of the potential plant water sources however in many applications the number of samples may not be sufficient for establishing to establish a credible swl which may limit the application of line correc method in identifying plant water sources therefore when using the line correc method to correct the δ2h offset for plant water sourcing all of the potential plant water sources should be investigated the δ2h offset decreased to 0 44 3 69 after rehydr correction among the three correction methods the rehydr performed best and none of the 80 cases of plant water sourcing significantly differed from the sap water with an rmse of 13 8 table 1 however some issues still require caution a few studies have indicated that the δ2h offset can only be partially compensated for by the rehydr correction chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 chen et al 2020 obtained a linear relationship between the relative water content and hydrogen deviation through rehydration experiments this relationship may depend on the plant types organs and labeled water isotope concentrations wen et al 2022 due in part to their differing proportions of cellulose and the exchangeable hydrogen in the cellulose thus a single linear relationship between stem water content and hydrogen deviation may not apply to all possible environmental conditions wen et al 2022 in our rehydration experiments labeled water which had an isotopic composition similar to the local soil water sources was used to rehydrate the apple tree twigs to a state similar to that of the field plant samples therefore the linear relationship obtained in our study is representative of the field conditions as a result the rehydr correction method did not result in significantly different water sourcing results allen and kirchner 2022 wen et al 2021 therefore our study shows that the rehydr correction can be used for partitioning plant water sources 4 3 plant water obtained from centrifugation method and true sap water considerable attention has been paid to obtain all of the stem water by perfecting the cve extraction conditions millar et al 2018 orlowski et al 2016 however only the sap water transmitted in the vessels tracheids is the right water representing the soil water taken up by the roots cavitron centrifugation obtains the sap water by displacing the water with air du et al 2019 without any phase change therefore centrifugation methods are theoretically capable of extracting the true sap water without artificially introducing a bias in practice some tissue water is released from living cells at a high centrifugal speed 6 mpa tyree and yang 1990 and there is a potential bias in the extracted water recent experiments strongly support the conclusion that when an appropriate centrifugal speed is used the cact method can obtain representative sap water barbeta et al 2022 wen et al 2022 using pot grown experiments barbeta et al 2022 found that the cact sap water was consistent with the labeled irrigation water in a dual isotope plot wen et al 2022 also verified that the water extracted from the cact water from apple seedlings agreed well with the true plant water in field studies barbeta et al 2022 found that the cact sap water overlapped with the deep unbound soil water on the dual isotope plot when deep unbound soil water was the main pool accessed by the roots barbeta et al 2022 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the cavitron centrifugation method extracts the sap water 4 4 limitations and perspectives of this study our research contributes to the pressing need to evaluate different hydrogen correction methods to better understand plant water sourcing however we acknowledge that there are some limitations in this research and the applied correction methods as was previously discussed the species and the environmental conditions may alter the hydrogen offset barbeta et al 2019 wen et al 2022 our experiment was conducted on one species in a continental monsoon climate zone therefore verification of the three correction methods and the cavitron based extraction method needs to be conducted on more species and under different environmental conditions in addition our research wen et al 2022 this study shows that it may not be possible to obtain a universal correction equation that fits all tree species consequently our research does not provide a panacea for rescuing legacy cve data however it does suggest a possibility for a tree specific correction method which is significant given the wide application of cve undoubtedly more environments and species studies are needed before we can obtain more conclusive results chen et al 2020 obtained δ2hoffset of 8 1 by averaging the offsets from different species including those from xeric saline and mesic habitats this average was adopted by allen and kirchner 2022 and chen et al 2020 in their analyses our purpose was to test whether this average value which may be inevitably biased could be used to sufficiently correct the offset for water sourcing purposes however a rigorous test should be conducted using a wide selection of tree species 5 conclusions over 96 of the isotopic analyses to data have been based on cve or its variants however recent studies suggest that cve extracted bulk xylem water undergoes fractionation particularly fractionation of 2h it is urgent that the uncertainty induced by the offsets in plant water apportioning to be evaluated and reduced to this end for the first time we evaluated the three hydrogen correction methods that have been proposed in the literature based on true sap water obtained using the centrifugation method our results suggest that there could be substantial biases in cve extracted plant water however when the 8 1 mean correc and rehydr methods are applied the cve extracted bulk xylem water shows no statistical difference in the plant water apportioning compared to the true sap water this is very encouraging because cve has been the gold standard for plant water isotope analysis in the last few decades using these two correction methods the δ2h offset of the cve extracted bulk xylem water can be corrected and the data obtained in previous studies can be reevaluated we recommend that the rehydr and 8 1 mean correc methods be applied to cve bulk xylem water to identify plant water source because the cavitron centrifuge technique is widely accessible declaration of competing interest the authors

1877,cryogenic vacuum extraction cve the most popular method for obtaining xylem water for isotopic analysis of ecosystems is known to cause δ2h offset and may lead to biased inference on transpiration while δ2h offset correction methods have been proposed recently their accuracy in identifying plant water sources remains uncertain in this study capitalizing on the latest cavitron centrifuge technique cact we evaluated the accuracy of three current δ2h offset correction methods cve bulk xylem water after the 8 1 correction method 8 1 mean correc cve bulk xylem water after the soil water isotope line correction method line correc and cve bulk xylem water after the rehydration correction method rehydr for plant water source identification we tested the three correction approaches on five apple malus pumila mill orchards our results revealed that although δ18o values of the cve bulk xylem water and the cact sap water matched the δ2h values differed p 0 05 with a mean difference of 10 23 3 75 by applying the available correction methods to the cve bulk xylem water the δ2h offset was reduced to 2 13 3 75 8 1 mean correc 4 43 4 48 line correc and 0 44 3 69 rehydr the corrections also improved the z score however substantial δ2h offset variations remained after the corrections moreover when applying the corrected xylem water isotopic compositions in plant water apportioning analysis the line correc method resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in 1 out of 80 cases while the 8 1 mean correc 0 80 and rehydr 0 80 methods did not our results suggest that for the available correction methods for cryogenic extraction to reduce δ2h offsets the rehydr and 8 1 mean correc methods outperformed the line correc method in plant water source identification thus we recommended that the rehydr method and 8 1 mean correc method be used to identify plant water sources of cve extracted bulk xylem water keywords plant water source identification stable isotopes cryogenic vacuum extraction centrifuge technique δ2h offset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding the earth s water carbon and energy cycles requires a better understanding of plant root water uptake miguez macho and fan 2021 while some methods are available for characterizing plant root water uptake such as root excavation and heat tracing čermák and nadezhdina 2011 jarvis 1989 the use of isotope tracing techniques 2h and 18o and or 3h is by far the most significant methodological advancement nie et al 2012 tao et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the stable isotope method for identifying root water uptake assumes that the isotopic composition of plant stem water is a mix of the plant water sources in the soil and or groundwater barbeta and peñuelas 2017 dawson and ehleringer 1991 based on this assumption once we measure the isotopic composition of the plant water and soil water sources we can determine the proportion of the contribution from a soil water source or layer however measuring the isotopic composition of plant water directly is challenging hence extracting plant water is a prerequisite for determining the isotopic composition of the water conventional methods for extracting plant water include cryogenic vacuum extraction cve song and barbour 2016 centrifugation peters and yakir 2008 scholander type pressure chamber zuecco et al 2022 direct vapor equilibration magh et al 2022 microwave extraction munksgaard et al 2014 and high pressure mechanical squeezing millar et al 2018 mounting evidence indicates that there is isotopic heterogeneity in stem water pools barbeta et al 2022 zhao et al 2016 raising the question on which is the best proxy of the isotopic composition of plant water sources only the sap water that exchanges with the plant water reservoirs and is transmitted in the xylem vessel or tracheid is the actual water involved in plant transpiration therefore for plant water apportioning the correct water in the xylem should be the sap water the cve direct vapor equilibration and high pressure mechanical squeezing methods extract not only the vessel tracheid water in the plant but also the intercellular water zhao et al 2016 making them inappropriate for extracting sap water currently 96 of plant water isotope extractions have been implemented using the cve method de la casa et al 2022 the cve method and its variants rely on high temperature extraction and the resulting isotopic composition can be affected by hydrogen exchange between the xylem water and xylem tissues chen et al 2020 chen et al 2020 reported that there is a hydrogen offset between the stem water extracted via cve and the source water which is likely due to the dynamic exchange between the organic h and the free bulk xylem water during the cve as a result they questioned the reliability of the cve method for extracting the hydrogen composition of stem water and argued that without some sort of compensation for the offsets biased inferences can result several attempts have been made to correct the hydrogen offset in plant water sourcing allen and kirchner 2022 barbeta et al 2019 chen et al 2020 li et al 2021 first based on a mean hydrogen offset of 8 1 obtained across saline xeric and mesic species chen et al 2020 applied a uniform 8 1 correction to all plant water in a global dataset evaristo et al 2015 subsequently allen and kirchner 2022 applied similar average hydrogen offset to the data from four previous studies they showed that a 6 1 δ2h offset was large enough to substantially affect plant water sourcing in two cases allen et al 2019 kerhoulas et al 2013 while it did not make a difference in the remaining two cases dawson and ehleringer 1991 goldsmith et al 2012 second based on the concept of line condition excess lc excess barbeta et al 2019 and li et al 2021 proposed the concepts of soil water excess sw excess and potential water excess pw excess respectively the sw excess and pw excess are used to quantify the deviation in the dual isotope space between any sample and the soil potential water line swl pwl although li et al 2021 evaluated the effects of the pw excess method on plant water sourcing they did not analyze sap water which recent research suggests is a better proxy for the isotopic composition of water sources thus they could not assess the accuracy of their method third chen et al 2020 found a good linear relationship between the relative stem water content and hydrogen offset for different plants through a stem rehydration experiment thus they recommended that the linear stem rehydration linear curves of specific species be used to correct the hydrogen offset of the cve extracted stem water these three methods are simple and easy to implement but their relative performances in plant water sourcing remain uncertain this is because in order to compare the methods the isotopic composition of the true plant water is a prerequisite but it is difficult to obtain notably chen et al 2020 showed that the steady state transpiration water vapor obtained in an controlled environmental chamber was identical in isotopic composition to the fed labeled water this suggests that the isotopic signature of the true plant source can be obtained by collecting transpiration vapor however the required steady state conditions are difficult to maintain and implement for field plants recently barbeta et al 2022 found that stem cavitron centrifuge technique cact sap water was consistent with labeled water in potted irrigation experiments and the isotopic composition of the sap water matched that of the mobile deep soil water in the field experiment wen et al 2022 provided further evidence that cact sap water represents the true source water through rehydration experiments therefore the cact extracted sap water may serve as reference water in this study we evaluated whether the three proposed correction methods are sufficiently accurate for plant water partitioning specifically we address the following questions 1 how do the stable isotope results of the cact sap water and cve bulk xylem water compare 2 do the three correction methods reduce the hydrogen offset 3 do the three correction methods ultimately improve the cve for plant water sourcing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling our experiment was conducted on the southeastern chinese loess plateau 35 14 n 107 41e elevation of 1200 m and the study site was characterized by flat surfaces and silt loam soil texture fig 1 the soil was developed over the thick aeolian deposits accumulated since the pleistocene the site has a continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 579 mm from 1960 to 2016 of which 50 occurs from july to september the land use was traditional farmland and annual crops such as spring wheat and maize were mainly grown since the 1990s about half of the land area has been converted to rainfed apple orchards li et al 2019 the groundwater in the region is 80 m below the soil surface which is beyond the root zone and thus the groundwater does not participate in plant transpiration five apple orchards were selected as our experimental sites labeled sites a b c d and e these apple orchards were planted in 2013 a 2008 b 2005 c 2001 d and 1998 e on clear and sunny days during the growing season in 2021 soil and plant samples were collected from the five sites for isotope analysis at each site we selected four neighboring apple trees with similar growth forming a rectangle along the diagonals of this rectangle we collected one profile of soil samples the soil core was extracted to a sampling depth of 5 m using a special auger considering that the surface soil water isotope composition can be altered greatly by evaporation and precipitation the vertical soil core was split into four sections top soil sampling intervals of 10 cm in the upper 0 0 4 m shallow sub soil sampling intervals of 20 cm in the 0 4 2 m soil layer deep soil 2 5 m sampling intervals of 1 m below 2 m and extremely deep soil 5 m soil layer we calculated the average isotopic composition of each soil layer by taking a volumetric water content weighted average of the measured isotopic compositions of all of the sampling intervals within that layer since seasonal precipitation water typically cannot reach the extremely deep soil and root water uptake does not alter the isotopic composition of the soil water we assumed that the isotopic composition of soil water in the 5 m soil layer remained unchanged during the study period consequently the isotopic values of extremely deep soil water collected in 2016 were used in this study tao et al 2021 the collected soil was partitioned into two parts one was placed in an aluminum box to obtain the soil water content via the oven drying method and the other was placed in a 100 ml polyethylene bottle and sealed with parafilm transported to the laboratory and stored at 20 c prior to the water extraction to measure the plant water isotopic composition four one year old twigs were collected from the selected four trees in an orchard the sampling generally took place in the afternoon when high sap flow velocity occurs the obtained twig sample was then wrapped in parafilm and stored in a container with ice packs to prevent evaporation the samples were then transported to the laboratory for immediate water extraction in addition to soil and plant samples the site for precipitation collection was located 2 km away from the study area at an elevation of 1200 m daily precipitation water samples directly flowed into a bottle connected to a funnel and a ping pong ball was placed in the funnel to avoid evaporation lu et al 2020 the precipitation samples were immediately transported to the lab filtered using a filter head and disposable syringe and analyzed to determine their isotopic compositions xiang et al 2020 the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed from precipitation isotope data collected daily from 2019 to 2021 in the experimental area 2 2 water extraction and analytical methods water from the soil samples was extracted using a cve system koeniger et al 2011 the soil samples were loaded into 12 ml exetainers labco ltd uk and were gradually heated to 205 c for 0 5 h with a system pressure of 10 pa the water collection bottle was connected through a 1 5 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle to a sample bottle that was immersed in liquid nitrogen the sample bottle was inserted into a customized heating module that was immersed in high temperature silicone oil the recovery rate was obtained by placing the post extraction sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the samples were discarded if the extraction efficiency was outside the range of 98 102 the isotopic compositions of the extracted water were measured using an off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy water isotope analyzer lgr iwa 45ep los gatos research san jose ca usa with measurement accuracies of 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the gravimetric soil water content of the soil samples was measured via oven drying at 105 c for 24 h a centrifugation method was used to extract plant sap water there are two types of such centrifuges du et al 2019 one is called cavitron which was remodeled based on an allegra x 22r beckman coulter at the university of vermont machine shop and the other is the chinatron remodeled after a model h2100r centrifuge in cooperation with xiang yi lab instr co ltd both centrifuges were developed to produce a vulnerability curve based on the cavitron technique for tree physiology the chinatron centrifuge was adopted in our research and it is referred to as the cavitron centrifuge technique with a rotor diameter of 30 cm the required twig length was 27 4 cm after cutting 2 cm from both twig ends before centrifugation each twig sample was inserted into a cuvette with the top wrapped in parafilm to avoid evaporation following the method of barbeta et al 2022 the centrifugal temperature was set at 10 c with a centrifugal time of 2 min and centrifugal speed of 7636 rpm 6 mpa subsequently the centrifuged plant water was collected into the sample bottle through a disposable syringe and it is referred to as sap water the plant water extracted using the cact is hereinafter referred to as the cact sap water the water samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to the isotope analyses we also extracted the plant water using cve after cutting off the 27 4 cm centrifugation part of the twigs the remaining twigs were rapidly peeled to remove leaves bark and phloem and were then placed into an exetainer the plant water extracted via cve is referred to as the bulk xylem water referred to as the cve bulk xylem water the cve had a distillation temperature of 105 c distillation time of 3 h and vacuum pressure of 10 pa to avoid spectral contamination introduced by organic compounds an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms 253 plus thermo fisher scientific inc bremen germany was used to analyze the isotopic compositions of the bulk xylem and sap water 2 3 δ2h offset correction methods 2 3 1 δ2h offset average correction method 8 1 method i e the 8 1 mean correc chen et al 2020 measured the hydrogen offsets δ2hoffset i e the difference between true δ2h δ2htrue and the cve measured δ2h δ2hcve of nine tree species the δ2hoffset ranged from 10 9 to 5 2 with an average of 8 1 1 δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve 8 1 where δ2hcorrection is the hydrogen isotope value after correction δ2hoffset 8 1 was used as the correction value in a recent study allen and kirchner 2022 2 3 2 soil water line method line correc inspired by the concept of lc excess barbeta et al 2019 defined the offset of the hydrogen isotopes between the xylem and soil water as the sw excess 2 sw e x c e s s δ 2 h a s δ 18 o b s where as and bs are the slope and intercept of soil water isotope line swl respectively considering that groundwater and rainwater can be sources of plant water li et al 2021 proposed the pw excess concept of hydrogen isotope offset between multiple potential water sources and plant water 3 pw e x c e s s δ 2 h a p δ 18 o b p δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve p w e x c e s s where ap and bp are the slope and intercept of the multiple potential water isotope lines pwl respectively for each sampling event in each orchard the soil water isotope values of the four soil layers were fitted using a linear equation therefore each orchard had a specific slope ap and intercept bp for each sampling event table s1 because the groundwater in our experimental site was deeper than the maximum rooting depth and there was no irrigation the soil water was the only water source for the plants therefore sw excess pw excess and the swl can be fitted to the δ2h and δ18o data for the different sampling events table s1 2 3 3 rehydration method rehydr spike experiment approximately 500 g of apple twig material was collected from the experimental trees the bark and phloem were removed and the twig was cut into 1 2 cm segments then plant materials were placed in 12 ml glass exetainer vials labco ltd uk and sealed for transportation to the lab the samples were oven dried at 105 c for at least 24 h chen et al 2020 after being oven dried and cooled to room temperature we added labeled water with a known isotopic composition δ2h 69 29 δ18o 9 46 to the glass exetainer vials labco ltd uk the specific amount of water added to each sample was calculated according to the designed gravimetric water contents 40 60 80 100 and saturation after reaching equilibrium at 4 c for 10 days the water in the rehydrated branches was extracted using the cve method the specific cve process is described in section 2 2 the deviations between the extracted plant water and labeled water were then calculated for the different stem water contents θstem the linear relationship between the stem water content swc and hydrogen deviation δ2hoffset was fitted to the measured data fig 2 three replicates were performed for each water content for a total of 15 samples the r2 value of the relationship between the δ2hoffset and stem water content was 0 889 fig 2 4 δ 2 h offset a s w c b δ 2 h correction δ 2 h cve δ 2 h offset where a and b are the slope and intercept of the fitted line of the stem water content and hydrogen offset respectively a 5 855 b 13 776 δ2hoffset is the deviation between the plant water isotope values extracted via cve and the isotopic values of the labeled water all of the samples were corrected based on the stem water content following the established calibration relationship between stem water content and hydrogen offset some of the biases from the rehydration experiment were large due in part to the variability of the actual exchangeable hydrogen among the different organs chen et al 2020 schimmelmann 1991 the z score values reflect the isotopic deviation between the sap water and these xylem waters using the assigned measurement accuracy orlowski et al 2016 we calculated the z score for each of the corrected and uncorrected xylem water as follows 5 z δ sap δ xylem μ where δsap is the δ2h or δ18o value of the extracted cact sap water and δxylem is the δ2h or δ18o value of the cve xylem water including the uncorrected bulk xylem water 8 1 mean corrected bulk xylem water line corrected bulk xylem water and rehydr corrected bulk xylem water the measurement accuracies μ were set to 2 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o via irms absolute z scores of 2 2 5 and 5 were deemed to be acceptable questionable and unacceptable respectively wassenaar et al 2012 2 4 isotopic mixing model for quantification of tree water sources the relative contributions of the different soil layers to the apple tree root water uptake were calculated using the mixsiar statistical package which has a general bayesian framework stock and semmens 2013 based on the influences of evaporation rainfall and infiltration on the soil water isotopes the soil profile was divided into four layers 0 0 4 m 0 4 2 m 2 5 m and 5 m in this study tao et al 2021 plant water was used as the mixed source data for root water uptake and the soil water in the different layers was used as the potential water source data assuming no fractionation during the root water uptake and transport chen et al 2020 the fractionation parameter was set to 0 the length of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter in the mixsiar model was set to very long as the convergence condition the error structure was set using the residual process the mixing model error structures were caused by a combination of the process and residual errors furthermore the performance of residual process is a more ecologically realistic assumption stock and semmens 2016 in addition the root distribution and available soil water content were used as prior information to reduce the model uncertainty the fine root length density distribution in the soil profile was obtained in november 2020 assuming that the soil water content of aged orchards was the lowest limit of the root water uptake the available soil water content was obtained by subtracting the lower limit from the soil water content profile of the orchards in that year the average available soil water content and the average fine root length density within each layer are listed in table s2 and they were used as the weights for the isotopic compositions of the layers in the model to evaluate the effects of the hydrogen deviation correction methods on the calculation of the plant water source partitioning three corrected methods eqs 1 4 were compared with the cact sap water δ2h and δ18o and cve bulk xylem water δ2h and δ18o the dual isotope of the cact sap water was used as the true plant water the student s t test was used to detect the mean difference between the two groups with a confidence level of 95 the plant water source identification using different hydrogen deviation correction methods was evaluated using the root mean squared error rmse 6 rmse j 1 n y j y j λ n where yj and y j λ are the proportional contributions of the different soil layers to the dual sap water isotope and one of the three hydrogen correction methods respectively the paired t test was used to determine whether the cve bulk xylem water was significantly different from the cact sap water we also performed linear regression between the offsets and stem water content the statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 or t 1 96 all of the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics ibm spss statistics for windows version 26 0 the difference between the contributions of the two extracted plant waters in each of the four soil layers was also tested using the t test 7 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means and σ x and σ y are the standard errors of variables x and y respectively the statistical tests were considered significant when t 1 96 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 stable isotopic compositions of soil water sap water and xylem water the stable isotopic compositions of the soil water from the five sampling sites had similar distribution patterns with depth table s3 taking site c as an example the isotopic compositions of the soil water in the 0 0 4 and 0 4 2 m intervals were generally more enriched in heavy isotopes than the soil water in the 2 5 m and 5 m layers fig 3 a c below 2 m the isotopic composition of the soil water was stable because the isotopic composition of 2 5 m layer was similar to that of the 5 m soil layer moreover there were strong temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the shallow soil water in the dry period such as 30 june fig 3a the water isotopic composition of the 0 0 4 m layer was enriched in heavy isotopes relative to the other soil layers however in the wet periods such as 21 sep fig 3d the soil water in the 0 0 4 m layer was more depleted in heavy isotopes than the 0 4 m soil layer due to infiltration of depleted precipitation water all of the isotopic compositions of the sap water fell within the ranges of the soil water isotopes fig 3 the sap water and xylem water showed considerable variability in terms of the hydrogen isotopic offsets among the four sampling events and five sites with δ2h offsets ranging from 15 34 to 2 35 fig 4 a the hydrogen isotope composition of the sap water was greater than that of the xylem water p 0 05 for most of the sampling events and sites fig 4a the resulting hydrogen offsets between the xylem and sap water were statistically different from zero among all of the sites and sampling events p 0 05 however the mean oxygen isotope value of all of the sap water samples did not differ from that of the xylem water p 0 05 the oxygen offsets between the sap water and xylem water for the sampling events were consistently small in magnitude fig 4b most of the oxygen offsets were not statistically different from zero p 0 05 and were within the precision of the irms 0 2 3 2 compensations of three hydrogen correction methods fig 5 shows the δ2h values of the sap water bulk xylem water and the three corrected waters pooled across all of the sampling data the hydrogen isotopic composition of sap water did not differ significantly from that of the bulk xylem water after the 8 1 mean correc or rehydr correction p 0 05 but it did differ from that of the bulk xylem water after the line correc correction p 0 05 the bulk xylem water was significantly different from the sap water and the three corrected bulk xylem waters p 0 05 fig 5 the bulk xylem water corrected using the 8 1 and rehydration corrections was much closer to the sap water in terms of the δ2h value the δ2h offset was reduced to 2 13 3 75 mean value standard deviation by the 8 1 mean correc method and to 0 44 3 69 by the rehydr method however the line correc correction method performed poorly with an δ2h offset of 4 43 4 48 after correction the four xylem waters had a considerable number of z score points within the questionable range fig 6 for the uncorrected xylem water more than half of the z score points were within the unacceptable range fig 6a correction using any of the three methods substantially reduced the number of z scores within the unacceptable range and increased the number z score points within the acceptable region however more than a third of the points still fell within in the questionable range fig 6b d for the rehydr method 35 7 of the rehydr corrected data still fell within the questionable range and one point within the unacceptable range this was the lowest number among the three methods in this sense the rehydr performed the best among the three correction methods 3 3 performances of three correction methods in identification of plant water sources the proportional contributions of the different soil layers to transpiration varied significantly among the cact sap water cve bulk xylem water and cve bulk xylem water after correction using the three methods mentioned above fig 7 the performances of the correction methods varied among the multiple sampling events fig 7 for convenience we defined the proportional contribution of each soil layer among the different sites and sampling events as a case with a total of 80 cases first 8 75 7 out of 80 of the cve bulk xylem water samples differed significantly in the plant water partitioning compared to the cact sap water p 0 05 however after correction using any of the three methods the percentage was substantially reduced 0 0 out of 80 cases after 8 1 mean correc correction 1 25 1 out of 80 cases after line correc correction and 0 0 out of 80 cases after rehydr correction table 1 the three hydrogen correction methods yielded smaller rmses 13 8 16 5 than the cve method table 1 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic offsets between bulk xylem water and sap water the sap water was relatively enriched in δ2h compared to the xylem water δ2hxylem δ2hsap 0 fig 4a the reason for the δ2h offset may be twofold first stem water has different pools of water and each pool has a distinct δ2h value barbeta et al 2022 this is because cellulosic fibers and hydrophilic organics preferentially adsorb lighter plant water leaving the relatively heavier sap water to migrate in the vessel or tracheid creating stem δ2h isotopic heterogeneity chen et al 2016 second dynamic exchange of 1h and 2h between the plant cellulose and ambient water occurs during cve chen et al 2020 as a result the lighter 1h in the stem cellulose is transferred to the sap and tissue water filot et al 2006 which is subsequently extracted via cve the progressive evaporation during cve preferentially removes the 1h in the sap and tissue water enhancing the transfer of 1h from the cellulose to the sap and tissue water xylem water consequently cve makes the extracted plant water more depleted than the true sap and tissue water wen et al 2022 moreover there are two potential h exchange pathways one process occurs during rehydration and the other occurs during the extraction process diao et al 2022 for the twig samples obtained from the orchard under ambient conditions the exchangeable h in the stem organic matter had already reached isotopic equilibrium with the bulk xylem water through isotopic exchange however during the extraction the bulk xylem water was progressively evaporated and enriched in heavier isotopes which perturbed the isotopic equilibrium between the bulk xylem water and cell tissue this created a large concentration difference between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water additionally the temperature was as high as 105 during the extraction and the higher temperature increased the kinetic energy of the participating molecules thereby facilitating the isotope exchange reaction clark and fritz 1997 wen et al 2022 therefore the hydrogen exchange during the extraction process due to the high temperature and enhanced concentration difference between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water may have caused the isotopic offset diao et al 2022 demonstrated the obvious hydrogen exchange due to the rehydration process when the absolute water volume was small whereas when the absolute water volume was 1 ml the δ2h offset values due to rehydration tended to be stable δ2h offset of stem powder or stem cellulose powder close to 5 10 with a magnitude similar to those presented by chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 in addition the δ2h offset of celluslose triacetate and caffeine no cellulose was close to zero when the absolute water volume was 1 ml diao et al 2022 based on this we can reasonably assume that the hydrogen exchange of the cellulose occurred during the extraction process not during the rehydration phase in the rehydr method this dominated the cve induced hydrogen exchange and δ2h offsets in our study when the extracted water volume was 1 ml however our experiments suggest that the use of relatively small water volumes 1 ml for isotope analysis could result in hydrogen offset yu et al 2023 minor revisions and the obtained relationship between the isotopic deviation and absolute amount of extracted water measured via the vapour liquid equilibrium method matches the theory of rayleigh fractionation the effects of rehydration on the isotopic deviation presented in diao et al 2022 may by more pronounced when the extracted water volume is small in our study the amount of plant water 1 ml extracted from the field samples was much greater than that in study conducted by diao et al 2022 as such our results were not as greatly affected by the rehydration process as those of diao et al 2022 based on the above reasoning we concluded that the hydrogen exchange in the extraction process was the primary cause of the hydrogen bias when the volume of the extracted bulk xylem water was relatively large 1 ml this is consistent with the conclusion of chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 who suggested that the extraction process was the primary cause of the δ2h bias however this should be verified through further experiments which is beyond the scope of this study the average value of the δ2h offsets ranged from 15 34 to 2 35 fig 4a this large variability which was also reported by chen et al 2020 who found larger offsets for drier samples could not be explained solely by the stem water contents similar to barbeta et al 2022 we have shown that there is a non significant relationship between the bulk stem water and observed δ2h offset under field conditions fig s1 we conclude that the large variability of the δ2h offsets and their poor relationship with the stem water content are the collective result of the spatial variability of the tree hydraulics and the hydrogen exchange between the cell tissue and bulk xylem water during both the rehydration and extraction processes first the specific conductivity ks varies greatly between apple trees with a maximum difference of 0 5 kg m mpa 1 s 1 wang et al unpublished the distinct hydraulic tree traits can result in differing degrees of mixing varied residence time of xylem water and water sources from different soil depths due to differing root architecture bowers and williams 2022 obviously the greater the difference in the isotopic composition between the source water and cell tissue is the larger the δ2h offset is and the xylem water contents may not play a role in this case second the lower the stem water content is the larger the hydrogen offset between the extracted plant water and source water is which is supported by the results of chen et al 2020 and wen et al 2022 obtained through rehydration experiments in the lab and by those of bowers and williams 2022 obtained through field experiments the relationship between the xylem water content and the δ2h offset obtained through rehydration experiments is much stronger than the relationship obtained by sampling trees from the field as is the case for our field samples fig s1 this may be explained by the fact that the branch samples in our rehydration experiments were wetted with the same water source and were given enough time to equilibrate the water extracted through cve from those samples would have little variability due to the variable water source and differing degree of mixing between the cell water and sap water compared to field samples therefore our rehydr method cannot correct for the biases resulting from the field variability of the water sources and the xylem hydraulics but it can be used to correct δ2h offsets due to cve however the correction equation obtained from our rehydr method may be specific to branches of apple tree species as a previous study demonstrated that 30 of the hydrogen in pure cellulose is hydroxyl hydrogen epstein et al 1976 which can easily exchange with that in ambient water filot et al 2006 however cellulose is a fibrous closely knit agglomerate of biopolymers in practice and hence not all of the o h bonds are physically accessible for exchange with ambient water schimmelmann 1991 therefore the magnitude of the δ2h offset may be affected by the percentage of the exchangeable hydroxyl hydrogen in the cellulose epstein et al 1976 wilson and grinsted 1977 which may vary between plant species organs and organ water contents resulting in variability of δ2h offsets however we suspect that for branches from different trees of the same species the percentage of exchangeable hydroxyl hydrogen may not vary as much and thus the rehydr method can be used to correct for the δ2h offsets of branch samples from apple trees remarkably the oxygen isotopes of the sap water and xylem water did not differ significantly and the oxygen offset was virtually negligible fig 4b this is supported by the results of previous studies barbeta et al 2022 chen et al 2020 4 2 validation of the correction methods for plant water source identification surprisingly when applied to plant water sourcing fig 7 none of the 8 1 mean correc corrected water caused significantly biased water sourcing and the rmse was only 14 8 table 1 the rmse is very close to the average uncertainty for the bayesian mixing model 14 evaristo et al 2017 this suggests that the 8 1 mean correc is practically reliable for water source partitioning for the apple trees we studied during the sampling season this is in partial agreement with the results of allen and kirchner 2022 based on four previous studies they showed that an δ2hoffset of 6 1 8 1 was also used as a bias correction value in allen and kirchner 2022 s revised edit and the results did not differ for 6 1 and 8 1 was large enough to substantially affect plant water sourcing in two out of four cases allen et al 2019 dawson and ehleringer 1991 goldsmith et al 2012 kerhoulas et al 2013 however due to the lack of a true value they could not evaluate whether the δ2hoffset 6 1 correction resulted in correct plant water sourcing the results of our study show that the uncorrected cve bulk xylem water isotopic compositions resulted in biased plant water sourcing but the same data with 8 1 mean correc produced statistically unbiased plant water sourcing over five orchards and four sampling events the disagreement with the results of allen et al 2019 could be because our average δ2hoffset 10 23 is relatively similar to the 8 1 value in such cases plant water apportioning based on such corrected data can be expected to be comparable to the true value fig 7 however the sampling event can have a much higher δ2hoffset than 8 1 for example barbeta et al 2022 showed that the δ2h offset ranged from 12 to 29 i e δ2h offsets far 8 1 in this case more precaution should be taken when applying the 8 1 mean correc the δ2h offset was reduced to 4 43 4 48 following by the line correc and the resulting plant water sources differed significantly from that of sap water in one out of 80 cases with an rmse of 16 5 table 1 more specifically one case had a considerable δ2h offset which led to significant deviation of the plant water sourcing even after the line correc correction for example for orchard a on 21 sep the δ2h value of the cve bulk xylem water after the line correc correction was 72 2 1 6 while the cact sap water had a δ2h value of 62 2 1 9 table s3 therefore the method resulted in an δ2h offset value of 10 0 to put this number in perspective this δ2h offset value 10 0 was greater than most of the differences between the different soil layers 0 0 4 m 96 9 27 4 0 4 2 m 61 8 7 1 2 5 m 66 0 2 4 5 m 67 8 2 0 this is inconsistent with the study conducted by li et al 2021 who treated the average plant water apportioning results of multiple methods as the correct result and evaluated different input data for plant water sourcing as they did not have access to true plant water isotope information they could only judge how close the pwl was to the average result of multiple methods therefore the accuracy of the pwl results could not be evaluated in this study the swl was established based on four soil layers each of which was sampled at a sufficient resolution to cover all of the potential plant water sources however in many applications the number of samples may not be sufficient for establishing to establish a credible swl which may limit the application of line correc method in identifying plant water sources therefore when using the line correc method to correct the δ2h offset for plant water sourcing all of the potential plant water sources should be investigated the δ2h offset decreased to 0 44 3 69 after rehydr correction among the three correction methods the rehydr performed best and none of the 80 cases of plant water sourcing significantly differed from the sap water with an rmse of 13 8 table 1 however some issues still require caution a few studies have indicated that the δ2h offset can only be partially compensated for by the rehydr correction chen et al 2020 wen et al 2022 chen et al 2020 obtained a linear relationship between the relative water content and hydrogen deviation through rehydration experiments this relationship may depend on the plant types organs and labeled water isotope concentrations wen et al 2022 due in part to their differing proportions of cellulose and the exchangeable hydrogen in the cellulose thus a single linear relationship between stem water content and hydrogen deviation may not apply to all possible environmental conditions wen et al 2022 in our rehydration experiments labeled water which had an isotopic composition similar to the local soil water sources was used to rehydrate the apple tree twigs to a state similar to that of the field plant samples therefore the linear relationship obtained in our study is representative of the field conditions as a result the rehydr correction method did not result in significantly different water sourcing results allen and kirchner 2022 wen et al 2021 therefore our study shows that the rehydr correction can be used for partitioning plant water sources 4 3 plant water obtained from centrifugation method and true sap water considerable attention has been paid to obtain all of the stem water by perfecting the cve extraction conditions millar et al 2018 orlowski et al 2016 however only the sap water transmitted in the vessels tracheids is the right water representing the soil water taken up by the roots cavitron centrifugation obtains the sap water by displacing the water with air du et al 2019 without any phase change therefore centrifugation methods are theoretically capable of extracting the true sap water without artificially introducing a bias in practice some tissue water is released from living cells at a high centrifugal speed 6 mpa tyree and yang 1990 and there is a potential bias in the extracted water recent experiments strongly support the conclusion that when an appropriate centrifugal speed is used the cact method can obtain representative sap water barbeta et al 2022 wen et al 2022 using pot grown experiments barbeta et al 2022 found that the cact sap water was consistent with the labeled irrigation water in a dual isotope plot wen et al 2022 also verified that the water extracted from the cact water from apple seedlings agreed well with the true plant water in field studies barbeta et al 2022 found that the cact sap water overlapped with the deep unbound soil water on the dual isotope plot when deep unbound soil water was the main pool accessed by the roots barbeta et al 2022 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the cavitron centrifugation method extracts the sap water 4 4 limitations and perspectives of this study our research contributes to the pressing need to evaluate different hydrogen correction methods to better understand plant water sourcing however we acknowledge that there are some limitations in this research and the applied correction methods as was previously discussed the species and the environmental conditions may alter the hydrogen offset barbeta et al 2019 wen et al 2022 our experiment was conducted on one species in a continental monsoon climate zone therefore verification of the three correction methods and the cavitron based extraction method needs to be conducted on more species and under different environmental conditions in addition our research wen et al 2022 this study shows that it may not be possible to obtain a universal correction equation that fits all tree species consequently our research does not provide a panacea for rescuing legacy cve data however it does suggest a possibility for a tree specific correction method which is significant given the wide application of cve undoubtedly more environments and species studies are needed before we can obtain more conclusive results chen et al 2020 obtained δ2hoffset of 8 1 by averaging the offsets from different species including those from xeric saline and mesic habitats this average was adopted by allen and kirchner 2022 and chen et al 2020 in their analyses our purpose was to test whether this average value which may be inevitably biased could be used to sufficiently correct the offset for water sourcing purposes however a rigorous test should be conducted using a wide selection of tree species 5 conclusions over 96 of the isotopic analyses to data have been based on cve or its variants however recent studies suggest that cve extracted bulk xylem water undergoes fractionation particularly fractionation of 2h it is urgent that the uncertainty induced by the offsets in plant water apportioning to be evaluated and reduced to this end for the first time we evaluated the three hydrogen correction methods that have been proposed in the literature based on true sap water obtained using the centrifugation method our results suggest that there could be substantial biases in cve extracted plant water however when the 8 1 mean correc and rehydr methods are applied the cve extracted bulk xylem water shows no statistical difference in the plant water apportioning compared to the true sap water this is very encouraging because cve has been the gold standard for plant water isotope analysis in the last few decades using these two correction methods the δ2h offset of the cve extracted bulk xylem water can be corrected and the data obtained in previous studies can be reevaluated we recommend that the rehydr and 8 1 mean correc methods be applied to cve bulk xylem water to identify plant water source because the cavitron centrifuge technique is widely accessible declaration of competing interest the authors

the number of model scenarios that can feasibly be run to test alternative management scenarios under climate change machine learning ml techniques have been used to capture complex nonlinear hydrologic dynamics in other contexts but to our knowledge there have not been efforts to use ml to increase computational efficiency in modeling groundwater responses to agricultural water use we use extreme gradient boosting to replace the groundwater sub model for the wrb decision support tool resulting in accurate estimates of reservoir storage monthly error almost always 5 of reservoir capacity streamflow total outflow errors from 3 to 20 depending on scenario and agricultural water shortages 12 to 18 error in total shortage depending on scenario for comparison we found that omitting groundwater modeling from the wam results in a larger overprediction of outflows 2 to 58 and underprediction in agricultural water shortages 0 to 41 across a range of scenarios we use this validated ml method to explore the sensitivity of agricultural water availability to a range of streamflow volumes and streamflow timings results indicate that agricultural water shortages are more sensitive to annual streamflow volume in comparison to shifts in streamflow timing our model shows that reservoirs can buffer the impact of altered flow timing on agricultural production except under extreme conditions in which all precipitation falls as rain no snow storage and streamflow peaks in the winter future work will explore these thresholds in more detail while the results here are site

a need to assess hydro economic vulnerability of the current system to anticipated streamflow changes and develop climate adaptation strategies for competing water users in this region adger et al

larson and spinazola 2004 wurbs 2020 aliyari et al 2021 the computational time required to run fully coupled models can limit the number of climate scenarios investigated to improve computational efficiency we propose a method for using machine learning ml as a fast and accurate way to capture surface groundwater interactions within a wam ml has been increasing in popularity for modeling complex hydrologic systems that previously relied on computationally intensive physically based models examples include modeling groundwater level responses to land use majumdar et al 2020 sahoo et al

ni et al 2020 and capturing stream aquifer interactions in agricultural basins triana et al 2005 ml has multiple advantages over other statistical models such as linear regression since ml models can capture nonlinear dynamics and do not rely on a priori assumptions about the specific relationship between the dependent variable and its predictors shen 2018 however statistical models including ml do not implicitly incorporate physical processes while methods exist for incorporating physical constraints into hybrid physical ml models jiang et al 2020 such approaches come at the expense of model flexibility and computation time pure ml models can potentially produce outputs that are not physically possible and potentially have difficulties capturing changes to a system when model inputs are not within the range of the training data therefore it is important to test ml models in terms of their ability to realistically represent situations outside of the training dataset shen 2018 the objective of this research is to explore numerically efficient ml options to replace a physically based three dimensional and fully transient groundwater model that is dynamically coupled with a wam we test the approach in a representative western us agricultural basin dependent on snowmelt that is expected to see shifts in upland hydrology related to changing climate we explore the ability of ml to represent stream water accretions and depletions from groundwater we then verify the wam s ability to represent reservoir storage agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water supply and streamflow exiting the basin across a range of upstream flow conditions when the wam is coupled with ml lastly we demonstrate a use case of this coupled model by using a suite of model runs to test the sensitivity of agricultural shortages and reservoir storage to hypothetical streamflow reductions and timing shifts given contemporary water infrastructure and water rights structures 2

mountains along the basin s southwestern edge and flows north northeast before terminating in walker lake elevations range from 1218 to 3747 m climate at high elevations is humid continental cold winters with heavy precipitation while latitude desert conditions arid hot summers occur at walker lake annual precipitation ranges from 1 8 m at the highest elevations to 0 11 m in the lower elevations to the east prism climate group 2014 temperatures are highly seasonal see supporting information si figure s1b ranging from 6 c in december to 34 c in july at yerington nevada elevation

figure s1a c stream water supports irrigated agriculture in bridgeport antelope smith and mason valleys for the period of model development 1996 2011 alfalfa was the dominant crop but other irrigated agriculture includes corn garlic grains grass hay onions and other vegetables collopy thomas 2016 topaz lake and bridgeport reservoir act as managed storage for streamflow along the east and west forks of the walker river respectively surface water for irrigation is diverted from the river through a series of ditches based on a complex system of permits and seniority water rights are classified as decree storage or flood water and each landowner can hold one or more types of surface water rights for a given place of use the level of seniority dictates when the water can be diverted for a given set of fields and can only be diverted once water for higher seniority rights has been allocated aka prior appropriations doctrine in addition to surface diversions groundwater pumping occurs in the wrb to support agricultural demand full groundwater rights are divorced from surface diversions while supplemental groundwater rights are tied to surface diversions such that they support agriculture when streamflow is low as an example carroll et al 2010 estimated groundwater pumping in mason valley as 13 to 27 of irrigated water during a wet year and 50 to 57 during a dry year walker river basin water management is representative of many agricultural areas in the southwest in its reliance both on groundwater and on highly variable streamflow from snow dominated headwaters as well as its use of artificial reservoirs to reconcile the fact that peak water demand occurs during the season of lowest precipitation 2 2 description of individual sub models the existing decision support tool collopy thomas 2016 is a dynamically coupled wam and three dimensional groundwater model we discuss these sub models separately before discussing the existing coupled model and our updated model which combines the wam with ml 2 2 1 water allocation model modsim modsim software is a wam which simulates river flows and reservoir operations labadie 2011 surface water is routed through a network of nodes connected by links identifying flow paths by which water can be moved from one node to another for our case study these links represent a specific segment of a

consumptive water use or drainage into the subsurface stored for later release i e a reservoir or water can simply pass through the node and be distributed to the next link s downstream water rights are represented by varying the cost of sending water through a given link for the wrb modsim minimizes the total cost of moving water through the network based on the prior appropriations doctrine the wrb is simulated with monthly timesteps using temperature and precipitation data from noaa weather stations www ncdc noaa gov station id 269229 in yerington nv and station id 267612 in smith nv inflows from the west walker river near coleville figure s1a and desert creek are defined using u s geological survey usgs gages 10296500 and 10299100 respectively while inflows above bridgeport reservoir were derived using a water balance based on reservoir outflows at gage 10293000 and storage levels measured at usgs site 10292500 fig 1 these three inflow locations form the upstream limit of our wam target storage in the two major reservoirs bridgeport and topaz can be forced to historical observations but we allow the model to estimate maximum storage volume after accounting for evaporation from the reservoir surface and optimizing agricultural water needs forced water releases in excess of crop demand occur when reservoir stage exceeds its maximum 8 m above deadpool for topaz and 14 m for bridgeport a high priority instream flow requirement immediately below each reservoir keeps modeled reservoir releases from dropping to zero though if reservoir stage reaches deadpool elevation then releases are limited to monthly inflows minus reservoir evaporation surface water diversions for agriculture are largely located in smith valley and mason valley estimated demands at each diversion location are calculated based on estimated crop water requirements huntington allen 2010 si section 2 after accounting for irrigation efficiency and ditch leakage diversions are limited by water availability and water rights priority accretions from groundwater to the surface water system are represented as water being added to the modsim node at the downstream end of the stream or irrigation ditch segment link where the accretion takes place similarly surface water losses back to the groundwater depletions are represented via water being removed from the node located at the downstream end of the link from which the water is depleted following each modsim iteration a spatially distributed water balance calculation estimates pumping aquifer recharge and surface runoff for each ditch service area the modsim model assumes that surface water shortages demand minus diversions for each ditch service area will be made up via pumping up to the maximum legal annual limit of four feet per year applied to each acre aquifer recharge and surface runoff are calculated as calibrated percentages of total water applied to each field the estimated agricultural surface runoff is added to surface water flow downstream of the fields where it was generated and this additional surface water flow is then available for diversion in the next modsim iteration streamflow

by collopy thomas 2016 2 2 2 groundwater model modflow the walker river is highly seasonal in its hydrology and has significant groundwater development gallagher 2004 huxel harris 1969 these factors result in heterogenous groundwater surface water interactions in both space and time to capture the basin s complex hydrology modsim s simplified groundwater flux estimates were replaced with two physically based three dimensional groundwater models developed for those agricultural regions smith and mason valleys in the wrb with extensive pumping to meet agricultural demand see model extents in fig 1 carroll et al 2010 provides a comprehensive description of the modeling approach in brief the groundwater model uses modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the finite difference grid is at the 100 m grid resolution with three vertical layers to capture alluvial aquifer geology monthly stress periods simulate groundwater surface interactions between the river and aquifer system to estimate gaining and losing conditions prudic et al 2004 the model accounts for mountain block recharge interbasin groundwater flow phreatophyte evapotranspiration groundwater pumping for irrigation surface diversions and associated return flows to the stream network diversion ditch conveyance losses and irrigation recharge mountain block recharge is constant while interbasin flow is simulated as general head boundary conditions for all modflow runs while fluxes related to pumping surface water diversions etc vary depending on modsim outputs excess water applied to fields is calculated as the applied water from surface and groundwater sources less the crop type irrigation water requirement huntington allen 2010 the partitioning of excess irrigation water to either recharge or drain return flow was part of the groundwater model calibration to match observed stream water gains and losses this model has been previously validated using groundwater levels as well as observed river flows and diversions carroll et al 2010 2 2 3 machine learning ml the main focus of the present study is to create an ml sub model to predict net accretion depletion of water to from nodes in the modsim model network we use accretions and depletions modeled by modflow for model training and validation the modflow run uses observed inflows and weather for 1996 2011 and is dynamically coupled with modsim for calculation of groundwater pumping aquifer recharge and surface water flows see sections 2 2 2 and 2 3 1 we train the ml sub model on ten years of modflow output water years 1999 2008 retaining six years 1996 1998 and 2009 2011 as testing data for model validation these time periods were chosen to ensure that the training period covers a range of very wet and very dry years within the observed time period to which modsim and modflow were calibrated figure s1 input data for the ml sub model include monthly stream water inflows precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature month as an integer from january 1 through december 12 previous 1 to 24 months of inflows and previous 1 to 12 months of precipitation these predictor variables were chosen because they capture the main external sources of temporal variability to the system at a range of time scales that we expect to be relevant to groundwater dynamics a separate ml sub model is trained for each modsim node shown in fig 1 using modflow accretions and depletions for that stream segment as target values we use the same matrix of input predictor variables inflow hydrograph weather etc for all nodes although a given stream segment s groundwater interactions are likely influenced by inflows from upstream stream segments as well as nearby surface groundwater interactions we chose not to explicitly include these spatial connections in the ml model initial tests showed that surface flows were not necessary for accurate model predictions and since all segments are experiencing the same external forcings we would expect any spatial interactions to be intrinsically captured by the ml model we therefore chose to omit any explicitly modeled connections between stream segments in order to maximize model speed while minimally reducing model accuracy the ml groundwater modeling component of the current study was created using the extreme gradient boosting or xgboost package in r https cran r project org web packages xgboost xgboost pdf the algorithm is based on a regression tree approach and has been widely used for many different ml applications chen guestrin 2016 regression trees operate by dividing the data into smaller and smaller groups or nodes according to the data properties the data in each parent node is divided into two child nodes based on one of the supplied predictors and the division which maximizes the separation in target values between the two child nodes is selected at each step these divisions continue until a stopping criterion is reached either based on the number of branches or the size of each terminal leaf node given a set of predictor variables the output or target variable is found by following the path from the first node to the appropriate terminal node this algorithm can be used to model potentially lagged responses to time varying driving forces in our case we use it to model time series of fluxes between groundwater and surface water by including time lagged information as a predictor for example we include the previous 1 24 months of inflow data as model inputs to predict water fluxes at a given timestep by predicting a point in time using both current and previous conditions we allow the model to have a memory of previous hydrologic conditions this is potentially important since we anticipate a delay between hydrologic processes on the land surface and responses in groundwater condition kuwayama brozović 2013 we chose to use the xgboost algorithm because it has been successfully used to forecast time series in other applications e g ni et al 2020 xgboost also incorporates methods to prevent overfitting chen guestrin 2016 which is valuable for applications where the prediction inputs may vary substantially from the training data in addition this algorithm s status as freely available r code makes our methods accessible to a large suite of potential users our primary validation of the ml sub model quantifies its ability to reproduce time series of surface groundwater fluxes calculated by modflow in both the training and testing periods the match between the ml and modflow time series is calculated using three metrics which each quantify the time series similarity in slightly different ways nrmse root mean squared error normalized by the range in true modflow calculated values this common metric provides a straightforward measure of the magnitude in model errors relative to the original data s magnitude of variability a smaller value indicates a better model fit nse nash sutcliffe efficiency this widely used metric was designed for testing modeled streamflow time series and measures the proportion of the true data variance that is captured by the model gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe 1970 a value of 1 would indicate perfect model fit while values below zero suggest the model performs less accurately than simply using the mean of the true modflow calculated data gupta et al 2009 kge kling gupta efficiency this metric was designed to capture three different measures of model accuracy within a single metric a value of 1 indicates perfect model fit with lower values indicating a greater distance from the ideal condition of 0 bias perfect correlation and equal variance between the two time series gupta et al 2009 additional details for the ml sub model are given in the si 2 3 description of coupled models 2 3 1 modsim modflow the dynamically coupled modsim modflow model the existing decision support tool uses an iterative process for numeric convergence on a solution at each iteration spatially explicit surface water flow agricultural recharge ditch leakage and groundwater pumping activity calculated from the wam modsim outputs are fed into modflow the pumping and aquifer recharge estimates are used by modflow in its calculations of water table depth and groundwater flow modflow then outputs groundwater accretions and depletions at each modsim node shown in fig 1 these accretions or depletions are accounted for in the next iteration of modsim as it allocates water to different areas in the network see section 2 2 1 for a description of how accretions and depletions are incorporated into modsim runs this process continues until the maximum change in any node s accretions and depletions between two successive iterations falls below a specified convergence threshold 2 3 2 modsim ml we couple the faster ml groundwater model with modsim to create a loosely coupled model that we will refer to as modsim ml in this model setup groundwater accretions and depletions calculated by ml are used as inputs to the modsim model see section 2 2 1 for a description of how accretions and depletions are incorporated into modsim runs modsim outputs do not explicitly affect the ml calculations see si section 1 3 however the two sub models are linked by running them with the same inflow and weather time series as inputs ml should implicitly capture the impacts of water allocation on groundwater as they are represented in modsim modflow since it is trained on outputs from a fully converged modsim modflow simulation 2 4 stress tests we tested the modsim ml model s ability to match accretion and depletion as predicted by modsim modflow when forcing timeseries data were beyond historical precedence specifically hypothetical stress test scenarios were developed representing multiyear droughts and wet periods that are consecutively more extreme than those from the historical training period agricultural water demands were held constant across all scenarios but inflows precipitation and temperature inputs varied climate and streamflow inputs for each scenario are provided in fig 2 super drought scenario inflows and weather data from water year 2002 october 2001 september 2002 historically very dry year are repeated for 10 years super wet scenario inflows and weather data from water year 2006 october 2005 september 2006 historically a very wet year are repeated for 10 years wet dry wet scenario runs the super wet scenario for three years then switches to super drought conditions for four years then switches back to super wet for the last three years this scenario tests the ability of ml to capture large interannual variations in hydrology no snow scenario uses weather from the dry year 2002 but sets monthly streamflow proportional to the precipitation in that month this scenario serves as an extreme example mimicking hydrologic implications of a warmer climate with no snow storage in the headwaters of the wrb 2 4 1 metrics for stress test analysis for each model run we simulate 15 years total but treat the first five years as a spin up period to stabilize groundwater levels to remove the effects of initial conditions we then use the remaining 10 years to evaluate the accuracy of the ml approach to replace modflow for comparison we also run modsim with no groundwater interactions modsim nogw in the modsim nogw version of the model there are no accretions depletions from groundwater to the river network ditch leakage is still modeled from irrigation canals but it is simply lost from the basin and does not interact with the groundwater system if the groundwater system is important to water allocation in the wrb then the modsim ml model should at least match modsim modflow better than modsim nogw for all metrics evaluated for each of the four stress test scenarios described above we use multiple metrics to evaluate modsim ml accuracy in terms of 1 surface groundwater accretions and depletions 2 agricultural surface water shortages 3 reservoir operations and 4 final outflow from the walker river basin defining modsim modflow as the true target value error in capturing monthly surface groundwater accretions and depletions positive fluxes from groundwater to surface water for accretions negative fluxes for depletions at individual stream reaches is measured in terms of both geographic and temporal variability the variability in net accretions sum of monthly water fluxes over the 10 year model period across all modeled stream reaches for ml and modflow are compared using r2 and nrmse these measures quantify how well the ml model captures spatial distribution in the net magnitude and direction of surface groundwater fluxes the ten year long monthly time series of water fluxes from modflow and ml at each reach are compared using nse kge and nrmse defined in section section 2 2 3 these measures serve to demonstrate whether the ml model accurately captures temporal patterns at individual stream reaches error in annual agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water diversions for irrigation is measured at two temporal scales total shortage over the 10 model years are compared both within each ditch service area using a scatterplot and as a total shortage summed over all water users using percent error these measures test the ability of ml to capture spatial variability in water shortages as well as total magnitudes of water shortage percent error in total shortage in individual years demonstrates the ml model s ability to capture interannual variability of water shortages the monthly difference in reservoir levels between models is divided by reservoir capacity in order to represent the magnitude of errors in surface water storage relative to the amount of potential storage water available we also compare month to month variability of storage graphically annual and monthly percent errors in basin outflow at the wabuska gage give a relative magnitude of inaccuracy in the volume of water flowing to walker lake combined with shortage errors these measures provide information on the net impact of ml errors on the total basin water balance nse and kge of the monthly outflow time series measure the ability of modsim ml to capture temporal patterns of outflow 2 5 sensitivity to changing stream conditions the ultimate goal of developing the numerically efficient modsim ml coupled model is to facilitate running a greater number of model scenarios than would be practical using modsim modflow in order to demonstrate the type of modeling study that becomes possible with reduced computation time we use modsim ml to explore the water allocation system s sensitivity to climate variations across a large gradient of drought and warming we represent these climate variations by altering the timing of surface water inflows to the basin to reflect different snowmelt scenarios in the mountains specifically we simulate the median historical condition with annual peak discharge in june baseline as well as scenarios with peak discharge shifted earlier by one month early shift peak discharge shifted earlier by one month but spreading out the flow over time to mimic a longer snowmelt period early broad increasing spring flows while decreasing summer flows to simulate an early snowmelt with low summer base flow high spring low summer and an extreme condition in which there is no snow storage and streamflow is proportional to monthly precipitation wet season peak for each of these five seasonal stream inflow distributions fig 3 we model nine different total annual flow volumes by multiplying the monthly fractions in fig 3 by the desired annual flow volume for a total of 45 model runs annual flow volumes range from the annual median to minimum volume observed over the historical period of 1996 2011 climate and agricultural water demands are held at 2002 levels drought for all model runs so any modeled differences are due solely to changes in streamflow we compare reservoir storage levels and agricultural surface water shortages across these different streamflow inputs in order to quantify the system s sensitivity to inflow volume representing various degrees of drought and timing representing changing snowmelt dynamics in a warming climate we calculate both reservoir storage on june 1 and mean reservoir storage as the first is an indicator of surface water available at the beginning of the peak growing season and the second captures the system s ability to take advantage of the full reservoir capacity total agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water diversions provide a straightforward measure of whether the water allocation system is capable of meeting irrigation needs across the entire basin 3 results 3 1 machine learning model validation ml matched accretions and depletions predicted by modsim modflow over the training period with high accuracy the nrmse at each stream section ranged from 0 to 1 9 nse ranged from 0 96 to 1 figures s4 s5 and kge ranged from 0 88 to 1 for most stream sections the testing data was also modeled well with a median nrmse of 11 range 6 to 28 a median nse of 0 74 range 2 7 to 0 97 and median kge of 0 77 range 58 to 0 97 however 7 of the stream sections had negative nse values indicating that the mean of the testing data would provide a better time series prediction than the given model these negative nse values were isolated to stream reaches with small sporadic groundwater fluxes modeled by modsim modflow small red symbols in figure s6 and therefore represent only a small fraction of the total error by volume within the network among all predictor variables used inflow at west fork walker near coleville wfc was the most likely to be included as one of the most important predictors for a given modsim node s ml model monthly temperature was the second most likely and the previous month s inflow at wfc was third this suggests that for most areas the surface groundwater interactions were primarily related to short term fluctuations in water availability inflows from the largest stream reach in the current or previous month and water demand which is highly correlated to monthly temperature precipitation was not often an important predictor justifying our decision to have a greater number of streamflow related inputs to the ml model and relatively few precipitation metrics see si section 3 for more details 3 2 increased efficiency with machine learning the modflow portion of the water allocation model took approximately 20 min to run for each iteration and multiple iterations are needed in order to converge on a solution which can lead to approximately 24 h being required in order to obtain the final model output the ml code to estimate accretions and depletions on the other hand runs in approximately 3 min and does not require iteration since it uses only external data inputs one iteration of the modsim portion of the model including calculating the water balance a post processing step needed to estimate recharge to the aquifer and runoff from fields requires approximately 30 min even if some iteration is required in order to get the model to converge at most a few hours are needed to run modsim ml for a 15 year simulation 3 3 stress tests for the modsim ml model 3 3 1 accuracy in terms of accretions and depletions the stress test scenarios showed that ml was able to reproduce total surface groundwater fluxes very accurately for most stream sections including those with the most extreme accretions or depletions fig 4 the fit was most accurate for the super wet fig 4c and wet dry wet scenarios fig 4b both of which had r2 0 98 and nrmse 2 but super drought still agreed well with the physically based approach fig 4a r2 0 93 nrmse 5 in the no snow scenario the ml sub model was slightly less accurate than in the other stress test scenarios but still showed a strong correlation to modflow accretions and depletions r2 0 87 nrmse 6 fig 4d model errors were not randomly distributed but showed a bias toward higher net accretions in super drought and no snow scenarios and an opposite bias toward greater depletions in the super wet and wet dry wet scenarios the match for timeseries of accretions and depletions between the modflow and ml models for the wet dry wet scenario was generally high median nse 0 78 median kge 0 75 median nrmse 11 however accuracy varied across space with some modsim stream sections matching almost perfectly nse 0 998 kge 0 983 nrmse 2 and some stream sections showing large errors minimum nse 6 4 minimum kge 175 maximum nrmse 41 errors were greatest during the transition from wet to dry conditions e g node m1 in fig 5 a for comparison setting all surface groundwater fluxes to zero as with modsim nogw gives much poorer median values of nse 1 13 kge 0 73 and nrmse 33 for the wet dry wet scenario for the no snow scenario timeseries of accretions matched modflow output less well fig 5 with a median nse of 0 25 ranging from 12 4 to 0 98 median kge of 0 20 ranging from 18 3 to 0 97 and median nrmse of 29 ranging from 5 to 75 these poor fit metrics for the no snow scenario reflect ml s inability to always capture the full range of seasonal surface groundwater fluxes however the volumes of these ml modeled fluxes tended to still remain within the range of magnitudes predicted by modflow e g nodes m1 and s1 in fig 5b and setting all surface groundwater fluxes to zero as with modsim nogw gives even worse median values of nse 2 02 kge 0 73 and nrmse 56 showing that the ml flux estimates are more informative than merely ignoring groundwater effects 3 3 2 accuracy in terms of agricultural shortages for the 10 year simulation period of the super drought scenario the machine learning version of the model modsim ml underpredicted total surface water irrigation shortages by 12 1 while the model with no surface groundwater interaction modsim nogw underpredicted these shortages by 40 5 fig 6 a in the no snow scenario modsim ml underpredicted total surface water shortages by 9 while modsim nogw underpredicted by 20 none of the model versions predicted any shortages under the super wet scenario for the wet dry wet scenario modsim ml overpredicted total surface water shortages by 18 while modsim nogw underpredicted by 17 this slightly larger error for the modsim ml model is mostly the result of a few demand nodes with high shortages fig 6b most of this error is accrued during the first year of the simulated drought when modsim ml overpredicts shortage by 149 by the fourth consecutive drought year the ml model only overpredicts shortages by 7 while the modsim nogw model underpredicts shortages in that year by 26 in terms of water resource management planning underpredicting shortages is probably more consequential since it could mean failure to adequately prepare whereas overpredictions of shortages may lead to unnecessary costs for mitigation measures but at least would not result in unexpected lack of irrigation water 3 3 3 accuracy in terms of reservoir operations and basin outflow for both super drought and super wet scenarios reservoir storage time series for the modsim ml model matched the modsim modflow model very closely monthly errors 5 of reservoir capacity in contrast modsim nogw overpredicted monthly reservoir storage volumes by up to 18 during super drought with largest errors during summer fig 7 a and underpredicted them by up to 10 under super wet conditions with largest errors occurring during winter fig 7b for wet dry wet the modsim ml model was consistently in between the reservoir levels for the modsim modflow and modsim nogw models fig 8 a and was closer to the modflow version for most time steps fig 8b 3 3 4 accuracy in terms of basin outflow annual basin outflows from the modsim ml model system underpredicted modsim modflow outflows by 3 in the super wet scenario and overpredicted outflows by 20 in the super drought scenario mainly due to overpredictions in winter months fig 7c modsim nogw model overpredicted outflows by 2 for super wet mainly in may june fig 7d and 58 for super drought overestimates occurred in both winter and summer fig 7c in the wet dry wet scenario all model versions matched each other s outflow timeseries with an nse 0 99 but modsim ml underpredicted annual outflow volumes by 0 to 21 while modsim nogw annual errors ranged from 8 to 24 at a monthly timestep modsim ml errors ranged from 37 to 9 while modsim nogw errors had a greater range of 48 to 86 fig 8c modsim ml outflow had kge 0 97 while kge for modsim nogw was slightly lower at 0 92 3 4 example use case sensitivity to changing stream conditions each artificial hydrograph shape refer to fig 3 was scaled so that the total annual inflows equaled various volumes ranging from 424 x106 m3 approximately median annual flow normalized inflow 1 0 down to 244 x106 m3 approximately 2002 volumes normalized inflow 0 58 across the range of inflows tested modsim ml found that earlier peak flows led to shortages similar to those under the base hydrograph differences in shortages 2 of demand fig 9 a despite the growing season starting out with more reservoir storage june 1 storage increased by 6 to 38 of reservoir capacity depending on inflow volume and hydrograph shape fig 9b and decreasing mean annual reservoir storage 0 to 33 fig 9c overall total annual flow volume was much more important than the distribution of flow throughout the year with drought increasing shortages by up to 24 and reducing mean reservoir storage by up to 65 in contrast the wet season peak scenario which represents the most extreme shift in flow timing that could potentially occur had significantly larger shortages compared to the base hydrograph increases 10 to 19 depending on inflow volume fig 9a and produced lower reservoir stages in moderate drought but higher reservoir stages under severe drought shifting at a normalized inflow of 0 8 fig 9b c the wet season peak scenario was also the only hydrograph shape that produced shortages 1 at median annual flow volumes normalized inflow 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of machine learning approach running modsim with groundwater interactions that were estimated using ml was generally more accurate than using a model in which surface groundwater interactions were not included one notable exception to this was during the initial transition from wet conditions to drought in the wet dry wet scenario the ml model overestimated the magnitude of this transition s impact on groundwater fluxes in the first year of dry conditions e g fig 5a and this led to a large overprediction of shortages during that first dry year the inability of ml to accurately capture groundwater declines during drought may be a consequence of having few wet to dry transition periods in the training data set however there appears to be some hysteresis in this model bias since the wetting up post drought was captured quite accurately e g figs 5 and 8 show ml or modsim ml errors that are relatively large in the first year of drought but relatively small in the first year post drought the accuracy of the dry to wet transition is probably due to the fact that little pumping is needed during a wet year no matter what the antecedent conditions and therefore groundwater during wet years behaves fairly predictably rather than being impacted by variable pumping demands modsim modflow predicted that relatively little pumping would be needed during the first drought year of wet dry wet since there was still abundant reservoir storage following the antecedent wet years this is likely the main reason there was little impact on groundwater fluxes compared to most drought years that formed the ml training dataset in which more pumping would have been required since drought years in the training data did not begin with full reservoirs this would explain why ml matched modflow better after multiple drought years when the impact of the drought had had more time to affect groundwater these results suggest that surface water shortages can lead to a negative feedback loop in which greater pumping leads to reduced groundwater discharge to streams barlow leake 2012 and thus even more surface water shortage given the available training data which included less extreme dry periods ml was apparently not able to fully capture the water storage infrastructure s short term ability to mitigate this negative feedback in the super drought scenario the ml model generally underpredicted the amount of water that would be lost from surface water to groundwater while in the super wet scenario the ml model underpredicted the amount of groundwater that would accrete to the gaining reaches fig 4 this could be due to pumping activity in the modflow model changing in response to prolonged wet or dry periods in ways that are not captured by the ml model since its training data include only relatively short wet or dry spells inflows over the previous 2 years were among the most important predictors for 10 of the individual reaches ml models si section 3 and even longer system memory might be important for capturing the groundwater flux dynamics of some reaches these issues could likely be addressed by providing a longer set of training data for the ml model which would allow it to better calibrate for multi year lags in groundwater response to changing hydrologic inputs for this study we chose to calibrate only on modflow outputs from a relatively short period where historical data could be used to drive modflow thus minimizing uncertainty in the modflow results since they were calibrated to the historical data another approach would be to use a model emulation strategy by running modflow over longer periods with artificial inputs e g hypothetical realizations of long dry or wet spells and transitions between the two in order to train the ml model to respond to a wider variety of conditions castelletti et al 2012 interpretation of results from such an approach however would need to take into account that the original modflow model might not accurately capture extreme future conditions and that the ml model will inherit any biases or shortcomings of the modflow results on which it was trained modsim ml was more accurate than modsim nogw in estimating surface water shortages for the super drought and no snow scenarios fig 6 demonstrating the importance of incorporating surface groundwater interactions into the modsim model omitting such interactions led the modsim nogw model to overpredict the total amount of water available during multi year droughts since that model version did not account for the loss of surface water to groundwater in losing stream reaches see figure s6 for spatial distribution of losing stream reaches this water balance error led the modsim nogw model to overpredict reservoir storage and final outflow from the system while underpredicting water shortages figs 6 8 during drought conditions both the modsim modflow and modsim ml models deliver only the minimum required water right during the summer while the modsim nogw model provides some supplemental water during april august fig 7c this additional spring summer water is likely from agricultural runoff in the downstream parts of the system that are lost via depletions to groundwater in the other model versions during winters of the super wet scenario modsim nogw underestimates reservoir storage and system outflows because it fails to capture streamflow gains from groundwater during very wet conditions fig 7b d ml offers an efficient and tractable approach to capturing these complex hydrologic feedbacks that impact water supply capturing these surface groundwater interactions becomes especially important during extended drought as the river becomes more losing over subsequent years due to lower irrigation recharge and more groundwater pumping e g node m1 in fig 5a modsim ml was able to capture most of the impacts of these losing reaches e g overall close matches in fluxes out of streams in figs 4 and 5 while modsim nogw could not capture them since it did not include groundwater fluxes in the wet dry wet scenario error from the modsim nogw model version becomes larger with each subsequent drought year while the error from using ml decreased with each subsequent drought year fig 8b c predictably accretions and depletions were modeled least accurately for the no snow scenario in which the inflow hydrograph diverged greatly from the seasonal patterns experienced with the training data fig 4d however even in this case there was high correlation between ml and modflow accretions and depletions and the total error in modsim shortages was 10 even under this hypothetical climate scenario that is very different from the ml training data individual demand nodes shortages under modflow ml were still more accurate than modflow nogw fig 6c demonstrating that when more detailed modflow simulations are not available there is still value in incorporating approximations of groundwater dynamics from the ml model even under such an extreme scenario with high model uncertainty in practice when studying a climate scenario like this which is so different from the testing data it might be advisable to run modsim modflow once under the new climate scenario and use that model s output to re calibrate the ml model the recalibrated modsim ml could then be used to evaluate small variations to the climate scenario e g climates for a future time simulated using different global circulation models or streamflow inputs calculated from different downscaling techniques 4 2 spatial distribution of error locations where the ml model had negative nse values were limited to a few small areas within mason valley suggesting that ml model error was not random but related to certain areas that were more difficult to represent without a process based model figure s6 it may be that areas with more pumping activity were more difficult to model using ml and mason valley historically experienced approximately three times as much annual pumping as smith valley unpublished nevada division of water resources data 2015 it is also not surprising that mason valley is more difficult to model since it is further downstream in the system and its surface water flows which affect the modflow sub model but not the ml sub model are therefore affected by the net impact of many smaller changes upstream for the super drought scenario smith valley had some of the largest discrepancies in surface water shortages between modsim modflow and modsim ml fig 6 si figure s7 despite surface groundwater fluxes generally being modeled more accurately in smith valley this demonstrates how small errors in groundwater modeling can propagate through the surface water delivery system in unexpected ways in the wet dry wet scenario the spatial patterns of error in shortages more closely matched the spatial pattern of error in surface groundwater fluxes demonstrating how the transition from wet to dry conditions influences the system quite differently from persistent drought fig 6 si figures s6 s7 diversion locations with relatively junior water rights were more prone to error compared to locations with older water rights the diversion points with the greatest relative errors in terms of water shortage were all within the bottom 30th percentile in terms of mean water right age this is expected since water deliveries to older water rights are less likely to be affected by a small change in streamflow volume 4 3 sensitivity to changing stream conditions we found that total annual flow volume was much more important than moderate shifts of flow timing in terms of water demands being met in most cases the system did not begin to experience notable surface water shortages until inflows were below 75 of the long term median fig 9 however under an extreme case of no precipitation being stored as snow wet season peak scenario the system experienced shortages and reduced start of summer reservoir storage even in years with relatively high flows such shortages in the absence of spring summer snowmelt availability is an expected outcome throughout the western united states mankin et al 2015 in extremely dry years modeled mean reservoir storage actually stayed highest in the wet season peak scenario likely because the lack of a snowmelt pulse ensured that streamflow rarely exceeded the reservoir s holding capacity but this increased artificial storage was not sufficient to reduce total shortages the shortage difference between the baseline and wet season peak scenarios was highest when inflows were at 80 of the median with the difference decreasing again as inflows approached historical drought levels the highly nonlinear nature of the water distribution s response to changing inflow hydrographs demonstrates the importance of being able to run many simulations across a range of potential flow scenarios note that our stress test showed that modsim ml underpredicted shortages in the no snow and superdrought test cases fig 6 suggesting that shortages calculated by modsim ml for below average inflows and earlier flow peaks are likely to have a bias toward being too low therefore surface water shortages under prolonged droughts and earlier snowmelt may actually be even higher than what is shown in fig 9 the wet season peak scenario is a first order approximation of the maximum potential change to streamflow seasonal patterns that could occur due to changing precipitation phase from snow to rain under climate change though actual hydrograph changes might be more complex see gordon et al 2022 the scenario with earlier higher spring flow and lower summer flow high spring low summer more closely matches what we actually expect the hydrograph to look like in this region under climate change in the coming century justin l huntington niswonger 2012 zhu et al 2005 the high spring low summer inflows only met 2 to 3 less of demand than the base scenario whereas wet season peak met up to 19 less of demand it is possible that the model would have shown greater sensitivity to the high spring low summer and early shift scenarios if we had used a finer temporal resolution the monthly time step in each of our model components modsim and modflow may not be sufficient to capture the full impact of flow timing shifts which are also on the order of one month while we believe the current analysis is sufficient to capture general trends future work may need to use a finer temporal resolution for decision making this exercise demonstrates the value in exploring multiple metrics of water shortage for example according to mean reservoir storage it would appear that the high spring low summer hydrograph was the most detrimental during drought years but the wet season peak hydrograph was the worst according to actual surface water shortages also reservoir storage begins to drop sharply around 80 of median annual flow while shortages are still very minor for most scenarios illustrating the ability of these reservoirs to provide some buffer against the impacts of low flow volumes fig 9 while this analysis was informative it is important to note that we made a number of simplifying assumptions in order to observe changes that can be attributed exclusively to different hydrographs for example we repeated the same hydrograph each year used the same precipitation and temperature in all scenarios and did not alter crop type or fallow any fields in response to water shortages due to these simplifications the model results may be very different from the water allocations that would actually occur in the real world and should be viewed as more of a sensitivity analysis rather than predictions nonetheless these results provide an illustration of the types of analyses that can be performed much more easily when modsim is coupled with an ml model rather than modflow and this method could be leveraged to run more realistic model scenarios if needed to aid decision making we plan to run more detailed scenarios in future analyses that account for changing water demand among other parameters 4 4 benefits and limitations the main advantage of using the modsim ml model is its much greater computation speed this speed allows for more scenario runs in less time and using fewer computing resources training ml models also enabled the creation of importance plots figure s2 which provide insights into local drivers of the groundwater system for example these importance plots showed that inflows at west fork walker was the most important predictor of surface groundwater fluxes at 42 of nodes figure s3 which is expected given that monthly inflows to west fork walker are an average of 2 4 times greater than inflows at bridgeport importance plots also suggest that including streamflow over the previous two years and thus including a 2 year memory in the model was highly important for 10 of modeled nodes see si section 3 for more details triana et al 2005 also demonstrated the computational benefits of using ml to simulate stream groundwater interactions in a wam though they used a very different type of algorithm artificial neural networks ann triana et al 2005 also did not link modsim directly with a physically based groundwater model meaning they could not evaluate the impacts of their ann on modsim results directly and they could not train their machine learning model on aquifer responses to climate or infrastructure scenarios outside of the historical range the methods presented here rely on the existence of a physically based groundwater model which is fully coupled with a wam in order to provide training data for the ml sub model which is more complicated than the approach of triana et al 2005 but also provides more flexibility and greater certainty when modeling scenarios outside the training data s range an unavoidable drawback of using ml is that it won t work if you change the system too much from training setup although one could always re train ml to a single modflow run under new setup and test small scenario changes using ml instead of modflow groundwater level is not modeled explicitly rather the ml model only predicts flows between the groundwater store and a specific stream reach since the ml model does not explicitly calculate groundwater levels this method does not provide information such as whether wells in a certain area might run dry or whether legal restrictions on pumping might be triggered however the ml model could still capture the impacts of these drawdowns implicitly as long as the training data includes some situations with very low groundwater levels other studies have addressed this issue by incorporating simple physically based representations of surface groundwater dynamics such as stream response functions e g kuwayama brozović 2013 which are computationally efficient but cannot capture as much complexity and nonlinearity as modflow or a machine learning approach of course for both modsim ml and modsim modflow results are also dependent on accuracy of input estimates of climate and agricultural water demand 4 5 larger impacts and future directions while the results shown above are specific to the walker river basin this approach of using machine learning models to predict groundwater flux time series could be applied in any location the only requirement is that either a process based model such as modflow or observational data are available as training data we have demonstrated that capturing spatiotemporally variable groundwater fluxes can be very important for accurate modeling of water allocations in the context of an uncertain hydrologic future ml provides the needed computational speed to run water allocation models under a range of climatic inputs in order to capture the range of this uncertainty the methods explored here will allow us to conduct climate studies of how water allocation in the walker river basin will likely change under different climate scenarios and water governance scenarios this more in depth study will alter both incoming streamflows as well as irrigation water demand according to hydrological and crop models forced by a suite of climate projections we will also explore the impact of changing water allocation priorities and irrigation efficiencies this suite of model explorations will be made possible by combining the flexibility of the modsim modflow model with the computation speed of modsim ml future work will identify effective methods of training the ml sub model to relevant modflow outputs in order to fill in gaps between extremes modeled with the slower modsim modflow method 5 conclusion machine learning was able to reproduce groundwater surface water interactions in our water allocation model for the walker river basin with high accuracy the model had some difficulty accurately capturing transitions from very wet to very dry conditions and in modeling the dynamics of a streamflow regime that was greatly altered from the training dataset however the overall impact of these difficulties on the final water allocation model were minimal we found that ignoring groundwater fluxes resulted in significant under predictions in estimated agricultural shortages using ml based approaches to mimic groundwater fluxes was able to capture shortages more accurately than ignoring groundwater all together and still maintain numerical efficiency incorporating these groundwater fluxes in the water allocation model was especially important under drought conditions we have demonstrated that a machine learning algorithm trained on modflow output can be used to accurately reproduce modflow results using only information regarding streamflow season and weather we also demonstrated use of the algorithm to process a gradient of possible hydrographic responses to decreasing snowpack to provide better understanding of system sensitivity to inflow timing and volume while only a proof of concept to enable more detailed modeling using global climate models to inform hydrologic supply and demand we found the contemporary wrb infrastructure somewhat resilient to modest changes in streamflow amount and timing however the current structure was unable to buffer agricultural shortages in the extreme case of winter rains in the mountains and no snow storage in conclusion we found that replacing a modflow groundwater model with ml maintains the need to explicitly account for groundwater fluxes in the system but provides an efficient platform this efficiency will enable future work in the wrb to more explicitly test where and when hydrologic thresholds with climate change occur using a monte carlo framework that was impossible with the physically based

1878,water allocation models wam can capture complex feedbacks between water infrastructure water supply water demand and water rights structure they are an important tool for water managers to reduce conflict and aid in future water resource planning future streamflow reductions and shifts in timing are anticipated in snow dominated watersheds of the western united states due to projected reductions in snow water storage these basins tend to be water limited and rely on groundwater to support agricultural demand water managers in the snow fed agricultural walker river basin wrb in california and nevada use a dynamically coupled wam and physically based groundwater flow model as a decision support tool large computation time is required to simulate groundwater dynamics limiting the number of model scenarios that can feasibly be run to test alternative management scenarios under climate change machine learning ml techniques have been used to capture complex nonlinear hydrologic dynamics in other contexts but to our knowledge there have not been efforts to use ml to increase computational efficiency in modeling groundwater responses to agricultural water use we use extreme gradient boosting to replace the groundwater sub model for the wrb decision support tool resulting in accurate estimates of reservoir storage monthly error almost always 5 of reservoir capacity streamflow total outflow errors from 3 to 20 depending on scenario and agricultural water shortages 12 to 18 error in total shortage depending on scenario for comparison we found that omitting groundwater modeling from the wam results in a larger overprediction of outflows 2 to 58 and underprediction in agricultural water shortages 0 to 41 across a range of scenarios we use this validated ml method to explore the sensitivity of agricultural water availability to a range of streamflow volumes and streamflow timings results indicate that agricultural water shortages are more sensitive to annual streamflow volume in comparison to shifts in streamflow timing our model shows that reservoirs can buffer the impact of altered flow timing on agricultural production except under extreme conditions in which all precipitation falls as rain no snow storage and streamflow peaks in the winter future work will explore these thresholds in more detail while the results here are site specific the methodology for coupling a wam with a ml representation of surface groundwater interactions can be applied to a wide variety of water resource modeling applications these results also

agriculture accounts for 81 of water use dieter et al 2018 and contributes 95 billion in annual output https agamerica com farm publications west coast agricultural trends report consequently there is a need to assess hydro economic vulnerability of the current system to anticipated streamflow changes and develop climate adaptation strategies for competing water users in this region adger et al 2005 sterle et al 2019 however developing adaptation strategies is a challenge due to inherent water scarcity and associated conflict fuller harhay 2010 and the need to account for the prior

larson and spinazola 2004 wurbs 2020 aliyari et al 2021 the computational time required to run fully coupled models can limit the number of climate scenarios investigated to improve computational efficiency we propose a method for using machine learning ml as a fast and accurate way to capture surface groundwater interactions within a wam ml has been increasing in popularity for modeling complex hydrologic systems that previously relied on computationally intensive physically based models examples include modeling groundwater level responses to land use majumdar et al 2020 sahoo et al 2017 identifying sites of likely groundwater pollution ransom et al 2017 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 predicting water temperatures to assess ecosystem health rahmani et al 2020 streamflow forecasting ni et al 2020 and capturing stream aquifer interactions in agricultural basins triana et al 2005 ml has multiple advantages over other statistical models such as linear regression since ml models can capture nonlinear dynamics and do not rely on a priori assumptions about the specific relationship between the dependent variable and its predictors shen 2018 however statistical models including ml do not implicitly incorporate physical processes while methods exist for incorporating physical constraints into hybrid physical ml models jiang et al 2020 such approaches come at the expense of model flexibility and computation time pure ml models can potentially produce outputs that are not physically possible and potentially have difficulties capturing changes to a system when model inputs are not within the range of the training data therefore it is important to test ml models in terms of their ability to realistically represent situations outside of the training dataset shen 2018 the objective of this research is to explore numerically efficient ml options to replace a physically based three dimensional and fully transient groundwater model that is dynamically coupled with a wam we test the approach in a representative western us agricultural basin dependent on snowmelt that is expected to see shifts in upland hydrology related to changing climate we explore the ability of ml to represent stream water accretions and depletions from groundwater we then verify the wam s ability to represent reservoir storage agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water supply and streamflow exiting the basin across a range of upstream flow conditions when the wam is coupled with ml lastly we demonstrate a use case of this coupled model by using a suite of model runs to test the sensitivity of agricultural shortages and reservoir storage to hypothetical streamflow reductions and timing shifts given contemporary water infrastructure and water rights structures 2 methods 2 1 site description the walker river basin wrb 10 760 km2 straddles the california nevada state line in the eastern sierra nevada mountains fig 1 stream water originates as snowmelt in the mountains along the basin s southwestern edge and flows north northeast before terminating in walker lake elevations range from 1218 to 3747 m climate at high elevations is humid continental cold winters with heavy precipitation while latitude desert conditions arid hot summers occur at walker lake annual precipitation ranges from 1 8 m at the highest elevations to 0 11 m in the lower elevations to the east prism climate group 2014 temperatures are highly seasonal see supporting information si figure s1b ranging from 6 c in december to 34 c in july at yerington nevada elevation 1350 m precipitation and streamflow are also highly seasonal and have large inter annual variability with wet years experiencing total streamflow and precipitation more than double that of dry years figure s1a c stream water supports irrigated agriculture in bridgeport antelope smith and mason valleys for the period of model development 1996 2011 alfalfa was the dominant crop but other irrigated agriculture includes corn garlic grains grass hay onions and other vegetables collopy thomas 2016 topaz lake and bridgeport reservoir act as managed storage for streamflow along the east and west forks of the walker river respectively surface water for irrigation is diverted from the river through a series of ditches based on a complex system of permits and seniority water rights are classified as decree storage or flood water and each landowner can hold one or more types of surface water rights for a given place of use the level of seniority dictates when the water can be diverted for a given set of fields and can only be diverted once water for higher seniority rights has been allocated aka prior appropriations doctrine in addition to surface diversions groundwater pumping occurs in the wrb to support agricultural demand full groundwater rights are divorced from surface diversions while supplemental groundwater rights are tied to surface diversions such that they support agriculture when streamflow is low as an example carroll et al 2010 estimated groundwater pumping in mason valley as 13 to 27 of irrigated water during a wet year and 50 to 57 during a dry year walker river basin water management is representative of many agricultural areas in the southwest in its reliance both on groundwater and on highly variable streamflow from snow dominated headwaters as well as its use of artificial reservoirs to reconcile the fact that peak water demand occurs during the season of lowest precipitation 2 2 description of individual sub models the existing decision support tool collopy thomas 2016 is a dynamically coupled wam and three dimensional groundwater model we discuss these sub models separately before discussing the existing coupled model and our updated model which combines the wam with ml 2 2 1 water allocation model modsim modsim software is a wam which simulates river flows and reservoir operations labadie 2011 surface water is routed through a network of nodes connected by links identifying flow paths by which water can be moved from one node to another for our case study these links represent a specific segment of a stream or diversion canal at each node water can be added to the surface water system e g tributary inflow runoff from a field or groundwater inflows removed from the surface water system e g consumptive water use or drainage into the subsurface stored for later release i e a reservoir or water can simply pass through the node and be distributed to the next link s downstream water rights are represented by varying the cost of sending water through a given link for the wrb modsim minimizes the total cost of moving water through the network based on the prior appropriations doctrine the wrb is simulated with monthly timesteps using temperature and precipitation data from noaa weather stations www ncdc noaa gov station id 269229 in yerington nv and station id 267612 in smith nv inflows from the west walker river near coleville figure s1a and desert creek are defined using u s geological survey usgs gages 10296500 and 10299100 respectively while inflows above bridgeport reservoir were derived using a water balance based on reservoir outflows at gage 10293000 and storage levels measured at usgs site 10292500 fig 1 these three inflow locations form the upstream limit of our wam target storage in the two major reservoirs bridgeport and topaz can be forced to historical observations but we allow the model to estimate maximum storage volume after accounting for evaporation from the reservoir surface and optimizing agricultural water needs forced water releases in excess of crop demand occur when reservoir stage exceeds its maximum 8 m above deadpool for topaz and 14 m for bridgeport a high priority instream flow requirement immediately below each reservoir keeps modeled reservoir releases from dropping to zero though if reservoir stage reaches deadpool elevation then releases are limited to monthly inflows minus reservoir evaporation surface water diversions for agriculture are largely located in smith valley and mason valley estimated demands at each diversion location are calculated based on estimated crop water requirements huntington allen 2010 si section 2 after accounting for irrigation efficiency and ditch leakage diversions are limited by water availability and water rights priority accretions from groundwater to the surface water system are represented as water being added to the modsim node at the downstream end of the stream or irrigation ditch segment link where the accretion takes place similarly surface water losses back to the groundwater depletions are represented via water being removed from the node located at the downstream end of the link from which the water is depleted following each modsim iteration a spatially distributed water balance calculation estimates pumping aquifer recharge and surface runoff for each ditch service area the modsim model assumes that surface water shortages demand minus diversions for each ditch service area will be made up via pumping up to the maximum legal annual limit of four feet per year applied to each acre aquifer recharge and surface runoff are calculated as calibrated percentages of total water applied to each field the estimated agricultural surface runoff is added to surface water flow downstream of the fields where it was generated and this additional surface water flow is then available for diversion in the next modsim iteration streamflow exits the model system at the wabuska gaging station usgs 103015000 wabuska is downstream of most agricultural water use and is upstream of walker lake fig 1 streamflow at wabuska represents the water right for the walker river paiute tribe which is the basin s senior most water right and the primary optimization target in modsim calibration of modsim parameters optimize the model s ability to match observed historical reservoir storage levels surface water diversion records and flow at each usgs gage see the si for more details full details of the modsim set up and validation are provided by collopy thomas 2016 2 2 2 groundwater model modflow the walker river is highly seasonal in its hydrology and has significant groundwater development gallagher 2004 huxel harris 1969 these factors result in heterogenous groundwater surface water interactions in both space and time to capture the basin s complex hydrology modsim s simplified groundwater flux estimates were replaced with two physically based three dimensional groundwater models developed for those agricultural regions smith and mason valleys in the wrb with extensive pumping to meet agricultural demand see model extents in fig 1 carroll et al 2010 provides a comprehensive description of the modeling approach in brief the groundwater model uses modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the finite difference grid is at the 100 m grid resolution with three vertical layers to capture alluvial aquifer geology monthly stress periods simulate groundwater surface interactions between the river and aquifer system to estimate gaining and losing conditions prudic et al 2004 the model accounts for mountain block recharge interbasin groundwater flow phreatophyte evapotranspiration groundwater pumping for irrigation surface diversions and associated return flows to the stream network diversion ditch conveyance losses and irrigation recharge mountain block recharge is constant while interbasin flow is simulated as general head boundary conditions for all modflow runs while fluxes related to pumping surface water diversions etc vary depending on modsim outputs excess water applied to fields is calculated as the applied water from surface and groundwater sources less the crop type irrigation water requirement huntington allen 2010 the partitioning of excess irrigation water to either recharge or drain return flow was part of the groundwater model calibration to match observed stream water gains and losses this model has been previously validated using groundwater levels as well as observed river flows and diversions carroll et al 2010 2 2 3 machine learning ml the main focus of the present study is to create an ml sub model to predict net accretion depletion of water to from nodes in the modsim model network we use accretions and depletions modeled by modflow for model training and validation the modflow run uses observed inflows and weather for 1996 2011 and is dynamically coupled with modsim for calculation of groundwater pumping aquifer recharge and surface water flows see sections 2 2 2 and 2 3 1 we train the ml sub model on ten years of modflow output water years 1999 2008 retaining six years 1996 1998 and 2009 2011 as testing data for model validation these time periods were chosen to ensure that the training period covers a range of very wet and very dry years within the observed time period to which modsim and modflow were calibrated figure s1 input data for the ml sub model include monthly stream water inflows precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature month as an integer from january 1 through december 12 previous 1 to 24 months of inflows and previous 1 to 12 months of precipitation these predictor variables were chosen because they capture the main external sources of temporal variability to the system at a range of time scales that we expect to be relevant to groundwater dynamics a separate ml sub model is trained for each modsim node shown in fig 1 using modflow accretions and depletions for that stream segment as target values we use the same matrix of input predictor variables inflow hydrograph weather etc for all nodes although a given stream segment s groundwater interactions are likely influenced by inflows from upstream stream segments as well as nearby surface groundwater interactions we chose not to explicitly include these spatial connections in the ml model initial tests showed that surface flows were not necessary for accurate model predictions and since all segments are experiencing the same external forcings we would expect any spatial interactions to be intrinsically captured by the ml model we therefore chose to omit any explicitly modeled connections between stream segments in order to maximize model speed while minimally reducing model accuracy the ml groundwater modeling component of the current study was created using the extreme gradient boosting or xgboost package in r https cran r project org web packages xgboost xgboost pdf the algorithm is based on a regression tree approach and has been widely used for many different ml applications chen guestrin 2016 regression trees operate by dividing the data into smaller and smaller groups or nodes according to the data properties the data in each parent node is divided into two child nodes based on one of the supplied predictors and the division which maximizes the separation in target values between the two child nodes is selected at each step these divisions continue until a stopping criterion is reached either based on the number of branches or the size of each terminal leaf node given a set of predictor variables the output or target variable is found by following the path from the first node to the appropriate terminal node this algorithm can be used to model potentially lagged responses to time varying driving forces in our case we use it to model time series of fluxes between groundwater and surface water by including time lagged information as a predictor for example we include the previous 1 24 months of inflow data as model inputs to predict water fluxes at a given timestep by predicting a point in time using both current and previous conditions we allow the model to have a memory of previous hydrologic conditions this is potentially important since we anticipate a delay between hydrologic processes on the land surface and responses in groundwater condition kuwayama brozović 2013 we chose to use the xgboost algorithm because it has been successfully used to forecast time series in other applications e g ni et al 2020 xgboost also incorporates methods to prevent overfitting chen guestrin 2016 which is valuable for applications where the prediction inputs may vary substantially from the training data in addition this algorithm s status as freely available r code makes our methods accessible to a large suite of potential users our primary validation of the ml sub model quantifies its ability to reproduce time series of surface groundwater fluxes calculated by modflow in both the training and testing periods the match between the ml and modflow time series is calculated using three metrics which each quantify the time series similarity in slightly different ways nrmse root mean squared error normalized by the range in true modflow calculated values this common metric provides a straightforward measure of the magnitude in model errors relative to the original data s magnitude of variability a smaller value indicates a better model fit nse nash sutcliffe efficiency this widely used metric was designed for testing modeled streamflow time series and measures the proportion of the true data variance that is captured by the model gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe 1970 a value of 1 would indicate perfect model fit while values below zero suggest the model performs less accurately than simply using the mean of the true modflow calculated data gupta et al 2009 kge kling gupta efficiency this metric was designed to capture three different measures of model accuracy within a single metric a value of 1 indicates perfect model fit with lower values indicating a greater distance from the ideal condition of 0 bias perfect correlation and equal variance between the two time series gupta et al 2009 additional details for the ml sub model are given in the si 2 3 description of coupled models 2 3 1 modsim modflow the dynamically coupled modsim modflow model the existing decision support tool uses an iterative process for numeric convergence on a solution at each iteration spatially explicit surface water flow agricultural recharge ditch leakage and groundwater pumping activity calculated from the wam modsim outputs are fed into modflow the pumping and aquifer recharge estimates are used by modflow in its calculations of water table depth and groundwater flow modflow then outputs groundwater accretions and depletions at each modsim node shown in fig 1 these accretions or depletions are accounted for in the next iteration of modsim as it allocates water to different areas in the network see section 2 2 1 for a description of how accretions and depletions are incorporated into modsim runs this process continues until the maximum change in any node s accretions and depletions between two successive iterations falls below a specified convergence threshold 2 3 2 modsim ml we couple the faster ml groundwater model with modsim to create a loosely coupled model that we will refer to as modsim ml in this model setup groundwater accretions and depletions calculated by ml are used as inputs to the modsim model see section 2 2 1 for a description of how accretions and depletions are incorporated into modsim runs modsim outputs do not explicitly affect the ml calculations see si section 1 3 however the two sub models are linked by running them with the same inflow and weather time series as inputs ml should implicitly capture the impacts of water allocation on groundwater as they are represented in modsim modflow since it is trained on outputs from a fully converged modsim modflow simulation 2 4 stress tests we tested the modsim ml model s ability to match accretion and depletion as predicted by modsim modflow when forcing timeseries data were beyond historical precedence specifically hypothetical stress test scenarios were developed representing multiyear droughts and wet periods that are consecutively more extreme than those from the historical training period agricultural water demands were held constant across all scenarios but inflows precipitation and temperature inputs varied climate and streamflow inputs for each scenario are provided in fig 2 super drought scenario inflows and weather data from water year 2002 october 2001 september 2002 historically very dry year are repeated for 10 years super wet scenario inflows and weather data from water year 2006 october 2005 september 2006 historically a very wet year are repeated for 10 years wet dry wet scenario runs the super wet scenario for three years then switches to super drought conditions for four years then switches back to super wet for the last three years this scenario tests the ability of ml to capture large interannual variations in hydrology no snow scenario uses weather from the dry year 2002 but sets monthly streamflow proportional to the precipitation in that month this scenario serves as an extreme example mimicking hydrologic implications of a warmer climate with no snow storage in the headwaters of the wrb 2 4 1 metrics for stress test analysis for each model run we simulate 15 years total but treat the first five years as a spin up period to stabilize groundwater levels to remove the effects of initial conditions we then use the remaining 10 years to evaluate the accuracy of the ml approach to replace modflow for comparison we also run modsim with no groundwater interactions modsim nogw in the modsim nogw version of the model there are no accretions depletions from groundwater to the river network ditch leakage is still modeled from irrigation canals but it is simply lost from the basin and does not interact with the groundwater system if the groundwater system is important to water allocation in the wrb then the modsim ml model should at least match modsim modflow better than modsim nogw for all metrics evaluated for each of the four stress test scenarios described above we use multiple metrics to evaluate modsim ml accuracy in terms of 1 surface groundwater accretions and depletions 2 agricultural surface water shortages 3 reservoir operations and 4 final outflow from the walker river basin defining modsim modflow as the true target value error in capturing monthly surface groundwater accretions and depletions positive fluxes from groundwater to surface water for accretions negative fluxes for depletions at individual stream reaches is measured in terms of both geographic and temporal variability the variability in net accretions sum of monthly water fluxes over the 10 year model period across all modeled stream reaches for ml and modflow are compared using r2 and nrmse these measures quantify how well the ml model captures spatial distribution in the net magnitude and direction of surface groundwater fluxes the ten year long monthly time series of water fluxes from modflow and ml at each reach are compared using nse kge and nrmse defined in section section 2 2 3 these measures serve to demonstrate whether the ml model accurately captures temporal patterns at individual stream reaches error in annual agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water diversions for irrigation is measured at two temporal scales total shortage over the 10 model years are compared both within each ditch service area using a scatterplot and as a total shortage summed over all water users using percent error these measures test the ability of ml to capture spatial variability in water shortages as well as total magnitudes of water shortage percent error in total shortage in individual years demonstrates the ml model s ability to capture interannual variability of water shortages the monthly difference in reservoir levels between models is divided by reservoir capacity in order to represent the magnitude of errors in surface water storage relative to the amount of potential storage water available we also compare month to month variability of storage graphically annual and monthly percent errors in basin outflow at the wabuska gage give a relative magnitude of inaccuracy in the volume of water flowing to walker lake combined with shortage errors these measures provide information on the net impact of ml errors on the total basin water balance nse and kge of the monthly outflow time series measure the ability of modsim ml to capture temporal patterns of outflow 2 5 sensitivity to changing stream conditions the ultimate goal of developing the numerically efficient modsim ml coupled model is to facilitate running a greater number of model scenarios than would be practical using modsim modflow in order to demonstrate the type of modeling study that becomes possible with reduced computation time we use modsim ml to explore the water allocation system s sensitivity to climate variations across a large gradient of drought and warming we represent these climate variations by altering the timing of surface water inflows to the basin to reflect different snowmelt scenarios in the mountains specifically we simulate the median historical condition with annual peak discharge in june baseline as well as scenarios with peak discharge shifted earlier by one month early shift peak discharge shifted earlier by one month but spreading out the flow over time to mimic a longer snowmelt period early broad increasing spring flows while decreasing summer flows to simulate an early snowmelt with low summer base flow high spring low summer and an extreme condition in which there is no snow storage and streamflow is proportional to monthly precipitation wet season peak for each of these five seasonal stream inflow distributions fig 3 we model nine different total annual flow volumes by multiplying the monthly fractions in fig 3 by the desired annual flow volume for a total of 45 model runs annual flow volumes range from the annual median to minimum volume observed over the historical period of 1996 2011 climate and agricultural water demands are held at 2002 levels drought for all model runs so any modeled differences are due solely to changes in streamflow we compare reservoir storage levels and agricultural surface water shortages across these different streamflow inputs in order to quantify the system s sensitivity to inflow volume representing various degrees of drought and timing representing changing snowmelt dynamics in a warming climate we calculate both reservoir storage on june 1 and mean reservoir storage as the first is an indicator of surface water available at the beginning of the peak growing season and the second captures the system s ability to take advantage of the full reservoir capacity total agricultural surface water shortages demand minus surface water diversions provide a straightforward measure of whether the water allocation system is capable of meeting irrigation needs across the entire basin 3 results 3 1 machine learning model validation ml matched accretions and depletions predicted by modsim modflow over the training period with high accuracy the nrmse at each stream section ranged from 0 to 1 9 nse ranged from 0 96 to 1 figures s4 s5 and kge ranged from 0 88 to 1 for most stream sections the testing data was also modeled well with a median nrmse of 11 range 6 to 28 a median nse of 0 74 range 2 7 to 0 97 and median kge of 0 77 range 58 to 0 97 however 7 of the stream sections had negative nse values indicating that the mean of the testing data would provide a better time series prediction than the given model these negative nse values were isolated to stream reaches with small sporadic groundwater fluxes modeled by modsim modflow small red symbols in figure s6 and therefore represent only a small fraction of the total error by volume within the network among all predictor variables used inflow at west fork walker near coleville wfc was the most likely to be included as one of the most important predictors for a given modsim node s ml model monthly temperature was the second most likely and the previous month s inflow at wfc was third this suggests that for most areas the surface groundwater interactions were primarily related to short term fluctuations in water availability inflows from the largest stream reach in the current or previous month and water demand which is highly correlated to monthly temperature precipitation was not often an important predictor justifying our decision to have a greater number of streamflow related inputs to the ml model and relatively few precipitation metrics see si section 3 for more details 3 2 increased efficiency with machine learning the modflow portion of the water allocation model took approximately 20 min to run for each iteration and multiple iterations are needed in order to converge on a solution which can lead to approximately 24 h being required in order to obtain the final model output the ml code to estimate accretions and depletions on the other hand runs in approximately 3 min and does not require iteration since it uses only external data inputs one iteration of the modsim portion of the model including calculating the water balance a post processing step needed to estimate recharge to the aquifer and runoff from fields requires approximately 30 min even if some iteration is required in order to get the model to converge at most a few hours are needed to run modsim ml for a 15 year simulation 3 3 stress tests for the modsim ml model 3 3 1 accuracy in terms of accretions and depletions the stress test scenarios showed that ml was able to reproduce total surface groundwater fluxes very accurately for most stream sections including those with the most extreme accretions or depletions fig 4 the fit was most accurate for the super wet fig 4c and wet dry wet scenarios fig 4b both of which had r2 0 98 and nrmse 2 but super drought still agreed well with the physically based approach fig 4a r2 0 93 nrmse 5 in the no snow scenario the ml sub model was slightly less accurate than in the other stress test scenarios but still showed a strong correlation to modflow accretions and depletions r2 0 87 nrmse 6 fig 4d model errors were not randomly distributed but showed a bias toward higher net accretions in super drought and no snow scenarios and an opposite bias toward greater depletions in the super wet and wet dry wet scenarios the match for timeseries of accretions and depletions between the modflow and ml models for the wet dry wet scenario was generally high median nse 0 78 median kge 0 75 median nrmse 11 however accuracy varied across space with some modsim stream sections matching almost perfectly nse 0 998 kge 0 983 nrmse 2 and some stream sections showing large errors minimum nse 6 4 minimum kge 175 maximum nrmse 41 errors were greatest during the transition from wet to dry conditions e g node m1 in fig 5 a for comparison setting all surface groundwater fluxes to zero as with modsim nogw gives much poorer median values of nse 1 13 kge 0 73 and nrmse 33 for the wet dry wet scenario for the no snow scenario timeseries of accretions matched modflow output less well fig 5 with a median nse of 0 25 ranging from 12 4 to 0 98 median kge of 0 20 ranging from 18 3 to 0 97 and median nrmse of 29 ranging from 5 to 75 these poor fit metrics for the no snow scenario reflect ml s inability to always capture the full range of seasonal surface groundwater fluxes however the volumes of these ml modeled fluxes tended to still remain within the range of magnitudes predicted by modflow e g nodes m1 and s1 in fig 5b and setting all surface groundwater fluxes to zero as with modsim nogw gives even worse median values of nse 2 02 kge 0 73 and nrmse 56 showing that the ml flux estimates are more informative than merely ignoring groundwater effects 3 3 2 accuracy in terms of agricultural shortages for the 10 year simulation period of the super drought scenario the machine learning version of the model modsim ml underpredicted total surface water irrigation shortages by 12 1 while the model with no surface groundwater interaction modsim nogw underpredicted these shortages by 40 5 fig 6 a in the no snow scenario modsim ml underpredicted total surface water shortages by 9 while modsim nogw underpredicted by 20 none of the model versions predicted any shortages under the super wet scenario for the wet dry wet scenario modsim ml overpredicted total surface water shortages by 18 while modsim nogw underpredicted by 17 this slightly larger error for the modsim ml model is mostly the result of a few demand nodes with high shortages fig 6b most of this error is accrued during the first year of the simulated drought when modsim ml overpredicts shortage by 149 by the fourth consecutive drought year the ml model only overpredicts shortages by 7 while the modsim nogw model underpredicts shortages in that year by 26 in terms of water resource management planning underpredicting shortages is probably more consequential since it could mean failure to adequately prepare whereas overpredictions of shortages may lead to unnecessary costs for mitigation measures but at least would not result in unexpected lack of irrigation water 3 3 3 accuracy in terms of reservoir operations and basin outflow for both super drought and super wet scenarios reservoir storage time series for the modsim ml model matched the modsim modflow model very closely monthly errors 5 of reservoir capacity in contrast modsim nogw overpredicted monthly reservoir storage volumes by up to 18 during super drought with largest errors during summer fig 7 a and underpredicted them by up to 10 under super wet conditions with largest errors occurring during winter fig 7b for wet dry wet the modsim ml model was consistently in between the reservoir levels for the modsim modflow and modsim nogw models fig 8 a and was closer to the modflow version for most time steps fig 8b 3 3 4 accuracy in terms of basin outflow annual basin outflows from the modsim ml model system underpredicted modsim modflow outflows by 3 in the super wet scenario and overpredicted outflows by 20 in the super drought scenario mainly due to overpredictions in winter months fig 7c modsim nogw model overpredicted outflows by 2 for super wet mainly in may june fig 7d and 58 for super drought overestimates occurred in both winter and summer fig 7c in the wet dry wet scenario all model versions matched each other s outflow timeseries with an nse 0 99 but modsim ml underpredicted annual outflow volumes by 0 to 21 while modsim nogw annual errors ranged from 8 to 24 at a monthly timestep modsim ml errors ranged from 37 to 9 while modsim nogw errors had a greater range of 48 to 86 fig 8c modsim ml outflow had kge 0 97 while kge for modsim nogw was slightly lower at 0 92 3 4 example use case sensitivity to changing stream conditions each artificial hydrograph shape refer to fig 3 was scaled so that the total annual inflows equaled various volumes ranging from 424 x106 m3 approximately median annual flow normalized inflow 1 0 down to 244 x106 m3 approximately 2002 volumes normalized inflow 0 58 across the range of inflows tested modsim ml found that earlier peak flows led to shortages similar to those under the base hydrograph differences in shortages 2 of demand fig 9 a despite the growing season starting out with more reservoir storage june 1 storage increased by 6 to 38 of reservoir capacity depending on inflow volume and hydrograph shape fig 9b and decreasing mean annual reservoir storage 0 to 33 fig 9c overall total annual flow volume was much more important than the distribution of flow throughout the year with drought increasing shortages by up to 24 and reducing mean reservoir storage by up to 65 in contrast the wet season peak scenario which represents the most extreme shift in flow timing that could potentially occur had significantly larger shortages compared to the base hydrograph increases 10 to 19 depending on inflow volume fig 9a and produced lower reservoir stages in moderate drought but higher reservoir stages under severe drought shifting at a normalized inflow of 0 8 fig 9b c the wet season peak scenario was also the only hydrograph shape that produced shortages 1 at median annual flow volumes normalized inflow 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of machine learning approach running modsim with groundwater interactions that were estimated using ml was generally more accurate than using a model in which surface groundwater interactions were not included one notable exception to this was during the initial transition from wet conditions to drought in the wet dry wet scenario the ml model overestimated the magnitude of this transition s impact on groundwater fluxes in the first year of dry conditions e g fig 5a and this led to a large overprediction of shortages during that first dry year the inability of ml to accurately capture groundwater declines during drought may be a consequence of having few wet to dry transition periods in the training data set however there appears to be some hysteresis in this model bias since the wetting up post drought was captured quite accurately e g figs 5 and 8 show ml or modsim ml errors that are relatively large in the first year of drought but relatively small in the first year post drought the accuracy of the dry to wet transition is probably due to the fact that little pumping is needed during a wet year no matter what the antecedent conditions and therefore groundwater during wet years behaves fairly predictably rather than being impacted by variable pumping demands modsim modflow predicted that relatively little pumping would be needed during the first drought year of wet dry wet since there was still abundant reservoir storage following the antecedent wet years this is likely the main reason there was little impact on groundwater fluxes compared to most drought years that formed the ml training dataset in which more pumping would have been required since drought years in the training data did not begin with full reservoirs this would explain why ml matched modflow better after multiple drought years when the impact of the drought had had more time to affect groundwater these results suggest that surface water shortages can lead to a negative feedback loop in which greater pumping leads to reduced groundwater discharge to streams barlow leake 2012 and thus even more surface water shortage given the available training data which included less extreme dry periods ml was apparently not able to fully capture the water storage infrastructure s short term ability to mitigate this negative feedback in the super drought scenario the ml model generally underpredicted the amount of water that would be lost from surface water to groundwater while in the super wet scenario the ml model underpredicted the amount of groundwater that would accrete to the gaining reaches fig 4 this could be due to pumping activity in the modflow model changing in response to prolonged wet or dry periods in ways that are not captured by the ml model since its training data include only relatively short wet or dry spells inflows over the previous 2 years were among the most important predictors for 10 of the individual reaches ml models si section 3 and even longer system memory might be important for capturing the groundwater flux dynamics of some reaches these issues could likely be addressed by providing a longer set of training data for the ml model which would allow it to better calibrate for multi year lags in groundwater response to changing hydrologic inputs for this study we chose to calibrate only on modflow outputs from a relatively short period where historical data could be used to drive modflow thus minimizing uncertainty in the modflow results since they were calibrated to the historical data another approach would be to use a model emulation strategy by running modflow over longer periods with artificial inputs e g hypothetical realizations of long dry or wet spells and transitions between the two in order to train the ml model to respond to a wider variety of conditions castelletti et al 2012 interpretation of results from such an approach however would need to take into account that the original modflow model might not accurately capture extreme future conditions and that the ml model will inherit any biases or shortcomings of the modflow results on which it was trained modsim ml was more accurate than modsim nogw in estimating surface water shortages for the super drought and no snow scenarios fig 6 demonstrating the importance of incorporating surface groundwater interactions into the modsim model omitting such interactions led the modsim nogw model to overpredict the total amount of water available during multi year droughts since that model version did not account for the loss of surface water to groundwater in losing stream reaches see figure s6 for spatial distribution of losing stream reaches this water balance error led the modsim nogw model to overpredict reservoir storage and final outflow from the system while underpredicting water shortages figs 6 8 during drought conditions both the modsim modflow and modsim ml models deliver only the minimum required water right during the summer while the modsim nogw model provides some supplemental water during april august fig 7c this additional spring summer water is likely from agricultural runoff in the downstream parts of the system that are lost via depletions to groundwater in the other model versions during winters of the super wet scenario modsim nogw underestimates reservoir storage and system outflows because it fails to capture streamflow gains from groundwater during very wet conditions fig 7b d ml offers an efficient and tractable approach to capturing these complex hydrologic feedbacks that impact water supply capturing these surface groundwater interactions becomes especially important during extended drought as the river becomes more losing over subsequent years due to lower irrigation recharge and more groundwater pumping e g node m1 in fig 5a modsim ml was able to capture most of the impacts of these losing reaches e g overall close matches in fluxes out of streams in figs 4 and 5 while modsim nogw could not capture them since it did not include groundwater fluxes in the wet dry wet scenario error from the modsim nogw model version becomes larger with each subsequent drought year while the error from using ml decreased with each subsequent drought year fig 8b c predictably accretions and depletions were modeled least accurately for the no snow scenario in which the inflow hydrograph diverged greatly from the seasonal patterns experienced with the training data fig 4d however even in this case there was high correlation between ml and modflow accretions and depletions and the total error in modsim shortages was 10 even under this hypothetical climate scenario that is very different from the ml training data individual demand nodes shortages under modflow ml were still more accurate than modflow nogw fig 6c demonstrating that when more detailed modflow simulations are not available there is still value in incorporating approximations of groundwater dynamics from the ml model even under such an extreme scenario with high model uncertainty in practice when studying a climate scenario like this which is so different from the testing data it might be advisable to run modsim modflow once under the new climate scenario and use that model s output to re calibrate the ml model the recalibrated modsim ml could then be used to evaluate small variations to the climate scenario e g climates for a future time simulated using different global circulation models or streamflow inputs calculated from different downscaling techniques 4 2 spatial distribution of error locations where the ml model had negative nse values were limited to a few small areas within mason valley suggesting that ml model error was not random but related to certain areas that were more difficult to represent without a process based model figure s6 it may be that areas with more pumping activity were more difficult to model using ml and mason valley historically experienced approximately three times as much annual pumping as smith valley unpublished nevada division of water resources data 2015 it is also not surprising that mason valley is more difficult to model since it is further downstream in the system and its surface water flows which affect the modflow sub model but not the ml sub model are therefore affected by the net impact of many smaller changes upstream for the super drought scenario smith valley had some of the largest discrepancies in surface water shortages between modsim modflow and modsim ml fig 6 si figure s7 despite surface groundwater fluxes generally being modeled more accurately in smith valley this demonstrates how small errors in groundwater modeling can propagate through the surface water delivery system in unexpected ways in the wet dry wet scenario the spatial patterns of error in shortages more closely matched the spatial pattern of error in surface groundwater fluxes demonstrating how the transition from wet to dry conditions influences the system quite differently from persistent drought fig 6 si figures s6 s7 diversion locations with relatively junior water rights were more prone to error compared to locations with older water rights the diversion points with the greatest relative errors in terms of water shortage were all within the bottom 30th percentile in terms of mean water right age this is expected since water deliveries to older water rights are less likely to be affected by a small change in streamflow volume 4 3 sensitivity to changing stream conditions we found that total annual flow volume was much more important than moderate shifts of flow timing in terms of water demands being met in most cases the system did not begin to experience notable surface water shortages until inflows were below 75 of the long term median fig 9 however under an extreme case of no precipitation being stored as snow wet season peak scenario the system experienced shortages and reduced start of summer reservoir storage even in years with relatively high flows such shortages in the absence of spring summer snowmelt availability is an expected outcome throughout the western united states mankin et al 2015 in extremely dry years modeled mean reservoir storage actually stayed highest in the wet season peak scenario likely because the lack of a snowmelt pulse ensured that streamflow rarely exceeded the reservoir s holding capacity but this increased artificial storage was not sufficient to reduce total shortages the shortage difference between the baseline and wet season peak scenarios was highest when inflows were at 80 of the median with the difference decreasing again as inflows approached historical drought levels the highly nonlinear nature of the water distribution s response to changing inflow hydrographs demonstrates the importance of being able to run many simulations across a range of potential flow scenarios note that our stress test showed that modsim ml underpredicted shortages in the no snow and superdrought test cases fig 6 suggesting that shortages calculated by modsim ml for below average inflows and earlier flow peaks are likely to have a bias toward being too low therefore surface water shortages under prolonged droughts and earlier snowmelt may actually be even higher than what is shown in fig 9 the wet season peak scenario is a first order approximation of the maximum potential change to streamflow seasonal patterns that could occur due to changing precipitation phase from snow to rain under climate change though actual hydrograph changes might be more complex see gordon et al 2022 the scenario with earlier higher spring flow and lower summer flow high spring low summer more closely matches what we actually expect the hydrograph to look like in this region under climate change in the coming century justin l huntington niswonger 2012 zhu et al 2005 the high spring low summer inflows only met 2 to 3 less of demand than the base scenario whereas wet season peak met up to 19 less of demand it is possible that the model would have shown greater sensitivity to the high spring low summer and early shift scenarios if we had used a finer temporal resolution the monthly time step in each of our model components modsim and modflow may not be sufficient to capture the full impact of flow timing shifts which are also on the order of one month while we believe the current analysis is sufficient to capture general trends future work may need to use a finer temporal resolution for decision making this exercise demonstrates the value in exploring multiple metrics of water shortage for example according to mean reservoir storage it would appear that the high spring low summer hydrograph was the most detrimental during drought years but the wet season peak hydrograph was the worst according to actual surface water shortages also reservoir storage begins to drop sharply around 80 of median annual flow while shortages are still very minor for most scenarios illustrating the ability of these reservoirs to provide some buffer against the impacts of low flow volumes fig 9 while this analysis was informative it is important to note that we made a number of simplifying assumptions in order to observe changes that can be attributed exclusively to different hydrographs for example we repeated the same hydrograph each year used the same precipitation and temperature in all scenarios and did not alter crop type or fallow any fields in response to water shortages due to these simplifications the model results may be very different from the water allocations that would actually occur in the real world and should be viewed as more of a sensitivity analysis rather than predictions nonetheless these results provide an illustration of the types of analyses that can be performed much more easily when modsim is coupled with an ml model rather than modflow and this method could be leveraged to run more realistic model scenarios if needed to aid decision making we plan to run more detailed scenarios in future analyses that account for changing water demand among other parameters 4 4 benefits and limitations the main advantage of using the modsim ml model is its much greater computation speed this speed allows for more scenario runs in less time and using fewer computing resources training ml models also enabled the creation of importance plots figure s2 which provide insights into local drivers of the groundwater system for example these importance plots showed that inflows at west fork walker was the most important predictor of surface groundwater fluxes at 42 of nodes figure s3 which is expected given that monthly inflows to west fork walker are an average of 2 4 times greater than inflows at bridgeport importance plots also suggest that including streamflow over the previous two years and thus including a 2 year memory in the model was highly important for 10 of modeled nodes see si section 3 for more details triana et al 2005 also demonstrated the computational benefits of using ml to simulate stream groundwater interactions in a wam though they used a very different type of algorithm artificial neural networks ann triana et al 2005 also did not link modsim directly with a physically based groundwater model meaning they could not evaluate the impacts of their ann on modsim results directly and they could not train their machine learning model on aquifer responses to climate or infrastructure scenarios outside of the historical range the methods presented here rely on the existence of a physically based groundwater model which is fully coupled with a wam in order to provide training data for the ml sub model which is more complicated than the approach of triana et al 2005 but also provides more flexibility and greater certainty when modeling scenarios outside the training data s range an unavoidable drawback of using ml is that it won t work if you change the system too much from training setup although one could always re train ml to a single modflow run under new setup and test small scenario changes using ml instead of modflow groundwater level is not modeled explicitly rather the ml model only predicts flows between the groundwater store and a specific stream reach since the ml model does not explicitly calculate groundwater levels this method does not provide information such as whether wells in a certain area might run dry or whether legal restrictions on pumping might be triggered however the ml model could still capture the impacts of these drawdowns implicitly as long as the training data includes some situations with very low groundwater levels other studies have addressed this issue by incorporating simple physically based representations of surface groundwater dynamics such as stream response functions e g kuwayama brozović 2013 which are computationally efficient but cannot capture as much complexity and nonlinearity as modflow or a machine learning approach of course for both modsim ml and modsim modflow results are also dependent on accuracy of input estimates of climate and agricultural water demand 4 5 larger impacts and future directions while the results shown above are specific to the walker river basin this approach of using machine learning models to predict groundwater flux time series could be applied in any location the only requirement is that either a process based model such as modflow or observational data are available as training data we have demonstrated that capturing spatiotemporally variable groundwater fluxes can be very important for accurate modeling of water allocations in the context of an uncertain hydrologic future ml provides the needed computational speed to run water allocation models under a range of climatic inputs in order to capture the range of this uncertainty the methods explored here will allow us to conduct climate studies of how water allocation in the walker river basin will likely change under different climate scenarios and water governance scenarios this more in depth study will alter both incoming streamflows as well as irrigation water demand according to hydrological and crop models forced by a suite of climate projections we will also explore the impact of changing water allocation priorities and irrigation efficiencies this suite of model explorations will be made possible by combining the flexibility of the modsim modflow model with the computation speed of modsim ml future work will identify effective methods of training the ml sub model to relevant modflow outputs in order to fill in gaps between extremes modeled with the slower modsim modflow method 5 conclusion machine learning was able to reproduce groundwater surface water interactions in our water allocation model for the walker river basin with high accuracy the model had some difficulty accurately capturing transitions from very wet to very dry conditions and in modeling the dynamics of a streamflow regime that was greatly altered from the training dataset however the overall impact of these difficulties on the final water allocation model were minimal we found that ignoring groundwater fluxes resulted in significant under predictions in estimated agricultural shortages using ml based approaches to mimic groundwater fluxes was able to capture shortages more accurately than ignoring groundwater all together and still maintain numerical efficiency incorporating these groundwater fluxes in the water allocation model was especially important under drought conditions we have demonstrated that a machine learning algorithm trained on modflow output can be used to accurately reproduce modflow results using only information regarding streamflow season and weather we also demonstrated use of the algorithm to process a gradient of possible hydrographic responses to decreasing snowpack to provide better understanding of system sensitivity to inflow timing and volume while only a proof of concept to enable more detailed modeling using global climate models to inform hydrologic supply and demand we found the contemporary wrb infrastructure somewhat resilient to modest changes in streamflow amount and timing however the current structure was unable to buffer agricultural shortages in the extreme case of winter rains in the mountains and no snow storage in conclusion we found that replacing a modflow groundwater model with ml maintains the need to explicitly account for groundwater fluxes in the system but provides an efficient platform this efficiency will enable future work in the wrb to more explicitly test where and when hydrologic thresholds with climate change occur using a monte carlo framework that was impossible with the physically based

wang et al 2022 additionally our field long term monitoring results showed that the nitrate concentration in groundwater decreased with groundwater rising and increased with falling while the opposite trend was observed for ammonium fig 1 b it can therefore be speculated that the variation in nitrogen concentration in the surrounding contaminated groundwater follows a similar pattern to test this hypothesis a soil sampling well was constructed 100 m southeast of the monitoring well the medium lithology of underground 2 5 m in the vadose zone was clay and fine sand that of 5 6 m in the groundwater table fluctuation zone was mainly fine sand and the zone below 6 m was water saturated soil was collected in the groundwater table fluctuation zone for the microcosm experiment 2 2 experiment on n transformation under groundwater table fluctuation the experimental device was composed of an organic glass built intermediate sand tank measuring 100 cm in length 30 cm in breadth and 70 cm in depth a water supply pool as well as a water discharge pool measuring 5 cm in length 30 cm in width and 70 cm in depth fig 2 the two water pools were connected using peristaltic pumps using silicone hoses to regulate water table and water flow rate quartz sand was filled in the bottom and top of the sand tank and 60 mesh nylon meshes were covered in the bottom and surrounding areas to prevent soil leakage and ensure the flow of water in addition to leaving a 1 5 cm wide blank in the water pools to observe the water table a black light shielding film was pasted on the outside of the entire main device to simulate the underground light proof environment three water sampling holes were arranged at the front of the sand tank at heights of 50 cm layer a 30 cm layer b and 10 cm layer c from the bottom and three soil sampling holes were arranged at the same height on the back of the sand tank to ensure microbial activity the sand tank was filled quickly based on the bulk density after sampling the soil on site after filling vents on the top of the sand tank were connected to n2 bags to ensure the original redox state groundwater was pumped on the field just before the start of the experiment which was placed in a light tight water supply device connected to n2 bags and was replenished every day during the experiment the basic properties of groundwater are shown in table 1 the whole experiment was divided into rising and falling processes and lasted for 62 days before the experiment soil in different layers were sampled a0 c0 at the beginning of rising rising stage vents were opened and the water supply device was connected to the sand tank the groundwater recharge flow was controlled to 20 ml min i e 0 137 m d as the groundwater velocity using peristaltic pumps after 4 days of recharge the groundwater table rose from the initial level h0 to the highest designed water table level h1 and the discharge rate was set to be the same as the recharge rate groundwater was continuously supplied to maintain the water level at 55 cm until the 21st day and samples of soil were collected a1 c1 to monitor nitrogen transformation processes during the water table decline the falling process was designed in two stages in the falling ⅰ stage the water table control device was adjusted so that the water level decreased to 35 cm h2 and remained stable until day 38 when medium was sampled from soil profile a2 c2 at this stage the top of the sandbox a layer is unsaturated while the bottom b and c layers could still be accessed to collect saturated groundwater in the falling ⅱ stage the water table lowered to the point where no water flowed out at the water outlet h3 and the medium was sampled from soil profile on day 62 a3 c3 groundwater samples were collected by connecting the front groundwater sampling holes to a soil solution sampler rhizon mom netherlands the soil sampling holes on the back is equipped with a spiral interface that can be opened and closed when collecting soil samples the screw interface was opened and the sterile sampling glass tube was used to collect the samples after sampling the screw interface was closed and sealed with parafilm the soil samples were divided into two parts one part was stored at 80 c for microbial and functional gene determination and the other was stored at 4 c for determination of physicochemical properties water samples at different depths were collected every second day during the experiment using a soil solution sampler 2 3 water chemistry and soil property analysis the do of the water samples was tested on site using a portable multiparameter water quality meter hach hq40d the collected water samples were immediately filtered with a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane and tested with a professional instrument no3 and nh4 were tested with a uv spectrophotometer unico uv 2100 and doc was tested with a toc system shimadzu toc l cph cn200 the soil samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 12 h the weight of soil before and after falling was measured and the moisture content ω was calculated the soils were digested with potassium dichromate and alkaline potassium sulfate and the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn contents were measured by a uv spectrophotometer the ammonia and nitrate in the soil were extracted with kcl and the supernatant after centrifugation was extracted and tested by a uv spectrophotometer 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing analysis soil genomic dna was extracted from 0 5 g soil according to the instructions of the e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek norcross ga usa dna extraction quality was detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna concentration and purity were determined by a nanodrop2000 system the v3 v4 region in the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers under the indicated conditions after mixing the pcr products of the same sample the pcr products were verified using a 2 agarose gel and the recovered products were purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa the purified products were then quantified using a quantus fluorometer promega usa finally dna libraries were constructed using the nextflex rapid dna seq kit sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq pe300 platform the original sequencing results were quality controlled with fastp and spliced with flash the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity truncated values the phylogenetic affiliation of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed with the rdp classifier against the silva ssu132 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 2 5 quantitative real time pcr qpcr was used to study functional genes related to nitrogen transformation aoa amoa and aob amoa were used to indicate nitrification and narg nirk nirs

differences among chao ace and shannon index in different water table stages in soil profile were tested by a least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 using spss 25 ibm usa to reveal the interrelationships between do nitrogen transformation bacterial community structure and functional genes in nitrate contaminated groundwater under groundwater table fluctuation a structure equation model sem was constructed using amos 28 which fitted the present data well χ2 16 378 df 7 cfi 0 904 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the redox environment under groundwater table fluctuation the experimental system allowed for long term precise control of the groundwater table in the sandbox the enforced water table regime in turn controlled the temporal variation in do concentration in groundwater as shown in fig 3 at the beginning of rising stage oxygen rich air trapped in sediment pore space was captured by oxygen depleted groundwater chen et al 2020 leading to a significant increase in groundwater do concentration when the water table was raised to 55 cm and reached stability all layers showed a negative oxygen balance and the oxygen was consumed the do concentration gradually decreased from 3 46 3 33 and 3 37 mg l to 2 92 2 01 and 2 09 mg l from layer a to layer c respectively then as the water table dropped to 35 cm falling ⅰ stage the previously saturated soil in layer a changed to unsaturated the downward displacement of the air water interface enhanced the air diffusive transport at the b and c layers jia et al 2017 jurado et al 2017 which led to an increase of the corresponding do concentrations from 2 35 and 2 25 mg l to 3 17 and 3 10 mg l respectively changes in do concentration caused by water table fluctuation affected oxygen dependent environmental factors in direct or indirect paths from fig 3 the highest soil moisture content in the c layer decreased from 0 44 to 0 14 owing to the increasing oxygen air volume furthermore the increasing oxygen content promoted the oxidation and decomposition of soil organic carbon yang et al 2014 as a result the toc content of soil decreased from 0 28 0 32 in the rising period to 0 08 0 18 in the falling period soil organic matter is a significant source of doc malik and gleixner 2013 which may be converted to doc in groundwater with the participation of microorganisms however beyond the expected results the doc concentration in groundwater did not increase but gradually decreased at a relatively steady rate this might be due to the involvement of doc as an effective electron donor in the biogeochemical reactions in groundwater bourg and bertin 1993 3 2 nitrogen transformation in controlled nitrate contaminated groundwater the hypoxic environment generated by water table inundation altered the nitrogen transformation in groundwater and promoted the denitrification and dnra as shown in fig 4 the mean groundwater nitrate concentration decreased from 15 to 8 5 mg l on the 8th day of rising which was below the who guideline value this meant that the water table raise made nitrate concentration in groundwater from exceeding to meeting the standard furthermore along the vertical profile the nitrate concentration in groundwater decreased from layer a to layers b and c from 10 93 to 9 9 and 8 5 mg l respectively which suggested that nitrate dissimilation was more intense at the bottom of the sandbox compared with the fluctuation condition the continuous lateral runoff under the constant water table condition appeared to predominate from 9 to 20 days nitrate concentration in groundwater recovered to the level of the recharge source however the rate of doc depletion in this period was approximately equal to that in the previous period which might because the nitrogen transformation processes in the water table fluctuation zone were still ongoing in addition inundation contributed to a considerable loss of total n in soil in agreement with a previous report in which a large amount of organic nitrogen rapidly dissolved in the rising water and flowed out of the simulation system through the effluent chen et al 2022 as the water table dropped from 55 cm to 35 cm falling ⅰ stage the increase in do concentration led to changes in nitrogen transformation as shown in fig 4 from 20 to 27 days the ammonium concentrations in layers b and c decreased from 0 19 and 0 11 mg l to 0 03 and 0 02 mg l respectively meanwhile the nitrate concentrations increased to 19 0 and 17 5 mg l both of which were higher than those in the recharge source this indicated that the nitrification caused by water table decline aggravated the groundwater nitrate contamination and the intensity of nitrification at the top of the fluctuating zone was higher than that at the bottom furthermore nitrification transforms ammonium in the soil into nitrate which may contribute to higher nitrate concentration in soil however the results showed that soil nitrate concentration in layers b and c decreased to 5 10 and 6 95 mg kg with the drop of the groundwater table while total nitrogen and nitrate concentration in groundwater at the sandtank outlet showed an increasing trend table s2 which indicated that nitrate might leach from the sandtank though water flow shen et al 2023 as same as the rising process after a period of water table fluctuation from 27 to 37 days the continuous lateral runoff converged the nitrate concentration in groundwater to that at the inlet therefore we concluded that water table fluctuation altered nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater but the effect was somewhat time limited during the falling ⅱ stage the mean values of moisture and toc content in soil decreased from 0 295 and 0 197 mg kg in the falling ⅰ stage to 0 109 and 0 127 mg kg in addition the mean values of no3 n and nh4 n content in soil decreased to 3 93 mg kg and 6 39 mg kg respectively 3 3 bacterial community characteristics during nitrogen transformation 3 3 1 bacterial richness and diversity the rising and falling of soil profiles driven by groundwater table fluctuation has a significant impact on the soil moisture oxygen content c and n availability among other parameters which are important environmental factors affecting bacterial community characteristics supramaniam et al 2016 zuo et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 the chao and ace values indicating microbial abundance chao and lee 1992 increased from 2899 and 2877 to 3054 and 3047 respectively the shannon value used to estimate microbial diversity lande 1996 showed overall increasing trend from the a layer to the c layer ranging from 3 53 to 6 70 which suggested an increasing microbial diversity compared to the pre experimental period groundwater table fluctuation resulted in significant changes in chao ace and shannon indices p 0 05 therefore the results revealed that groundwater table fluctuation significantly promoted the microbial abundance and diversity in soil the reason was that compared with bacterial communities shaped by stable and less dynamic hydrologic settings communities formed by rapidly fluctuating hydrologic conditions needed to increase their abundance and diversity to adapt to variable environmental conditions such as water content oxygen content and c and n availability meng et al 2021 peralta et al 2014 3 3 2 bacterial community structure the microbial community composition of soil at the phylum level at different water table stages was analyzed fig 6 a the dominant bacterial phyla were actinobacteriota proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteriota accounting for 50 79 of the total bacterial phyla the abundance of actinobacteriota and proteobacteria had the most pronounced changes with water table fluctuation while chloroflexi and acidobacteriota showed relatively stable abundances actinobacteriota one of the common soil hypoxic bacteria lupwayi et al 2018 can be utilized to indicate the transition from anaerobic to aerobic condition liu et al 2021 oxygen brought by groundwater table fluctuation resulted in a decreasing mean abundance of actinobacteriota from 25 83 in rising period to 11 84 in falling period proteobacteria play an important role in nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification xue et al 2022 the mean abundance of proteobacteria increased from 18 23 to 42 54 during the rise and fall of the water table suggesting that the water table fluctuation significantly promoted nitrogen transformation in fluctuation zone for more details a bar graph was constructed to exhibit the microbial community profiles at the genus level fig 6 b the bacterial communities in different water table stages were dominated by arthrobacter sp norank p gal15 sp nocardioides sp and lysobacter sp during the flooding and drying ⅰ stages both b and c layers were saturated however the relative abundance of arthrobacter sp and norank p gal15 sp was higher in b1 and c1 than in b2 and c2 which indicated that the water table fluctuation affected the microbial community structure arthrobacter sp has been regarded as a crucial bacterium participating in dnra under anoxic conditions he et al 2020 the average abundance of arthrobacter sp in different layers decreased from 6 16 in rising period to 2 06 in falling period indicating that the intensity of dnra gradually decreased with the lower groundwater table the abundance of nocardioides sp involved in the nitrification reaction was highest before the experiment 21 29 but decreased to 1 34 at rising period due to the rising water table previous studies had shown that the abundances of lysobacter sp exhibited a substantial positive connection with the content of available nitrogen yang et al 2021 while gal15 sp was regarded as an oligotrophic taxon yang et al 2022b as the water table decreased the abundances of lysobacter sp and gal15 sp showed an increasing and decreasing trend respectively indicating that the decreasing water table improved the effectiveness of soil n this might be due to the increased oxygen content in the fluctuation zone caused by the falling water table which promoted the mineralization of soil organic nitrogen 3 3 3 significant differences among bacterial communities to identify significantly different biomarkers affecting nitrogen transformation during groundwater table fluctuation the differential abundance of soil bacteria was characterized based on the lefse analysis fig 7 showed the phylogenetic tree of marker microorganisms from the phylum to genus level in layer b which was conspicuously affected by water table fluctuation a total of 97 bacterial clades showed statistically significant differences in abundance between clades p 0 05 a threshold of 4 0 was chosen for the logarithmic lda scores fig s1 during the rising period arthrobacter sp gal15 sp and bacillus sp were enriched within the bacterial communities it has been established that arthrobacter sp belonging to actinobacteriota is involved in dnra while bacillus sp belonging to firmicutes is one of the typical bacteria involved in denitrification zuo et al 2021 the enrichment of arthrobacter sp and bacillus sp indicated that dnra and denitrification occurred during the groundwater rising period in addition the high contribution of gal15 sp indicated the changes of the soil n effectiveness during the falling period chloroflexi sp acidobacteriota sp and gammaproteobacteria sp belonging to proteobacteria were enriched in the microbial community among them chloroflexi sp participates in the second step of nitrification i e the oxidation of no2 sorokin et al 2012 acidobacteriota sp and gammaproteobacteria sp play a major role in ammonium oxidation abed et al 2015 evidence from bacterial biomarkers suggested that nitrogen transformation in the water table fluctuation zone shifted to nitrification as the water table decrease 3 4 abundance of functional genes during nitrogen transformation the microbial transformation of nitrogen is a cycle of different sub step processes that proceed in an orderly fashion liu et al 2023 nitrate is reduced to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and ammonium in sequence with microbial involvement and the functional genes involved in nitrogen transformation are narg nirs norb and norz respectively mosley et al 2022 therefore the above functional genes can serve as proof of nitrogen transformation progresses kraft et al 2014 as shown in fig 8 the abundance of narg nirs and nosz indicating denitrification were highest during the rising period and declined as the water table decreased this result suggested that denitrification mainly occurred during the rising period and gradually weakened with the rising falling transition which is consistent with common denitrification characteristics qiao et al 2020 the trend of increasing do concentration and decreasing no3 concentration in groundwater also supported this conclusion fig 3 and fig 4 with the lowering of the water table the do concentration in the water table fluctuation zone increased zhang et al 2020 the aoa and aob genes involving in ammonium oxidation liu et al 2015 were most abundant during the falling period while the abundance of denitrification genes decreased significantly the result suggested that the role of nitrification was stronger than that of denitrification in this period consequently the gene evidence revealed that the nitrogen functional genes had a significant response to water table fluctuation and as the water table decreased the main nitrogen transformation that occurred in the water table fluctuation zone shifted from denitrification to nitrification 3 5 mechanism of nitrogen transformations by groundwater table fluctuation the sem analysis demonstrated that groundwater table fluctuation altered not only the do but also the dominant bacterial abundance and functional gene groups in direct and indirect paths resulting in changes in nitrogen transformation fig 9 a and b specifically the direct effect coefficients of the groundwater table with do and dominant microbial abundance were 0 927 and 0 716 fig 9 c revealing that water table fluctuation was the direct factor stimulating changes in the redox environment and microbial community structure which was in agreement with previous studies meng et al 2021 the decline in the groundwater table created favorable aerobic conditions for the growth of nitrifying bacteria such as chloroflexi acidobacteriota and gammaproteobacteria furthermore do and dominant microbial abundance controlled by the groundwater table had direct relationships with nosz and aoa aob which were shown to be major determining factors for ammonium and nitrate transformation petersen et al 2012 zhang and ji 2018 as mentioned above our results showed that the influence of groundwater table fluctuation on nitrogen transformation was mainly through indirect paths fig 9 d and changes in the groundwater table affected the do and dominant bacterial abundance which in turn altered the functional gene groups and the accumulation or reduction of ammonium and nitrate therefore it can be concluded that groundwater table fluctuation is an essential driving force affecting nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater situations in field scenarios are much more complex numerous factors such as soil nitrogen dissolution and leaching owing to precipitation dilution due to surface water recharge and nitrogen transformation caused by groundwater table fluctuation all have an impact on groundwater nitrate concentration yang et al 2023 in this study we confirmed the third hypothesis and broadened the understanding of how and to what extent water table fluctuation affect nitrogen transformation by regulating the do microbial community structure and functional genes it should be noted that water table fluctuation occurs constantly due to the influences of precipitation surface water groundwater interaction and agricultural irrigation as a result the nitrate concentration in groundwater may be continuously variable particularly for some areas with minor nitrate contamination water table fluctuation may alter the groundwater nitrate contamination status which seriously clouds the accurate understanding of groundwater quality therefore in sensitive areas such as centralized or decentralized groundwater drinking water sources multiperiod or long time series of water quality monitoring should be adopted to reasonably evaluate the risks associated with nitrate contamination and to safeguard groundwater supplies 4 conclusions this study shed light on the mutual effects of the do bacterial community structure functional gene groups and associated nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater under groundwater table fluctuation groundwater table rising reduced nitrate concentration while falling aggravated it specifically denitrification and dnra induced by rising reduced the average nitrate concentration from 15 to 8 5 mg l which was below the who guideline value while nitrification induced by falling aggravated groundwater nitrate contamination moreover groundwater table fluctuation enriched soil bacterial abundance and diversity and modified the microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels biomarkers such as arthrobacter sp bacillus sp chloroflexi sp and acidobacteriota sp involved in nitrogen transformation as well as functional genes of nitrogen transformation were identified as an essential environmental driving force groundwater table fluctuation influenced nitrogen transformation through indirect paths and changes in the groundwater table affected the do and dominant bacterial abundance which in turn altered the functional gene groups and the accumulation or reduction of ammonium and nitrate this study enhances our knowledge of how and to what extent nitrogen transformation is affected by groundwater table fluctuation and long term monitoring is needed to properly assess the risk of

biochemical environment and nitrogen transformation leading to periodic changes in groundwater nitrate concentration a microcosm experiment of groundwater table fluctuation was designed to explore the underlying mechanism the dissolved oxygen do bacterial community functional gene groups and associated nitrogen transformation were investigated based on field scenario the results showed that groundwater rising reduced the average nitrate concentration while falling aggravated it owing to the variations in groundwater table the do concentration underwent periodic changes furthermore the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria were enriched and the structure of the microbial community was altered nitrogen transformation biomarkers such as arthrobacter sp bacillus sp chloroflexi sp and acidobacteriota sp as well as nitrogen transformation functional genes were identified a structure equation model was established which demonstrated that groundwater table fluctuation altered do and the dominant bacterial abundance which in turn modified the functional gene groups and nitrogen transformation this study broadens the understanding of how and to what extent groundwater table

become a critical environmental problem around the world richa et al 2022 yang et al 2022a 30 regions in africa 20 in asia and 9 in europe are in a catastrophic state with regard to nitrate pollution in groundwater abascal et al 2022 gu et al 2013 han et al 2016 the increasing trend will be amplified owing to climate change and anthropogenic activities he et al 2022 nitrogen leaching from agricultural and nonagricultural sources contribute to widespread nitrate contamination of groundwater gutierrez et al 2018 nikolenko et al 2018 high nitrate levels in groundwater can lead to serious environmental threats szymczycha et al 2017 and human health problems bahadoran et al 2015 as a result the world health organization who has recommend a guideline value of 50 mg l for nitrate 11 3 mg l nitrate as nitrogen who 2011 many efforts have been made to prevent or treat nitrate contamination of groundwater and to make reasonable adjustments in nitrogen management xin et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 nitrogen transformation plays a major role in modifying nitrogen species and concentrations in groundwater through nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox covatti and grischek 2021 from the water quality perspective it is favorable to exploit any process in the nitrogen cycle that serves as a sink in nitrate contaminated groundwater korom and scott 1992 denitrification fulfills this criterion and is therefore regarded as the most important nitrogen removal process in aquifer morrissy et al 2021 following nature based approaches natural attenuation artificial wetlands and horizontal levees have evolved to remove excess nitrate from groundwater cecchetti et al 2022 rivett et al 2008 numerous studies have shown that nitrogen transformation in shallow groundwater is influenced by biogeochemical processes li et al 2020 the concentration and availability of dissolved oxygen do as well as other environmental conditions such as nitrate concentration ph temperature and microbial acclimation are essential factors regulating nitrogen transformation yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 in addition nitrogen transformation processes interact with each other and are regulated by relevant microorganisms xia et al 2020 zhang and furman 2020 as well as functional genes such as aoa amoa aob amoa nirs narg and nosz kuypers et al 2018 stoliker et al 2016 in hyporheic and coastal regions where hydrodynamic conditions change frequently environmental factors the nature of the microbial community and associated variations in nitrogen transformations and concentrations have been extensively studied liu et al 2017 groundwater table fluctuation zone with steep physical chemical and biological gradients has emerged as a hotspot for nitrogen transformation research li et al 2021 rezanezhad et al 2014 xin et al 2021 it has been reported that nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater varies significantly with different seasons li et al 2015 which is influenced by the thickness and permeability of vadose zone liu et al 2022 soil nitrogen content chen et al 2022 kawagoshi et al 2019 and water table fluctuation zhang and furman 2023 our focus is the latter previous studies have demonstrated that variations in the groundwater table lead to periodic changes in do accompanied by the transition from anoxic to aerobic states chen et al 2020 furthermore changes in environmental factors have an impact on the structure and activity of nitrogen transforming microorganisms which play essential roles in regulating nitrogen transformation despite these efforts knowledge gaps remain regarding the interplaying paths through which groundwater table fluctuation affects do bacterial community characteristics functional genes and associated nitrogen transformations mimicking the observed groundwater table and the concentration of nitrogen a microcosm system was established the objectives of this work were threefold 1 to identify changes in the do and nitrogen transformation processes under groundwater table fluctuation 2 to investigate the response of microbial communities and functional gene groups during nitrogen transformation and 3 to reveal the regulatory mechanism of the do bacterial community structure functional gene groups and associated nitrogen transformation driven by groundwater table fluctuation the results provide a new understanding of the impact of groundwater table fluctuation on nitrate concentration and are crucial for assessing and managing risks of groundwater nitrate contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and soil sampling the study site 39 85 n 116 72 e located in the center of tongzhou district beijing china downstream of the alluvial plain of the yongding river and chaobai river fig 1 a the region experiences a typical temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 11 3 and precipitation of 620 mm mainly occurring from june to september consistent with the topography the groundwater generally flows from northwest to southeast due to precipitation recharge river infiltration lateral runoff and irrigation return the shallow groundwater table fluctuates from 10 57 m to 11 86 m as shown in fig 1 a cropland 55 33 and impervious land 42 29 are the largest land use types in the study area followed by rivers 1 33 and forests 1 04 groundwater in the region is generally contaminated to varying degrees due to extensive agricultural and industrial activities with nitrate and ammonium as the main contaminants miao et al 2019 previous investigations reported that in some areas of intense agricultural activity the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations exceeded 16 30 mg l and 4 53 mg l respectively wang et al 2022 additionally our field long term monitoring results showed that the nitrate concentration in groundwater decreased with groundwater rising and increased with falling while the opposite trend was observed for ammonium fig 1 b it can therefore be speculated that the variation in nitrogen concentration in the surrounding contaminated groundwater follows a similar pattern to test this hypothesis a soil sampling well was constructed 100 m southeast of the monitoring well the medium lithology of underground 2 5 m in the vadose zone was clay and fine sand that of 5 6 m in the groundwater table fluctuation zone was mainly fine sand and the zone below 6 m was water saturated soil was collected in the groundwater table fluctuation zone for the microcosm experiment 2 2 experiment on n transformation under groundwater table fluctuation the experimental device was composed of an organic glass built intermediate sand tank measuring 100 cm in length 30 cm in breadth and 70 cm in depth a water supply pool as well as a water discharge pool measuring 5 cm in length 30 cm in width and 70 cm in depth fig 2 the two water pools were connected using peristaltic pumps using silicone hoses to regulate water table and water flow rate quartz sand was filled in the bottom and top of the sand tank and 60 mesh nylon meshes were covered in the bottom and surrounding areas to prevent soil leakage and ensure the flow of water in addition to leaving a 1 5 cm wide blank in the water pools to observe the water table a black light shielding film was pasted on the outside of the entire main device to simulate the underground light proof environment three water sampling holes were arranged at the front of the sand tank at heights of 50 cm layer a 30 cm layer b and 10 cm layer c from the bottom and three soil sampling holes were arranged at the same height on the back of the sand tank to ensure microbial activity the sand tank was filled quickly based on the bulk density after sampling the soil on site after filling vents on the top of the sand tank were connected to n2 bags to ensure the original redox state groundwater was pumped on the field just before the start of the experiment which was placed in a light tight water supply device connected to n2 bags and was replenished every day during the experiment the basic properties of groundwater are shown in table 1 the whole experiment was divided into rising and falling processes and lasted for 62 days before the experiment soil in different layers were sampled a0 c0 at the beginning of rising rising stage vents were opened and the water supply device was connected to the sand tank the groundwater recharge flow was controlled to 20 ml min i e 0 137 m d as the groundwater velocity using peristaltic pumps after 4 days of recharge the groundwater table rose from the initial level h0 to the highest designed water table level h1 and the discharge rate was set to be the same as the recharge rate groundwater was continuously supplied to maintain the water level at 55 cm until the 21st day and samples of soil were collected a1 c1 to monitor nitrogen transformation processes during the water table decline the falling process was designed in two stages in the falling ⅰ stage the water table control device was adjusted so that the water level decreased to 35 cm h2 and remained stable until day 38 when medium was sampled from soil profile a2 c2 at this stage the top of the sandbox a layer is unsaturated while the bottom b and c layers could still be accessed to collect saturated groundwater in the falling ⅱ stage the water table lowered to the point where no water flowed out at the water outlet h3 and the medium was sampled from soil profile on day 62 a3 c3 groundwater

model sem was constructed using amos 28 which fitted the present data well χ2 16 378 df 7 cfi 0 904 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the redox environment under groundwater table fluctuation the experimental system allowed for long term precise control of the groundwater table in the sandbox the enforced water table regime in turn controlled the temporal variation in do concentration in groundwater as shown in fig 3 at the beginning of rising stage oxygen rich air trapped in sediment pore space was captured by oxygen depleted groundwater chen et al 2020 leading to a significant increase in groundwater do concentration when the water table was raised to 55 cm and reached stability all layers showed a negative oxygen balance and the oxygen was consumed the do concentration gradually decreased from 3 46 3 33 and 3 37 mg l to 2 92 2 01 and 2 09 mg l from layer a to layer c respectively then as the water table dropped to 35 cm falling ⅰ stage the previously saturated soil in layer a changed to unsaturated the downward displacement of the air water interface enhanced the air diffusive transport at the b and c layers jia et al 2017 jurado et al 2017 which led to an increase of the corresponding do concentrations from 2 35 and 2 25 mg l to 3 17 and 3 10 mg l respectively changes in do concentration caused by water table fluctuation affected oxygen dependent environmental factors in direct or indirect paths from fig 3 the highest soil moisture content in the c layer decreased from 0 44 to 0 14 owing to the increasing oxygen air volume furthermore the increasing oxygen content promoted the oxidation and decomposition of soil organic carbon yang et al 2014 as a result the toc content of soil decreased from 0 28 0 32 in the rising period to 0 08 0 18 in the falling period soil organic matter is a significant source of doc malik and gleixner 2013 which may be converted to doc in groundwater with the participation of microorganisms however beyond the expected results the doc concentration in groundwater did not increase but gradually decreased at a relatively steady rate this might be due to the involvement of doc as an effective electron donor in the biogeochemical reactions in groundwater bourg and bertin 1993 3 2 nitrogen transformation in controlled nitrate contaminated groundwater the hypoxic environment generated by water table inundation altered the nitrogen transformation in groundwater and promoted the denitrification and dnra as shown in fig 4 the mean groundwater nitrate concentration decreased from 15 to 8 5 mg l on the 8th day of rising which was below the who guideline value this meant that the water table raise made nitrate concentration in groundwater from exceeding to meeting the standard furthermore along the vertical profile the nitrate concentration in groundwater decreased from layer a to layers b and c from 10 93 to 9 9 and 8 5 mg l respectively which suggested that nitrate dissimilation was more intense at the bottom of the sandbox compared with the fluctuation condition the continuous lateral runoff under the constant water table condition appeared to predominate from 9 to 20 days nitrate concentration in groundwater recovered to the level of the recharge source however the rate of doc depletion in this period was approximately equal to that in the previous period which might because the nitrogen transformation processes in the water table fluctuation zone were still ongoing in addition inundation contributed to a considerable loss of total n in soil in agreement with a previous report in which a large amount of organic nitrogen rapidly dissolved in the rising water and flowed out of the simulation system through the effluent chen et al 2022 as the water table dropped from 55 cm to 35 cm falling ⅰ stage the increase in do concentration led to changes in nitrogen transformation as shown in fig 4 from 20 to 27 days the ammonium concentrations in layers b and c decreased from 0 19 and 0 11 mg l to 0 03 and 0 02 mg l respectively meanwhile the nitrate concentrations increased to 19 0 and 17 5 mg l both of which were higher than those in the recharge source this indicated that the nitrification caused by water table decline aggravated the groundwater nitrate contamination and the intensity of nitrification at the top of the fluctuating zone was higher than that at the bottom furthermore nitrification transforms ammonium in the soil into nitrate which may contribute to higher nitrate concentration in soil however the results showed that soil nitrate concentration in layers b and c decreased to 5 10 and 6 95 mg kg with the drop of the groundwater table while total nitrogen and nitrate concentration in groundwater at the sandtank outlet showed an increasing trend table s2 which indicated that nitrate might leach from the sandtank though water flow shen et al 2023 as same as the rising process after a period of water table fluctuation from 27 to 37 days the continuous lateral runoff converged the nitrate concentration in groundwater to that at the inlet therefore we concluded that water table fluctuation altered nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater but the effect was somewhat time limited during the falling ⅱ stage the mean values of moisture and toc content in soil decreased from 0 295 and 0 197 mg kg in the falling ⅰ stage to 0 109 and 0 127 mg kg in addition the mean values of no3 n and nh4 n content in soil decreased to 3 93 mg kg and 6 39 mg kg respectively 3 3 bacterial community characteristics during nitrogen transformation 3 3 1 bacterial richness and diversity the rising and falling of soil profiles driven by groundwater table fluctuation has a significant impact on the soil moisture oxygen content c and n availability among other parameters which are important environmental factors affecting bacterial community characteristics supramaniam et al 2016 zuo et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 the chao and ace values indicating microbial abundance chao and lee 1992 increased from 2899 and 2877 to 3054 and 3047 respectively the shannon value used to estimate microbial diversity lande 1996 showed overall increasing trend from the a layer to the c layer ranging from 3 53 to 6 70 which suggested an increasing microbial diversity compared to the pre experimental period groundwater table fluctuation resulted in significant changes in chao ace and shannon indices p 0 05 therefore the results revealed that groundwater table fluctuation significantly promoted the microbial abundance and diversity in soil the reason was that compared with bacterial communities shaped by stable and less dynamic hydrologic settings communities formed by rapidly fluctuating hydrologic conditions needed to increase their abundance and diversity to adapt to variable environmental conditions such as water content oxygen content and c and n availability meng et al 2021 peralta et al 2014 3 3 2 bacterial community structure the microbial community composition of soil at the phylum level at different water table stages was analyzed fig 6 a the dominant bacterial phyla were actinobacteriota proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteriota accounting for 50 79 of the total bacterial phyla the abundance of actinobacteriota and proteobacteria had the most pronounced changes with water table fluctuation while chloroflexi and acidobacteriota showed relatively stable abundances actinobacteriota one of the common soil hypoxic bacteria lupwayi et al 2018 can be utilized to indicate the transition from anaerobic to aerobic condition liu et al 2021 oxygen brought by groundwater table fluctuation resulted in a decreasing mean abundance of actinobacteriota from 25 83 in rising period to 11 84 in falling period proteobacteria play an important role in nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification xue et al 2022 the mean abundance of proteobacteria increased from 18 23 to 42 54 during the rise and fall of the water table suggesting that the water table fluctuation significantly promoted nitrogen transformation in fluctuation zone for more details a bar graph was constructed to exhibit the microbial community profiles at the genus level fig 6 b the bacterial communities in different water table stages were dominated by arthrobacter sp norank p gal15 sp nocardioides sp and lysobacter sp during the flooding and drying ⅰ stages both b and c layers were saturated however the relative abundance of arthrobacter sp and norank p gal15 sp was higher in b1 and c1 than in b2 and c2 which indicated that the water table fluctuation affected the microbial community structure arthrobacter sp has been regarded as a crucial bacterium participating in dnra under anoxic conditions he et al 2020 the average abundance of arthrobacter sp in different layers decreased from 6 16 in rising period to 2 06 in falling period indicating that the intensity of dnra gradually decreased with the lower groundwater table the abundance of nocardioides sp involved in the nitrification reaction was highest before the experiment 21 29 but decreased to 1 34 at rising period due to the rising water table previous studies had shown that the abundances of lysobacter sp exhibited a substantial positive connection with the content of available nitrogen yang et al 2021 while gal15 sp was regarded as an oligotrophic taxon yang et al 2022b as the water table decreased the abundances of lysobacter sp and gal15 sp showed an increasing and decreasing trend respectively indicating that the decreasing water table improved the effectiveness of soil n this might be due to the increased oxygen content in the fluctuation zone caused by the falling water table which promoted the mineralization of soil organic nitrogen 3 3 3 significant differences among bacterial communities to identify significantly different biomarkers affecting nitrogen transformation during groundwater table fluctuation the differential abundance of soil bacteria was characterized based on the lefse analysis fig 7 showed the phylogenetic tree of marker microorganisms from the phylum to genus level in layer b which was conspicuously affected by water table fluctuation a total of 97 bacterial clades showed statistically significant differences in abundance between clades p 0 05 a threshold of 4 0 was chosen for the logarithmic lda scores fig s1 during the rising period arthrobacter sp gal15 sp and bacillus sp were enriched within the bacterial communities it has been established that arthrobacter sp belonging to actinobacteriota is involved in dnra while bacillus sp belonging to firmicutes is one of the typical bacteria involved in denitrification zuo et al 2021 the enrichment of arthrobacter sp and bacillus sp indicated that dnra and denitrification occurred during the groundwater rising period in addition the high contribution of gal15 sp indicated the changes of the soil n effectiveness during the falling period chloroflexi sp acidobacteriota sp and gammaproteobacteria sp belonging to proteobacteria were enriched in the microbial community among them chloroflexi sp participates in the second step of nitrification i e the oxidation of no2 sorokin et al 2012 acidobacteriota sp and gammaproteobacteria sp play a major role in ammonium oxidation abed et al 2015 evidence from bacterial biomarkers suggested that nitrogen transformation in the water table fluctuation zone shifted to nitrification as the water table decrease 3 4 abundance of functional genes during nitrogen transformation the microbial transformation of nitrogen is a cycle of different sub step processes that proceed in an orderly fashion liu et al 2023 nitrate is reduced to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and ammonium in sequence with microbial involvement and the functional genes involved in nitrogen transformation are narg nirs norb and norz respectively mosley et al 2022 therefore the above functional genes can serve as proof of nitrogen transformation progresses kraft et al 2014 as shown in fig 8 the abundance of narg nirs and nosz indicating denitrification were highest during the rising period and declined as the water table decreased this result suggested that denitrification mainly occurred during the rising period and gradually weakened with the rising falling transition which is consistent with common denitrification characteristics qiao et al 2020 the trend of increasing do concentration and decreasing no3 concentration in groundwater also supported this conclusion fig 3 and fig 4 with the lowering of the water table the do concentration in the water table fluctuation zone increased zhang et al 2020 the aoa and aob genes involving in ammonium oxidation liu et al 2015 were most abundant during the falling period while the abundance of denitrification genes decreased significantly the result suggested that the role of nitrification was stronger than that of denitrification in this period consequently the gene evidence revealed that the nitrogen functional genes had a significant response to water table fluctuation and as the water table decreased the main nitrogen transformation that occurred in the water table fluctuation zone shifted from denitrification to nitrification 3 5 mechanism of nitrogen transformations by groundwater table fluctuation the sem analysis demonstrated that groundwater table fluctuation altered not only the do but also the dominant bacterial abundance and functional gene groups in direct and indirect paths resulting in changes in nitrogen transformation fig 9 a and b specifically the direct effect coefficients of the groundwater table with do and dominant microbial abundance were 0 927 and 0 716 fig 9 c revealing that water table fluctuation was the direct factor stimulating changes in the redox environment and microbial community structure which was in agreement with previous studies meng et al 2021 the decline in the groundwater table created favorable aerobic conditions for the growth of nitrifying bacteria such as chloroflexi acidobacteriota and gammaproteobacteria furthermore do and dominant microbial abundance controlled by the groundwater table had direct relationships with nosz and aoa aob which were shown to be major determining factors for ammonium and nitrate transformation petersen et al 2012 zhang and ji 2018 as mentioned above our results showed that the influence of groundwater table fluctuation on nitrogen transformation was mainly through indirect paths fig 9 d and changes in the groundwater table affected the do and dominant bacterial abundance which in turn altered the functional gene groups and the accumulation or reduction of ammonium and nitrate therefore it can be concluded that groundwater table fluctuation is an essential driving force affecting nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater situations in field scenarios are much more complex numerous factors such as soil nitrogen dissolution and leaching owing to precipitation dilution due to surface water recharge and nitrogen transformation caused by groundwater table fluctuation all have an impact on groundwater nitrate concentration yang et al 2023 in this study we confirmed the third hypothesis and broadened the understanding of how and to what extent water table fluctuation affect nitrogen transformation by regulating the do microbial community structure and functional genes it should be noted that water table fluctuation occurs constantly due to the influences of precipitation surface water groundwater interaction and agricultural irrigation as a result the nitrate concentration in groundwater may be continuously variable particularly for some areas with minor nitrate contamination water table fluctuation may alter the groundwater nitrate contamination status which seriously clouds the accurate understanding of groundwater quality therefore in sensitive areas such as centralized or decentralized groundwater drinking water sources multiperiod or long time series of water quality monitoring should be adopted to reasonably evaluate the risks associated with nitrate contamination and to safeguard groundwater supplies 4 conclusions this study shed light on the mutual effects of the do bacterial community structure functional gene groups and associated nitrogen transformation in nitrate contaminated groundwater under groundwater table fluctuation groundwater table rising reduced nitrate concentration while falling aggravated it specifically denitrification and dnra induced by rising reduced the average nitrate concentration from 15 to 8 5 mg l which was below the who guideline value while nitrification induced by falling aggravated groundwater nitrate contamination moreover groundwater table fluctuation enriched soil bacterial abundance and diversity and modified the microbial community structure at the phylum and genus levels biomarkers such as arthrobacter sp bacillus sp chloroflexi sp and acidobacteriota sp involved in nitrogen transformation as well as functional genes of nitrogen transformation were identified as an essential environmental driving force groundwater table fluctuation influenced nitrogen transformation through indirect paths and changes in the groundwater table affected the do and dominant bacterial abundance which in turn altered the functional gene groups and the accumulation or reduction of ammonium and nitrate this study enhances our knowledge of how and to what extent nitrogen transformation is affected by groundwater table fluctuation and long term monitoring is needed to properly assess the risk of
