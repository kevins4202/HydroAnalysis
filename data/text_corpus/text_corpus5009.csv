25045,choices in ecological research and natural resource management require balancing multiple often competing objectives examples include maximizing species persistence in a wildlife conservation context while minimizing cost or balancing opposing stakeholder objectives when managing wildlife populations multiple objective optimization moo provides a unifying framework for solving multiple objective problems model selection is a critical component of ecological inference and prediction and requires balancing the competing objectives of model fit and model complexity the tradeoff between model fit and model complexity provides a basis for describing the model selection problem within the moo framework we discuss moo and two strategies for solving the moo problem modeling preferences pre optimization and post optimization most conventional model selection methods can be formulated as solutions of moo problems via specification of pre optimization preferences we reconcile model selection within the moo framework we also consider model selection using post optimization specification of preferences that is by first identifying pareto optimal solutions and then selecting among them we demonstrate concepts with an ecological application of model selection using avian species richness data in the continental united states keywords competing models decision theory model selection multiple objectives pareto frontier optimal solution 1 introduction the goal of modeling ecological processes varies from identifying the important factors driving a system to robust prediction into the future or across space multiple competing models are considered in most cases each model based on hypotheses of spatial or temporal structure in parameters heterogeneity among individuals within a population or candidates for covariates influencing the process of interest ultimately one model from the candidate models or a composition of candidate models is selected for inference or prediction statistical model selection is one of the most common problems in scientific research and numerous model selection methods are available e g akaike 1973 mallows 1973 schwarz et al 1978 gelfand and ghosh 1998 burnham and anderson 2002 hooten and hobbs 2015 each model selection method represents an approach to balancing the bias due to missing important factors model fit with imprecision due to over fitting the data model complexity each method represents a different a priori weighting of the relative importance of model fit and model complexity while guidelines exist there is no consensus among statisticians on best methods for this model selection process hooten and hobbs 2015 in the field of decision theory multiple objective problems are often addressed using the methods of multi objective optimization moo marler and arora 2004 williams 2016 williams and kendall 2017 moo is common in engineering economics and other fields for which decisions must balance trade offs between 2 competing objectives marler and arora 2004 when a decision maker has competing objectives a solution that is optimal for one objective might not be optimal for the other objective and a single solution that optimizes multiple objectives does not exist with competing objectives there exist possibly infinitely many solutions that might be considered optimal i e pareto optimal williams and kendall 2017 however in most decision contexts a decision maker can only make one choice e g which model to use to predict into the future to choose among solutions a decision maker must include their preferences among objectives to identify a final solution moo provides a mathematical framework for quantifying preferences for examining multi objective problems our objective is to frame and examine the model selection problem through the lens of the moo framework by doing so we can gain new insight into the model selection problem specifically 1 we bridge a gap and reconcile the literature between methodologies from two separate fields of study the decision theoretic field of moo and the statistical field of model selection 2 we reveal that several methods commonly used for model selection are specific cases of the moo problem solved using a priori specification of preferences 3 we examine concepts of the moo framework specifically pareto optimality and show that common model selection methods meet the criteria for pareto optimality and 4 we consider model selection via the moo approach of post specification of a decision maker s preferences we demonstrate the concepts presented using an example from the field of ecology involving variable selection in a generalized linear regression model for avian species richness data 2 materials and methods 2 1 model selection as a moo problem the moo framework is described generally as 1 min θ θ f 1 θ f 2 θ f k θ θ i where f 1 θ f 2 θ f k θ are k different potentially competing objective functions e g eqs 4 and 5 and θ θ 1 θ p are design variables of the objective function e g potential choices an investigator has the objective function f i θ i 1 k maps a choice θ to the real line regarding model selection the design variables are the potential parameters and their specific value of a model the design variables of the objective function must be feasible to the investigator that is make sense logically or mathematically for the problem at hand and can be constrained to the feasible set using inequality and equality constraints generally these constraints are represented as functions g and h of the design variables g j θ c j and h m θ d m where j 1 j are the j inequality constraints that must be less than or equal to some arbitrary constant c j and where m 1 m are the m equality constraints that must be equal to some arbitrary constant d j marler and arora 2004 cohon 2013 the point θ i minimizes the objective functions f 1 θ f 2 θ f k θ pareto optimality is a concept of optimality used for eq 1 when no value of θ simultaneously optimizes all functions f i i 1 k a pareto optimal solution for a minimization problem is a solution θ θ for which there is no other solution θ θ such that both f θ f θ and f i θ f i θ for at least one function i deb 2001 marler and arora 2004 for decision problems with competing objectives there are many potentially infinite pareto optimal solutions the set of solutions that are pareto optimal is known as the pareto set or pareto frontier or efficiency frontier each solution in a pareto set has an implied set of preferences among the objective functions f i deb 2001 williams and hooten 2016 thus choosing among a set of pareto optimal solutions assumes either implicitly or explicitly preferences among the objective functions f i such preferences can be specified pre or post optimization representing two separate strategies to solving eq 1 williams and kendall 2017 when specifying preferences pre optimization decision makers explicitly describe preferences of objective functions and select the pareto optimal solution associated with their choice of preferences when specifying preferences post optimization decision makers first examine the set of pareto optimal solutions then the decision maker chooses the final pareto optimal solution based on the trade offs observed among the set the choice implies decision maker preferences 2 2 model selection using pre optimization selection of weights one of the most common methods for incorporating preferences for f i in eq 1 into a decision problem pre optimization is the weighted sum method athan and papalambros 1996 das and dennis 1997 cohon 2013 williams and kendall 2017 the weighted sum method is described by 2 f θ i 1 k w i f i θ for which the optimal solution is 3 f θ min θ i 1 k w i f i θ the weights w i are chosen by the decision maker to reflect the importance of each objective function f i the weighted sum method is a composition that results in a single objective function over which to optimize when optimizing an objective function under one fixed set of weight values an unequivocal optimal choice can be made model selection methods typically consist of minimizing a weighted sum of two functions often described heuristically as a function for model fit and a function for model complexity e g gelfand and ghosh 1998 burnham and anderson 2002 p 87 this can be described as a specific case of eq 3 where θ represents the optimal solutions from the set of design variables θ i e model parameters describing fit and complexity of any model w i are weights for the importance of the objectives associated with model fit and complexity and f i are functions that quantify the value of model fit and complexity the statistical literature is rich in excellent work developing the theoretical justification for choices of objective functions f i θ and their corresponding weights w i akaike 1973 mallows 1973 schwarz et al 1978 gelfand and ghosh 1998 burnham and anderson 2002 link and barker 2006 hooten and hobbs 2015 although there is no consensus among statisticians on specific model selection methods most of the theoretical development related to model selection can be described by two general functions for f i differences in model selection criteria are often the result of different theoretical motivation for the selection of weights the most common objective function for model fit is the negative log likelihood of the parameters given the data i e the deviance that is if f 1 is the objective function associated with model fit it is described as 4 f 1 θ log l θ y where l θ y represents the likelihood of the parameters θ given the data y although the deviance is a commonly used objective function for model fit others have been used for example in mallows c p f 1 θ i 1 n y i μ ˆ sub 2 i 1 n y i μ ˆ full 2 n where μ ˆ sub equals the estimated mean of a sub model parameter in consideration μ ˆ full equals the estimated mean of the full model parameter in consideration and n equals the sample size mallows 1973 tibshirani 1996 tikhonov et al 2013 and hooten and hobbs 2015 describe several objective functions for model complexity using a function proportional to 5 f 2 θ j 1 p θ j μ j γ known as the regulator regularizer or penalty in eq 5 p represents the number of parameters in the model γ is the degree of the norm a user defined parameter that controls the relative penalty of the distance between θ j and μ j θ j are parameter estimates for centered and scaled covariates and μ j is a location parameter often set to 0 substituting the choices of f 1 θ and f 2 θ from eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3 we obtain the following multi objective optimization problem 6 f θ w 1 f 1 θ w 2 f 2 θ w 1 log l θ y w 2 j 1 p θ j μ j γ with the objective of min θ f θ 2 3 model selection using post optimization selection of weights solving a moo problem with competing objectives using post optimization specification of weights requires first identifying as many pareto optimal solutions as possible then choosing among the pareto optimal solutions williams and kendall 2017 pareto optimal solutions for the objective functions in eqs 4 and 5 are models for which increasing the value of eq 4 requires a decrease in the values in eq 5 and vice versa values for eqs 4 and 5 for any candidate model can be obtained from standard software see appendix for r code to obtain these values to identify pareto optimal solutions consider a 2 dimensional plot of candidate models with values of eq 4 on the y axis and eq 5 on the x axis e g fig 2 after the pareto frontier is identified the decision maker can select the model based on the trade offs observed in the pareto frontier this is analogous to best subset selection an active area of statistical research e g hastie et al 2009 thus the selection of the final model is made without explicitly choosing weights w associated with the model selection criteria listed in table 1 however if a choice from the pareto frontier is also optimal with respect to specific model selection criterion the weights of that selection criterion are implied 2 4 example avian species richness in the u s model selection is commonly used for selecting variables to include in linear and generalized linear regression models we examine the variable selection problem within a moo framework by considering avian species richness in the contiguous u s as a function of state level covariates these data were originally used to demonstrate model selection techniques in hooten et al 2019 we seek to model the number of avian species y i counted in each of the contiguous states in the u s and washington d c i e i 1 n where sample size n 49 based on covariate information x i collected in each state covariates include the area of the state the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation response data and covariates are shown in fig 1 we modeled count data using a poisson distribution y i poisson λ i where λ i represents the mean species richness in each state we linked mean species richness to the covariate data using the log link function log λ i x i β we considered a total of 24 different models for x i β representing different linear and quadratic combinations of the covariates the 24 candidate models are provided in table 2 we fit each model using the glm function in r statistical software r core team 2013 see appendix to conduct model selection for the avian species richness data we used the objective function in eq 6 with values of w 2 and γ 0 i e aic that is for a poisson likelihood the weighted objective function was 7 f β m 2 i 1 n λ i m y i log λ i m log y i 2 j 1 p m β j m 0 where β m is the subset of parameters for model m 1 24 n is the sample size and the term log y i can be omitted because it does not affect the optimization of β m provided the likelihood is not changed 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre optimization selection of weights and relationship among model selection methods eq 6 is the general function used in many model selection methods including akaike s information criterion aic aic for small samples aic c quasi aic qaic qaic for small samples qaic c schwartz s information criterion bic ridge regression lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator natural bayesian shrinkage and some forms of posterior predictive loss table 1 gelfand and ghosh 1998 hooten and hobbs 2015 each of the listed model selection methods result from specific choices of w and γ which we report in table 1 for example let the weights be w 1 2 w 2 2 and set γ to zero with these weights eq 6 simplifies to 2log l θ y 2p or aic table 1 additionally expressing model selection methods in terms of eq 3 has an important result that links model selection to pareto optimality for positive weights w any solution to eq 3 is a pareto optimal solution marler and arora 2010 thus any model selection method that can be expressed in terms of eq 6 i e the methods in table 1 results in a solution that is pareto optimal with respect to the objectives of maximizing model fit and minimizing model complexity the explicit application of multi objective optimization to model selection using the objective functions defined in eqs 4 and 5 ties several important properties of moo to common methods used in ecological research to select a model first many different model selection methods are special cases of the weighted sum method each method representing different objective weights this provides a unifying framework to quantitatively and visually compare model selection methods based on different theoretical foundations practitioners of multi objective optimization in operations research or other decision theoretic fields usually recommend evaluating sensitivity of the resulting decisions given the choice of objective weights keeney and raiffa 1976 williams and kendall 2017 a sensitivity analysis for the model selection problem consists of evaluating multiple model selection criteria representing different objective weights to examine the robustness of the solution to the choice of criterion many practitioners argue against this approach suggesting that a criterion should be selected based on its theoretical motivation e g aic is asymptotically efficient bic is consistent aho et al 2014 others view a specific information criterion as one line of evidence to assist in a decision and report different criteria side by side e g araújo and luoto 2007 parviainen et al 2008 preferences vary by field the former tends to be the dominant paradigm in ecological research whereas the latter is common in other fields second many model selection methods result in pareto optimal solutions because they are specific formulations of eq 2 which is sufficient for pareto optimality thus there is a decision theoretic basis for model selection methods that can be expressed in the form of eq 6 in terms of optimality criteria although we described the model selection problem heuristically in terms of maximizing model fit and minimizing model complexity we could have replaced model fit with predictive ability as the objective of interest predictive ability is the most commonly sought model characteristic for model selection and many information criteria and other model selection methods were developed to optimize predictive ability akaike 1973 stone 1977 gelfand and ghosh 1998 hoeting et al 1999 burnham and anderson 2002 hooten and hobbs 2015 many information criteria have weights and penalties that serve as bias corrections for optimization in terms of predictive ability konishi and kitagawa 1996 that is many information criteria are based on bias corrected log likelihoods for which the model complexity is a correction factor to remove asymptotic bias of the log likelihood of a fitted model konishi and kitagawa 1996 the moo problem in terms of maximizing predictive ability and accounting for model bias is similar in spirit to the moo problem of maximizing model fit while minimizing model complexity 3 1 1 avian species richness the model from table 2 that minimized eq 7 i e the aic top model included the intercept a linear area effect and a quadratic precipitation and temperature effect all other model fitting results are shown in table 2 a common practice for pre specification of weights in moo problems in other applications includes examining the sensitivity of the optimal choice relative to the selected weights barron and schmidt 1988 insua 1990 an analogous procedure in the model selection framework is to examine the optimal solutions relative to different information criteria because different criteria represent different objective weights table 1 the aic aic c and bic criteria all resulted in the same top model suggesting the optimal solution for these data was robust to several different choices of weights 3 2 post optimization model selection by examining pareto optimal solutions model selection by examining trade offs of fit and complexity post optimization has been used in several other applications users of mallows c p often conduct similar investigations freitas 2004 examined pareto optimality in the related question comparing prediction and simplicity for data mining viewing each model s trade offs in terms of objectives provides a visual assessment of the model selection problem a potentially useful tool for ultimately choosing a model for inference or prediction as is the case with any multi objective optimization problem the additional flexibility in model choice based on post optimization specification of preferences could be viewed as either a positive or negative trait depending on how an investigator values the order for which preferences are specified specifying preferences pre optimization for the model selection problem benefits from being objective in the sense that a decision maker chooses how to weigh their specific objective functions without being influenced by how weights will alter the outcome of optimization specifying preferences post optimization has the added flexibility of choosing a pareto optimal solution that provides the best trade offs for context dependent decision problems 3 2 1 avian species richness we examined model selection via specification of preferences post optimization using avian species richness data fig 2 we identified pareto optimal solutions among the 24 models and then considered potential methods for selecting a model to identify pareto optimal solutions we plotted the values f 1 and f 2 described in eq 7 for each model on opposing axes to identify solutions along the pareto frontier fig 2 identifying pareto optimal solutions does not require specifying w 1 or w 2 and therefore does not require adhering to an information criterion the pareto optimal set included 6 models one model for each number of parameters 1 7 except p 5 where both model fit and complexity could be simultaneously improved by using the top model containing four parameters each pareto solution represented the model that minimized eq 7 among all models with the same number of parameters there were 17 dominated models i e models that were not pareto optimal fig 2 the aic top model was a pareto optimal solution this was expected because aic and other information criteria is a specific formulation of the weighted sum method and is therefore sufficient for pareto optimality i e if it is a specific formulation of the weighted sum method it is pareto optimal marler and arora 2010 each of the pareto solutions correspond to a specific set of weights in eq 6 given the information on pareto optimal solutions in fig 2 selecting a final model for inference can proceed in many ways depending on the application and the nature of the parameters under consideration a decision maker can use the information on pareto optimal solutions to view trade offs of fit gained by adding or subtracting additional parameters from the model and choose a pareto optimal solution with trade offs acceptable to the decision maker some parameters might be associated with covariates for which annual data are difficult expensive or impossible to collect the trade offs in terms of model fit can be assessed relative to the expense of collecting additional data for these parameters if the increase in model fit from the pareto optimal solution that requires the additional expensive covariate data does not justify the additional expense another pareto optimal solution may be preferred another option is to examine the curvature of the pareto frontier for example the pareto frontier in fig 2 makes a curved shape with a point around p 3 at this point increasing the number of parameters has diminishing marginal returns in terms of f 1 and decreasing the number of parameters has a large effect on f 1 in the avian species richness data the largest improvement in model fit per parameter added was adding area to the null model an 86 unit improvement to fit fig 2 subsequent parameter additions showed diminishing marginal returns in model fit the second biggest improvement in model fit was adding precipitation to the area model 23 units followed by adding temperature to the area precipitation model 7 units no models with five parameters occurred on the pareto frontier which model the investigator should choose is context dependent by viewing these trade offs between model fit and complexity the decision maker has an additional tool to help inform context dependent decisions another approach is to compare the trade offs to scientific significance of the parameters involved and the need to make inference on those parameters for example if a parameter is required to inform a management decision such as the effect of management on survival rates for conservation decisions a decision maker would want to choose a model where the effect of decisions on survival or any other parameter is included another approach might be to choose a pareto optimal solution such that the maximum number of parameters is constrained by the amount of data for example if an investigator wishes to constrain the number of parameters in the model such that p n 15 the investigator could select the pareto optimal solution that maximized model fit within the constrained set in the avian species richness data with n 49 this constraint would suggest choosing the pareto optimal model with three parameters with log linear predictor β 0 β 1 x area t β 2 x temp t table 2 models that are optimal in terms of model selection criteria could be highlighted as reference points on the pareto frontier to guide decisions on the final model choice ultimately the use of the pareto frontier is that it provides visual information on the trade offs of the objectives of the decision maker in this case maximizing model fit and minimizing complexity two dimensions are trivial to visualize and techniques exist to visualize the pareto optimal set if the moo problem considered has 2 objective functions lotov and miettinen 2008 in our reasoning as well as our example we assumed that γ 0 although this assumption is not necessary table 1 the value of γ controls the shape of the model complexity function in eq 5 hooten and hobbs suggest that the choice of γ is more a result of personal preference based on desired inference setting γ 2 is analogous to the penalty term used in ridge regression while setting γ 1 is

function in r statistical software r core team 2013 see appendix to conduct model selection for the avian species richness data we used the objective function in eq 6 with values of w 2 and γ 0 i e

weights and relationship among model selection methods eq 6 is the general function used in many model selection methods including akaike s information criterion aic aic for small samples aic c quasi aic qaic qaic for small samples qaic c schwartz s information criterion bic ridge regression lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator natural bayesian shrinkage and some forms of posterior predictive loss table 1 gelfand and ghosh 1998 hooten and hobbs 2015 each of the listed model selection methods result from specific choices of w and γ which we report in table 1 for example let the weights be w 1 2 w 2 2 and set γ to zero with these weights eq 6 simplifies to 2log l θ y 2p or aic table 1 additionally expressing model selection methods in terms of eq 3 has an important result that links model selection to pareto optimality for positive weights w any solution to eq 3 is a pareto optimal solution marler and arora 2010 thus any model selection method that can be expressed in terms of eq 6 i e the methods in table 1 results in a solution that is pareto optimal with respect to the objectives of maximizing model fit and minimizing model complexity the explicit application of multi objective optimization to model selection using the objective functions defined in eqs 4 and 5 ties several important properties of moo to common methods used in ecological research to select a model first many different model selection methods are special cases of the weighted sum method each method representing different objective weights this provides a unifying framework to quantitatively and visually compare model selection methods based on different theoretical foundations practitioners of multi objective optimization in operations research or other decision theoretic fields usually recommend evaluating sensitivity of the resulting decisions given the choice of objective weights keeney and raiffa 1976 williams and kendall 2017 a sensitivity analysis for the model selection problem consists of evaluating multiple model selection criteria representing different objective weights to examine the robustness of the solution to the choice of criterion many practitioners argue against this approach suggesting that a criterion should be selected based on its theoretical motivation e g aic is asymptotically efficient bic is consistent aho et al 2014 others view a specific information criterion as one line of evidence to assist in a decision and report different criteria side by side e g araújo and luoto 2007 parviainen et al 2008 preferences vary by field the former tends to be the dominant paradigm in ecological research whereas the latter is common in other fields second many model selection methods result in pareto optimal solutions because they are specific formulations of eq 2 which is sufficient for pareto optimality thus there is a decision theoretic basis for model selection methods that can be expressed in the form of eq 6 in terms of optimality criteria although we described the model selection problem heuristically in terms of maximizing model fit and minimizing model complexity we could have replaced model fit with predictive ability as the objective of interest predictive ability is the most commonly sought model characteristic for model selection and many information criteria and other model selection methods were developed to optimize predictive ability akaike 1973 stone 1977 gelfand and ghosh 1998 hoeting et al 1999 burnham and anderson 2002 hooten and hobbs 2015 many information criteria have weights and penalties that serve as bias corrections for optimization in terms of predictive ability konishi and kitagawa 1996 that is many information criteria are based on bias corrected log likelihoods for which the model complexity is a correction factor to remove asymptotic bias of the log likelihood of a fitted model konishi and kitagawa 1996 the moo problem in terms of maximizing predictive ability and accounting for model bias is similar in spirit to the moo problem of maximizing model fit while minimizing model complexity 3 1 1 avian species richness the model from table 2 that minimized eq 7 i e the aic top model included the intercept a linear area effect and a quadratic precipitation and temperature effect all other model fitting results are shown in table 2 a common practice for pre specification of weights in moo problems in other applications includes examining the sensitivity of the optimal choice relative to the selected weights barron and schmidt 1988 insua 1990 an analogous procedure in the model selection framework is to examine the optimal solutions relative to different information criteria because different criteria represent different objective weights table 1 the aic aic c and bic criteria all resulted in the same top model suggesting the optimal solution for these data was robust to several different choices of weights 3 2 post optimization model selection by examining pareto optimal solutions model selection by examining trade offs of fit and complexity post optimization has been used in several other applications users of mallows c p often conduct similar investigations freitas 2004 examined pareto optimality in the related question comparing prediction and simplicity for data mining viewing each model s trade offs in terms of objectives provides a visual assessment of the model selection problem a potentially useful tool for ultimately choosing a model for inference or prediction as is the case with any multi objective optimization problem the additional flexibility in model choice based on post optimization specification of preferences could be viewed as either a positive or negative trait depending on how an investigator values the order for which preferences are specified specifying preferences pre optimization for the model selection problem benefits from being objective in the sense that a decision maker chooses how to weigh their specific objective functions without being influenced by how weights will alter the outcome of optimization specifying preferences post optimization has the added flexibility of choosing a pareto optimal solution that provides the best trade offs for context dependent decision problems 3 2 1 avian species richness we examined model selection via specification of preferences post optimization using avian species richness data fig 2 we identified pareto optimal solutions among the 24 models and then considered potential methods for selecting a model to identify pareto optimal solutions we plotted the values f 1 and f 2 described in eq 7 for each model on opposing axes to identify solutions along the pareto frontier fig 2 identifying pareto optimal solutions does not require specifying w 1 or w 2 and therefore does not require adhering to an information criterion the pareto optimal set included 6 models one model for each number of parameters 1 7 except p 5 where both model fit and complexity could be simultaneously improved by using the top model containing four parameters each pareto solution represented the model that minimized eq 7 among all models with the same number of parameters there were 17 dominated models i e models that were not pareto optimal fig 2 the aic top model was a pareto optimal solution this was expected because aic and other information criteria is a specific formulation of the weighted sum method and is therefore sufficient for pareto optimality i e if it is a specific formulation of the weighted sum method it is pareto optimal marler and arora 2010 each of the pareto solutions correspond to a specific set of weights in eq 6 given the information on pareto optimal solutions in fig 2 selecting a final model for inference can proceed in many ways depending on the application and the nature of the parameters under consideration a decision maker can use the information on pareto optimal solutions to view trade offs of fit gained by adding or subtracting additional parameters from the model and choose a pareto optimal solution with trade offs acceptable to the decision maker some parameters might be associated with covariates for which annual data are difficult expensive or impossible to collect the trade offs in terms of model fit can be assessed relative to the expense of collecting additional data for these parameters if the increase in model fit from the pareto optimal solution that requires the additional expensive covariate data does not justify the additional expense another pareto optimal solution may be preferred another option is to examine the curvature of the pareto frontier for example the pareto frontier in fig 2 makes a curved shape with a point around p 3 at this point increasing the number of parameters has diminishing marginal returns in terms of f 1 and decreasing the number of parameters has a large effect on f 1 in the avian species richness data the largest improvement in model fit per parameter added was adding area to the null model an 86 unit improvement to fit fig 2 subsequent parameter additions showed diminishing marginal returns in model fit the second biggest improvement in model fit was adding precipitation to the area model 23 units followed by adding temperature to the area precipitation model 7 units no models with five parameters occurred on the pareto frontier which model the investigator should choose is context dependent by viewing these trade offs between model fit and complexity the decision maker has an additional tool to help inform context dependent decisions another approach is to compare the trade offs to scientific significance of the parameters involved and the need to make inference on those parameters for example if a parameter is required to inform a management decision such as the effect of management on survival rates for conservation decisions a decision maker would want to choose a model where the effect of decisions on survival or any other parameter is included another approach might be to choose a pareto optimal solution such that the maximum number of parameters is constrained by the amount of data for example if an investigator wishes to constrain the number of parameters in the model such that p n 15 the investigator could select the pareto optimal solution that maximized model fit within the constrained set in the avian species richness data with n 49 this constraint would suggest choosing the pareto optimal model with three parameters with log linear predictor β 0 β 1 x area t β 2 x temp t table 2 models that are optimal in terms of model selection criteria could be highlighted as reference points on the pareto frontier to guide decisions on the final model choice ultimately the use of the pareto frontier is that it provides visual information on the trade offs of the objectives of the decision maker in this case maximizing model fit and minimizing complexity two dimensions are trivial to visualize and techniques exist to visualize the pareto optimal set if the moo problem considered has 2 objective functions lotov and miettinen 2008 in our reasoning as well as our example we assumed that γ 0 although this assumption is not necessary table 1 the value of γ controls the shape of the model complexity function in eq 5 hooten and hobbs suggest that the choice of γ is more a result of personal preference based on desired inference setting γ 2 is analogous to the penalty term used in ridge regression while setting γ 1 is analogous to the penalty term used in lasso acknowledgments funding was provided by u s geological survey alaska science center the colorado state university department of fish wildlife and

rules hcrs and alternative management strategies however a comprehensive mse framework advising management is still absent for the severely depleted gulf of maine gom cod gadus morhua in the present study we developed a conceptual mse framework and conditioned on this stock utilizing stock specific parameterization we highlighted the simulation of a few key processes with semi independent sub models and accounted for uncertainties from multiple sources the simulated population dynamics was calibrated and validated against the historical trend in hindcasting forecasting simulations were also conducted and validated to examine the effectiveness in the context of uncertainty hindcasting results suggested that the calibrated mse framework could capture the stock dynamics assuming different recruitment dynamics indicated by residuals lower than 5 forecasting stochastic runs demonstrated a minor disparity between management effects of fishing mortality based and catch based hcrs when the segregated stock recruitment relationship was adopted with a difference in simulated spawning stock biomass lower than 10 additionally the results were comparable to assessment and projections made in the stock assessment indicating the robustness of the framework the framework can potentially help disentangle complex issues related to the mixed fishery decision making and performance evaluation of a monitoring system keywords fishery management management strategy evaluation harvest control rules uncertainty 1 introduction management advices are often developed in the form of harvest control rules hcrs in modern fisheries management kvamsdal et al 2016 specifically they transform available biological information and management objectives into future harvest strategy such as an annual catch limit based on the status of the fishery punt 2010 eikeset et al 2013 previous biological information is normally provided in stock assessment and empirical studies both well represent current knowledge with a fair level of certainty punt 2010 however cooke 1999 suggested any assessment and projection are accompanied with a high degree of uncertainty which could result in management failure when not accounted for these uncertainties can arise from management policy implementation and execution environmental variability and changes in stock dynamics resulting in undesirable catch limit fluctuation or lagged control measures holland 2010 therefore managing towards sustainable fisheries is challenging without understanding the consequences of management strategies in the context of uncertainties as a powerful simulation based approach management strategy evaluation mse is often developed to assess the performance and effectiveness of alternative strategies given specific management targets by accounting for different sources of uncertainties butterworth 2007 punt et al 2016 in brief a self contained mse framework should have the following characteristics for conceptual details please refer to de oliveira et al 2009 holland 2010 and punt et al 2016 1 covering necessary components of science based fisheries management including but not limited to data sampling and observing observation model stock assessment and hcrs determination management procedure and population dynamics and implementation simulation operating model 2 reflecting dynamics of the target fishery with operating models based on the best knowledge 3 connecting these components with a temporal feedback loop 4 identifying and incorporating uncertainties that may realistically reflect process observation and implementation errors management advices are subject to a broad range of uncertainties which were summarized into five major categories from a perspective of numerical simulation including process error observation error model error estimation error and implementation error kell et al 2007 a complete mse framework should be able to parameterize these uncertainties for corresponding components and assess the robustness of candidate strategies iterative simulation is widely used to fully assess the complex influence of uncertainties by looping over randomly generated errors in addition statistical analysis is conducted afterwards to evaluate the management performance regarding the pre defined objectives the most concerned and expected result from mse is the probability of management success or in other words the risk of management failure in achieving the defined management objectives as a flexible and extensive conceptual framework mse can be modified for case and stock specific applications to test for management performance to more variables recent studies have focused on not only implementing mse to support a gear specific fishery but also using it as a tool to describe the changing fisheries even at an ecosystem level szuwalski and punt 2012 dawson et al 2016 carruthers and hordyk 2018 atlantic cod has been the iconic species in the gulf of maine gom economically and ecologically despite comprehensive management efforts the previous fishing resilient stock abundance plummeted in recent years nefsc 2015 the past decades have witnessed a dramatic overall decline in the gom cod spawning stock biomass ssb according to the 2015 stock assessment fig 1 nefsc 2015 apparently the declining trends of ssb and catch were highly synchronized during the period indicating the shrinking stock is posing a threat to the fishery meanwhile the stock also showed different levels of responsive variation to a similar catch since the mid 90 s the unexpected decrease was attributed to synthetic effects of heavy fishing shifts in ecology population dynamics and spatial distribution and erroneous historical stock assessment which overturned our confidence of previous management actions and called for improved understanding of management strategies pershing et al 2013 guan et al 2017 complementary to these zemeckis et al 2014 and kerr et al 2014 also pointed out the existence of demographic connectivity of gom cod stock to the neighboring cod stocks their findings supported the theory that gom cod was a sub population of the metapopulation making the identification and estimation of the spawning population even more challenging this meant the local recruitment dynamics might be influenced by spawning stock biomass outside the assessed stock because of emigration with the conceptual mse framework well defined a variety of mse frameworks have been developed and implemented with cod gadus morhua globally ranging from the more general simulation frameworks baudron et al 2010 carruthers et al 2018 to more case specific simulation models a mar et al 2009 bastardie et al 2009 2010 these frameworks especially the latter of which were remarkably competent in investigating the effectiveness of management plans under environmental and anthropological uncertainties by extracting dynamics with historical observations unfortunately despite their advantage targeting certain issues few of these models were able to summarize and refine the uncertainty presented by historical document retrospectively a typical case was made by the gom cod where the uncertainties have strongly undermined the reliability of stock assessment and resulted in a collapse that was not earlier forecasted to coping with this a few simulation models were developed to retrospectively describe the stock spatial features and highlight their influence on the mis matched perception of dynamics and interpretation of assessment reich and dealteris 2009 kerr et al 2010 cao et al 2014 these models succeeded in describing and explaining the observed historical developments however they are more analogous to a deterministic operating model while a comprehensive mse framework evaluating hcrs in the context of uncertainty is still not available to advise future management of gom cod in the present study we developed an mse framework conditioned and parameterized for the gom cod based on available information from assessment and diagnostics as a simulation tool to test the performance of current and possible management strategies we also validated the framework particularly the operating model with both hindcast and forecast projection simulation based on the following deterministic and stochastic design 2 methods 2 1 management strategy evaluation framework a novel management strategy evaluation framework was developed following the conceptual overview of punt et al 2016 as in fig 2 the framework primarily consisted of three major sections including operating model observation model and management procedure in our case we enriched the framework with more rational and systematic linkages within and among these sections to formulate a technical roadmap in particular several sub models were installed to increase the flexibility a data limited shortcut was also available for hcrs and survey with unconventional data requirements and purpose the simulation followed a one way closed feedback loop on an annual basis only useful data from the previous stages were extracted for the subsequent stages based on two considerations 1 to release the computational pressure and 2 to emulate the reality where only certain data were observable data integration was realized with the r package flr fisheries library for r version 2 6 9 kell et al 2007 with r version 3 4 4 r core team 2018 2 1 1 operating model operating model was the core part of mse and the essential foundation of the simulation it was dedicated to simulating population dynamics of gom cod and its direct or indirect response to anthropological or environmental disturbance in this case we used an explicit catch limit as the input for operating model and a monitoring stage as acquiring the output as in reality the catch limit was given in the form of total allowable catch tac from the precedent section making our simulated fishery a tac based management system to implement such a system with our mse we firstly developed a sub model describing fleet dynamics under the operating model to allocate the tac in our case we considered a single fleet with age specific selectivity that completely excluded bycatch and discards indicating the fleet intended to fish exactly the catch regulated by tac an age structured population model was established in the operating model all information was stored as age specific parameters including abundance size maturity and mortality this model was appropriate to mimic the growth of groundfish including cod because of three advantages 1 match the long live life history of groundfish 2 consistent with sophisticated stock assessment methods 3 convenient to model recruitment process and variations among cohorts punt 2011 the age span was set to range from age 1 to maximum age where the latter of which could be determined from either empirical treatment or aging biological sample the oldest age group was set as plus group where fish beyond that age was parameterized as fish of maximum age in terms of life history traits however their changes in abundance were still treated as an older age group although the abundance was normally extremely low due to mortality the abundance variation in age structure was forwarded and updated at the end of each simulated year also could be seen as the start of the next year with the following equations 1 n a y 1 α s s b exp β s s b e x p ε a 1 2 n a y 1 n a 1 y exp z a 1 y a 2 3 a g e m a x 1 3 n a y 1 n a 1 y e x p z a 1 y n a y e x p z a y a a g e m a x where age max indicates the maximum age na y indicates the number of age a fish of year y the meanings of other parameters were described in appendix table 1 obviously three forward patterns were presented for different age groups the age 1 abundance which was regarded as the age 1 recruitment was generated by the stock recruitment relationships srr based on the assumption that the recruitment of the following year was dependent on the precedent year spawning stock biomass sbb here we used the ricker stock recruitment relationships srr appendix table 1 as an example because it had been proved reliable for cod stocks in the region fogarty et al 2001 an error term ε was added to the recruitment relationship to represent the associated uncertainty see appendix for details the abundance of other age groups was generated from the abundance of the younger age group of the precedent year using equations 2 and 3 where za y is the total mortality for age group a of the year y the total mortality was acquired by summing up natural mortality and fishing mortality as following 4 z a y m a y f f u l l y c a t c h s e l a y c a t c h s e l a y 0 1 where ma y is the age and year specific natural mortality catch sela y is the year specific selectivity for each age group determined by the fleet sub model f fully is the year specific fishing mortality at full selectivity because we considered only one fleet the catch for each year was simply obtained by accumulating catch from all age groups 5 c y a 1 a g e m a x n a y f a y 1 exp z a y z a y with a monitoring process attached at the end the necessary information was passed on to the subsequent observation model and management procedure 2 1 2 observation model as in real fisheries monitoring and survey only two types of data are observable and extractable for the observation model including catch at age data and abundance indices these data were also the necessary inputs for a formal stock assessment the observed catch value was unnecessarily identical to the determined tac for the year because tac was given based on the information perceived from assessment and assumption which was inevitably subject to the bias of various sources abundance indices acquired from surveys on the other hand are likely to better represent stock abundance therefore we included a survey sub model to generate age specific abundance index for multiple surveys that could occur at different times of a year with different survey designs the survey data were generated with the catch per unit effort based on the survey time of the year and the survey specific catchability at age complementary to the abundance survey sub model can also provide life history information such as size and maturity at age when the simulation was conducted with hindcasting these well observed data were ultimately compiled and exported to the management procedure in order to make mse able to operate in a data limited situation we additionally reserved unconventional connection that directed the limited information to the next links with a short cut through which the data are compiled into different forms as requested in the corresponding management strategies 2 1 3 management procedure the first step in management procedure was performing the stock assessment using the compiled data the extended survivors analysis xsa was adopted in our framework which was essentially a modified virtual population analysis capable of accommodating multi sets of survey indices and avoid negative estimations shepherd 1999 additionally xsa has also been widely used in groundfish stock assessment ices 2013 2017 subsequently management objectives were quantitatively determined considering the stock status and management plan which were normally given in the form of biological reference points during the stock assessment process derived harvest control rules hcrs were then developed to translate the scientific conclusions into viable and controllable simple indicators the presented framework allowed hcrs to operate with either catch limits given as acceptable biological catch abc or fishing mortality given as fishing mortality at full selectivity f full as the indicator depending on the management requirements the indicators were given in explicit values identified from the precedent steps and imported to the decision making sub model for the determination of a final total allowable catch tac to be distributed among fishing fleets with this sub model the scientific advice was adjusted by incorporating other socio economic considerations that were following different principles from fisheries science the complexity of the decision making sub model could range from putting a simple reducing buffer to the scientific suggestions as a precautionary approach to integrating rather complicated socio economic models 2 1 4 stochasticity understanding the influence of uncertainty was of vital importance when evaluating the effeteness of fisheries management with mse therefore we additionally considered uncertainties from multiple sources and modeled them with stochasticity in the mse framework these included the recruitment process observation process and survey sub model see appendix for details the modeling of these stochastic process was achieved in the form identical to recruitment as shown in equation 1 where an error term was added to unbiased simulated data the parameterization of the stochastic recruitment processes was supposed to vary case by case the values of the error for observation and survey process were extracted from corresponding log normal distributions see appendix table 1 for details 2 2 case study of gulf of maine cod 2 2 1 background the gulf of maine cod is a severely depleted stock in an urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation of alternative management strategies fig 1 palmer 2014 it has been well documented for both time series fishery dependent and fishery independent survey data covering the period of 1982 to 2014 the survey data were provided by the northeast fisheries science center spring and fall bottom trawl surveys and massachusetts department of marine fisheries madmf spring bottom trawl survey the analytical assessment was updated annually after 2012 when the benchmark stock assessment was done to formulate reference points and stock projections leading to recommended catch limit the most recent stock assessment was updated in 2017 based on the 2013 benchmark assessment nefsc 2013 2017 the reference point f40 was adopted and extremely low catch limit was suggested over the recent years because of the poor stock status perceived in the stock assessment nefsc 2017 despite these exploitation on the stock was not strictly regulated until 2015 in this study we used the historical survey and catch at age data of gom cod from 1982 to 2015 to parameterize the mse model 2 2 2 parameterization the age structured population dynamics model was developed with 9 age groups age 9 as a plus group the age specific life history information such as size at age and maturity at age were acquired from the recent stock assessment reports nefsc 2013 2015 2017 the benchmark report nefsc 2013 suggested the gom stock inclined to the ricker srr as demonstrated with equation 1 the error term incorporated into the recruitment was parameterized with the residuals of the historical fitting by randomly sampling from the discrete uniform distribution of residuals due to the time range of historical data more than 30 years and the changes in environmental conditions the residuals varied greatly and exhibited obvious temporal patterns appendix fig 1 therefore we adopted two srr systems hoping to achieve a better description of the recruitment dynamics a general srr system was fitted using the complete time series data from 1982 to 2014 as in the previous study kerr et al 2014 we also divided the historical data into three periods assuming there were major shifts in recruitment dynamics and then fitted the three stages segregated srr using data of each period separately the temporal division was determined following the stock assessment assumption used by nefsc 2015 such division greatly reduced the range of residuals in comparison to the general srr appendix fig 1 by analyzing their fitting residual diagnostics appendix fig 1 we noticed a huge negative bias against ssb when it ranged from 7500 t to 12 500 t in addition cao et al 2014 kerr et al 2014 and zemeckis et al 2014 suggested that gom cod was a component of metapopulation subject to the strong mixture with neighboring stocks therefore we introduced a one way flux that was activated only at the corresponding ssb level where a certain proportion of the spawners were removed due to the mixing besides mortality the flux dynamics was measured with the flux index its influence and parameterization needed to be figured out with simulation natural mortality m was set constantly for all age groups at 0 2 suggested by the stock assessment nefsc 2015 2 2 3 simulation scenarios a series of simulations were conducted for the established mse framework illustrated in fig 2 the complete simulation designs and their descriptions were presented in table 1 the framework was firstly calibrated for parameterization of the flux index and investigated for its sensitivity the calibrated framework was then implemented for hindcast deterministic simulation and forecast stochastic simulation for validation selected performance metrics were ssb for all scenarios consistently because of its intuitive representation of both stock size and reproductive capacity 2 2 3 1 calibration runs calibration runs were conducted to obtain the optimal value of flux index that could perfectly explain the stock development during the past decades this was regarded as a hindcast simulation since it utilized the historical data from 1982 to 2014 as they were already known the complete stock information in 1982 was made completely available to initialize the mse the stock was fished strictly to the documented total annual catch shown in fig 1 the flux index was calibrated for both general and segregated srr systems applied with deterministic year specific errors sampled from residuals the least square approach was adopted by the calibration procedure using the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm to return the optimal index value that yielded a simulated ssb which approximated the actual ssb the calibration was conducted using the complete 32 years time series data with a yearly time step 2 2 3 2 hindsight deterministic runs the hindcast deterministic runs were conducted using the calibrated mse framework and parameterization the purpose was to highlight the influence of involving different contents of information and to investigate if the more informative framework was valid three scenarios for both srr systems with increasing contents of configuration were designed and compared to the historical trend in terms of ssb table 1 2 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis runs the sensitivity of mse was evaluated regarding the variation in the flux index the simulation configurations were basically hindsight parameterized as in the scenarios above except the stochasticity associated with recruitment was introduced the simulation followed a monte carlo design where the flux index was sampled from a normal distribution with five different standard deviation values ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 the consequent ssb development was compared to the true value in light of different srr systems table 1 the sensitivity analysis runs were simulated with 200 iterations 2 2 3 4 forecast stochastic runs forecast stochastic runs were finally conducted with short term projections of six year as a preliminary application of the framework it was referred to as a foresight simulation because biological and fleet information after 2014 was approximated with the most recent record as in other simulated mse studies hamon et al 2017 li et al 2018 according to the nefsc reports the exploitation of gom cod after 2014 was restrained to the msy level msy proxy despite of minor implementation bias nefsc 2015 2017 we used msy based threshold as the managing target and conducted simulation with corresponding hcrs during the projection specifically both fishing mortality based hcrs and catch based hcrs were applied in parallel and tested for equivalency the values of ffull and tac were acquired from the assessment 2014 2017 and projection 2018 2020 results from nefsc reports due to the inconsistent results from the 2015 and 2017 reports we conducted mse with two sets of initial parameter and stock status data accordingly the projected ssb using both srr systems with stochastic errors were validated against the stock assessment and short term projection from nefsc reports in addition a certain level of observation error was also considered with the observation model to evaluate the potential bias arose from an inaccurate observation process the foresight stochastic runs were simulated with 200 iterations 3 results 3 1 hindcast deterministic runs and calibration results the ssb trajectories of hindcast mse validation with both srr systems are shown in fig 3 an early extinction was observed with the basic deterministic simulation when applying the general srr by incorporating the error the ssb started to increase dramatically after the first ten years and failed to return to the true ssb level the performance was strongly enhanced by incorporating the calibrated flux index which resulted in a highly comparable ssb trajectory to the historical reference most year specific residuals lower than 10 appendix table 2 when assuming the segregated srr the hindcast simulation could better match the final historical reference ssb in this case the simulated ssb did not take off after the first dozen years interestingly the disparity in ssb was ultimately eliminated by a dramatic reduction at the end of the simulation incorporating the flux index in this instance successfully eliminate the disparity before the final years and showed an even closer match than that observed with the general srr system most year specific residuals lower than 5 appendix table 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis runs results of mse sensitivity analysis to the variation in the flux index were also illustrated in light of different variation levels fig 4 the mse with segregated srr generally gene apparently outperformed that with general srr with smaller ssb confidence intervals as observed with the hindsight deterministic mse ssb simulated with segregated srr could always generate a good match at the end of the situation despite of the relatively larger disparity at the mid late stage this was consistent from the lowest tested variation level 0 01 to the highest tested variation level 0 05 indicating the segregated srr system was quite reliable even in with a biased flux index in contrast simulation with general srr was highly vulnerable to even the lowest variation 0 01 and became substantially unreliable at the highest variation level 0 05 3 3 forecast stochastic runs forecast simulation results were demonstrated with the trajectories of ssb catch and ffull fig 5 basically the inconsistent assessment from the 2015 and 2017 reports resulted in discrepant projected stock development fig 5a and b as well as mis forecasting of expected yield fig 5c and d and fishing pressure fig 5e and f the projections using the general srr and the segregated srr could both fairly match the reference level while the former runs tended to create a larger variation in the presence of stochasticity using 2015 assessment update the effectiveness of the f based hcr and the catch based hcr was quite comparable in terms of ssb and catch forecast especially when assuming the segregated srr with the 2017 assessment where the difference was lower than 3 appendix table 11 the sole major discrepancy between the projection and reference was observed with the ffull when catch based hcr was applied fig 5e and f where the projected values could barely reflect the reference level at 95 confidence intervals the observed values overall did not strongly bias from the real stock reference level within the simulated period its influence took the form of an increasing range of uncertain without systematically abating the reliability of the framework 4 discussion we developed a management strategy evaluation framework by modifications of the classic mse conceptual framework punt 2010 and conditioned it for the gom cod in this study the mse can capture the characteristics of the gom cod stock and fishery the framework was established with classic components and parameterized with the historical data of the stock we also specifically set up a variety of configured scenarios targeting the most crucial concerns of our framework the proposed framework could produce results compatible with the historical reference in hindcasting and forecasting simulations following either deterministic or stochastic designs indicating its effectiveness in the realistic reflection of the gom cod fishery dynamics this is critical for the future application of this framework in evaluating alternative management strategies the most challenging task of the framework construction was to apply the conceptual operating model to the case specific level we applied the general population dynamics theory and parameterized the dynamics based on the gom cod fishery data the largest uncertainty associated with modeling of gom cod dynamics was arguably its stock mixture with geographically related stocks cao et al 2014 pointed out such interstock mixing was not causing generic bias in stock assessment however previous mse results concluded that mixing of cod stocks certainly took a toll on the perception of management expectation kerr et al 2010 2014 unfortunately insights into forecasting spatial interaction and distribution dynamics of the cod stocks remained limited due to the modeling complexity guan et al 2017 a recent study by guan et al 2018 provided an innovative approach and attempted to measure the effect of spatial mixing with recruitment variation which greatly boosted our analysis based on srr diagnostics the hindcasting mse results fig 3 demonstrated that the general srr could not rule out the bias from mixing even with year specific errors this issue was solved by using three staged segregated srrs which turned out to be effective in simulating the final stock status consistent with the historical data this was in line with the findings of tableau et al 2018 that srr derived with a shorter time span data could better account for dynamic productivity in the changing northwest atlantic environment adjusting the srrs with the flux index greatly enhanced the mse performance regardless of srr systems which was recommended to be considered for spatially complex stocks guan et al 2018 however the values of the stock mixing index and associated bias had to be subtly identified to avoid systematical bias with the general srr as shown by the sensitivity analysis runs fig 4 in this case the segregated srr could better cater to the dramatic changes seen in intrinsic recruitment dynamics during the past decades nevertheless forecasting stochastic runs with two srr systems showed only negligible discrepancy fig 5 this was because both srr systems had no distinction at lower abundance levels the segregated srr system had a much lower maximum recruitment in comparison to the general srr for the last decade see appendix for details this also explains why a dramatic decline of ssb in the final years was observed with the corresponding hindcasting runs fig 3 data processing was of vital importance for management procedure which is essential for numerical analysis to yield information to support management decisions and ultimately translate the decision back into numerical output to achieve management objectives sainsbury et al 2000 we highlighted such capacity of the proposed mse with our management procedure section that was quantitatively explicit as in realistic management the determination of catch limit required very specific and reliable scientific recommendations which was provided via quantitative perception with stock assessment measurable targets and intuitive limits they were achieved sequentially normally either target fishing mortality or acceptable biological catch were used as control quantity our management procedure could accommodate them both with f based hcr and catch based hcr respectively this added extra flexibility and compatibility with less than satisfying data availability for example hcrs would have to take certain control measurement when management targets were simplified to be semi quantitative or even qualitative due to limited data available for a quantitative stock assessment apel et al 2013 to ensure no bias was introduced by different control measures we specifically tested the performance of f based and catch based hcrs and concluded that they were equivalent in terms of projecting for stock development while the equivalence could be affected by srrs or stochasticity fig 5 some key components of the framework were modeled with the form of sub model these included decision making process fleet dynamics and survey design each of them was entitled to unique dynamics that could vary case by case modeling these complexes with semi independent sub models could greatly extend the scoping of application of the framework without major structural revision which would greatly release following researches from modification efforts in our case these sub models were established separately to highlight their utilization the decision making sub model was designed to integrate various crucial considerations other than science recommendation such as stakeholder opinions socio economic effect and ecological benefit comparing to directly adjusting the scientific advice the integration was superior in two ways firstly the preceding quantitative analysis remained intact and scientifically unbiased secondly different sources of biases could be more explicitly accounted for with the current fleet sub model configuration the catch was contributed by only one fleet perfectly targeting cod however considering the scale of recreational fishing and bycatch it was still necessary to further distinguish the commercial catch from these when future research question would require zhang and chen 2015 lee et al 2017 using a fleet sub model could reflect the catch allocation among fleets once an explicit dynamic was summarized and potentially assisted management evaluation of mixed fishery in addition to the three major surveys involved in our current framework the cod bycatch in the lobster fishery was sampled since 2006 as valuable supplementary survey and developed for abundance indices zhang and chen 2015 this highlighted the necessity of running the survey sub model where different surveys could be better organized and provided information simultaneously regardless of fluctuation in catch observation also the survey sub model could adapt to a certain demand for data limited hcrs our semi independent sub model design was not seen in the other integrated mse models for example the fleet behavior was directly integrated with the combined influence of economic expectations and management objective with the fleet based mse developed by bastardie et al 2010 similarly the climate change mse model introduced by a mar et al 2009 also connected the survey and recruitment dynamics without any intermediate links in comparison breaking these processes into sub models would inevitably diminish the flexible connection of dynamics within the framework rendering our framework less functional when targeting certain research questions however such division would make the mse easier to maintain and compensated the complex in structure with less loss of the logical intactness when incorporating new dynamics using our mse functions of a mar et al 2009 and bastardie et al 2010 could be equally achieved with more complicated modeling design within each sub model and more specific data compilation procedure active connections between these sub models sometimes operating model would be involved as well as their timely response could be insured with a shorter simulation time step used in some explicit simulation model li et al submitted the framework can be potentially implemented to support further simulation based research of gom cod to understand the effectiveness of future management plans in light of uncertainty from various sources shifts of stock intrinsic dynamics changes of abiotic environment and robustness of survey are among the most concerned issues a case specific modification should be made to address specific research questions and management and the framework in general should be used strictly following the validated configuration the proposed conceptual framework can also be applied to other fish stocks such utilization however requires considerable efforts in completely reconditioning and reconstructing population dynamics and sub models sources of uncertainty can vary by case which must be realized with sophisticated quantitative approaches for simulation purpose acknowledgements the authors would like to thank mr mike palmer for providing data and background materials on the gulf of

rules hcrs and alternative management strategies however a comprehensive mse framework advising management is still absent for the severely depleted gulf of maine gom cod gadus morhua in the present study we developed a conceptual mse framework and conditioned on this stock utilizing stock specific parameterization we highlighted the simulation of a few key processes with semi independent sub models and accounted for uncertainties from multiple sources the simulated population dynamics was calibrated and validated against the historical trend in hindcasting forecasting simulations were also conducted and validated to examine the effectiveness in the context of uncertainty hindcasting results suggested that the calibrated mse framework could capture the stock dynamics assuming different recruitment dynamics indicated by residuals lower than 5 forecasting stochastic runs demonstrated a minor disparity between management effects of fishing mortality based and catch based hcrs when the segregated stock recruitment relationship was adopted with a difference in simulated spawning stock biomass lower than 10 additionally the results were comparable to assessment and projections made in the stock assessment indicating the robustness of the framework the framework can potentially help disentangle complex issues related to the mixed fishery decision making and performance evaluation of a monitoring system keywords fishery management management strategy evaluation harvest control rules uncertainty 1 introduction management advices are often developed in the form of harvest control rules hcrs in modern fisheries management kvamsdal et al 2016 specifically they transform available biological information and management objectives into future harvest strategy such as an annual catch limit based on the status of the fishery punt 2010 eikeset et al 2013 previous biological information is normally provided in stock assessment and empirical studies both well represent current knowledge with a fair level of certainty punt 2010 however cooke 1999 suggested any assessment and projection are accompanied with a high degree of uncertainty which could result in management failure when not accounted for these uncertainties can arise from management policy implementation and execution environmental variability and changes in stock dynamics resulting in undesirable catch limit fluctuation or lagged control measures holland 2010 therefore managing towards sustainable fisheries is challenging without understanding the consequences of management strategies in the context of uncertainties as a powerful simulation based approach management strategy evaluation mse is often developed to assess the performance and effectiveness of alternative strategies given specific management targets by accounting for different sources of uncertainties butterworth 2007 punt et al 2016 in brief a self contained mse framework should have the following characteristics for conceptual details please refer to de oliveira et al 2009 holland 2010 and punt et al 2016 1 covering necessary components of science based fisheries management including but not limited to data sampling and observing observation model stock assessment and hcrs determination management procedure and population dynamics and implementation simulation operating model 2 reflecting dynamics of the target fishery with operating models based on the best knowledge 3 connecting these components with a temporal feedback loop 4 identifying and incorporating uncertainties that may realistically reflect process observation and implementation errors management advices are subject to a broad range of uncertainties which were summarized into five major categories from a perspective of numerical simulation including process error observation error model error estimation error and implementation error kell et al 2007 a complete mse framework should be able to parameterize these uncertainties for corresponding components and assess the robustness of candidate strategies iterative simulation is widely used to fully assess the complex influence of uncertainties by looping over randomly generated errors in addition statistical analysis is conducted afterwards to evaluate the management performance regarding the pre defined objectives the most concerned and expected result from mse is the probability of management success or in other words the risk of management failure in achieving the defined management objectives as a flexible and extensive conceptual framework mse can be modified for case and stock specific applications to test for management performance to more variables recent studies have focused on not only implementing mse to support a gear specific fishery but also using it as a tool to describe the changing fisheries even at an ecosystem level szuwalski and punt 2012 dawson et al 2016 carruthers and hordyk 2018 atlantic cod has been the iconic species in the gulf of maine gom economically and ecologically despite comprehensive management efforts the previous fishing resilient stock abundance plummeted in recent years nefsc 2015 the past decades have witnessed a dramatic overall decline in the gom cod spawning stock biomass ssb according to the 2015 stock assessment fig 1 nefsc 2015 apparently the declining trends of ssb and catch were highly synchronized during the period indicating the shrinking stock is posing a threat to the fishery meanwhile the stock also showed different levels of responsive variation to a similar catch since the mid 90 s the unexpected decrease was attributed to synthetic effects of heavy fishing shifts in ecology population dynamics and spatial distribution and erroneous historical stock assessment which overturned our confidence of previous management actions and called for improved understanding of management strategies pershing et al 2013 guan et al 2017 complementary to these zemeckis et al 2014 and kerr et al 2014 also pointed out the existence of demographic connectivity of gom cod stock to the neighboring cod stocks their findings supported the theory that gom cod was a sub population of the metapopulation making the identification and estimation of the spawning population even more challenging this meant the local recruitment dynamics might be influenced by spawning stock biomass outside the assessed stock because of emigration with the conceptual mse framework well defined a variety of mse frameworks have been developed and implemented with cod gadus morhua globally ranging from the more general simulation frameworks baudron et al 2010 carruthers et al 2018 to more case specific simulation models a mar et al 2009 bastardie et al 2009 2010 these frameworks especially the latter of which were remarkably competent in investigating the effectiveness of management plans under environmental and anthropological uncertainties by extracting dynamics with historical observations unfortunately despite their advantage targeting certain issues few of these models were able to summarize and refine the uncertainty presented by historical document retrospectively a typical case was made by the gom cod where the uncertainties have strongly undermined the reliability of stock assessment and resulted in a collapse that was not earlier forecasted to coping with this a few simulation models were developed to retrospectively describe the stock spatial features and highlight their influence on the mis matched perception of dynamics and interpretation of assessment reich and dealteris 2009 kerr et al 2010 cao et al 2014 these models succeeded in describing and explaining the observed historical developments however they are more analogous to a deterministic operating model while a comprehensive mse framework evaluating hcrs in the context of uncertainty is still not available to advise future management of gom cod in the present study we developed an mse framework conditioned and parameterized for the gom cod based on available information from assessment and diagnostics as a simulation tool to test the performance of current and possible management strategies we also validated the framework particularly the operating model with both hindcast and forecast projection simulation based on the following deterministic and stochastic design 2 methods 2 1 management strategy evaluation framework a novel management strategy evaluation framework was developed following the conceptual overview of punt et al 2016 as in fig 2 the framework primarily consisted of three major sections including operating model observation model and management procedure in our case we enriched the framework with more rational and systematic linkages within and among these sections to formulate a technical roadmap in particular several sub models were installed to increase the flexibility a data limited shortcut was also available for hcrs and survey with unconventional data requirements and purpose the simulation followed a one way closed feedback loop on an annual basis only useful data from the previous stages were extracted for the subsequent stages based on two considerations 1 to release the computational pressure and 2 to emulate the reality where only certain data were observable data integration was realized with the r package flr fisheries library for r version 2 6 9 kell et al 2007 with r version 3 4 4 r core team 2018 2 1 1 operating model operating model was the core part of mse and the essential foundation of the simulation it was dedicated to simulating population dynamics of gom cod and its direct or indirect response to anthropological or environmental disturbance in this case we used an explicit catch limit as the input for operating model and a monitoring stage as acquiring the output as in reality the catch limit was given in the form of total allowable catch tac from the precedent section making our simulated fishery a tac based management system to implement such a system with our mse we firstly developed a sub model describing fleet dynamics under the operating model to allocate the tac in our case we considered a single fleet with age specific selectivity that completely excluded bycatch and discards indicating the fleet intended to fish exactly the catch regulated by tac an age structured population model was established in the operating model all information was stored as age specific parameters including abundance size maturity and mortality this model was appropriate to mimic the growth of groundfish including cod because of three advantages 1 match the long live life history of groundfish 2 consistent with sophisticated stock assessment methods 3 convenient to model recruitment process and variations among cohorts punt 2011 the age span was set to range from age 1 to maximum age where the latter of which could be determined from either empirical treatment or aging biological sample the oldest age group was set as plus group where fish beyond that age was parameterized as fish of maximum age in terms of life history traits however their changes in abundance were still treated as an older age group although the abundance was normally extremely low due to mortality the abundance variation in age structure was forwarded and updated at the end of each simulated year also could be seen as the start of the next year with the following equations 1 n a y 1 α s s b exp β s s b e x p ε a 1 2 n a y 1 n a 1 y exp z a 1 y a 2 3 a g e m a x 1 3 n a y 1 n a 1 y e x p z a 1 y n a y e x p z a y a a g e m a x where age max indicates the maximum age na y indicates the number of age a fish of year y the meanings of other parameters were described in appendix table 1 obviously three forward patterns were presented for different age groups the age 1 abundance which was regarded as the age 1 recruitment was generated by the stock recruitment relationships srr based on the assumption that the recruitment of the following year was dependent on the precedent year spawning stock biomass sbb here we used the ricker stock recruitment relationships srr appendix table 1 as an example because it had been proved reliable for cod stocks in the region fogarty et al 2001 an error term ε was added to the recruitment relationship to represent the associated uncertainty see appendix for details the abundance of other age groups was generated from the abundance of the younger age group of the precedent year using equations 2 and 3 where za y is the total mortality for age group a of the year y the total mortality was acquired by summing up natural mortality and fishing mortality as following 4 z a y m a y f f u l l y c a t c h s e l a y c a t c h s e l a y 0 1 where ma y is the age and year specific natural mortality catch sela y is the year specific selectivity for each age group determined by the fleet sub model f fully is the year specific fishing mortality at full selectivity because we considered only one fleet the catch for each year was simply obtained by accumulating catch from all age groups 5 c y a 1 a g e m a x n a y f a y 1 exp z a y z a y with a monitoring process attached at the end the necessary information was passed on to the subsequent observation model and management procedure 2 1 2 observation model as in real fisheries monitoring and survey only two types of data are observable and extractable for the observation model including catch at age data and abundance indices these data were also the necessary inputs for a formal stock assessment the observed catch value was unnecessarily identical to the determined tac for the year because tac was given based on the information perceived from assessment and assumption which was inevitably subject to the bias of various sources abundance indices acquired from surveys on the other hand are likely to better represent stock abundance therefore we included a survey sub model to generate age specific abundance index for multiple surveys that could occur at different times of a year with different survey designs the survey data were generated with the catch per unit effort based on the survey time of the year and the survey specific catchability at age complementary to the abundance survey sub model can also provide life history information such as size and maturity at age when the simulation was conducted with hindcasting these well observed data were ultimately compiled and exported to the management procedure in order to make mse able to operate in a data limited situation we additionally reserved unconventional connection that directed the limited information to the next links with a short cut through which the data are compiled into different forms as requested in the corresponding management strategies 2 1 3 management procedure the first step in management procedure was performing the stock assessment using the compiled data the extended survivors analysis xsa was adopted in our framework which was essentially a modified virtual population analysis capable of accommodating multi sets of survey indices and avoid negative estimations shepherd 1999 additionally xsa has also been widely used in groundfish stock assessment ices 2013 2017 subsequently management objectives were quantitatively determined considering the stock status and management plan which were normally given in the form of biological reference points during the stock assessment process derived harvest control rules hcrs were then developed to translate the scientific conclusions into viable and controllable simple indicators the presented framework allowed hcrs to operate with either catch limits given as acceptable biological catch abc or fishing mortality given as fishing mortality at full selectivity f full as the indicator depending on the management requirements the indicators were given in explicit values identified from the precedent steps and imported to the decision making sub model for the determination of a final total allowable catch tac to be distributed among fishing fleets with this sub model the scientific advice was adjusted by incorporating other socio economic considerations that were following different principles from fisheries science the complexity of the decision making sub model could range from putting a simple reducing buffer to the scientific suggestions as a precautionary approach to integrating rather complicated socio economic models 2 1 4 stochasticity understanding the influence of uncertainty was of vital importance when evaluating the effeteness of fisheries management with mse therefore we additionally considered uncertainties from multiple sources and modeled them with stochasticity in the mse framework these included the recruitment process observation process and survey sub model see appendix for details the modeling of these stochastic process was achieved in the form identical to recruitment as shown in equation 1 where an error term was added to unbiased simulated data the parameterization of the stochastic recruitment processes was supposed to vary case by case the values of the error for observation and survey process were extracted from corresponding log normal distributions see appendix table 1 for details 2 2 case study of gulf of maine cod 2 2 1 background the gulf of maine cod is a severely depleted stock in an urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation of alternative management strategies fig 1 palmer 2014 it has been well documented for both time series fishery dependent and fishery independent survey data covering the period of 1982 to 2014 the survey data were provided by the northeast fisheries science center spring and fall bottom trawl surveys and massachusetts department of marine fisheries madmf spring bottom trawl survey the analytical assessment was updated annually after 2012 when the benchmark stock assessment was done to formulate reference points and stock projections leading to recommended catch limit the most recent stock assessment was updated in 2017 based on the 2013 benchmark assessment nefsc 2013 2017 the reference point f40 was adopted and extremely low catch limit was suggested over the recent years because of the poor stock status perceived in the stock assessment nefsc 2017 despite these exploitation on the stock was not strictly regulated until 2015 in this study we used the historical survey and catch at age data of gom cod from 1982 to 2015 to parameterize the mse model 2 2 2 parameterization the age structured population dynamics model was developed with 9 age groups age 9 as a plus group the age specific life history information such as size at age and maturity at age were acquired from the recent stock assessment reports nefsc 2013 2015 2017 the benchmark report nefsc 2013 suggested the gom stock inclined to the ricker srr as demonstrated with equation 1 the error term incorporated into the recruitment was parameterized with the residuals of the historical fitting by randomly sampling from the discrete uniform distribution of residuals due to the time range of historical data more than 30 years and the changes in environmental conditions the residuals varied greatly and exhibited obvious temporal patterns appendix fig 1 therefore we adopted two srr systems hoping to achieve a better description of the recruitment dynamics a general srr system was fitted using the complete time series data from 1982 to 2014 as in the previous study kerr et al 2014 we also divided the historical data into three periods assuming there were major shifts in recruitment dynamics and then fitted the three stages segregated srr using data of each period separately the temporal division was determined following the stock assessment assumption used by nefsc 2015 such division greatly reduced the range of residuals in comparison to the general srr appendix fig 1 by analyzing their fitting residual diagnostics appendix fig 1 we noticed a huge negative bias against ssb when it ranged from 7500 t to 12 500 t in addition cao et al 2014 kerr et al 2014 and zemeckis et al 2014 suggested that gom cod was a component of metapopulation subject to the strong mixture with neighboring stocks therefore we introduced a one way flux that was activated only at the corresponding ssb level where a certain proportion of the spawners were removed due to the mixing besides mortality the flux dynamics was measured with the flux index its influence and parameterization needed to be figured out with simulation natural mortality m was set constantly for all age groups at 0 2 suggested by the stock assessment nefsc 2015 2 2 3 simulation scenarios a series of simulations were conducted for the established mse framework illustrated in fig 2 the complete simulation designs and their descriptions were presented in table 1 the framework was firstly calibrated for parameterization of the flux index and investigated for its sensitivity the calibrated framework was then implemented for hindcast deterministic simulation and forecast stochastic simulation for validation selected performance metrics were ssb for all scenarios consistently because of its intuitive representation of both stock size and reproductive capacity 2 2 3 1 calibration runs calibration runs were conducted to obtain the optimal value of flux index that could perfectly explain the stock development during the past decades this was regarded as a hindcast simulation since it utilized the historical data from 1982 to 2014 as they were already known the complete stock information in 1982 was made completely available to initialize the mse the stock was fished strictly to the documented total annual catch shown in fig 1 the flux index was calibrated for both general and segregated srr systems applied with deterministic year specific errors sampled from residuals the least square approach was adopted by the calibration procedure using the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm to return the optimal index value that yielded a simulated ssb which approximated the actual ssb the calibration was conducted using the complete 32 years time series data with a yearly time step 2 2 3 2 hindsight deterministic runs the hindcast deterministic runs were conducted using the calibrated mse framework and parameterization the purpose was to highlight the influence of involving different contents of information and to investigate if the more informative framework was valid three scenarios for both srr systems with increasing contents of configuration were designed and compared to the historical trend in terms of ssb table 1 2 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis runs the sensitivity of mse was evaluated regarding the variation in the flux index the simulation configurations were basically hindsight parameterized as in the scenarios above except the stochasticity associated with recruitment was introduced the simulation followed a monte carlo design where the flux index was sampled from a normal distribution with five different standard deviation values ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 the consequent ssb development was compared to the true value in light of different srr systems table 1 the sensitivity analysis runs were simulated with 200 iterations 2 2 3 4 forecast stochastic runs forecast stochastic runs were finally conducted with short term projections of six year as a preliminary application of the framework it was referred to as a foresight simulation because biological and fleet information after 2014 was approximated with the most recent record as in other simulated mse studies hamon et al 2017 li et al 2018 according to the nefsc reports the exploitation of gom cod after 2014 was restrained to the msy level msy proxy despite of minor implementation bias nefsc 2015 2017 we used msy based threshold as the managing target and conducted simulation with corresponding hcrs during the projection specifically both fishing mortality based hcrs and catch based hcrs were applied in parallel and tested for equivalency the values of ffull and tac were acquired from the assessment 2014 2017 and projection 2018 2020 results from nefsc reports due to the inconsistent results from the 2015 and 2017 reports we conducted mse with two sets of initial parameter and stock status data accordingly the projected ssb using both srr systems with stochastic errors were validated against the stock assessment and short term projection from nefsc reports in addition a certain level of observation error was also considered with the observation model to evaluate the potential bias arose from an inaccurate observation process the foresight stochastic runs were simulated with 200 iterations 3 results 3 1 hindcast deterministic runs and calibration results the ssb trajectories of hindcast mse validation with both srr systems are shown in fig 3 an early extinction was observed with the basic deterministic simulation when applying the general srr by incorporating the error the ssb started to increase dramatically after the first ten years and failed to return to the true ssb level the performance was strongly enhanced by incorporating the calibrated flux index which resulted in a highly comparable ssb trajectory to the historical reference most year specific residuals lower than 10 appendix table 2 when assuming the segregated srr the hindcast simulation could better match the final historical reference ssb in this case the simulated ssb did not take off after the first dozen years interestingly the disparity in ssb was ultimately eliminated by a dramatic reduction at the end of the simulation incorporating the flux index in this instance successfully eliminate the disparity before the final years and showed an even closer match than that observed with the general srr system most year specific residuals lower than 5 appendix table 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis runs results of mse sensitivity analysis to the variation in the flux index were also illustrated in light of different variation levels fig 4 the mse with segregated srr generally gene apparently outperformed that with general srr with smaller ssb confidence intervals as observed with the hindsight deterministic mse ssb simulated with segregated srr could always generate a good match at the end of the situation despite of the relatively larger disparity at the mid late stage this was consistent from the lowest tested variation level 0 01 to the highest tested variation level 0 05 indicating the segregated srr system was quite reliable even in with a biased flux index in contrast simulation with general srr was highly vulnerable to even the lowest variation 0 01 and became substantially unreliable at the highest variation level 0 05 3 3 forecast stochastic runs forecast simulation results were demonstrated with the trajectories of ssb catch and ffull fig 5 basically the inconsistent assessment from the 2015 and 2017 reports resulted in discrepant projected stock development fig 5a and b as well as mis forecasting of expected yield fig 5c and d and fishing pressure fig 5e and f the projections using the general srr and the segregated srr could both fairly match the reference level while the former runs tended to create a larger variation in the presence of stochasticity using 2015 assessment update the effectiveness of the f based hcr and the catch based hcr was quite comparable in terms of ssb and catch forecast especially when assuming the segregated srr with the 2017 assessment where the difference was lower than 3 appendix table 11 the sole major discrepancy between the projection and reference was observed with the ffull when catch based hcr was applied fig 5e and f where the projected values could barely reflect the reference level at 95 confidence intervals the observed values overall did not strongly bias from the real stock reference level within the simulated period its influence took the form of an increasing range of uncertain without systematically abating the reliability of the framework 4 discussion we developed a management strategy evaluation framework by modifications of the classic mse conceptual framework punt 2010 and conditioned it for the gom cod in this study the mse can capture the characteristics of the gom cod stock and fishery the framework was established with classic components and parameterized with the historical data of the stock we also specifically set up a variety of configured scenarios targeting the most crucial concerns of our framework the proposed framework could produce results compatible with the historical reference in hindcasting and forecasting simulations following either deterministic or stochastic designs indicating its effectiveness in the realistic reflection of the gom cod fishery dynamics this is critical for the future application of this framework in evaluating alternative management strategies the most challenging task of the framework construction was to apply the conceptual operating model to the case specific level we applied the general population dynamics theory and parameterized the dynamics based on the gom cod fishery data the largest uncertainty associated with modeling of gom cod dynamics was arguably its stock mixture with geographically related stocks cao et al 2014 pointed out such interstock mixing was not causing generic bias in stock assessment however previous mse results concluded that mixing of cod stocks certainly took a toll on the perception of management expectation kerr et al 2010 2014 unfortunately insights into forecasting spatial interaction and distribution dynamics of the cod stocks remained limited due to the modeling complexity guan et al 2017 a recent study by guan et al 2018 provided an innovative approach and attempted to measure the effect of spatial mixing with recruitment variation which greatly boosted our analysis based on srr diagnostics the hindcasting mse results fig 3 demonstrated that the general srr could not rule out the bias from mixing even with year specific errors this issue was solved by using three staged segregated srrs which turned out to be effective in simulating the final stock status consistent with the historical data this was in line with the findings of tableau et al 2018 that srr derived with a shorter time span data could better account for dynamic productivity in the changing northwest atlantic environment adjusting the srrs with the flux index greatly enhanced the mse performance regardless of srr systems which was recommended to be considered for spatially complex stocks guan et al 2018 however the values of the stock mixing index and associated bias had to be subtly identified to avoid systematical bias with the general srr as shown by the sensitivity analysis runs fig 4 in this case the segregated srr could better cater to the dramatic changes seen in intrinsic recruitment dynamics during the past decades nevertheless forecasting stochastic runs with two srr systems showed only negligible discrepancy fig 5 this was because both srr systems had no distinction at lower abundance levels the segregated srr system had a much lower maximum recruitment in comparison to the general srr for the last decade see appendix for details this also explains why a dramatic decline of ssb in the final years was observed with the corresponding hindcasting runs fig 3 data processing was of vital importance for management procedure which is essential for numerical analysis to yield information to support management decisions and ultimately translate the decision back into numerical output to achieve management objectives sainsbury et al 2000 we highlighted such capacity of the proposed mse with our management procedure section that was quantitatively explicit as in realistic management the determination of catch limit required very specific and reliable scientific recommendations which was provided via quantitative perception with stock assessment measurable targets and intuitive limits they were achieved sequentially normally either target fishing mortality or acceptable biological catch were used as control quantity our management procedure could accommodate them both with f based hcr and catch based hcr respectively this added extra flexibility and compatibility with less than satisfying data availability for example hcrs would have to take certain control measurement when management targets were simplified to be semi quantitative or even qualitative due to limited data available for a quantitative stock assessment apel et al 2013 to ensure no bias was introduced by different control measures we specifically tested the performance of f based and catch based hcrs and concluded that they were equivalent in terms of projecting for stock development while the equivalence could be affected by srrs or stochasticity fig 5 some key components of the framework were modeled with the form of sub model these included decision making process fleet dynamics and survey design each of them was entitled to unique dynamics that could vary case by case modeling these complexes with semi independent sub models could greatly extend the scoping of application of the framework without major structural revision which would greatly release following researches from modification efforts in our case these sub models were established separately to highlight their utilization the decision making sub model was designed to integrate various crucial considerations other than science recommendation such as stakeholder opinions socio economic effect and ecological benefit comparing to directly adjusting the scientific advice the integration was superior in two ways firstly the preceding quantitative analysis remained intact and scientifically unbiased secondly different sources of biases could be more explicitly accounted for with the current fleet sub model configuration the catch was contributed by only one fleet perfectly targeting cod however considering the scale of recreational fishing and bycatch it was still necessary to further distinguish the commercial catch from these when future research question would require zhang and chen 2015 lee et al 2017 using a fleet sub model could reflect the catch allocation among fleets once an explicit dynamic was summarized and potentially assisted management evaluation of mixed fishery in addition to the three major surveys involved in our current framework the cod bycatch in the lobster fishery was sampled since 2006 as valuable supplementary survey and developed for abundance indices zhang and chen 2015 this highlighted the necessity of running the survey sub model where different surveys could be better organized and provided information simultaneously regardless of fluctuation in catch observation also the survey sub model could adapt to a certain demand for data limited hcrs our semi independent sub model design was not seen in the other integrated mse models for example the fleet behavior was directly integrated with the combined influence of economic expectations and management objective with the fleet based mse developed by bastardie et al 2010 similarly the climate change mse model introduced by a mar et al 2009 also connected the survey and recruitment dynamics without any intermediate links in comparison breaking these processes into sub models would inevitably diminish the flexible connection of dynamics within the framework rendering our framework less functional when targeting certain research questions however such division would make the mse easier to maintain and compensated the complex in structure with less loss of the logical intactness when incorporating new dynamics using our mse functions of a mar et al 2009 and bastardie et al 2010 could be equally achieved with more complicated modeling design within each sub model and more specific data compilation procedure active connections between these sub models sometimes operating model would be involved as well as their timely response could be insured with a shorter simulation time step used in some explicit simulation model li et al submitted the framework can be potentially implemented to support further simulation based research of gom cod to understand the effectiveness of future management plans in light of uncertainty from various sources shifts of stock intrinsic dynamics changes of abiotic environment and robustness of survey are among the most concerned issues a case specific modification should be made to address specific research questions and management and the framework in general should be used strictly following the validated configuration the proposed conceptual framework can also be applied to other fish stocks such utilization however requires considerable efforts in completely reconditioning and reconstructing population dynamics and sub models sources of uncertainty can vary by case which must be realized with sophisticated quantitative approaches for simulation purpose acknowledgements the authors would like to thank mr mike palmer for providing data and background materials on the gulf of

25047,in this paper the improved ecological network analysis framework is applied to study the internal metabolic process and external stability of the urban energy metabolism system firstly based on the analysis of ecological network the sectors are selected from the three stages of urban energy production transformation and consumption to build an ecological network model then according to the metabolic process and stability characteristics of urban energy system the network environ analysis and ascendency are integrated and the time dimension is expanded finally the data of beijing from 2007 to 2016 are selected for empirical study the results show that 1 the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products and natural gas has changed significantly the former has decreased from 3448 104 tce to 1283 104 tce and the latter has increased from 560 104 tce to 3699 104 tce 2 the electricity heat and water production and supply sector consumed the most energy 3 the energy transfer pathways between sectors has changed significantly the results of stability analysis show that the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolism system is increasing year by year but there is still space for further improvement this provides an important reference for optimizing the energy utilization structure of beijing in the future and further promoting clean energy initiatives keywords urban energy metabolic system ecological network analysis framework flow analysis stability analysis time dimension analysis beijing 1 introduction nowadays global environmental destruction and climate warming are the focus of the world one of the important reasons for this is the excessive consumption and unsustainable utilization of energy worldwide judging the development status of the energy system and seeking clean use of energy are the focus of governments as the world s second largest economy china has serious problems such as the massive consumptions of resources and energy and the destruction of the ecological environment according to the aunual report on china s energy development 2017 released by the china energy research association the total energy consumption of china in 2016 was 4 40 billion tons of standard coal increased 1 compared with that of 2015 among the total energy consumption the proportion of coal consumption with serious pollution reached 68 1 since 2012 china s energy consumption ranks first in the world refi et al 2012 in addition the rapid economic development has accelerated china s urbanization process gradually expanding the number and scale of chinese cities and the proportion of urban population has increased from 10 64 in 1949 to 57 35 in 2016 as an important material support for the normal operation of the social and economic system energy provides an important driving force for urban development but the status of the city as a main body of energy consumption has become increasingly prominent in china cities consume 84 of the country s commercial energy with the 35 largest cities accommodating 18 of the population and consuming 40 of the energy li et al 2010 according to statistics there were about 67 of energy consumption and 70 of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by activities in urban areas hoornweg et al 2011 lennon 2012 due to the global urbanization process energy demand is expected to be higher in the coming decades grimm et al 2008 madlener and sunak 2011 moreover optimizing the energy structure and building an efficient urban energy system is one of the important tasks of china s 13th five year plan liu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to study the energy problems of cities and provide effective ideas for alleviating urban environmental pressures with the deepening of urban energy system research and the continuous innovation of theoretical methods some researchers su et al 2010 vander veen 2011 jones et al 2015 believe that the researches of energy systems should not analyze the system itself in isolation but should treat it as part of the natural ecosystem explore its operating mechanism and analyze organizational behavior from the perspective of system ecology su et al 2013 from this perspective the city can be seen as a super organism in which the metabolism of various substances especially energy leads to various urban diseases that is the resource shortages and environmental problems faced by cities can be attributed to their increasing metabolic fluxes and metabolic inefficiency zhang et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to identify the inherent mechanism and external overall characteristics of urban systems especially the metabolic processes of energy systems to provide insights that will cure or prevent the urban diseases presently scholars conducted different methods to study the metabolic process of urban energy such as energy analysis liang and zhang 2012 improved input output method liang et al 2010 material flow analysis metabolic ratio and ecological footprint analysis browne et al 2012 energy value analysis method yang et al 2014 life cycle analysis norman et al 2006 and other methods meanwhile in order to determine the key factors influencing the process and mechanism of urban energy metabolism the researchers also conducted various analyses from different perspectives céspedes restrepo and morales pinzón 2018 rosales carreón and worrell 2018 these methods and analyses are powerful tools for analyzing the functions and structures of urban energy metabolic systems but there are drawbacks such as the inability to break the black box in traditional research and the inadequacy to calculate the embodied energy consumption ecological network analysis can help solve the above problems some researchers used beijing as an empirical example to compare the differences between energy flow analysis input output analysis and ecological network analysis in analyzing urban energy metabolism it was pointed out that ecological network analysis can reveal the principles of interaction between metabolic components and the degree of dependence of each sector on energy chen and chen 2015 the ecological network analysis originated from hannot patten et al 1976 applied the input output analysis method that invented by leontief leontief 1965 kohli 1966 to study the flow of substance and energy in ecosystems schramski et al 2011 which is one of the main methods to explore the interaction between ecosystem structure and function currently this method can quantitatively analyze the direction and quantity of ecological flows in ecological networks and the interactions between components thus revealing the integrity and complexity of ecosystem behavior fath 2007 in 1976 patten and finn first published a paper on ecological network flow analysis finn 1976 originally this analytical method was widely used in the study of natural ecosystems gattie et al 2006 borrett et al 2007 dame and christian 2008 jordán et al 2008 baird et al 2009 since bodini and bondavali applied the ecological network analysis method to urban systems for the first time in 2002 the application of this method in urban systems has been expanding bodini and bondavalli 2002 for example urban socio economic systems li et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a hu et al 2016 urban water systems bodini et al 2012 urban energy systems zhang et al 2017b urban carbon metabolic systems xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c zheng et al 2018 and so on at present the application of urban ecological network analysis mainly focuses on its use at multi scale and based on various indicators it has been divided into two branches of network environ analysis and ascendency analysis zhang et al 2017a the network environ analysis is responsible for analyzing the internal structural distribution and functional relationship of the network that is analyzing the inherent characteristics of the system such as integral flow zhang et al 2014a small et al 2014 integral utility zhang et al 2015a and control degree chen and chen 2012 the existing ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolic systems mainly adopted the network environ analysis different scholars have expanded the applications of the network environ analysis in urban energy metabolism from different perspectives and scales including combined this method with regional input output tables to take flow analysis and utility analysis of energy metabolism for single city zhang et al 2010b 2014b multiple cities zhang et al 2010a 2015b and agglomeration zhang et al 2016 conducted comparative studies of 5 sector network model 17 sector network model zhang et al 2011 and 28 sector network model zhang et al 2014a and the comprehensive researches of urban energy and other materials such as carbon zhang et al 2014c and water resources wang and chen 2016 the ascendency analysis is mainly responsible for evaluating the overall external characteristics of the system such as stability lu et al 2014 total system throughput xia et al 2016 and development capacity bodini 2012 overall as compared to the relatively rich and complete network environ analysis the ascendency analysis is currently not rich in research and application in the field of urban energy metabolism the above researches have made outstanding contributions to the ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolism but the limitations are mainly reflected in two aspects first the data the existing research was mostly based on the regional input output tables due to the update of these tables were delayed relatively so the timeliness of the data is not strong second the objects of analysis the sector selection in the ecological network model was mainly limited to the energy consumption stage that is focusing on the downstream end of urban energy metabolism but less on the upstream end in particular the classification of energy products that are actually consumed was not enough to solve those problems hu and other scholars constructed a 9 sector model from the energy production stage to the consumption stage taking beijing as an example to analyze the changes in beijing s energy system structure during 2010 to 2015 hu and mu 2018 however there are still aspect of this research that can to be improved such as the model s insufficient precision and time dimension that is the selected sectors and proven years were not enough therefore this paper drew on its ideas and selected the sectors from the whole process of energy production conversion and consumption to reflect the metabolic process of different energy and the corresponding relationships among urban components in energy activities moreover the 9 sector model was extended to the 25 sector model and the time dimension was extended to decade as mentioned above the precious ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolic systems used network environ analysis method mostly that is most of them only did flow analysis or utility analysis of urban energy metabolism however it is not enough to fully explain the metabolic mechanism and study the urban energy metabolic systems comprehensively if only based on the network environ analysis it is also necessary to evaluate and judge the performance and overall characteristics of the urban energy metabolism from the perspective of time dimension to provide a scientific basis for energy structure adjustment one of the significant means to analyze the overall characteristics of urban energy metabolism is the ascendency analysis method of ecological network analysis this paper combines the network environ analysis and ascendency analysis not only analyze the energy flows but also evaluate the stability of the urban energy metabolic systems that is we synchronously study the changes in the transfer relationships among urban internal sectors and the overall stability of the systems over time it is also necessary to analyze the urban energy metabolism from the time dimension the performance and overall characteristics of the evaluation and judgment to provide a more in depth reference for policy development at present one of the important means to analyze the overall characteristics of urban energy metabolism is based on the ascending analysis method of ecological network analysis this paper combines environmental meta analysis method and ascending analysis method to not only analyze the flow of urban energy metabolism system research the energy flow relationship between its various internal departments changes with time moreover the stability analysis of the system is performed to determine the stability of the overall stability of the urban energy metabolism system over time in this paper we have integrated the flow analysis and stability analysis into one ecological network model of the urban energy metabolic system based on the identified energy production conversion and consumption sectors and empirically analyzed the energy statistics of beijing from 2007 to 2016 by defining the nodes and pathways of the network model of beijing s energy metabolism the energy metabolic process inside the system is described and the external stability of the system is evaluated the contributions of this paper to the research field of urban energy metabolism are 1 considering both the upstream and downstream of urban energy metabolism so that the process of urban energy metabolism is investigated from a holistic perspective 2 differentiating the types of energy products actually consumed which is more practical 3 the combination of the network environ analysis and ascendency in the ecological network analysis makes up for the blank of previous studies and makes an overall study of urban energy metabolism system from the inside to the outside 4 the empirical analysis selects the energy data of beijing for 10 consecutive years to analyze which reflects the dynamic evolution characteristics of beijing s energy metabolism system and can provide feasible reference for the optimization of beijing s energy structure in the future 2 methods and data 2 1 construction of the ecological network model according to the real flow process of energy activities in cities the simplified model of ecological network of urban energy metabolism is constructed as shown in fig 1 fig 1 summarizes the urban energy metabolic system into the conceptual 7 sectors including the production sector the heat sector the electricity sector the primary industry sector the secondary industry sector the tertiary industry sector and the household sector ecological network model according to the metabolic process of urban energy production conversion consumption in this simplified network model i and j are used to represent nodes in the network that exchange energy and the nodes present the sectors within the urban energy metabolic system f i j are the pathways which present the energy flow among sectors as the research object of this paper is open system we define z i as the input flow from the external environment to node i and y i as the output flow from node i to the external environment 2 2 flow analysis of urban energy metabolic network flow analysis focuses on calculating the embodied energy flow among sectors in the network system to analyze how much each sector contributes to the entire network the method mainly involves the calculation of the following equations t i i n j 1 n f i j z i t i o u t j 1 n f j i y i where t i i n is the total energy inflow of sector i t i o u t is the total energy outflow of sector i f i j is the energy flow from sector i to sector j f j i is the energy flow from sector j to sector i z i is the input flow from the external environment to node i and y i is the output flow from node i to the external environment and n is the number of all sectors this paper assume that the ecological network model has reached a steady state thus the total energy inflow and the total energy outflow of sector i are equal t i t i i n t i o u t where t i is the total energy flow of each sector the through flow of the network system is t s t i 1 n t i based on this a direct flow intensity matrix g can be built as follows g g i j f i j t j where g i j represents the input oriented inter component flows from sector i to sector j further from the matrix g the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n can be computed using the following power series n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g m i g 1 where n represents the nondimensional flux of energy between nodes in the network reflects the cumulative effects of the energy within the sectors i is the identity matrix the matrix g reflects the direct relationships or pathways between any of the 7 sectors m represents the maximum number of path length in energy flows and g m represents the energy flows of length m between sectors 2 3 the stability analysis of urban energy metabolic system the flow analysis of the urban energy metabolic network is devoted to studying the energy transfer relationships and identifying the interaction mechanism among different sectors within the system network analyzing the specific metabolic path and operation mechanism of the energy within the system however the overall external characteristics of the urban energy metabolic system cannot be evaluated including the overall stability and development status of the system therefore on the basis of the ecological network model constructed above this paper continues to analyze the overall stability of urban energy metabolic system the stability analysis of system is an important part of the ascendency analysis of the ecological network it is mainly responsible for measuring the ability of the ecological network system to resist external disturbances and changes and evaluating the organizational and structural functions of the system one of the main indicators involved in quantitative analysis is the average mutual information index it can measure the average degree of mutual restriction of substances or energy quantum in the ecosystem network and quantify the development of the system the index is represented by a m i a m i k i 1 n 2 j 0 n f i j t log 2 f i j t t i t j where k represents the path length between two sectors f i j is the energy flow from sector i to sector j t i is the total flow to sector i t j is the total outflow from sector j and t is t s t indicates the total through flow of the system some scholars believe that the more perfect the network of medium exchange such as material energy and information in the ecological network system the lower the a m i index value will be therefore it can be used as a measure index of system stability li et al 2011 it is not difficult to see that the stability of the system network is closely related to its diversity and the diversity refers to the total capacity of the entire system to experience changes hu et al 2016 expressed by h the calculation formula is h j 0 n f i j t log 2 t j t therefore an index can be obtained to more directly evaluate the stability of the ecological network system by the difference between the a m i value and h value which can be expressed as d h r a m i with the continuous development of the ecological network system the value of the a m i indicator will gradually become smaller and the value of the h indicator will gradually become larger thus by judging the trend changes of the two indicators in a certain period of time the stability and development of the system network can be evaluated and provide decision making basis for policy makers 2 4 data preparation in order to illustrate the overall process of urban energy metabolism and considering the timeliness of data this paper imports beijing s energy statistics in 10 years from beijing energy balance sheets of 2007 2016 beijing statistical yearbooks beijing municipal bureau of statistics survey office of the national bureau of statistics in beijing 2007 different from the input output table when energy balance sheets are used to construct energy metabolic flow networks they can identify the upstream of urban energy metabolic processes and specify energy types which can more accurately explain the process of urban energy metabolism its basic form is shown in table 1 the energy production process in the table 1 can be shown in fig 2 that is the output of an energy product needs to input a certain amount of energy raw materials and other energy products therefore there are positive and negative values in the energy production process in which the positive indicates the output of energy products and the negative indicates the input and consumption of energy the precision of industry division in the terminal consumption segment of the table 1 is relatively rough which cannot meet the research needs of this paper on the selection of sector fineness therefore it is necessary to combine table 1 with the table of total energy consumption of different industries and consumption of main energy varieties the basic form of this table is shown in table 2 through the analysis of the tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the heat sector and electricity sector can be regarded as both the energy production sector mainly produce the two secondary energies of thermal power and electric power and the energy consumption sector mainly rely on the consumption of coal and natural gas and other primary energy therefore after the combination of the tables 1 and 2 the n order matrix of sector sector can be obtained it is the original table of energy flow among sectors in the urban energy metabolism system as shown in table 3 in the following empirical analysis all matrix calculations are based on the n order matrix data in the table 3 the application of software tools such as matlab python and echarts will be involved in the calculation of ecological network flow and stability evaluation index 3 results and discussion based on beijing s industrial distribution and energy structure sectors along beijing s energy metabolic processes are recognized and assorted a 25 sector model of beijing s energy metabolic ecological network is illustrated as fig 3 3 1 results of the flow analysis great changes have happened in beijing s industrial and energy structure due to the industrial transfer out of beijing in the last ten years thus 2007 2016 beijing s energy supply and demand are extracted from the yearbook of beijing energy statistics 2007 2016 in this paper to reflect the changes of beijing s energy metabolism as illustrated in fig 4 beijing s total cumulative energy consumption during 2007 2016 ha s experienced changes both in amount and structure an obvious leap occurs at 2007 2008 that the total cumulative energy consumption increased from 6500 104 tce to near 7900 104 tce this is belived associated with the 2008 beijing olympics event when a large amount of modern constructions and projects are launched since then despite the slight fluctuates beijing s total cumulative consumption maintains a relatively steady level around 8000 104 tce during 2008 2012 and 8500 104 tce during 2012 2016 meanwhile a more significant change happens in the structure of cumulative energy consumption that coal is losing the dominant status in beijing s energy system while natural gas is taking its place during the past 10 years the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products have decreased from 3448 104 tce in 2007 to 1283 104 tce in 2016 only 37 21 of previous level compared with that of natural gas has increased from 560 104 tce in 2007 to 3699 104 tce in 2016 about 54 of previous level this replacement of energy in beijing is believed as the results of the decoalization policy implemented in beijing in recent years and an effort towards a much cleaner and more efficient energy system in which a series of rectification measures are adopted including shutting down all coal fired power plants and coal fired thermal power plants in beijing s administrative regions reorganizing the use of scattered coal in household promoting gas fired power generation encouraging the use of clean energy etc it is obvious that all these policies are closely related with the decline in coal consumption and the rise in gas consumption in beijing unlike coal and gas results suggest other sources of energy sustain a relatively stable trend among which crude oil and oil products increased from 1258 104 tce to 1898 104 tce the heat consumption increased from 453 104 tce to 568 104 tce and the electricity consumption increased from 830 104 tce to 1254 104 tce besides the changes that happen in amount and structure changes in beijing s energy metabolic relationships between sectors are also happening this paper takes 3 years as a time interval and select results of 2007 2010 2013 and 2016 to reveal the pattern changes in beijing s energy metabolic system echarts and pathon are used to display the diagrams of energy transferred between sectors in figs 5 8 3 1 1 on the supply side on the energy supply side it is observed that the energy transferred relationships among the energy consumption sectors in beijing have changed significantly in the past decade the most obvious changes occurred in the outflow from s1 raw coal and coal products and s3 natural gas reflecting the great changes in the primary energy supply structure of energy metabolic system in beijing meanwhile the consumptions of raw coal and coal products in the secondary energy sectors s4 heat and s5 electricity and the terminal energy consumption sectors were declining indicating an decrease of 64 4 in the secondary energy sectors and 73 7 in the terminal energy consumption sectors on the other hand the use of natural gas in these sectors was increasing drastically from a mere consumption in 2007 to 1423 104 tce in 2016 and a 75 4 increase in the terminal energy consumption sectors while fig 4 suggest the results of substitution between coal and natural gas fig 5 8 reveal how these substitutions happen how they work in the past 10 years in beijing it is observed that the main supply path from primary energy to secondary energy has shifted from s1 raw coal and coal products to s4 heat and s5 electricity sector to s3 natural gas to these two sectors in 2007 coal dominated the energy consumption of the heat sector and electricity sector while natural gas accounted for a very small proportion while in 2016 the main energy flow into the heat and electricity sector had switched to natural gas accounting for 78 with coal dropping to 22 besides the changes in primary energy conversion same circumstances also happen in other supply pathways where primary energy flow to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water changing from raw coal and coal products to natural gas proportion of energy flow from raw coal and coal products to s8 manufacturing sector displaying significant drop 3 1 2 on the demand side on the demand side results suggest that the main consumers concentrate in s8 manufacturing s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water s25 the household sector s12 transportation warehousing and postal services s16 real estate and s13 accommodation and catering industry the most obvious change is in the s8 manufacturing industry the energy consumption of this sector has been declining year by year in the past 10 years and the cumulative energy consumption of this sector has decreased from 1985 104 tce in 2010 to 674 104 tce in 2016 this means that it has decreased by nearly two thirds in the past 10 years which is consistent with the effect of the industrial adjustment policy to reduce manufacturing enterprises of beijing in recent years since 2010 the energy consumption of the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water in beijing s terminal energy consumption sector has been the highest fluctuating up and down in the range of 1500 104 tce to 1900 104 tce per year this indicates that the secondary energy sectors heat and electricity has consumed a large amount of energy while providing sources to other terminal energy consumption sectors moreover from the figs 5 8 it can be seen that this sector mainly consumed coal secondly consumed natural gas which should be the key object of energy conservation and consumption reduction the growth trend of cumulative energy consumption of s25 the household sector and s12 transportation warehousing and postal services are obvious among them the cumulative total energy consumption of s25 the household sector increased from 844 104 tce in 2007 to 1332 104 tce in 2016 an increase of 1 58 times and the consumption of s12 transportation warehousing and postal services increased 1 77 times from 784 104 tce in 2007 to 1385 104 tce in 2016 it is closely related to the increase of population and the expansion of urban scale in beijing therefore they also should be taken as the targets to promote clean energy initiatives 3 1 3 on the energy flow pathways from the perspective of the changes of the annual largest energy flow path in beijing it can be found that the largest flow path in 2007 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s8 manufacturing sector s1 s8 in 2010 and 2013 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s1 s9 and in 2016 is the s3 natural gas sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s3 s9 it shows that the outflow and inflow ends of beijing s largest energy flow path have changed in the past 10 years the outflow end has been changed from s1 raw coal and coal products sector to s3 natural gas sector and the inflow end has been changed from s8 manufacturing sector to s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector in addition we also focus on the changes in the second largest energy flow path among sectors it can be seen from figs 5 8 that the second largest flow path only in 2007 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s1 s9 in the remaining three years 2010 2013 and 2016 are all the s2 crude oil and oil products sector flowing to the s12 transportation warehousing and postal services sector s2 s12 it shows that beijing s transportation warehousing and postal services has always been one of the major energy consuming sectors and is the main consumer of crude oil and oil products the main supply pathways from secondary energy to terminal consumption sectors were originally from the two sectors of heat and electricity to s8 manufacturing sector and later became from the two sectors heat and electricity to s25 the household sector the total consumption of s2 crude oil and oil products has been steadily rising but the change was not significant and mainly flows to s12 transportation warehousing and postal services and s25 the household sector 3 2 results of the stability analysis according to equations 5 to 7 ami h and d values of beijing s energy metabolic network during the decade from 2007 to 2016 were calculated respectively as shown in table 4 according to the data obtained in table 4 the trend charts of indicators changing with time were drawn as shown in figs 9 11 fig 9 11 show the changing trend of the average mutual information ami diversity index h and stability index d of the energy metabolic system in beijing from 2007 to 2016 on the whole ami showed an overall decrease h increased in fluctuation and d increased in general indicating that the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolic system is increasing and its ability to resist external changes was also enhanced year by year it should be noted that the three trend charts all fluctuate slightly around 2014 because in 2014 there was implementation of an energy infrastructure change program in beijing thus this work evaluates such impacts in all sectors the results show that the clean energy actions taken by beijing in recent years have achieved remarkable results however due to the emergence of the turning point the actions should be further strengthened and improved 3 3 discussion the recent decoalification and relieving non capital functions policies that implemented in beijing have aroused worries about the decline and instability of beijing s energy metabolic system the compel move out activities of industries substitution of energy are believed might bring negative impacts to existing economy energy and social systems at least in the short term however results suggest that these changes have actually optimized the current condition of beijing s energy metabolic system changes in supply and demand sides suggest a more simplified and efficient energy structure in beijing accompanied with an industrial structure historical data indicates that during the transition despite the industries related with decoalification and relieving non capital functions energy consumption in other sectors were barely affected this is believed closely associated with the related policies that enables the smooth transition of substitution between coal and natural gas as beijing is developing towards a more modernized metropolis a modernized energy metabolic system is essential during this process this indicates a highly functional system with higher efficiency less emissions and more stable structure the flow analysis indicates that the pattern changes in beijing s energy metabolic system is now evolving towards a much cleaner and functional structure which is closely associated with the coordinated development of beijing and jing jin ji agglomeration meanwhile the decrease in reliability on manufacture in beijing also indicate the ongoing upgrade in both industrial and energy structure a more simplified and optimized energy and industrial structure that focusing on core capital functions is under construction the stability analysis reveal that the structural changes in beijing s energy metabolic system improves the system s stability rather than triggering instability or decline in the urban area from an overall perspective beijing has one of the world s most complex industry network that the move out activities of any industries may result the unexpected decline in the system s stability however based on the results the system s stability is actually improving indicating that beijing has established a structure with lower reliability on traditional manufactures during the last decades this is believed closely related with development strategy of jing jin ji coordinated development it is also worth noting that the system s stability usually increases because of two reason a more closely linked network and a much simpler and shorter metabolic pathway in combination with hu and mu 2018 s research this increase is probably resulted by the latter reason that beijing s industrial structure upgrade causes beijing s energy metabolic pathway shorten and simplified this is understandable because the upgraded structure featuring culture scientific and technical innovation is basically knowledge oriented which means less resource or product reliability of course a more accurate understanding requires further and deeper expirations which is not discussed in this paper 4 conclusions in this paper we constructed a model based on ecological network analysis to study the internal operation mechanism and identify the change trend of overall stability of urban energy metabolic system from time dimension according to the energy production transformation and consumption sectors firstly we abstracted the nodes and pathways of urban energy metabolic system and built a conceptual framework of urban energy system based on ecosystem in order to calculate the embodied energy flows in the system and the cumulative energy flows of each type of energy we used the flow analysis method of network environ analysis in the ecological network analysis then we selected three indicators ami h and d in ascendency analysis to quantitatively evaluate the overall stability of urban energy metabolic system finally taking beijing as an example we selected the energy statistics from 2007 to 2016 for empirical analysis the results revealed that 1 the energy structure of beijing has changed greatly in the past decade among which the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products has decreased apparently year by year while the cumulative consumption of natural gas has increased gradually with obvious fluctuation 2 the energy consumption of the manufacturing sector decreased significantly due to the changes in the industrial structure of beijing however the sector of production and supply of electricity heat gas and water has always consumed the most energy since 2010 within the period of study and should be focused on 3 the energy output paths of raw coal and coal products sector and natural gas sector changes significantly in decade 4 the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolic system and its ability to resist external changes are increasing year by year the above conclusions on the one hand can test the effects of the energy policies adopted by beijing from 2007 to 2016 and on the other hand can provide an important reference for optimizing the energy structure in beijing we can see from the results that the clean energy policies adopted by beijing in recent years such as decoalization coal to gas coal to electricity and the move of high energy consuming enterprises out of beijing have achieved good results but on the other hand it also reflects the space for further optimization of beijing s energy structure in the future because one of the important reasons for such changes in the 10 years is to adjust the industrial structure which is to deal with the upstream of the energy metabolism process including moving a large number of energy intensive industries out of beijing deconstructing the functions of beijing emphasizing the capital s functional positioning and so on however the utilization of clean energy still needs more attention which is an important means to optimize the urban energy structure promote the healthier development of urban energy system and improve its stability the outstanding contributions of this research are 1 in order to make up for the deficiencies of previous studies which only considered the terminal consumption sector we selected the sectors from the three stages of energy production transformation and consumption it means that the upstream and downstream of the urban energy metabolism process are investigated at the same time by using the improved combined energy balance sheet 2 this work combines the network environ analysis and ascendency analysis in the ecological network analysis method for having a comprehensive understanding of the internal operation mechanism and overall system characteristics of urban energy system 3 in view of the dynamic evolution of urban energy metabolic system we chose 10 consecutive years for study based on the calculation results this research concludes that the energy utilization structure flow paths and main energy consumption sectors in urban energy metabolic system will change greatly with time and the overall stability is also changing which shows the dynamic evolution of urban energy metabolic system and verifies the feasibility of this study restricted by the completeness and accuracy of available data the analysis results of this paper still have deepening space in addition the expansion of research samples the improvement of analytical tools and the enrichment of other relevant influencing factors can further improve the accuracy of this study but the basic analysis conclusions obtained in this paper can satisfy the research purpose provide reference for relevant decision making and provide space for further improvement and deepening of the research results in this study the main shortcomings are 1 the selection of energy production sectors does not involve new clean energy such as biomass wind and solar 2 this paper only considers the one way flow process of each kind of energy and does not consider the flow of recycling energy future research can be further improved 3 when evaluating the overall stability of the urban energy metabolism system the overall evaluation of the energy system can be divided into the stability evaluation of the primary industry the secondary industry and the tertiary industry respectively which will be more practical and can be used as the direction for further research by other scholars acknowledgement this paper

25047,in this paper the improved ecological network analysis framework is applied to study the internal metabolic process and external stability of the urban energy metabolism system firstly based on the analysis of ecological network the sectors are selected from the three stages of urban energy production transformation and consumption to build an ecological network model then according to the metabolic process and stability characteristics of urban energy system the network environ analysis and ascendency are integrated and the time dimension is expanded finally the data of beijing from 2007 to 2016 are selected for empirical study the results show that 1 the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products and natural gas has changed significantly the former has decreased from 3448 104 tce to 1283 104 tce and the latter has increased from 560 104 tce to 3699 104 tce 2 the electricity heat and water production and supply sector consumed the most energy 3 the energy transfer pathways between sectors has changed significantly the results of stability analysis show that the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolism system is increasing year by year but there is still space for further improvement this provides an important reference for optimizing the energy utilization structure of beijing in the future and further promoting clean energy initiatives keywords urban energy metabolic system ecological network analysis framework flow analysis stability analysis time dimension analysis beijing 1 introduction nowadays global environmental destruction and climate warming are the focus of the world one of the important reasons for this is the excessive consumption and unsustainable utilization of energy worldwide judging the development status of the energy system and seeking clean use of energy are the focus of governments as the world s second largest economy china has serious problems such as the massive consumptions of resources and energy and the destruction of the ecological environment according to the aunual report on china s energy development 2017 released by the china energy research association the total energy consumption of china in 2016 was 4 40 billion tons of standard coal increased 1 compared with that of 2015 among the total energy consumption the proportion of coal consumption with serious pollution reached 68 1 since 2012 china s energy consumption ranks first in the world refi et al 2012 in addition the rapid economic development has accelerated china s urbanization process gradually expanding the number and scale of chinese cities and the proportion of urban population has increased from 10 64 in 1949 to 57 35 in 2016 as an important material support for the normal operation of the social and economic system energy provides an important driving force for urban development but the status of the city as a main body of energy consumption has become increasingly prominent in china cities consume 84 of the country s commercial energy with the 35 largest cities accommodating 18 of the population and consuming 40 of the energy li et al 2010 according to statistics there were about 67 of energy consumption and 70 of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by activities in urban areas hoornweg et al 2011 lennon 2012 due to the global urbanization process energy demand is expected to be higher in the coming decades grimm et al 2008 madlener and sunak 2011 moreover optimizing the energy structure and building an efficient urban energy system is one of the important tasks of china s 13th five year plan liu et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to study the energy problems of cities and provide effective ideas for alleviating urban environmental pressures with the deepening of urban energy system research and the continuous innovation of theoretical methods some researchers su et al 2010 vander veen 2011 jones et al 2015 believe that the researches of energy systems should not analyze the system itself in isolation but should treat it as part of the natural ecosystem explore its operating mechanism and analyze organizational behavior from the perspective of system ecology su et al 2013 from this perspective the city can be seen as a super organism in which the metabolism of various substances especially energy leads to various urban diseases that is the resource shortages and environmental problems faced by cities can be attributed to their increasing metabolic fluxes and metabolic inefficiency zhang et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to identify the inherent mechanism and external overall characteristics of urban systems especially the metabolic processes of energy systems to provide insights that will cure or prevent the urban diseases presently scholars conducted different methods to study the metabolic process of urban energy such as energy analysis liang and zhang 2012 improved input output method liang et al 2010 material flow analysis metabolic ratio and ecological footprint analysis browne et al 2012 energy value analysis method yang et al 2014 life cycle analysis norman et al 2006 and other methods meanwhile in order to determine the key factors influencing the process and mechanism of urban energy metabolism the researchers also conducted various analyses from different perspectives céspedes restrepo and morales pinzón 2018 rosales carreón and worrell 2018 these methods and analyses are powerful tools for analyzing the functions and structures of urban energy metabolic systems but there are drawbacks such as the inability to break the black box in traditional research and the inadequacy to calculate the embodied energy consumption ecological network analysis can help solve the above problems some researchers used beijing as an empirical example to compare the differences between energy flow analysis input output analysis and ecological network analysis in analyzing urban energy metabolism it was pointed out that ecological network analysis can reveal the principles of interaction between metabolic components and the degree of dependence of each sector on energy chen and chen 2015 the ecological network analysis originated from hannot patten et al 1976 applied the input output analysis method that invented by leontief leontief 1965 kohli 1966 to study the flow of substance and energy in ecosystems schramski et al 2011 which is one of the main methods to explore the interaction between ecosystem structure and function currently this method can quantitatively analyze the direction and quantity of ecological flows in ecological networks and the interactions between components thus revealing the integrity and complexity of ecosystem behavior fath 2007 in 1976 patten and finn first published a paper on ecological network flow analysis finn 1976 originally this analytical method was widely used in the study of natural ecosystems gattie et al 2006 borrett et al 2007 dame and christian 2008 jordán et al 2008 baird et al 2009 since bodini and bondavali applied the ecological network analysis method to urban systems for the first time in 2002 the application of this method in urban systems has been expanding bodini and bondavalli 2002 for example urban socio economic systems li et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a hu et al 2016 urban water systems bodini et al 2012 urban energy systems zhang et al 2017b urban carbon metabolic systems xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c zheng et al 2018 and so on at present the application of urban ecological network analysis mainly focuses on its use at multi scale and based on various indicators it has been divided into two branches of network environ analysis and ascendency analysis zhang et al 2017a the network environ analysis is responsible for analyzing the internal structural distribution and functional relationship of the network that is analyzing the inherent characteristics of the system such as integral flow zhang et al 2014a small et al 2014 integral utility zhang et al 2015a and control degree chen and chen 2012 the existing ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolic systems mainly adopted the network environ analysis different scholars have expanded the applications of the network environ analysis in urban energy metabolism from different perspectives and scales including combined this method with regional input output tables to take flow analysis and utility analysis of energy metabolism for single city zhang et al 2010b 2014b multiple cities zhang et al 2010a 2015b and agglomeration zhang et al 2016 conducted comparative studies of 5 sector network model 17 sector network model zhang et al 2011 and 28 sector network model zhang et al 2014a and the comprehensive researches of urban energy and other materials such as carbon zhang et al 2014c and water resources wang and chen 2016 the ascendency analysis is mainly responsible for evaluating the overall external characteristics of the system such as stability lu et al 2014 total system throughput xia et al 2016 and development capacity bodini 2012 overall as compared to the relatively rich and complete network environ analysis the ascendency analysis is currently not rich in research and application in the field of urban energy metabolism the above researches have made outstanding contributions to the ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolism but the limitations are mainly reflected in two aspects first the data the existing research was mostly based on the regional input output tables due to the update of these tables were delayed relatively so the timeliness of the data is not strong second the objects of analysis the sector selection in the ecological network model was mainly limited to the energy consumption stage that is focusing on the downstream end of urban energy metabolism but less on the upstream end in particular the classification of energy products that are actually consumed was not enough to solve those problems hu and other scholars constructed a 9 sector model from the energy production stage to the consumption stage taking beijing as an example to analyze the changes in beijing s energy system structure during 2010 to 2015 hu and mu 2018 however there are still aspect of this research that can to be improved such as the model s insufficient precision and time dimension that is the selected sectors and proven years were not enough therefore this paper drew on its ideas and selected the sectors from the whole process of energy production conversion and consumption to reflect the metabolic process of different energy and the corresponding relationships among urban components in energy activities moreover the 9 sector model was extended to the 25 sector model and the time dimension was extended to decade as mentioned above the precious ecological network analysis of urban energy metabolic systems used network environ analysis method mostly that is most of them only did flow analysis or utility analysis of urban energy metabolism however it is not enough to fully explain the metabolic mechanism and study the urban energy metabolic systems comprehensively if only based on the network environ analysis it is also necessary to evaluate and judge the performance and overall characteristics of the urban energy metabolism from the perspective of time dimension to provide a scientific basis for energy structure adjustment one of the significant means to analyze the overall characteristics of urban energy metabolism is the ascendency analysis method of ecological network analysis this paper combines the network environ analysis and ascendency analysis not only analyze the energy flows but also evaluate the stability of the urban energy metabolic systems that is we synchronously study the changes in the transfer relationships among urban internal sectors and the overall stability of the systems over time it is also necessary to analyze the urban energy metabolism from the time dimension the performance and overall characteristics of the evaluation and judgment to provide a more in depth reference for policy development at present one of the important means to analyze the overall characteristics of urban energy metabolism is based on the ascending analysis method of ecological network analysis this paper combines environmental meta analysis method and ascending analysis method to not only analyze the flow of urban energy metabolism system research the energy flow relationship between its various internal departments changes with time moreover the stability analysis of the system is performed to determine the stability of the overall stability of the urban energy metabolism system over time in this paper we have integrated the flow analysis and stability analysis into one ecological network model of the urban energy metabolic system based on the identified energy production conversion and consumption sectors and empirically analyzed the energy statistics of beijing from 2007 to 2016 by defining the nodes and pathways of the network model of beijing s energy metabolism the energy metabolic process inside the system is described and the external stability of the system is evaluated the contributions of this paper to the research field of urban energy metabolism are 1 considering both the upstream and downstream of urban energy metabolism so that the process of urban energy metabolism is investigated from a holistic perspective 2 differentiating the types of energy products actually consumed which is more practical 3 the combination of the network environ analysis and ascendency in the ecological network analysis makes up for the blank of previous studies and makes an overall study of urban energy metabolism system from the inside to the outside 4 the empirical analysis selects the energy data of beijing for 10 consecutive years to analyze which reflects the dynamic evolution characteristics of beijing s energy metabolism system and can provide feasible reference for the optimization of beijing s energy structure in the future 2 methods and data 2 1 construction of the ecological network model according to the real flow process of energy activities in cities the simplified model of ecological network of urban energy metabolism is constructed as shown in fig 1 fig 1 summarizes the urban energy metabolic system into the conceptual 7 sectors including the production sector the heat sector the electricity sector the primary industry sector the secondary industry sector the tertiary industry sector and the household sector ecological network model according to the metabolic process of urban energy production conversion consumption in this simplified network model i and j are used to represent nodes in the network that exchange energy and the nodes present the sectors within the urban energy metabolic system f i j are the pathways which present the energy flow among sectors as the research object of this paper is open system we define z i as the input flow from the external environment to node i and y i as the output flow from node i to the external environment 2 2 flow analysis of urban energy metabolic network flow analysis focuses on calculating the embodied energy flow among sectors in the network system to analyze how much each sector contributes to the entire network the method mainly involves the calculation of the following equations t i i n j 1 n f i j z i t i o u t j 1 n f j i y i where t i i n is the total energy inflow of sector i t i o u t is the total energy outflow of sector i f i j is the energy flow from sector i to sector j f j i is the energy flow from sector j to sector i z i is the input flow from the external environment to node i and y i is the output flow from node i to the external environment and n is the number of all sectors this paper assume that the ecological network model has reached a steady state thus the total energy inflow and the total energy outflow of sector i are equal t i t i i n t i o u t where t i is the total energy flow of each sector the through flow of the network system is t s t i 1 n t i based on this a direct flow intensity matrix g can be built as follows g g i j f i j t j where g i j represents the input oriented inter component flows from sector i to sector j further from the matrix g the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n can be computed using the following power series n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g m i g 1 where n represents the nondimensional flux of energy between nodes in the network reflects the cumulative effects of the energy within the sectors i is the identity matrix the matrix g reflects the direct relationships or pathways between any of the 7 sectors m represents the maximum number of path length in energy flows and g m represents the energy flows of length m between sectors 2 3 the stability analysis of urban energy metabolic system the flow analysis of the urban energy metabolic network is devoted to studying the energy transfer relationships and identifying the interaction mechanism among different sectors within the system network analyzing the specific metabolic path and operation mechanism of the energy within the system however the overall external characteristics of the urban energy metabolic system cannot be evaluated including the overall stability and development status of the system therefore on the basis of the ecological network model constructed above this paper continues to analyze the overall stability of urban energy metabolic system the stability analysis of system is an important part of the ascendency analysis of the ecological network it is mainly responsible for measuring the ability of the ecological network system to resist external disturbances and changes and evaluating the organizational and structural functions of the system one of the main indicators involved in quantitative analysis is the average mutual information index it can measure the average degree of mutual restriction of substances or energy quantum in the ecosystem network and quantify the development of the system the index is represented by a m i a m i k i 1 n 2 j 0 n f i j t log 2 f i j t t i t j where k represents the path length between two sectors f i j is the energy flow from sector i to sector j t i is the total flow to sector i t j is the total outflow from sector j and t is t s t indicates the total through flow of the system some scholars believe that the more perfect the network of medium exchange such as material energy and information in the ecological network system the lower the a m i index value will be therefore it can be used as a measure index of system stability li et al 2011 it is not difficult to see that the stability of the system network is closely related to its diversity and the diversity refers to the total capacity of the entire system to experience changes hu et al 2016 expressed by h the calculation formula is h j 0 n f i j t log 2 t j t therefore an index can be obtained to more directly evaluate the stability of the ecological network system by the difference between the a m i value and h value which can be expressed as d h r a m i with the continuous development of the ecological network system the value of the a m i indicator will gradually become smaller and the value of the h indicator will gradually become larger thus by judging the trend changes of the two indicators in a certain period of time the stability and development of the system network can be evaluated and provide decision making basis for policy makers 2 4 data preparation in order to illustrate the overall process of urban energy metabolism and considering the timeliness of data this paper imports beijing s energy statistics in 10 years from beijing energy balance sheets of 2007 2016 beijing statistical yearbooks beijing municipal bureau of statistics survey office of the national bureau of statistics in beijing 2007 different from the input output table when energy balance sheets are used to construct energy metabolic flow networks they can identify the upstream of urban energy metabolic processes and specify energy types which can more accurately explain the process of urban energy metabolism its basic form is shown in table 1 the energy production process in the table 1 can be shown in fig 2 that is the output of an energy product needs to input a certain amount of energy raw materials and other energy products therefore there are positive and negative values in the energy production process in which the positive indicates the output of energy products and the negative indicates the input and consumption of energy the precision of industry division in the terminal consumption segment of the table 1 is relatively rough which cannot meet the research needs of this paper on the selection of sector fineness therefore it is necessary to combine table 1 with the table of total energy consumption of different industries and consumption of main energy varieties the basic form of this table is shown in table 2 through the analysis of the tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the heat sector and electricity sector can be regarded as both the energy production sector mainly produce the two secondary energies of thermal power and electric power and the energy consumption sector mainly rely on the consumption of coal and natural gas and other primary energy therefore after the combination of the tables 1 and 2 the n order matrix of sector sector can be obtained it is the original table of energy flow among sectors in the urban energy metabolism system as shown in table 3 in the following empirical analysis all matrix calculations are based on the n order matrix data in the table 3 the application of software tools such as matlab python and echarts will be involved in the calculation of ecological network flow and stability evaluation index 3 results and discussion based on beijing s industrial distribution and energy structure sectors along beijing s energy metabolic processes are recognized and assorted a 25 sector model of beijing s energy metabolic ecological network is illustrated as fig 3 3 1 results of the flow analysis great changes have happened in beijing s industrial and energy structure due to the industrial transfer out of beijing in the last ten years thus 2007 2016 beijing s energy supply and demand are extracted from the yearbook of beijing energy statistics 2007 2016 in this paper to reflect the changes of beijing s energy metabolism as illustrated in fig 4 beijing s total cumulative energy consumption during 2007 2016 ha s experienced changes both in amount and structure an obvious leap occurs at 2007 2008 that the total cumulative energy consumption increased from 6500 104 tce to near 7900 104 tce this is belived associated with the 2008 beijing olympics event when a large amount of modern constructions and projects are launched since then despite the slight fluctuates beijing s total cumulative consumption maintains a relatively steady level around 8000 104 tce during 2008 2012 and 8500 104 tce during 2012 2016 meanwhile a more significant change happens in the structure of cumulative energy consumption that coal is losing the dominant status in beijing s energy system while natural gas is taking its place during the past 10 years the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products have decreased from 3448 104 tce in 2007 to 1283 104 tce in 2016 only 37 21 of previous level compared with that of natural gas has increased from 560 104 tce in 2007 to 3699 104 tce in 2016 about 54 of previous level this replacement of energy in beijing is believed as the results of the decoalization policy implemented in beijing in recent years and an effort towards a much cleaner and more efficient energy system in which a series of rectification measures are adopted including shutting down all coal fired power plants and coal fired thermal power plants in beijing s administrative regions reorganizing the use of scattered coal in household promoting gas fired power generation encouraging the use of clean energy etc it is obvious that all these policies are closely related with the decline in coal consumption and the rise in gas consumption in beijing unlike coal and gas results suggest other sources of energy sustain a relatively stable trend among which crude oil and oil products increased from 1258 104 tce to 1898 104 tce the heat consumption increased from 453 104 tce to 568 104 tce and the electricity consumption increased from 830 104 tce to 1254 104 tce besides the changes that happen in amount and structure changes in beijing s energy metabolic relationships between sectors are also happening this paper takes 3 years as a time interval and select results of 2007 2010 2013 and 2016 to reveal the pattern changes in beijing s energy metabolic system echarts and pathon are used to display the diagrams of energy transferred between sectors in figs 5 8 3 1 1 on the supply side on the energy supply side it is observed that the energy transferred relationships among the energy consumption sectors in beijing have changed significantly in the past decade the most obvious changes occurred in the outflow from s1 raw coal and coal products and s3 natural gas reflecting the great changes in the primary energy supply structure of energy metabolic system in beijing meanwhile the consumptions of raw coal and coal products in the secondary energy sectors s4 heat and s5 electricity and the terminal energy consumption sectors were declining indicating an decrease of 64 4 in the secondary energy sectors and 73 7 in the terminal energy consumption sectors on the other hand the use of natural gas in these sectors was increasing drastically from a mere consumption in 2007 to 1423 104 tce in 2016 and a 75 4 increase in the terminal energy consumption sectors while fig 4 suggest the results of substitution between coal and natural gas fig 5 8 reveal how these substitutions happen how they work in the past 10 years in beijing it is observed that the main supply path from primary energy to secondary energy has shifted from s1 raw coal and coal products to s4 heat and s5 electricity sector to s3 natural gas to these two sectors in 2007 coal dominated the energy consumption of the heat sector and electricity sector while natural gas accounted for a very small proportion while in 2016 the main energy flow into the heat and electricity sector had switched to natural gas accounting for 78 with coal dropping to 22 besides the changes in primary energy conversion same circumstances also happen in other supply pathways where primary energy flow to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water changing from raw coal and coal products to natural gas proportion of energy flow from raw coal and coal products to s8 manufacturing sector displaying significant drop 3 1 2 on the demand side on the demand side results suggest that the main consumers concentrate in s8 manufacturing s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water s25 the household sector s12 transportation warehousing and postal services s16 real estate and s13 accommodation and catering industry the most obvious change is in the s8 manufacturing industry the energy consumption of this sector has been declining year by year in the past 10 years and the cumulative energy consumption of this sector has decreased from 1985 104 tce in 2010 to 674 104 tce in 2016 this means that it has decreased by nearly two thirds in the past 10 years which is consistent with the effect of the industrial adjustment policy to reduce manufacturing enterprises of beijing in recent years since 2010 the energy consumption of the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water in beijing s terminal energy consumption sector has been the highest fluctuating up and down in the range of 1500 104 tce to 1900 104 tce per year this indicates that the secondary energy sectors heat and electricity has consumed a large amount of energy while providing sources to other terminal energy consumption sectors moreover from the figs 5 8 it can be seen that this sector mainly consumed coal secondly consumed natural gas which should be the key object of energy conservation and consumption reduction the growth trend of cumulative energy consumption of s25 the household sector and s12 transportation warehousing and postal services are obvious among them the cumulative total energy consumption of s25 the household sector increased from 844 104 tce in 2007 to 1332 104 tce in 2016 an increase of 1 58 times and the consumption of s12 transportation warehousing and postal services increased 1 77 times from 784 104 tce in 2007 to 1385 104 tce in 2016 it is closely related to the increase of population and the expansion of urban scale in beijing therefore they also should be taken as the targets to promote clean energy initiatives 3 1 3 on the energy flow pathways from the perspective of the changes of the annual largest energy flow path in beijing it can be found that the largest flow path in 2007 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s8 manufacturing sector s1 s8 in 2010 and 2013 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s1 s9 and in 2016 is the s3 natural gas sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s3 s9 it shows that the outflow and inflow ends of beijing s largest energy flow path have changed in the past 10 years the outflow end has been changed from s1 raw coal and coal products sector to s3 natural gas sector and the inflow end has been changed from s8 manufacturing sector to s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector in addition we also focus on the changes in the second largest energy flow path among sectors it can be seen from figs 5 8 that the second largest flow path only in 2007 is the s1 raw coal and coal products sector flowing to the s9 production and supply of electricity heat gas and water sector s1 s9 in the remaining three years 2010 2013 and 2016 are all the s2 crude oil and oil products sector flowing to the s12 transportation warehousing and postal services sector s2 s12 it shows that beijing s transportation warehousing and postal services has always been one of the major energy consuming sectors and is the main consumer of crude oil and oil products the main supply pathways from secondary energy to terminal consumption sectors were originally from the two sectors of heat and electricity to s8 manufacturing sector and later became from the two sectors heat and electricity to s25 the household sector the total consumption of s2 crude oil and oil products has been steadily rising but the change was not significant and mainly flows to s12 transportation warehousing and postal services and s25 the household sector 3 2 results of the stability analysis according to equations 5 to 7 ami h and d values of beijing s energy metabolic network during the decade from 2007 to 2016 were calculated respectively as shown in table 4 according to the data obtained in table 4 the trend charts of indicators changing with time were drawn as shown in figs 9 11 fig 9 11 show the changing trend of the average mutual information ami diversity index h and stability index d of the energy metabolic system in beijing from 2007 to 2016 on the whole ami showed an overall decrease h increased in fluctuation and d increased in general indicating that the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolic system is increasing and its ability to resist external changes was also enhanced year by year it should be noted that the three trend charts all fluctuate slightly around 2014 because in 2014 there was implementation of an energy infrastructure change program in beijing thus this work evaluates such impacts in all sectors the results show that the clean energy actions taken by beijing in recent years have achieved remarkable results however due to the emergence of the turning point the actions should be further strengthened and improved 3 3 discussion the recent decoalification and relieving non capital functions policies that implemented in beijing have aroused worries about the decline and instability of beijing s energy metabolic system the compel move out activities of industries substitution of energy are believed might bring negative impacts to existing economy energy and social systems at least in the short term however results suggest that these changes have actually optimized the current condition of beijing s energy metabolic system changes in supply and demand sides suggest a more simplified and efficient energy structure in beijing accompanied with an industrial structure historical data indicates that during the transition despite the industries related with decoalification and relieving non capital functions energy consumption in other sectors were barely affected this is believed closely associated with the related policies that enables the smooth transition of substitution between coal and natural gas as beijing is developing towards a more modernized metropolis a modernized energy metabolic system is essential during this process this indicates a highly functional system with higher efficiency less emissions and more stable structure the flow analysis indicates that the pattern changes in beijing s energy metabolic system is now evolving towards a much cleaner and functional structure which is closely associated with the coordinated development of beijing and jing jin ji agglomeration meanwhile the decrease in reliability on manufacture in beijing also indicate the ongoing upgrade in both industrial and energy structure a more simplified and optimized energy and industrial structure that focusing on core capital functions is under construction the stability analysis reveal that the structural changes in beijing s energy metabolic system improves the system s stability rather than triggering instability or decline in the urban area from an overall perspective beijing has one of the world s most complex industry network that the move out activities of any industries may result the unexpected decline in the system s stability however based on the results the system s stability is actually improving indicating that beijing has established a structure with lower reliability on traditional manufactures during the last decades this is believed closely related with development strategy of jing jin ji coordinated development it is also worth noting that the system s stability usually increases because of two reason a more closely linked network and a much simpler and shorter metabolic pathway in combination with hu and mu 2018 s research this increase is probably resulted by the latter reason that beijing s industrial structure upgrade causes beijing s energy metabolic pathway shorten and simplified this is understandable because the upgraded structure featuring culture scientific and technical innovation is basically knowledge oriented which means less resource or product reliability of course a more accurate understanding requires further and deeper expirations which is not discussed in this paper 4 conclusions in this paper we constructed a model based on ecological network analysis to study the internal operation mechanism and identify the change trend of overall stability of urban energy metabolic system from time dimension according to the energy production transformation and consumption sectors firstly we abstracted the nodes and pathways of urban energy metabolic system and built a conceptual framework of urban energy system based on ecosystem in order to calculate the embodied energy flows in the system and the cumulative energy flows of each type of energy we used the flow analysis method of network environ analysis in the ecological network analysis then we selected three indicators ami h and d in ascendency analysis to quantitatively evaluate the overall stability of urban energy metabolic system finally taking beijing as an example we selected the energy statistics from 2007 to 2016 for empirical analysis the results revealed that 1 the energy structure of beijing has changed greatly in the past decade among which the cumulative consumption of raw coal and coal products has decreased apparently year by year while the cumulative consumption of natural gas has increased gradually with obvious fluctuation 2 the energy consumption of the manufacturing sector decreased significantly due to the changes in the industrial structure of beijing however the sector of production and supply of electricity heat gas and water has always consumed the most energy since 2010 within the period of study and should be focused on 3 the energy output paths of raw coal and coal products sector and natural gas sector changes significantly in decade 4 the overall stability of beijing s energy metabolic system and its ability to resist external changes are increasing year by year the above conclusions on the one hand can test the effects of the energy policies adopted by beijing from 2007 to 2016 and on the other hand can provide an important reference for optimizing the energy structure in beijing we can see from the results that the clean energy policies adopted by beijing in recent years such as decoalization coal to gas coal to electricity and the move of high energy consuming enterprises out of beijing have achieved good results but on the other hand it also reflects the space for further optimization of beijing s energy structure in the future because one of the important reasons for such changes in the 10 years is to adjust the industrial structure which is to deal with the upstream of the energy metabolism process including moving a large number of energy intensive industries out of beijing deconstructing the functions of beijing emphasizing the capital s functional positioning and so on however the utilization of clean energy still needs more attention which is an important means to optimize the urban energy structure promote the healthier development of urban energy system and improve its stability the outstanding contributions of this research are 1 in order to make up for the deficiencies of previous studies which only considered the terminal consumption sector we selected the sectors from the three stages of energy production transformation and consumption it means that the upstream and downstream of the urban energy metabolism process are investigated at the same time by using the improved combined energy balance sheet 2 this work combines the network environ analysis and ascendency analysis in the ecological network analysis method for having a comprehensive understanding of the internal operation mechanism and overall system characteristics of urban energy system 3 in view of the dynamic evolution of urban energy metabolic system we chose 10 consecutive years for study based on the calculation results this research concludes that the energy utilization structure flow paths and main energy consumption sectors in urban energy metabolic system will change greatly with time and the overall stability is also changing which shows the dynamic evolution of urban energy metabolic system and verifies the feasibility of this study restricted by the completeness and accuracy of available data the analysis results of this paper still have deepening space in addition the expansion of research samples the improvement of analytical tools and the enrichment of other relevant influencing factors can further improve the accuracy of this study but the basic analysis conclusions obtained in this paper can satisfy the research purpose provide reference for relevant decision making and provide space for further improvement and deepening of the research results in this study the main shortcomings are 1 the selection of energy production sectors does not involve new clean energy such as biomass wind and solar 2 this paper only considers the one way flow process of each kind of energy and does not consider the flow of recycling energy future research can be further improved 3 when evaluating the overall stability of the urban energy metabolism system the overall evaluation of the energy system can be divided into the stability evaluation of the primary industry the secondary industry and the tertiary industry respectively which will be more practical and can be used as the direction for further research by other scholars acknowledgement this paper

25048,annually recurring environmental processes such as the cycle of temperature and light drive the phenology of marine plankton populations improved knowledge about the homogeneity and amplitude of the phenological response of phytoplankton to climate change is essential for an assessment of ecological consequences on the marine ecosystem we analyzed phenological variability of 21 phytoplankton species monitored work daily at helgoland roads from 1962 2015 we used a function of weibull type to estimate phenological dates of species specific abundance peaks the combination of derived dates and peak abundances formed the basis for the analyses of long term changes in phenological time slots and associated environmental conditions species specific preferences in combination with seasonally varying environmental trends resulted in a complex pattern of phenological long term response phenological trends showed both constant occurrence and shifts to an earlier or later occurrence co occurring phytoplankton species were shown to exhibit different phenological trends even within identical time slots differences in species specific trends in timing also reflected the seasonally varying shifts in water temperature ranges due to warming in spring and summer the main patterns of common variability in timing were associated with different abiotic and biotic drivers the majority of species showed more narrow time slots related to the occurrence of higher peaks considering the variation of species occurrence in their typical time window provided insight in terms of assigning the effect of environmental drivers on inter annual phenological variation phytoplankton species with similar long term trends in timing days showed different trends in biomass i e the phenological changes resulted from different ecological responses to environmental change the local character of environmental trends at helgoland underpins the limits for comparison of findings between different measuring sites or wider areas such as the north sea the study emphasizes the benefit and necessity of a highly resolved phytoplankton record for a true understanding of long term ecological changes in a highly dynamic marine environment such as the north sea keywords marine phytoplankton phenology weibull fitting peak modeling seasonal variability warming north sea helgoland

et al 2008 winder and sommer 2012 wiltshire et al 2015 the relative importance of the drivers of phytoplankton phenology on the regional scale is likely to be variable winder and cloern 2010 emphasize the role of site characteristics in ecological responses to climate change and also the relative importance of the annul cycle versus other drivers of inter annual variability sarker et al 2018 have demonstrated the sensitivity of role of different drivers on species combinations on the long term occurrence of species the seasonality of the regional climate constrains the seasonality of plankton

phenology of marine planktonic organisms richardson 2008 beaugrand 2009 beaugrand et al 2009 ipcc et al 2014 atkinson et al 2015 consequences of changes in phytoplankton phenology are often discussed in the context of temporal decoupling match mismatch of primary producers and consumers cushing 1990 richardson 2008 atkinson et al 2015 the asynchronous phenological responses between phytoplankton and zooplankton with regard to warming for example can lead to local changes in the plankton composition and feeding relationships wiltshire et al 2010 mackas et al 2012 as outlined in several studies the timing of for example the spring phytoplankton bloom or trophic mismatch is not necessarily closely related to seasonal temperature variation wiltshire et al 2008 poloczanska et al 2013 atkinson et al 2015 several studies had shown changes in the temporal and spatial occurrence of individual zooplankton species edwards et al 2010 mackas et al 2012 zooplankton communities beaugrand 2009

responses e g schlüter et al 2012 wiltshire et al 2015 i e by non uniform timing shifts to changes in environmental conditions the goal of this study was to better assess the inter annual and seasonal variation of timing occurrence for single phytoplankton species on a multi decadal scale for this we used the species and environmental data from the helgoland roads time series which represents one of the most comprehensive data sets available for marine observations see wiltshire et al 2010 we chose a broad spectrum of species representative of intra annual occurrence and reflecting fundamental differences due to for example varying preferences to light and water temperature e g gebühr et al 2009 mieruch et al 2010 scharfe 2013 wiltshire et al 2015 most existing phenological indices e g ji et al 2010 brody et al 2013 have been applied to aggregated variables such as total biomass or the abundances of phytoplankton groups such as diatoms and dinoflagellates edwards and richardson 2004 wiltshire et al 2008 however for a broader understanding on marine phenology it is important to know more about the species specific reactions and whether these behave in the same manner as total populations when related to a summed population of organisms the temporal structure in the occurrence of individual species will be significantly more heterogeneous reflecting this variability we focused on a peak based model approach instead of a cumulative population abundance approach or compared to approaches with fixed exceedance values e g ji et al 2010 we used a weibull type fitting approach described by rolinski et al 2007 for modeling of abundance peaks of single phytoplankton species in order to describe the temporal course of phenological variation we applied loess smoothing cleveland and delvin 1988 cleveland et al 1988 to scatterplots of species specific intra annual abundance distributions we proceeded as follows first we analyzed the species specific differentiation of occurrence windows including their different seasonal modes second we focused on the identification of environmental parameters which are relevant to variation or constancy of species phenology third we determined the variability in species specific phenological timing against the backdrop of environmental long term variability we discuss the uncertainties of assessing long term phenological shifts and the consequences of our results to considerations of shelf sea ecosystem reaction to climate fluctuations 2 methods 2 1 data in 1962 a pelagic monitoring program at the measuring site helgoland roads 54 11 3 n 7 54 0 e was started by the biologische anstalt helgoland this site about 60 km of the german coast represents a marine transition zone between coastal waters and the open sea on working days surface water samples were taken with a bucket lowered from a research vessel secchi depth and water temperature were measured directly on station water samples were analysed in the laboratory for nutrients salinity and phytoplankton phytoplankton subsamples were preserved using lugols solution at 0 1 concentrations in brown glass bottles and were counted daily using the utermöhl method lund et al 1958 the identification of the phytoplankton was usually carried out down to the species level wiltshire and dürselen 2004 nutrient concentrations were measured using the standard colorimetric methods as described by grashoff 1976 salinity was measured using a salinometer autosal gamma analysen technik gmbh in our study we considered the time series of the parameters water temperature secchi depth salinity and the nutrients nitrate phosphate and silicate table 1 the regular monitoring of the zooplankton was started in 1974 since then nets of two different sizes a 150 μm nansen net and a 500 μm calcofi net have been used for sampling three times a week for more detail of the sampling procedure and analytical methods used at helgoland roads see greve et al 2004 and boersma et al 2015 for zooplankton wiltshire and dürselen 2004 for phytoplankton and raabe and wiltshire 2009 for nutrients we used the sum of five important herbivore grazers as an indicator for zooplankton impact table 1 the analysis of the phenological response of phytoplankton was carried out using a representative seasonal cross section of the species observed specifically eighteen phytoplankton species and three phytoplankton genera of the most dominant marine phytoplankton groups were selected table 1 the species were selected according to the criteria for a complete and homogeneous monitoring within the time period 1962 2015 data pre processing was performed as follows first all daily time series were subjected linear interpolation to fill the gaps of missing data second the interpolated time series were smoothed using a moving five day average see mieruch et al 2010 these time series formed the basis for all subsequent analyses 2 2 peak modeling deriving phenological dates earlier analyses of long term changes in individual phytoplankton species at helgoland roads stressed the importance of recording seasonally different developments and the non homogeneous changes in abundance or biomass over time e g schlüter et al 2012 scharfe 2013 the high resolution data set of helgoland roads allowed the application of a model based approach to describe long term phenological changes in more detail in addition a non cumulative approach would also provide a detailed overview of the intra annual shifts in relation to species specific biomass to take these different aspects into account we applied a method proposed by rolinski et al 2007 this procedure entails the fitting a weibull function to an annual seasonal phytoplankton abundance curve and then estimating phenological dates from the function parameters rolinski et al 2007 applied the weibull type fitting approach to the spring biomass of total diatoms i e their study was related on the phenological description of the uni modal case of a highly aggregated parameter here we focused on the identification of phenological dates of single phytoplankton species abundance which showed uni and multi modal peak distributions in addition to timing this approach also provided information on the size of the peaks integral of the curve see below which was used in a second step for modeling and analysis of long term phenological changes see section 2 3 weibull functions are versatile in their adaptability to different distributions and thus provide information on location and shape parameters we followed the approach of rolinski et al 2007 and used a six parametric weibull function of the form 1 w x p 4 exp x p 5 p 6 1 p 1 e x p x p 2 p 3 where x is a time variable days of year and p1 p6 are parameters to be determined the latter describing characteristics of increasing and decreasing branches of the curve and considering different base levels before and after a peak after scaling the original abundance curve to the interval 0 1 i e to the original peak maximum ymax the function parameters in eq 1 are determined by fitting a nonlinear regression of the function w to the scaled values the goodness of fit was estimated by the coefficient of determination r² between the original and the fitted curve wfit based on wfit the phenological dates cardinal dates rolinski et al 2007 were then determined all calculations were performed using the cdw algorithm implemented in the r package cardidates rolinski et al 2015 which extracted the phenological dates from fitted six parametric weibull curves eq 1 the date of the maximum value of the wfit of a single peak was taken as a description of the timing of the maximum abundance hereinafter referred to tmid fig 1 a we determine the integral of wfit area below the curve considering potentially different base levels before and after tmid as many of the peaks showed an asymmetry between the increasing and decreasing branches the phenological dates describing the beginning and the end of a peak were calculated as follows as shown in fig 1a the date of the 10 quantile of the integral before tmid was defined as the beginning of the peak tbeg and the date of the 90 quantile of the area after tmid was defined as the end of the peak tend the use of a moving five day average of the original abundance see above improved the fitting of the rising and falling curve segments i e the determination of tbeg and tend the peak width was defined as the interval tbeg to tend species specific differences and inter annual variability result in a high number of different intra annual peak structures the distance between individual peaks as well as the ratio of the height of the maximum peak to the next smaller peak showed a high variation fig 1 this prevented the use of the same algorithm setting and a constant offset of the peak window for all years and species therefore visual inspection of the data to ensure correct handling was imperative two unequal peaks within one year compared to two equal peaks required the variation of the tuning parameter minpeak range 0 1 used default 0 3 which defined the minimum value of the maximum peak height which is regarded as another peak rolinski et al 2015 the model fit shown for guinardia delicatula fig 1a for instance was based on a value of 0 1 and that of skeletonema costatum fig 1b on a value of 0 3 cases showing a non zero base abundance level between two peaks closely adjacent in time caused further tuning effort due to the difficulty of their clear separation in such cases we used the tuning parameter mincut range 0 1 used default 0 15 which controls for the minimum relative height of a decline compared to the lower of the two neighbouring peaks at which these peaks are regarded as separate peaks rolinski et al 2015 in the case of eucampia zodiacus in the year 1996 fig 1c the use of the default to separate the peaks was sufficient the whole procedure was repeated for each year and each species genus separately the number of years of presence as well as the average number of peaks differed in part between single phytoplankton species considering all fitted peaks of each species in the period of observation the mean value of r² ranged between 0 86 thalassionema nitzschioides and 0 96 cerataulina pelagica 2 3 analysis of phenological long term changes the phenological dates and peak sizes derived in the previous section produced a detailed picture of species specific intra annual abundance distributions on the long term fig 2 showed this as an example for the diatom guinardia flaccida the center of a circle refers to the value of tmid and its diameter corresponds to the root transformed abundance of the 90 area under the peak curve i e the sum between tbeg and tend see above the largest diameter referred to a maximum peak sum of 5 67 105 cells l 1 year 1970 these time weighted distributions can be considered as a scatterplot with the scale for x on the horizontal axis in years and the scale for y on the vertical axis in day of year in order to determine the temporal course of phenological changes we applied loess smoothing to the scatterplot cleveland et al 1988 1992 analyses were performed using the loess acronym for local regression algorithm implemented in the stats package of r version 3 3 3 r core team 2018 loess is a non parametric regression technique that can be used to fit a curve through points in a scatterplot in this context non parametric means that no assumptions need to be made about the underlying distribution form of the data jacoby 2000 however fitting a loess smoothed curve to data pairs in a scatterplot required the estimation of two parameters the first parameter α span determines the degree of smoothing i e the proportion of all data that is to be used in each local fit size of neighborhood of x here we used α 0 25 for all fits this was proved to be a suitable compromise between smoothing and preserving of temporal structural information the second parameter λ specifies the degree of the polynomial which the loess procedure fits to the data jacoby 2000 we used λ 2 i e the local regression fitting based on quadratic equations in the loess procedure the points in a specific neighborhood determined by α span were weighted according to their distance to x tricubic weighting r core team 2018 this weighting approach initially contained no information on the size of the peaks associated with individual points grey circles in fig 2 in order to take into account the information on different sizes of the peaks prior to loess smoothing the single peak timing dates i e tmid were weighted by the associated root transformed abundance sum belonging to the 90 integral see above the solid line in fig 2 represents the loess fit based on this approach hereinafter referred to time series of mean tmid the dashed lines showed the related 95 confidence interval during years without peaks no open circle on the solid line fig 2 no loess fit value is available in such cases gaps were filled by linear interpolation between neighboring loess fit values where species showing one seasonal occurrence pattern e g g flaccida fig 2 the loess procedure was performed only once for the period 1962 2015 where species showed different seasonal occurrence patterns the loess procedure was applied for each sub period separately 2 4 timing conditions species specific preferences in terms of the environmental conditions as described by eight environmental parameters table 1 were analysed by calculating the conditions associated with the time series of mean tmid derived from the loess procedure see previous section the resulting time series e g water temperature at mean tmid were then compared to the background conditions in the corresponding time window in order to analyse the response in timing conditions and timing dates to long term environmental changes 2 5 comparison of periods a comparison of the periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 was made to test for changes in timing and related environmental conditions the kruskal wallis test was applied to test for significant differences in the medians to test for equal coefficient of variation cv we used the fligner killeen test fligner and killeen 1976 the t test was used to test for changes in the mean value all statistical tests were performed using the software past version 3 16 hammer et al 2001 2 6 analysis of common variation in timing principal component analysis pca see von storch and zwiers 1999 was applied to the time series of mean tmid for analyses of the pattern of common variation in species specific developments these analyses were carried out separately for the first and second half of the year with different numbers of time series included the strength of relationships between the principal components pcs and background environmental conditions was analyzed using the spearman correlation coefficient rs analyses were performed using past version 3 16 3 results 3 1 peak structure characteristics the phytoplankton species considered here occurred in the annual time period from february to october fig 3 a the timing of the spring species ranging from o aurita to c pelagica was between march and may the mean timing of most of the other diatom and dinoflagellate species was between late june and late august the timing dates i e tmid varied considerably between single species within similar time periods fig 3a the calculated long term occurrence of most diatoms had a mean peak width of around two weeks fig 3b the occurrence phases of the dinoflagellates were significantly longer at three to four weeks no species characteristic relationships were found between the intra annual position of tmid and the width of the peak while some species showed no correlation between peak width and sum of abundances e g c pelagica c fusus others showed a significant correlation e g n scintillans chaetoceros spp rs 0 58 and 0 61 both p 0 001 3 2 intra annual peak distribution of phytoplankton species intra annual peak occurrence was found to be different for each species reflecting the environment needs niche and the adaptive ability of a species on the basis of 16 example phytoplankton species different changes of properties were visible over their long term occurrence fig 4 the forms of temporal occurrence showed a high variation species such as o aurita in spring fig 4a or n scintillans in early summer fig 4h consistently showed little variation with regard to their temporal occurrence for species occurring in both halves of the year the trends of both developments could be similar s costatum thalassiosira spp fig 4b c or different chaetoceros spp fig 4f shifts towards an earlier occurrence in spring e g t nitzschioides d brightwellii fig 4d e and early summer r imbricata fig 4k as well as shifts towards a later occurrence in late summer e g e zodiacus fig 4m were found in summer r setigera showed a 10 year phase of strongly reduced abundance or absence which was followed by an abrupt shift towards later occurrence fig 4g in contrast the species o sinensis showed a temporary shift of the occurrence into spring fig 4n species such as g delicatula fig 4i showed a consistently broad occurrence throughout the year this made it impossible to calculate a suitable separation into two different periods for a more meaningful mean estimate of tmid on the other hand pseudo nitzschia spp showed an increase in the range of occurrence since the end of the 1990s fig 4j the inter annual variation in tmid expressed as the cv was lower for the dinoflagellates n scintillans fig 4h c fusus fig 4l c furca fig 4o and p micans fig 4p than for most diatoms shifts in timing were often associated with different changes in abundance and occurred at different times e g fig 4c j o phases with absence or reduced occurrence numbers differed between species these were also seen to vary between the first and second half of the year in one species e g fig 4c there were also significant differences in the regularity of the level of total annual abundance biomass here the species n scintillans fig 4h g delicatula fig 4i and r imbricata fig 4k showed the most uniform occurrence the temporal changes of most other species cf table 1 included in the study could be assigned to temporal change forms as shown in fig 4 3 3 shifts in timing fig 5 summarized the range of temporal shifts of all phytoplankton species due to the discontinuous nature of several species specific shifts over time we used the medians of mean tmid black lines in fig 4 of the two periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 to analyse the extent of temporal shifts shifts amounted to 0 to 17 days for those species occurring between late march and early june fig 5 in july the strongest shifts towards earlier occurrence were found for pseudo nitzschia spp and l minimus neighboring species could show significant differences in the shifts in late august and early september for example the dinoflagellate p micans showed a shift towards earlier occurrence 7 days and the diatoms d brightwellii and t nitzschioides showed shifts towards a later occurrence 10 and 24 days in order to put the phenological shifts in the context of changes in abundance biomass we also checked for changes in species specific abundances between both periods species showing significant phenological trends exhibited different developments with regard to abundance e g spring situation cases of later occurrence were not coupled with significant increases in abundances the development of chaetoceros spp in spring was the only example of a temporally constant occurrence with increasing abundances fig 5 we found that in spring several species showed significantly lower peaks at earlier occurrence table 2 this was in line with their corresponding trends in abundance and timing in summer species such as pseudo nitzschia spp and r imbricata had significantly higher peaks at earlier occurrence in accordance with existing trends in abundance significantly higher peaks at earlier occurrence were also found for species without corresponding trends e g d pumila table 2 no species in the second half of the year showed significantly higher peaks at later occurrence not even if there are significant trends in timing e g e zodiacus for the majority of species the occurrence of higher peaks was coupled to a lower variability in tmid see cvs in table 2 i e their occurrence was focused on a more narrow time window phytoplankton species thus showed a high range of changes in biomass with respect to temporal fluctuations 3 4 changes in environmental conditions at helgoland roads we analyzed the changes in the marine environment at helgoland roads by comparing the mean annual course of two periods for eight different parameters water temperature at helgoland roads showed a significant increase fig 6 a warming was evident throughout the year but different parameter ranges showed different shifts the temperature range of 6 8 c representing the starting conditions in spring for example showed a shift of about 14 days between both periods fig 6a the intra annual period with temperatures 16 is now greatly extended before and after the annual maximum while the timing of the annual maximum did not change on the long term sunshine duration also showed an increase during the second period between march and april fig 6a between april and july the warming trend was superimposed by a significant increase in secchi depth fig 6b the increase in secchi depth temporally coincided with the phase of highest light availability sunshine duration fig 6a salinity showed strongest increases between may and october fig 6b the time of decline in spring april remained largely the same over time phosphate concentrations were highest in a period from about 1975 to 1988 and showed a declining trend thereafter fig 6c intra annual courses of nutrient concentrations are net values as these are of course modified by the nutrient uptake of e g the phytoplankton the decrease in the phosphate concentrations was most pronounced in april and may in contrast to nitrate phosphate showed an earlier drop in concentrations in spring 20 days fig 6c the long term development of nitrate was characterized by a period of increased concentration from the early 1980s to the second half of the 1990s and that of of silicate concentrations was characterized by high inter annual variability and a period of higher concentration from about the end of the 1980s to the end of the 1990s as with phosphate but less pronounced an earlier decrease of silicate concentration took place during spring in the second period 10 15 days fig 6d the biggest differences increases between both periods were found in august and september fig 6d intra annual changes in nutrient concentrations were analyzed in more detail together with the changes in timing conditions of the different phytoplankton species next section zooplankton abundance was highest in the 1980s and decreased significantly from the second half of the 2000s afterwards fig 6d over the year zooplankton abundances were always highest in summer fig 6d 3 5 long term changes in timing conditions we used the environmental conditions associated with the trajectories of occurrence conditions at mean tmid black lines in fig 4 to relate the temporal shifts to the seasonally varying environmental conditions changes in species specific timing conditions were related to a the temporal shift of a species b the preferences of a species specific parameter range and c the characteristics of temporal change of a parameter species specific changes in timing conditions with regard to eight environmental parameters are shown in fig 7 3 5 1 water temperature in spring and early summer species showing a significant earlier occurrence do not show significant changes in associated water temperatures black arrows in fig 7a i e the shift in timing in days was of the same order of magnitude as the shift in the corresponding temperature range species with constant occurrence on the other hand usually reflect the increase in temperature in the respective time window e g chaetocerosspp in spring fig 7a species such as c pelagica and g flaccida showed no significant changes in associated temperatures but also no significant shift in timing see fig 5 this was probably due to lower temporal shifts in temperature ranges in that part of the year or the influence of other parameters before and after the annual maximum warming led to a different manifestation of temporal shifts of temperature ranges see fig 6a both chaetoceros spp and p micans for example had shown shifts towards earlier occurrence but in these cases we had observed also significant increases in timing temperatures reflecting a shift towards the highest temperature range the increase in timing temperatures of e zodiacus reflected the finding that the timing shift in days towards later occurrence was lower than the temporal shifts in temperature ranges during that time of the year in turn in early autumn d brightwellii again showed a close relationship between a shift in timing and temporal displacement of the temperature range these findings underlined the variability in which warming became apparent in the species specific timing conditions 3 5 2 sunshine duration and secchi depth the shifts in spring were not associated with statistically significant changes in sunshine duration see black squares and arrows fig 7a rise in sunshine duration during spring occurred much more unevenly compared to water temperature and the temporal extent of shifts in specific parameter ranges was smaller than the observed shifts in timing not shown species without shift in timing however reflected the significant changes in sunshine duration in april and may see c pelagica fig 7b the significant increase in light conditions at occurrence of the summer species r imbricata and pseudo nitzschia spp was associated with an occurrence shift towards the phase of the annual maximum of sunshine duration cf fig 6a the increase in secchi depth in spring was reflected differently in the timing conditions fig 7b species that occurred significantly earlier in spring black arrows mostly showed smaller changes in the associated conditions than the species with the most constant occurrence black arrows this was related to the fact that the temporal displacements of the species and that of secchi depth and water temperature were of a similar order of magnitude however there were differences in the relationship to both water temperature and secchi depth for example thalassiosira spp showed no change in associated temperatures over time and the temporal shift between the two periods 10 days fig 5 was of the same order of magnitude than that of the corresponding temperature range 13 days see fig 6a with regard to secchi depth however the shift in tmid resulted in a change from 3 2 to 3 9 m between the two periods arrow length in fig 7b that meant that thalassiosira spp did not follow the earlier occurrence of the same parameter range but only reflected the higher secchi depth in the second period at the earlier point in time comparable correlations were also found in other spring species e g t nitzschioides d brightwellii this indicated despite the rise in the secchi depth the water temperature as the main driver of phenological shifts in spring see also next section in the further course of the year the various species reflected the underlying trends in different ways fig 7b the secchi depth conditions of adjacent species were often uncorrelated e g c fusus l minimus significant increases in secchi depth conditions of l minimus chaetoceros spp and p micans seemed to be a consequence of the temporal shift earlier occurrence towards a period with a stronger trend in secchi depth july 3 5 3 salinity nutrients and zooplankton the changes in salinity conditions for species occurring after april mainly reflected the underlying increasing trend in salinity fig 7b significant increases observed with thalassiosira spp and d brightwellii occurrences for example in spring also reflected shifts towards phases with higher average salinity begin of april fig 6b yearly patterns in nutrient concentrations were controlled by the uptake of phytoplankton changes in the nutrient patterns however cannot only be attributed to the species considered here as these are a subset of the entire phytoplankton community however an earlier decrease in nutrient concentrations of phosphate and silicate fig 6c d could be a consequence of the earlier occurrence of different types of phytoplankton shifts in concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as the phenological shifts identified for several spring species cf fig 5 as a result some species e g thalassiosira spp t nitzschioides showed no significant changes in phosphate concentrations associated with timing despite the strong negative trends in mean phosphate concentrations during april and may such examples were also found for silicate e g a glacialis d brightwellii fig 7c differences in the time of re increase of phosphate and silicate concentrations between both periods fig 6c d resulted in very different trends in the timing conditions during that period of the year e g thalassiosira spp e zodiacus and o sinensis fig 7c the course of the nitrate concentrations grey lines in fig 6c was delayed compared to that of the other nutrients regardless of the individual shift of the species there were no statistically significant changes in the timing conditions regarding nitrate fig 7c the only exception was e zodiacus whose occurrence in the second period fig 4m coincided with the phase of the lowest nitrate concentration cf fig 6c with the exception of the earliest occurring species all species showed significant reduced zooplankton abundances at occurrence timing in the second period i e there were no differences in species showing significant shifts in timing or constant occurrence fig 7d 3 6 common variation in timing the above results show that even co occurring phytoplankton species may exhibit different phenological trends within identical time windows different species also had different phases of reduced or shifted presence superimposing the phenological long term trends fig 4 we used principal component analysis pca to identify the main factors of common inter annual variability in the timing of the phytoplankton species pca was applied to the time series of mean tmid black lines in fig 4 for species occurring in spring and summer respectively cf fig 4 in spring the first pc reflected the trend towards earlier occurrence fig 8 a strongest relationships were found with regard to water temperature rs 0 51 p 0 001 and zooplankton abundance in spring rs 0 64 p 0 001 the pattern of component loadings reflected the temporal shifts and the different sensitivity against the predictors fig 8c in contrast for the diatom c pelagica lowest loading a negative relationship with zooplankton abundance was found higher abundances were associated with a shift of mean tmid to an earlier date other pcs seemed to present non significant components broken stick criterion the temporal course of the first pc during summer appears different fig 8b pc1 shows the highest correlation to nitrate concentration in summer rs 0 57 p 0 001 higher nitrate concentrations were associated with earlier occurrences or displacements of mean tmid cf fig 4 diatom species without significant shifts in timing contributed most to the variability of this pattern higher loadings in fig 8d the second and the third pc of timing variability during summer had significantly lower explained variances 14 and 11 2 not shown pc2 showed weak correlations to zooplankton abundance rs 0 37 p 0 05 and silicate rs 0 40 p 0 01 interestingly pc3 showed a significant negative relationship with the mean water temperature in summer rs 0 49 p 0 001 the course of pc3 in summer strongly corresponded to that of pc1 in spring species specific loadings of this third pattern were highly correlated rs 0 89 p 0 0001 with the corresponding species specific shifts days in timing fig 5 thus for the part of the phytoplankton community considered here the part of timing variability induced by temperature changes is of secondary importance in summer and significantly lower than in spring 4 discussion especially in the context of climatic changes phenological studies on phytoplankton species occurrence or growth are often used to evaluate phytoplankton growth conditions e g poloczanska et al 2013 in order for such studies to be of real use in scenario analyses appropriately long term data sets are prerequisite see wiltshire et al 2010 this study creates new insights of the phenological response of marine phytoplankton species in temperate shallow seas we showed that different species are slotted into different species specific phenological time slots during annual succession more than half of the species examined here show significant shifts between the selected comparison periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 most changes relate to an earlier timing occurrence in the period april to july and are found in both diatom species and dinoflagellates whereby several species also show remarkable constancy in timing over decades unchanged timing associated with water temperature clearly reflect the answer of a species into the variable displacement of temperature ranges as a consequence seasonal displacements due to the same parameter have shown different temporal dimensions our study clearly shows the influence of warming on phenological changes of specific diatom species in spring with this study we clearly demonstrate that species specific relationships cannot simply be derived or inferred from the reactions of the total numbers e g diatoms to the different conditions e g wiltshire and manly 2004 edwards and richardson 2004 atkinson et al 2015 wiltshire et al 2015 such summed parameters may be dominated by the abundance biomass of single or merely a few species which may for example have no sensitivity or differing sensitivities to temperature changes the most dominant genus in spring chaetoceros spp shows a rather constant timing over time related to temperature regarding species with a narrow occurrence range the temporal course of the borders of the intra annual growth window can be considered approximately parallel to that of mean tmid e g d brightwellii fig 4 this describes a displacement of approximately constant width trajectories of occurrence rather than an expansion of the borders of the growth window or period see wiltshire et al 2015 other species such as pseudo nitzschia spp showed an increasing intra annual range of peak occurrence coupled to a significant increase in abundance cf fig 4 typically common timing indices take into account only the inter annual variation of the middle of season or the time of seasonal peak see ji et al 2010 but not the inter annual differences in the level of abundance achieved for a better assessment of the shifts and their potential ecological consequences it is very useful to combine the information about the temporal extent of shifts and the associated developments in abundance or biomass the weibull type fitting approach used in our study allows for a precise description of changes in phenological dates and related peak abundances the multitude of annual abundance curve structures however prevents the use of the same algorithm setting causing further tuning effort ultimately a visual inspection of the annual peak structures is essential to ensure correct model adaptation the use of loess curve fits for the description of annual occurrence timing mean tmid provides a suitable method to describe phenological variation on the long term scale it turns out that the loess curve fit of a species is consistent in terms of the mean temporal position and the trend with other phenological indices such as the 50th percentile of cumulative abundance or the central tendency e g ji et al 2010 the main difference arises from the reduced year to year variation caused by smoothing i e the inclusion of part of neighboring points to estimate mean tmid in a specific year the value of α 0 25 used here increases the influence of the timing date of larger than the surrounding peaks on the neighboring dates and reduces it in case of the timing of smaller than the surrounding peaks in addition the use of additional weights in loess smoothing leads to a weighting of the temporal position of larger peaks this procedure takes the following aspects into account nearly half of the species analyzed show a significantly higher variability in timing at small peak abundance sums table 2 i e the typical time corridor of main occurrence is often narrower in time furthermore if we only consider the variation between the time points of main occurrence in successive years i e without smoothing or as in an approach such as the central tendency for example fluctuations of 2 3 months often occur this variability is often due to the fact that a peak is missing in the typical corridor and significantly smaller peaks which otherwise do not matter form the focus of the occurrence at different times it does not seem plausible to assign such high temporal offsets to the variation of an environmental parameter range whose inter yearly variation is usually significantly lower using the smoothing approach we were thus able to investigate more precisely how each species was placed phenologically in the system and to relate this to environmental shifts we know from previous studies that because of the varying auto ecological characteristics of phytoplankton species differences in the responses to long term environmental changes are likely e g gebühr et al 2009 grüner et al 2011 freund et al 2012 schlüter et al 2012 schlüter et al 2012 analyzed the timing of three diatom species over the period 1962 2008 they showed that a low secchi depth plays the most important role in earlier appearance of o aurita in spring this was however not confirmed by our study although lower peaks of o aurita occurred significantly earlier table 2 no significant differences in secchi depth conditions between earlier and later peaks were found not shown using a cumulative approach wiltshire et al 2015 showed that o aurita achieved higher abundances during years with high secchi depth conditions in spring we only found a weak relationship between the secchi depth in february and the total abundance all peaks of o aurita in spring rs 0 39 p 0 01 and a slight negative shift in the timing of o aurita on the long term o aurita occurred most frequently in march in a period in which the secchi depth remained constant and sunshine duration only recorded a slight albeit significant increase peak conditions between the dates tbeg and tend see fig 1 were found not to differ significantly in terms of sunshine duration 5 h day and secchi depth 3 m but in terms of water temperature 4 3 to 5 3 c sunshine duration in march was also significantly less variable than water temperature and secchi depth however the cvs of tmid conditions with regard to these three parameters do not differ and the conditions at tend show a significantly lower variability with respect to water temperature and secchi depth this suggests that o aurita occurs in a comparatively constant range of light and turbulence conditions whose position is limited by the increase in water temperature and secchi depth in april it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the environmental conditions at individual peaks of all the phytoplankton species this example however demonstrates the potential for further analysis of species subsets versus cumulative whole population approaches the comparison of phenological shifts for different sub periods cf fig 5 also showed that changes do not occur evenly over time the division into comparative periods as used here represents only one possible perspective it weighted the phenological shifts of the individual species relative to specific environmental changes between both the comparison periods both of these aspects make it questionable whether it makes sense to specify a rate of phenological change as days per 1 c increase e g atkinson et al 2015 the superposition of anthropogenic influences the inference with hydrodynamic conditions scharfe 2013 callies and scharfe 2015 and the local warming trend in the southern north sea holt et al 2012 cause a strong local impact on the pattern of phenological variation in the german bight such pattern may therefore differ from other phenological changes for even the same species described for the greater north sea the dinoflagellate c fusus for example has shifted significantly by about 10 days at helgoland roads see fig 4 this magnitude is significantly lower than that reported by edwards and richardson 2004 for this species in the north sea area in general such a difference is probably related to the environmental heterogeneity of locations conditions in the greater north sea data set as used by edwards and richardson 2004 this illustrates as emphasized by mcquatters gollop and vermaat 2011 the complexity of down scaling generalizations from the whole north sea to a local area and vice versa phenological changes of the same species can also vary between single sites atkinson et al 2015 analyzed the phenological variation of different plankton groups observed at the plymouth l4 monitoring site english channel they described late august as the time of mean occurrence of the dinoflagellate n scintillans and found a significant later occurrence 44 days over a time period of 20 years coupled to an increase in water temperature at helgoland roads n scintillans occurs in mid july and no significant trend could be observed this also demonstrates the differences in the succession and seasonal courses of controlling factors between helgoland roads and the plymouth l4 station one controlling aspect is likely to be the dynamics of the long term changes in nutrient conditions e g shchekinova et al 2017 moreover especially with concomitant changes in the food quality of zooplankton e g boersma et al 2015 and their decling abundances are likely to play a role nitrate concentrations at helgoland roads are closely related to variation in the river elbe discharge wiltshire et al 2010 callies and scharfe 2015 voynova et al 2017 reflecting the position of helgoland roads as a marine transition zone between coastal waters and the open sea raabe and wiltshire 2009 emeis et al 2015 in our study of a s subset of the total phytoplankton community considered here nitrate concentration and zooplankton abundance were found to contribute most to timing variability in summer see fig 8b from the beginning of the 1980s until the mid 1990s several species show an earlier timing occurrence along with a significant increase in abundance e g l minimus shifts of similar amplitude in just a few years e g o sinensis or an accumulation of years of absence e g t nitzschioides in summer this induced variability in timing superimposes shifts resulting from warming this causal differentiation is important for the understanding and classification of climatic fluctuations on the future development of the marine ecosystem even though changes in the nutrient patterns are not alone responsible for the selection of species considered the similar magnitude in the time shifts 10 20 days with an earlier decline in spring silicate and phosphate suggest a relationship to the phenological shifts of the phytoplankton species see wiltshire et al 2015 decreasing long term trends in phosphate and silicate concentration were greater in april and may than in the adjoining months see shchekinova et al 2017 this underpins the interesting fact that species showing phenological shifts in spring are not affiliated with changes in the phosphate concentrations climate induced changes in phenology are implicit with shifts in the size structure and composition of the phytoplankton community overall and will influence the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels hays et al 2005 cheung et al 2011 winder and sommer 2012 wiltshire et al 2008 2010 2015 a closer look at the interference with time shifted nutrient uptake processes remains an interesting question for the future with regard to changes in the food quality of zooplankton and against the background of changing nutrient conditions in the german bight e g boersma et al 2015 sarker 2018 when zooplankton occurrence and shifts are combined with the phenological shifts which we have observed here for phytoplankton species it is clear that there is potential for mismatch cushing 1990 as shown by greve et al 2004 for the helgoland site also different zooplankton species exhibit species specific phenological responses the non homogenous response of both trophic levels in terms of phenology as a response to climate warming is well known e g edwards and richardson 2004 richardson 2008 wiltshire et al 2008 poloczanska et al 2013 however in a comparison of very warm and cold years atkinson et al 2015 pointed out that different strategies and compensation processes may reduce potential mismatch effects this could also be reflected in the differences described here between species specific changes in timing and more constant behavior at the level of the whole community the zooplankton abundance of various important copepods shows a strong decline in the southern north sea boersma et al 2015 in the subset of five zooplankton taxa used here table 1 the reduction is particularly pronounced in the period from 2007 the changed timing occurrence along with a reduction in abundance in spring and summer of thalassiosira spp fig 4c for example shows a high temporal coincidence with this phase the nature of this relationship has not become clear here but underlines the necessity of considering species specific relationships in the analysis of long term ecological changes in the coupling of phytoplankton and zooplankton and for the evaluation of climatic impacts on phenological changes 5 conclusions the model approach used here contributes to a broader understanding of the phenological response at species level in temperate shallow seas we showed that different species are slotted into different species specific phenological time slots during annual succession thus the effect of climatic and hydrological changes and especially warming on phytoplankton depends on the species and how it is enniched in a system our analysis shows that with the annual transition through seasonal environmental conditions even co occurring phytoplankton species may exhibit different phenological trends within overlapping time windows there are different forms of changes in the timing of growth windows of phytoplankton species on the intra annual and inter annual scale which reflect the strong warming at helgoland roads to varying degrees the local character in seasonality and trends also of other drivers of phenological variability makes it difficult to compare the impact of phenological shifts on ecosystem processes at different sites the complex phenological response

25048,annually recurring environmental processes such as the cycle of temperature and light drive the phenology of marine plankton populations improved knowledge about the homogeneity and amplitude of the phenological response of phytoplankton to climate change is essential for an assessment of ecological consequences on the marine ecosystem we analyzed phenological variability of 21 phytoplankton species monitored work daily at helgoland roads from 1962 2015 we used a function of weibull type to estimate phenological dates of species specific abundance peaks the combination of derived dates and peak abundances formed the basis for the analyses of long term changes in phenological time slots and associated environmental conditions species specific preferences in combination with seasonally varying environmental trends resulted in a complex pattern of phenological long term response phenological trends showed both constant occurrence and shifts to an earlier or later occurrence co occurring phytoplankton species were shown to exhibit different phenological trends even within identical time slots differences in species specific trends in timing also reflected the seasonally varying shifts in water temperature ranges due to warming in spring and summer the main patterns of common variability in timing were associated with different abiotic and biotic drivers the majority of species showed more narrow time slots related to the occurrence of higher peaks considering the variation of species occurrence in their typical time window provided insight in terms of assigning the effect of environmental drivers on inter annual phenological variation phytoplankton species with similar long term trends in timing days showed different trends in biomass i e the phenological changes resulted from different ecological responses to environmental change the local character of environmental trends at helgoland underpins the limits for comparison of findings between different measuring sites or wider areas such as the north sea the study emphasizes the benefit and necessity of a highly resolved phytoplankton record for a true understanding of long term

phenology of marine planktonic organisms richardson 2008 beaugrand 2009 beaugrand et al 2009 ipcc et al 2014 atkinson et al 2015 consequences of changes in phytoplankton phenology are often discussed in the context of temporal decoupling match mismatch of primary producers and consumers cushing 1990 richardson 2008 atkinson et al 2015 the asynchronous phenological responses between phytoplankton and zooplankton with regard to warming for example can lead to local changes in the plankton composition and feeding relationships wiltshire et al 2010 mackas et al 2012 as outlined in several studies the timing of for example the spring phytoplankton bloom or trophic mismatch is not necessarily closely related to seasonal temperature variation wiltshire et al 2008 poloczanska et al 2013 atkinson

responses e g schlüter et al 2012 wiltshire et al 2015 i e by non uniform timing shifts to changes in environmental conditions the goal of this study was to better assess the inter annual and seasonal variation of timing occurrence for single phytoplankton species on a multi decadal scale for this we used the species and environmental data from the helgoland roads time series which represents one of the most comprehensive data sets available for marine observations see wiltshire et al 2010 we chose a broad spectrum of species representative of intra annual occurrence and reflecting fundamental differences due to for example varying preferences to light and water temperature e g gebühr et al 2009 mieruch et al 2010 scharfe 2013 wiltshire et al 2015 most existing phenological indices e g ji et al 2010 brody et al 2013 have been applied to aggregated variables such as total biomass or the abundances of phytoplankton groups such as diatoms and dinoflagellates edwards and richardson 2004 wiltshire et al 2008 however for a broader understanding on marine phenology it is important to know more about the species specific reactions and whether these behave in the same manner as total populations when related to a summed population of organisms the temporal structure in the occurrence of individual species will be significantly more heterogeneous reflecting this variability we focused on a peak based model approach instead of a cumulative population abundance approach or compared to approaches with fixed exceedance values e g ji et al 2010 we used a weibull type fitting approach described by rolinski et al 2007 for modeling of abundance peaks of single phytoplankton species in order to describe the temporal course of phenological variation we applied loess smoothing cleveland and delvin 1988 cleveland et al 1988 to scatterplots of species specific intra annual abundance distributions we proceeded as follows first we analyzed the species specific differentiation of occurrence windows including their different seasonal modes second we focused on the identification of environmental parameters which are relevant to variation or constancy of species phenology third we determined the variability in species specific phenological timing against the backdrop of environmental long term variability we discuss the uncertainties of assessing long term phenological shifts and the consequences of our results to considerations of shelf sea ecosystem reaction to climate fluctuations 2 methods 2 1 data in 1962 a pelagic monitoring program at the measuring site helgoland roads 54 11 3 n 7 54 0 e was started by the biologische anstalt helgoland this site about 60 km of the german coast represents a marine transition zone between coastal waters and the open sea on working days surface water samples were taken with a bucket lowered from a research vessel secchi depth and water temperature were measured directly on station water samples were analysed in the laboratory for nutrients salinity and phytoplankton phytoplankton subsamples were preserved using lugols solution at 0 1 concentrations in brown glass bottles and were counted daily using the utermöhl method lund et al 1958 the identification of the phytoplankton was usually carried out down to the species level wiltshire and dürselen 2004 nutrient concentrations were measured using the standard colorimetric methods as described by grashoff 1976 salinity was measured using a salinometer autosal gamma analysen technik gmbh in our study we considered the time series of the parameters water temperature secchi depth salinity and the nutrients nitrate phosphate and silicate table 1 the regular monitoring of the zooplankton was started in 1974 since then nets of two different sizes a 150 μm nansen net and a 500 μm calcofi net have been used for sampling three times a week for more detail of the sampling procedure and analytical methods used at helgoland roads see greve et al 2004 and boersma et al 2015 for zooplankton wiltshire and dürselen 2004 for phytoplankton and raabe and wiltshire 2009 for nutrients we used the sum of five important herbivore grazers as an indicator for zooplankton impact table 1 the analysis of the phenological response of phytoplankton was carried out using a representative seasonal cross section of the species observed specifically eighteen phytoplankton species and three phytoplankton genera of the most dominant marine phytoplankton groups were selected table 1 the species were selected according to the criteria for a complete and homogeneous monitoring within the time period 1962 2015 data pre processing was performed as follows first all daily time series were subjected linear interpolation to fill the gaps of missing data second the interpolated time series were smoothed using a moving five day average see mieruch et al 2010 these time series formed the basis for all subsequent analyses 2 2 peak modeling deriving phenological dates earlier analyses of long term changes in individual phytoplankton species at helgoland roads stressed the importance of recording seasonally different developments and the non homogeneous changes in abundance or biomass over time e g schlüter et al 2012 scharfe 2013 the high resolution data set of helgoland roads allowed the application of a model based approach to describe long term phenological changes in more detail in addition a non cumulative approach would also provide a detailed overview of the intra annual shifts in relation to species specific biomass to take these different aspects into account we applied a method proposed by rolinski et al 2007 this procedure entails the fitting a weibull function to an annual seasonal phytoplankton abundance curve and then estimating phenological dates from the function parameters rolinski et al 2007 applied the weibull type fitting approach to the spring biomass of total diatoms i e their study was related on the phenological description of the uni modal case of a highly aggregated parameter here we focused on the identification of phenological dates of single phytoplankton species abundance which showed uni and multi modal peak distributions in addition to timing this approach also provided information on the size of the peaks integral of the curve see below which was used in a second step for modeling and analysis of long term phenological changes see section 2 3 weibull functions are versatile in their adaptability to different distributions and thus provide information on location and shape parameters we followed the approach of rolinski et al 2007 and used a six parametric weibull function of the form 1 w x p 4 exp x p 5 p 6 1 p 1 e x p x p 2 p 3 where x is a time variable days of year and p1 p6 are parameters to be determined the latter describing characteristics of increasing and decreasing branches of the curve and considering different base levels before and after a peak after scaling the original abundance curve to the interval 0 1 i e to the original peak maximum ymax the function parameters in eq 1 are determined by fitting a nonlinear regression of the function w to the scaled values the goodness of fit was estimated by the coefficient of determination r² between the original and the fitted curve wfit based on wfit the phenological dates cardinal dates rolinski et al 2007 were then determined all calculations were performed using the cdw algorithm implemented in the r package cardidates rolinski et al 2015 which extracted the phenological dates from fitted six parametric weibull curves eq 1 the date of the maximum value of the wfit of a single peak was taken as a description of the timing of the maximum abundance hereinafter referred to tmid fig 1 a we determine the integral of wfit area below the curve considering potentially different base levels before and after tmid as many of the peaks showed an asymmetry between the increasing and decreasing branches the phenological dates describing the beginning and the end of a peak were calculated as follows as shown in fig 1a the date of the 10 quantile of the integral before tmid was defined as the beginning of the peak tbeg and the date of the 90 quantile of the area after tmid was defined as the end of the peak tend the use of a moving five day average of the original abundance see above improved the fitting of the rising and falling curve segments i e the determination of tbeg and tend the peak width was defined as the interval tbeg to tend species specific differences and inter annual variability result in a high number of different intra annual peak structures the distance between individual peaks as well as the ratio of the height of the maximum peak to the next smaller peak showed a high variation fig 1 this prevented the use of the same algorithm setting and a constant offset of the peak window for all years and species therefore visual inspection of the data to ensure correct handling was imperative two unequal peaks within one year compared to two equal peaks required the variation of the tuning parameter minpeak range 0 1 used default 0 3 which defined the minimum value of the maximum peak height which is regarded as another peak rolinski et al 2015 the model fit shown for guinardia delicatula fig 1a for instance was based on a value of 0 1 and that of skeletonema costatum fig 1b on a value of 0 3 cases showing a non zero base abundance level between two peaks closely adjacent in time caused further tuning effort due to the difficulty of their clear separation in such cases we used the tuning parameter mincut range 0 1 used default 0 15 which controls for the minimum relative height of a decline compared to the lower of the two neighbouring peaks at which these peaks are regarded as separate peaks rolinski et al 2015 in the case of eucampia zodiacus in the year 1996 fig 1c the use of the default to separate the peaks was sufficient the whole procedure was repeated for each year and each species genus separately the number of years of presence as well as the average number of peaks differed in part between single phytoplankton species considering all fitted peaks of each species in the period of observation the mean value of r² ranged between 0 86 thalassionema nitzschioides and 0 96 cerataulina pelagica 2 3 analysis of phenological long term changes the phenological dates and peak sizes derived in the previous section produced a detailed picture of species specific intra annual abundance distributions on the long term fig 2 showed this as an example for the diatom guinardia flaccida the center of a circle refers to the value of tmid and its diameter corresponds to the root transformed abundance of the 90 area under the peak curve i e the sum between tbeg and tend see above the largest diameter referred to a maximum peak sum of 5 67 105 cells l 1 year 1970 these time weighted distributions can be considered as a scatterplot with the scale for x on the horizontal axis in years and the scale for y on the vertical axis in day of year in order to determine the temporal course of phenological changes we applied loess smoothing to the scatterplot cleveland et al 1988 1992 analyses were performed using the loess acronym for local regression algorithm implemented in the stats package of r version 3 3 3 r core team 2018 loess is a non parametric regression technique that can be used to fit a curve through points in a scatterplot in this context non parametric means that no assumptions need to be made about the underlying distribution form of the data jacoby 2000 however fitting a loess smoothed curve to data pairs in a scatterplot required the estimation of two parameters the first parameter α span determines the degree of smoothing i e the proportion of all data that is to be used in each local fit size of neighborhood of x here we used α 0 25 for all fits this was proved to be a suitable compromise between smoothing and preserving of temporal structural information the second parameter λ specifies the degree of the polynomial which the loess procedure fits to the data jacoby 2000 we used λ 2 i e the local regression fitting based on quadratic equations in the loess procedure the points in a specific neighborhood determined by α span were weighted according to their distance to x tricubic weighting r core team 2018 this weighting approach initially contained no information on the size of the peaks associated with individual points grey circles in fig 2 in order to take into account the information on different sizes of the peaks prior to loess smoothing the single peak timing dates i e tmid were weighted by the associated root transformed abundance sum belonging to the 90 integral see above the solid line in fig 2 represents the loess fit based on this approach hereinafter referred to time series of mean tmid the dashed lines showed the related 95 confidence interval during years without peaks no open circle on the solid line fig 2 no loess fit value is available in such cases gaps were filled by linear interpolation between neighboring loess fit values where species showing one seasonal occurrence pattern e g g flaccida fig 2 the loess procedure was performed only once for the period 1962 2015 where species showed different seasonal occurrence patterns the loess procedure was applied for each sub period separately 2 4 timing conditions species specific preferences in terms of the environmental conditions as described by eight environmental parameters table 1 were analysed by calculating the conditions associated with the time series of mean tmid derived from the loess procedure see previous section the resulting time series e g water temperature at mean tmid were then compared to the background conditions in the corresponding time window in order to analyse the response in timing conditions and timing dates to long term environmental changes 2 5 comparison of periods a comparison of the periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 was made to test for changes in timing and related environmental conditions the kruskal wallis test was applied to test for significant differences in the medians to test for equal coefficient of variation cv we used the fligner killeen test fligner and killeen 1976 the t test was used to test for changes in the mean value all statistical tests were performed using the software past version 3 16 hammer et al 2001 2 6 analysis of common variation in timing principal component analysis pca see von storch and zwiers 1999 was applied to the time series of mean tmid for analyses of the pattern of common variation in species specific developments these analyses were carried out separately for the first and second half of the year with different numbers of time series included the strength of relationships between the principal components pcs and background environmental conditions was analyzed using the spearman correlation coefficient rs analyses were performed using past version 3 16 3 results 3 1 peak structure characteristics the phytoplankton species considered here occurred in the annual time period from february to october fig 3 a the timing of the spring species ranging from o aurita to c pelagica was between march and may the mean timing of most of the other diatom and dinoflagellate species was between late june and late august the timing dates i e tmid varied considerably between single species within similar time periods fig 3a the calculated long term occurrence of most diatoms had a mean peak width of around two weeks fig 3b the occurrence phases of the dinoflagellates were significantly longer at three to four weeks no species characteristic relationships were found between the intra annual position of tmid and the width of the peak while some species showed no correlation between peak width and sum of abundances e g c pelagica c fusus others showed a significant correlation e g n scintillans chaetoceros spp rs 0 58 and 0 61 both p 0 001 3 2 intra annual peak distribution of phytoplankton species intra annual peak occurrence was found to be different for each species reflecting the environment needs niche and the adaptive ability of a species on the basis of 16 example phytoplankton species different changes of properties were visible over their long term occurrence fig 4 the forms of temporal occurrence showed a high variation species such as o aurita in spring fig 4a or n scintillans in early summer fig 4h consistently showed little variation with regard to their temporal occurrence for species occurring in both halves of the year the trends of both developments could be similar s costatum thalassiosira spp fig 4b c or different chaetoceros spp fig 4f shifts towards an earlier occurrence in spring e g t nitzschioides d brightwellii fig 4d e and early summer r imbricata fig 4k as well as shifts towards a later occurrence in late summer e g e zodiacus fig 4m were found in summer r setigera showed a 10 year phase of strongly reduced abundance or absence which was followed by an abrupt shift towards later occurrence fig 4g in contrast the species o sinensis showed a temporary shift of the occurrence into spring fig 4n species such as g delicatula fig 4i showed a consistently broad occurrence throughout the year this made it impossible to calculate a suitable separation into two different periods for a more meaningful mean estimate of tmid on the other hand pseudo nitzschia spp showed an increase in the range of occurrence since the end of the 1990s fig 4j the inter annual variation in tmid expressed as the cv was lower for the dinoflagellates n scintillans fig 4h c fusus fig 4l c furca fig 4o and p micans fig 4p than for most diatoms shifts in timing were often associated with different changes in abundance and occurred at different times e g fig 4c j o phases with absence or reduced occurrence numbers differed between species these were also seen to vary between the first and second half of the year in one species e g fig 4c there were also significant differences in the regularity of the level of total annual abundance biomass here the species n scintillans fig 4h g delicatula fig 4i and r imbricata fig 4k showed the most uniform occurrence the temporal changes of most other species cf table 1 included in the study could be assigned to temporal change forms as shown in fig 4 3 3 shifts in timing fig 5 summarized the range of temporal shifts of all phytoplankton species due to the discontinuous nature of several species specific shifts over time we used the medians of mean tmid black lines in fig 4 of the two periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 to analyse the extent of temporal shifts shifts amounted to 0 to 17 days for those species occurring between late march and early june fig 5 in july the strongest shifts towards earlier occurrence were found for pseudo nitzschia spp and l minimus neighboring species could show significant differences in the shifts in late august and early september for example the dinoflagellate p micans showed a shift towards earlier occurrence 7 days and the diatoms d brightwellii and t nitzschioides showed shifts towards a later occurrence 10 and 24 days in order to put the phenological shifts in the context of changes in abundance biomass we also checked for changes in species specific abundances between both periods species showing significant phenological trends exhibited different developments with regard to abundance e g spring situation cases of later occurrence were not coupled with significant increases in abundances the development of chaetoceros spp in spring was the only example of a temporally constant occurrence with increasing abundances fig 5 we found that in spring several species showed significantly lower peaks at earlier occurrence table 2 this was in line with their corresponding trends in abundance and timing in summer species such as pseudo nitzschia spp and r imbricata had significantly higher peaks at earlier occurrence in accordance with existing trends in abundance significantly higher peaks at earlier occurrence were also found for species without corresponding trends e g d pumila table 2 no species in the second half of the year showed significantly higher peaks at later occurrence not even if there are significant trends in timing e g e zodiacus for the majority of species the occurrence of higher peaks was coupled to a lower variability in tmid see cvs in table 2 i e their occurrence was focused on a more narrow time window phytoplankton species thus showed a high range of changes in biomass with respect to temporal fluctuations 3 4 changes in environmental conditions at helgoland roads we analyzed the changes in the marine environment at helgoland roads by comparing the mean annual course of two periods for eight different parameters water temperature at helgoland roads showed a significant increase fig 6 a warming was evident throughout the year but different parameter ranges showed different shifts the temperature range of 6 8 c representing the starting conditions in spring for example showed a shift of about 14 days between both periods fig 6a the intra annual period with temperatures 16 is now greatly extended before and after the annual maximum while the timing of the annual maximum did not change on the long term sunshine duration also showed an increase during the second period between march and april fig 6a between april and july the warming trend was superimposed by a significant increase in secchi depth fig 6b the increase in secchi depth temporally coincided with the phase of highest light availability sunshine duration fig 6a salinity showed strongest increases between may and october fig 6b the time of decline in spring april remained largely the same over time phosphate concentrations were highest in a period from about 1975 to 1988 and showed a declining trend thereafter fig 6c intra annual courses of nutrient concentrations are net values as these are of course modified by the nutrient uptake of e g the phytoplankton the decrease in the phosphate concentrations was most pronounced in april and may in contrast to nitrate phosphate showed an earlier drop in concentrations in spring 20 days fig 6c the long term development of nitrate was characterized by a period of increased concentration from the early 1980s to the second half of the 1990s and that of of silicate concentrations was characterized by high inter annual variability and a period of higher concentration from about the end of the 1980s to the end of the 1990s as with phosphate but less pronounced an earlier decrease of silicate concentration took place during spring in the second period 10 15 days fig 6d the biggest differences increases between both periods were found in august and september fig 6d intra annual changes in nutrient concentrations were analyzed in more detail together with the changes in timing conditions of the different phytoplankton species next section zooplankton abundance was highest in the 1980s and decreased significantly from the second half of the 2000s afterwards fig 6d over the year zooplankton abundances were always highest in summer fig 6d 3 5 long term changes in timing conditions we used the environmental conditions associated with the trajectories of occurrence conditions at mean tmid black lines in fig 4 to relate the temporal shifts to the seasonally varying environmental conditions changes in species specific timing conditions were related to a the temporal shift of a species b the preferences of a species specific parameter range and c the characteristics of temporal change of a parameter species specific changes in timing conditions with regard to eight environmental parameters are shown in fig 7 3 5 1 water temperature in spring and early summer species showing a significant earlier occurrence do not show significant changes in associated water temperatures black arrows in fig 7a i e the shift in timing in days was of the same order of magnitude as the shift in the corresponding temperature range species with constant occurrence on the other hand usually reflect the increase in temperature in the respective time window e g chaetocerosspp in spring fig 7a species such as c pelagica and g flaccida showed no significant changes in associated temperatures but also no significant shift in timing see fig 5 this was probably due to lower temporal shifts in temperature ranges in that part of the year or the influence of other parameters before and after the annual maximum warming led to a different manifestation of temporal shifts of temperature ranges see fig 6a both chaetoceros spp and p micans for example had shown shifts towards earlier occurrence but in these cases we had observed also significant increases in timing temperatures reflecting a shift towards the highest temperature range the increase in timing temperatures of e zodiacus reflected the finding that the timing shift in days towards later occurrence was lower than the temporal shifts in temperature ranges during that time of the year in turn in early autumn d brightwellii again showed a close relationship between a shift in timing and temporal displacement of the temperature range these findings underlined the variability in which warming became apparent in the species specific timing conditions 3 5 2 sunshine duration and secchi depth the shifts in spring were not associated with statistically significant changes in sunshine duration see black squares and arrows fig 7a rise in sunshine duration during spring occurred much more unevenly compared to water temperature and the temporal extent of shifts in specific parameter ranges was smaller than the observed shifts in timing not shown species without shift in timing however reflected the significant changes in sunshine duration in april and may see c pelagica fig 7b the significant increase in light conditions at occurrence of the summer species r imbricata and pseudo nitzschia spp was associated with an occurrence shift towards the phase of the annual maximum of sunshine duration cf fig 6a the increase in secchi depth in spring was reflected differently in the timing conditions fig 7b species that occurred significantly earlier in spring black arrows mostly showed smaller changes in the associated conditions than the species with the most constant occurrence black arrows this was related to the fact that the temporal displacements of the species and that of secchi depth and water temperature were of a similar order of magnitude however there were differences in the relationship to both water temperature and secchi depth for example thalassiosira spp showed no change in associated temperatures over time and the temporal shift between the two periods 10 days fig 5 was of the same order of magnitude than that of the corresponding temperature range 13 days see fig 6a with regard to secchi depth however the shift in tmid resulted in a change from 3 2 to 3 9 m between the two periods arrow length in fig 7b that meant that thalassiosira spp did not follow the earlier occurrence of the same parameter range but only reflected the higher secchi depth in the second period at the earlier point in time comparable correlations were also found in other spring species e g t nitzschioides d brightwellii this indicated despite the rise in the secchi depth the water temperature as the main driver of phenological shifts in spring see also next section in the further course of the year the various species reflected the underlying trends in different ways fig 7b the secchi depth conditions of adjacent species were often uncorrelated e g c fusus l minimus significant increases in secchi depth conditions of l minimus chaetoceros spp and p micans seemed to be a consequence of the temporal shift earlier occurrence towards a period with a stronger trend in secchi depth july 3 5 3 salinity nutrients and zooplankton the changes in salinity conditions for species occurring after april mainly reflected the underlying increasing trend in salinity fig 7b significant increases observed with thalassiosira spp and d brightwellii occurrences for example in spring also reflected shifts towards phases with higher average salinity begin of april fig 6b yearly patterns in nutrient concentrations were controlled by the uptake of phytoplankton changes in the nutrient patterns however cannot only be attributed to the species considered here as these are a subset of the entire phytoplankton community however an earlier decrease in nutrient concentrations of phosphate and silicate fig 6c d could be a consequence of the earlier occurrence of different types of phytoplankton shifts in concentrations were in the same order of magnitude as the phenological shifts identified for several spring species cf fig 5 as a result some species e g thalassiosira spp t nitzschioides showed no significant changes in phosphate concentrations associated with timing despite the strong negative trends in mean phosphate concentrations during april and may such examples were also found for silicate e g a glacialis d brightwellii fig 7c differences in the time of re increase of phosphate and silicate concentrations between both periods fig 6c d resulted in very different trends in the timing conditions during that period of the year e g thalassiosira spp e zodiacus and o sinensis fig 7c the course of the nitrate concentrations grey lines in fig 6c was delayed compared to that of the other nutrients regardless of the individual shift of the species there were no statistically significant changes in the timing conditions regarding nitrate fig 7c the only exception was e zodiacus whose occurrence in the second period fig 4m coincided with the phase of the lowest nitrate concentration cf fig 6c with the exception of the earliest occurring species all species showed significant reduced zooplankton abundances at occurrence timing in the second period i e there were no differences in species showing significant shifts in timing or constant occurrence fig 7d 3 6 common variation in timing the above results show that even co occurring phytoplankton species may exhibit different phenological trends within identical time windows different species also had different phases of reduced or shifted presence superimposing the phenological long term trends fig 4 we used principal component analysis pca to identify the main factors of common inter annual variability in the timing of the phytoplankton species pca was applied to the time series of mean tmid black lines in fig 4 for species occurring in spring and summer respectively cf fig 4 in spring the first pc reflected the trend towards earlier occurrence fig 8 a strongest relationships were found with regard to water temperature rs 0 51 p 0 001 and zooplankton abundance in spring rs 0 64 p 0 001 the pattern of component loadings reflected the temporal shifts and the different sensitivity against the predictors fig 8c in contrast for the diatom c pelagica lowest loading a negative relationship with zooplankton abundance was found higher abundances were associated with a shift of mean tmid to an earlier date other pcs seemed to present non significant components broken stick criterion the temporal course of the first pc during summer appears different fig 8b pc1 shows the highest correlation to nitrate concentration in summer rs 0 57 p 0 001 higher nitrate concentrations were associated with earlier occurrences or displacements of mean tmid cf fig 4 diatom species without significant shifts in timing contributed most to the variability of this pattern higher loadings in fig 8d the second and the third pc of timing variability during summer had significantly lower explained variances 14 and 11 2 not shown pc2 showed weak correlations to zooplankton abundance rs 0 37 p 0 05 and silicate rs 0 40 p 0 01 interestingly pc3 showed a significant negative relationship with the mean water temperature in summer rs 0 49 p 0 001 the course of pc3 in summer strongly corresponded to that of pc1 in spring species specific loadings of this third pattern were highly correlated rs 0 89 p 0 0001 with the corresponding species specific shifts days in timing fig 5 thus for the part of the phytoplankton community considered here the part of timing variability induced by temperature changes is of secondary importance in summer and significantly lower than in spring 4 discussion especially in the context of climatic changes phenological studies on phytoplankton species occurrence or growth are often used to evaluate phytoplankton growth conditions e g poloczanska et al 2013 in order for such studies to be of real use in scenario analyses appropriately long term data sets are prerequisite see wiltshire et al 2010 this study creates new insights of the phenological response of marine phytoplankton species in temperate shallow seas we showed that different species are slotted into different species specific phenological time slots during annual succession more than half of the species examined here show significant shifts between the selected comparison periods 1962 1988 and 1989 2015 most changes relate to an earlier timing occurrence in the period april to july and are found in both diatom species and dinoflagellates whereby several species also show remarkable constancy in timing over decades unchanged timing associated with water temperature clearly reflect the answer of a species into the variable displacement of temperature ranges as a consequence seasonal displacements due to the same parameter have shown different temporal dimensions our study clearly shows the influence of warming on phenological changes of specific diatom species in spring with this study we clearly demonstrate that species specific relationships cannot simply be derived or inferred from the reactions of the total numbers e g diatoms to the different conditions e g wiltshire and manly 2004 edwards and richardson 2004 atkinson et al 2015 wiltshire et al 2015 such summed parameters may be dominated by the abundance biomass of single or merely a few species which may for example have no sensitivity or differing sensitivities to temperature changes the most dominant genus in spring chaetoceros spp shows a rather constant timing over time related to temperature regarding species with a narrow occurrence range the temporal course of the borders of the intra annual growth window can be considered approximately parallel to that of mean tmid e g d brightwellii fig 4 this describes a displacement of approximately constant width trajectories of occurrence rather than an expansion of the borders of the growth window or period see wiltshire et al 2015 other species such as pseudo nitzschia spp showed an increasing intra annual range of peak occurrence coupled to a significant increase in abundance cf fig 4 typically common timing indices take into account only the inter annual variation of the middle of season or the time of seasonal peak see ji et al 2010 but not the inter annual differences in the level of abundance achieved for a better assessment of the shifts and their potential ecological consequences it is very useful to combine the information about the temporal extent of shifts and the associated developments in abundance or biomass the weibull type fitting approach used in our study allows for a precise description of changes in phenological dates and related peak abundances the multitude of annual abundance curve structures however prevents the use of the same algorithm setting causing further tuning effort ultimately a visual inspection of the annual peak structures is essential to ensure correct model adaptation the use of loess curve fits for the description of annual occurrence timing mean tmid provides a suitable method to describe phenological variation on the long term scale it turns out that the loess curve fit of a species is consistent in terms of the mean temporal position and the trend with other phenological indices such as the 50th percentile of cumulative abundance or the central tendency e g ji et al 2010 the main difference arises from the reduced year to year variation caused by smoothing i e the inclusion of part of neighboring points to estimate mean tmid in a specific year the value of α 0 25 used here increases the influence of the timing date of larger than the surrounding peaks on the neighboring dates and reduces it in case of the timing of smaller than the surrounding peaks in addition the use of additional weights in loess smoothing leads to a weighting of the temporal position of larger peaks this procedure takes the following aspects into account nearly half of the species analyzed show a significantly higher variability in timing at small peak abundance sums table 2 i e the typical time corridor of main occurrence is often narrower in time furthermore if we only consider the variation between the time points of main occurrence in successive years i e without smoothing or as in an approach such as the central tendency for example fluctuations of 2 3 months often occur this variability is often due to the fact that a peak is missing in the typical corridor and significantly smaller peaks which otherwise do not matter form the focus of the occurrence at different times it does not seem plausible to assign such high temporal offsets to the variation of an environmental parameter range whose inter yearly variation is usually significantly lower using the smoothing approach we were thus able to investigate more precisely how each species was placed phenologically in the system and to relate this to environmental shifts we know from previous studies that because of the varying auto ecological characteristics of phytoplankton species differences in the responses to long term environmental changes are likely e g gebühr et al 2009 grüner et al 2011 freund et al 2012 schlüter et al 2012 schlüter et al 2012 analyzed the timing of three diatom species over the period 1962 2008 they showed that a low secchi depth plays the most important role in earlier appearance of o aurita in spring this was however not confirmed by our study although lower peaks of o aurita occurred significantly earlier table 2 no significant differences in secchi depth conditions between earlier and later peaks were found not shown using a cumulative approach wiltshire et al 2015 showed that o aurita achieved higher abundances during years with high secchi depth conditions in spring we only found a weak relationship between the secchi depth in february and the total abundance all peaks of o aurita in spring rs 0 39 p 0 01 and a slight negative shift in the timing of o aurita on the long term o aurita occurred most frequently in march in a period in which the secchi depth remained constant and sunshine duration only recorded a slight albeit significant increase peak conditions between the dates tbeg and tend see fig 1 were found not to differ significantly in terms of sunshine duration 5 h day and secchi depth 3 m but in terms of water temperature 4 3 to 5 3 c sunshine duration in march was also significantly less variable than water temperature and secchi depth however the cvs of tmid conditions with regard to these three parameters do not differ and the conditions at tend show a significantly lower variability with respect to water temperature and secchi depth this suggests that o aurita occurs in a comparatively constant range of light and turbulence conditions whose position is limited by the increase in water temperature and secchi depth in april it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the environmental conditions at individual peaks of all the phytoplankton species this example however demonstrates the potential for further analysis of species subsets versus cumulative whole population approaches the comparison of phenological shifts for different sub periods cf fig 5 also showed that changes do not occur evenly over time the division into comparative periods as used here represents only one possible perspective it weighted the phenological shifts of the individual species relative to specific environmental changes between both the comparison periods both of these aspects make it questionable whether it makes sense to specify a rate of phenological change as days per 1 c increase e g atkinson et al 2015 the superposition of anthropogenic influences the inference with hydrodynamic conditions scharfe 2013 callies and scharfe 2015 and the local warming trend in the southern north sea holt et al 2012 cause a strong local impact on the pattern of phenological variation in the german bight such pattern may therefore differ from other phenological changes for even the same species described for the greater north sea the dinoflagellate c fusus for example has shifted significantly by about 10 days at helgoland roads see fig 4 this magnitude is significantly lower than that reported by edwards and richardson 2004 for this species in the north sea area in general such a difference is probably related to the environmental heterogeneity of locations conditions in the greater north sea data set as used by edwards and richardson 2004 this illustrates as emphasized by mcquatters gollop and vermaat 2011 the complexity of down scaling generalizations from the whole north sea to a local area and vice versa phenological changes of the same species can also vary between single sites atkinson et al 2015 analyzed the phenological variation of different plankton groups observed at the plymouth l4 monitoring site english channel they described late august as the time of mean occurrence of the dinoflagellate n scintillans and found a significant later occurrence 44 days over a time period of 20 years coupled to an increase in water temperature at helgoland roads n scintillans occurs in mid july and no significant trend could be observed this also demonstrates the differences in the succession and seasonal courses of controlling factors between helgoland roads and the plymouth l4 station one controlling aspect is likely to be the dynamics of the long term changes in nutrient conditions e g shchekinova et al 2017 moreover especially with concomitant changes in the food quality of zooplankton e g boersma et al 2015 and their decling abundances are likely to play a role nitrate concentrations at helgoland roads are closely related to variation in the river elbe discharge wiltshire et al 2010 callies and scharfe 2015 voynova et al 2017 reflecting the position of helgoland roads as a marine transition zone between coastal waters and the open sea raabe and wiltshire 2009 emeis et al 2015 in our study of a s subset of the total phytoplankton community considered here nitrate concentration and zooplankton abundance were found to contribute most to timing variability in summer see fig 8b from the beginning of the 1980s until the mid 1990s several species show an earlier timing occurrence along with a significant increase in abundance e g l minimus shifts of similar amplitude in just a few years e g o sinensis or an accumulation of years of absence e g t nitzschioides in summer this induced variability in timing superimposes shifts resulting from warming this causal differentiation is important for the understanding and classification of climatic fluctuations on the future development of the marine ecosystem even though changes in the nutrient patterns are not alone responsible for the selection of species considered the similar magnitude in the time shifts 10 20 days with an earlier decline in spring silicate and phosphate suggest a relationship to the phenological shifts of the phytoplankton species see wiltshire et al 2015 decreasing long term trends in phosphate and silicate concentration were greater in april and may than in the adjoining months see shchekinova et al 2017 this underpins the interesting fact that species showing phenological shifts in spring are not affiliated with changes in the phosphate concentrations climate induced changes in phenology are implicit with shifts in the size structure and composition of the phytoplankton community overall and will influence the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels hays et al 2005 cheung et al 2011 winder and sommer 2012 wiltshire et al 2008 2010 2015 a closer look at the interference with time shifted nutrient uptake processes remains an interesting question for the future with regard to changes in the food quality of zooplankton and against the background of changing nutrient conditions in the german bight e g boersma et al 2015 sarker 2018 when zooplankton occurrence and shifts are combined with the phenological shifts which we have observed here for phytoplankton species it is clear that there is potential for mismatch cushing 1990 as shown by greve et al 2004 for the helgoland site also different zooplankton species exhibit species specific phenological responses the non homogenous response of both trophic levels in terms of phenology as a response to climate warming is well known e g edwards and richardson 2004 richardson 2008 wiltshire et al 2008 poloczanska et al 2013 however in a comparison of very warm and cold years atkinson et al 2015 pointed out that different strategies and compensation processes may reduce potential mismatch effects this could also be reflected in the differences described here between species specific changes in timing and more constant behavior at the level of the whole community the zooplankton abundance of various important copepods shows a strong decline in the southern north sea boersma et al 2015 in the subset of five zooplankton taxa used here table 1 the reduction is particularly pronounced in the period from 2007 the changed timing occurrence along with a reduction in abundance in spring and summer of thalassiosira spp fig 4c for example shows a high temporal coincidence with this phase the nature of this relationship has not become clear here but underlines the necessity of considering species specific relationships in the analysis of long term ecological changes in the coupling of phytoplankton and zooplankton and for the evaluation of climatic impacts on phenological changes 5 conclusions the model approach used here contributes to a broader understanding of the phenological response at species level in temperate shallow seas we showed that different species are slotted into different species specific phenological time slots during annual succession thus the effect of climatic and hydrological changes and especially warming on phytoplankton depends on the species and how it is enniched in a system our analysis shows that with the annual transition through seasonal environmental conditions even co occurring phytoplankton species may exhibit different phenological trends within overlapping time windows there are different forms of changes in the timing of growth windows of phytoplankton species on the intra annual and inter annual scale which reflect the strong warming at helgoland roads to varying degrees the local character in seasonality and trends also of other drivers of phenological variability makes it difficult to compare the impact of phenological shifts on ecosystem processes at different sites the complex phenological response

25049,land use land cover lulc data represent important inputs in hydrologic models the lulc data can affect modelled watershed hydrologic processes by altering the rates of interception inﬁltration evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge that govern the timing and volume of surface and river runoff a thorough understanding of the impacts of lulc resolution on hydrologic modelling is thus essential and important generally differences in the resolution of lulc data in hydrologic modelling can result in different interpretation accuracies lulc classifications and spatial resolutions for one year lulc datasets typically such models only use one year lulc datasets in the simulation period to simply the calculation process but how would the model performance change if multiple years of lulc data were input into hydrologic models to better understand the impacts of lulc resolution on hydrologic modelling this study input four lulc datasets into the swat soil and water assessment tool model and compared the impacts of the lulc datasets on the hydrologic modelling results for a high elevation cold and mountainous watershed in northwest china the first three datasets describe the lulc in the year 2000 and are based on different interpretation accuracies lulc classifications and spatial resolutions the last dataset is the yearly lulc data over a 20 year period to incorporate the yearly lulc dataset we modified the hru hydrologic response unit division method and swat computational structure the main findings were as follows 1 a yearly lulc dataset may result in a higher simulation complexity in the swat model because this involves the most lulc patches 2 if multiple years of lulc data exist a lulc dataset with smaller time intervals e g yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in swat to get better model performance the model performance may improve by 2 2 13 9 compared to one year lulc datasets 3 if only one year lulc datasets exist we suggest inputting a dataset with a high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced numbers of lulc classification types into swat to improve the hydrologic model performance with such an approach the model performance may improve by 1 1 6 9 compared to other one year lulc datasets keywords land use land cover swat runoff hydrological modelling 1 introduction hydrologic models have become increasingly important tools for determining among other things the impact of human activities and environments on hydrology and ecology devia et al 2015 bouraoui and grizzetti 2017 in addition to water processes such models can also simulate the motion of sediments nutrients bacteria carbon and insecticides at catchment scales plus et al 2006 ahmadi et al 2014 bouraoui and grizzetti 2017 hydrologic models use a number of parameters to define the characteristics of a system and the ability of a model to accurately represent watershed hydrologic processes depends significantly on the accuracy of the input data the essential hydrologic model inputs are rainfall and drainage area while watershed characteristics such as soil properties land use land cover lulc and watershed topography are also important the accuracy of such data inputs are the primary sources of uncertainty zhang et al 2014 gires et al 2015 and a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of input accuracy on the hydrologic modelling process chaplot 2014 yang et al 2014 and zhang et al 2014 assessed the uncertainty of hydrologic modelling at different digital elevation model dem resolutions zhu and mackay 2001 ye et al 2011 and jin et al 2015 studied the impacts of soil data accuracy on hydrologic processes carpenter and georgakakos 2004 and gires et al 2015 studied the impact of rainfall data resolution on modelling different conclusions have been reached with respect to the effects of lulc data resolution on hydrological modelling chen et al 2005 studied the impacts of lulc data resolution on the modelling of hydrologic processes at the watershed scale in the united states and concluded that lulc data resolution did not affect streamflow simulation results contrarily romanowicz et al 2005 and kalyanapu et al 2009 reported that the lulc resolution had a significant effect on streamflow and other hydrologic features lulc data resolutionremote sensing interpretation accuracy generally differences in the accuracy of lulc data in hydrologic modelling can lead to different interpretation accuracies lulc classifications and spatial resolutions for one year lulc datasets typically hydrologic models only use one year lulc datasets in the simulation period to simply the calculation process arnold et al 2012 however because human activities cause the lulc to change over time one year datasets can perform very poorly when generalizing the descriptions of lulc over multiple years furthermore reliance on one year lulc datasets can increase model uncertainty with further impacts on model results therefore in this study we investigated how the model performance would change if multiple years of lulc data were input into hydrologic models as well although some studies have noted that more accurate or multiple period lulc data are not necessary in the hydrologic modelling of large catchments because the calibration process smooths out the effects of input data chen et al 2005 arnold et al 2012 li et al 2012 in general hydrologic process modelling is primarily impacted by the model inputs zhang et al 2014 furthermore it is necessary to take into account the accuracy of input data to reduce model uncertainty and maintain model parameters within reasonable ranges moriasi et al 2007 jin et al 2015 correspondingly multi year lulc data can be used to describe the land use and land cover change over time and the input of such yearly lulc data may be essential in hydrologic modelling under certain conditions e g watershed with severe human activities because lulc can affect watershed hydrologic and ecologic processes by altering the rates of interception inﬁltration evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge that drive the timing and volume of surface and river runoff it is an important driving input for hydrologic modelling baker and miller 2013 in some models lulc soil and topography are overlaid to obtain basic computational units one example is the swat soil and water assessment tool model a partially explicit physically based long term simulation model that computes the characteristics of hydrologic pathways on hrus hydrologic response units arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 each hru represents a unique combination of soil topography and lulc within each sub basin the lulc resolution influences how the model is divided into hrus and as a result how the characteristics of the hydrologic pathways are computed however owing to computational limitations the swat model must simulate hydrologic process over multiple year periods and cannot apply yearly lulc data in a seamless manner in applying hydrologic modelling to a watershed accurate simulation of river runoff is the basis for reasonable modelling of other hydrologic processes accordingly this study sought to obtain a better understanding of the effects of lulc data resolution on river runoff simulation model performance to better support basin management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river watershed is a typical inland river or terminal lake basin with a drainage area of approximately 130 000 km2 in the arid region of northwest china jin et al 2015 it lies between 98 and 101 3 e and 38 and 42 n the upper reach of the heihe river in the qilian mountains was selected for this study this area is monitored by the yingluoxia hydrological station which is located at an elevation of about 1600 m at the outlet of the upper reach of the heihe river watershed fig 1 the drainage area is 10 009 km2 the upper reach is the main runoff generation area for the entire watershed and has a very complex topography with elevations ranging widely from 1674 to 5584 m li et al 2009 precipitation increases 15 5 16 4 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation and the annual precipitation ranges from over 200 mm in areas above 2600 m to 700 mm at the summit li et al 2009 the annual average runoff is 1 605 109 m3 with weak intra annual variability the dominant lulc types within the watershed are grassland forestland and barren land li et al 2009 ran et al 2012 2 2 lulc datasets the four lulc datasets used in this study were obtained from different satellites during different years and have differing spectral and spatial resolutions table 1 the first which is called nludc for the purposes of this study was compiled by liu et al 2003 via visual interpretations of the national land use cover database of china at a scale of 1 100 000 in 2000 these data are based on 30 m resolution landsat thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images the remote sensing interpretation accuracy for these lulc classifications is greater than 90 liu et al 2003 the second dataset nludc 1 km was obtained by reclassifying the nludc map to a 1000 m resolution by using the arcgis environmental systems research institute 2012 data management tool s nearest resampling technique the third dataset miclu was a multi source integrated chinese lulc map obtained by integrating the following five relevant lulc datasets ran et al 2012 a 1 km land use map of china at a 1 100 000 scale obtained from the year 2000 land use database liu et al 2003 a 1 1000 000 vegetation map of china hou 2001 a 1 100 000 glacier distribution map wu and li 2004 a 1 1000 000 swamp map of china zhang 2002 and the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer global 1 km land cover classiﬁcation product for 2001 friedl et al 2002 the miclu dataset applies the international geosphere biosphere program igbp igbp 1990 lulc classiﬁcation system at a spatial resolution of 1000 m the overall accuracy of the miclu map is 71 the final dataset nludc yearly was comprised of yearly datasets from 2000 to 2009 obtained from the national land use cover database of china at a scale of 1 100 000 with data based on 30 m resolution landsat tm etm images compiled by liu et al 2003 via visual interpretations the dataset considers the land use land cover change over time fig 3 following application of the nludc igbp and other land use classification systems applied in the swat model the nludc nludc 1 km and nludc yearly datasets contained six primary lulc types namely farmland forestland grassland water built up land and barren land the miclu dataset had more lulc classifications and included 10 primary lulc types farmland brushland grassland wetlands evergreen forest deciduous forest mixed forest water built up land and barren land because it was obtained by integrating the five relevant lulc datasets fig 2 and table 2 show the spatial distributions and areas by lulc type the miclu dataset differed significantly from the other datasets particularly in terms of the distributions and areas of forest barren land and grassland nludc yearly also differed from the others in that it contained one year lulc data that as can be seen from table 2 varied by type from year to year and therefore could not represent the lulc over multiple years thus yearly lulc data might be required for hydrologic modelling 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model description the swat model arnold et al 1998 which is one of the most widely used hydrologic models is sufficiently powerful for simulating nearly all watershed characteristics gassman et al 2007 li et al 2009 this study focused on only the hydrologic component of this model the swat model uses physical algorithms to estimate runoff by using input data comprised mainly of precipitation soil properties topography and lulc the model calculates runoff with the soil conservation service scs curve number equation abbaspour et al 2007 in addition to its use of topography land use and soil data swat can divide a watershed into hrus by breaking the main basin into smaller units by selecting points on the stream network that act as outlets in this manner the model can provide output data such as discharge at speciﬁc points along a river network as has been summarized the responses of each hru in terms of water sediment nutrient and pesticide transformations are determined individually and then aggregated at the sub basin level and routed to the associated reach and to the catchment outlet through the channel network arnold et al 1998 the hydrologic component of swat is based on the following water balance equation 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where s w t is the final soil water content mm h2o s w 0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is the elapsed time d r d a y is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o q s u r f is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o w s e e p is the amount of percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom on day i mm h2o and q g w is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o swat incorporates some of the most common hydrologic equations for ﬂow simulations accurate implementation of these equations requires accurate input data in the form of watershed dems and local soil lulc and climate data of particular importance in terms of lulc is the model s ability to compute surface runoff with the help of the scs curve arnold et al 1998 the model s database includes different lulc types each with an associated curve for antecedent soil moisture ii cnii values which can be assigned by the user to a modelled watershed 2 3 2 model setup in addition to lulc data swat model input data include topography soil hydrology and meteorology data over the selected watershed the dem derived topographic data are used to divide the watershed into sub basins each of which is assigned information on climate groundwater main channels streams and outlets within each sub basin swat identiﬁes hrus with different combinations of unique land cover soil type and slope information water balance computations are performed at the hru level of spatial discretisation with the contributions of each hru averaged to represent the water yield to the main channel water is then routed to the outlet of the watershed arnold et al 1998 li et al 2009 jin et al 2015 owing to the difficulty of obtaining yearly lulc data and shortcomings in the swat computational process the hydrologic process is simulated at one period per pass while multiple periods e g multiple years of lulc cannot be continuously simulated i e the swat model cannot seamlessly call lulc data on a year by year basis to assess model performance in simulating the hydrologic process based on the multiple year lulc data contained in the nludc yearly dataset we modified the methods used by the swat model to produce hrus fig 4 along with some of its computational steps the modified swat model identifies hrus by first overlaying yearly lulc data to obtain a map showing areas in which the lulc type changes by year this map is then overlaid with soil and slope maps to obtain yearly hrus for those with unchanging areas but changing lulc types finally a yearly loop function introduced under the amended swat structure fig 5 a is used to assign parameters for hrus in different years fig 5b note that under this modification the basic formulas used by the swat model remain unchanged arcgis 10 0 was used to derive input files for the modified swat model based on the following datasets for the study area 1 dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m fig 6 2 detailed soil map containing 97 types of soil with different hydraulic properties fig 6 derived from in situ observations of the hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density available water content and particle size distribution jin et al 2015 3 climatic data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures daily precipitation daily relative humidity daily solar radiation and daily wind speed at meteorological stations all climate data were obtained as daily averages and 4 ﬂow data at the yingluoxia hydrological station which was used to evaluate the model performance all of these datasets were provided by the environmental ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn the swat model was run from 2000 to 2009 at monthly and yearly intervals model performance in ﬁtting the observations was measured by using the following three objective functions according to moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ratio of the root mean square error rmse to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and the percent bias pbias the nse is used to measure the goodness of ﬁt the rsr standardises the rmse in terms of the standard deviation of the measured data and has an optimal value of zero the pbias is used to measure the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than observed data and is expressed as a percentage positive and negative values indicate model underestimation and overestimation bias respectively nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 according to moriasi et al 2007 model simulation of flow can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 the nse rsr and pbias are calculated as follows 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s 2 3 r s r i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s 2 4 p b i a s i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 100 i 1 n q o b s i where q o b s i is the observed value on day or month i q s i m i is the simulated value on day or month i and q o b s is the average of the observed data over the simulation period 3 results 3 1 changes in hrus the four datasets used in this study had significantly varying hru numbers and the numbers for the nludc yearly miclu nludc and nludc 1 km datasets corresponded to 2 276 1 460 1261 and 1310 hrus respectively 3 2 model performance during the runoff simulation the swat outputs for the four lulc datasets were compared both prior to and following calibration 3 2 1 before calibration fig 7 and table 3 show the results of the comparison of monthly and yearly runoff across four different lulc datasets prior to model calibration from fig 7a it can be seen that the simulated monthly runoffs for the four lulc datasets were similar no significant differences and that the simulated runoffs in winter were much lower than the observed values the nse values for the prediction of monthly runoff were 0 70 0 61 0 63 and 0 75 the rsr values were 0 54 0 62 0 61 and 0 50 and the pbias values were 0 16 0 99 1 00 and 0 85 for the miclu nludc nludc 1 km and nludc yearly datasets respectively table 3 the four datasets had similar pbias values which were all negative and between 10 the nludc yearly dataset had the best model performance with the highest nse and lowest rsr values it can be seen from fig 7c that the simulated yearly runoffs produced by the four lulc datasets followed similar trends with the nludc yearly datasets producing the highest runoff the miclu dataset had the lowest nse value 0 26 and the highest rsr value 0 85 for yearly runoff the nludc yearly dataset produced both the highest nse value and the lowest rsr value which indicates that this dataset performed best in simulating the yearly runoff without calibration 3 2 2 with calibration 3 2 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameters for a given watershed must be determined prior to the swat calibration process in this study we used streamflow data from 2000 to 2009 at the yingluoxia station to conduct a global sensitivity analysis which involves allowing all parameter values to change arnold et al 2012 table 4 shows the results of this sensitivity analysis for the miclu nludc and nludc 1 km datasets over the study area because two of the datasets had the same spatial resolution and lulc classifications we assumed that the nludc yearly dataset had the same sensitive parameters as the nludc dataset table 4 lists the top 10 sensitive parameters for the miclu dataset these were as follows cn2 slsubbsn ch k2 hru slp canmx gw revap esco alpha bf ch n2 and gwqmn where cn2 denotes the initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii slsubbsn is the average slope length m ch k2 is the effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel alluvium mm h hru slp is the average slope steepness m m canmx is the maximum canopy storage mm h2o gw revap is the groundwater revap coefficient esco is the soil evaporation compensation factor alpha bf is the base flow alpha factor 1 d ch n2 is manning s n value for the main channel and gwqmn is the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur mm h2o for the nludc dataset the 10 most sensitive parameters were as follows ch k2 esco ch n2 canmx hru slp slsubbsn cn2 smtmp tlaps and rchrg d where smtmp denotes the snow melt base temperature c tlaps is the temperature lapse rate c km and rchrg dp is the deep aquifer percolation fraction for the nludc dataset the 10 most sensitive parameters were as follows cn2 slsubbsn esco ch k2 hru slp canmx gw revap gw delay alpha bf and smtmp where gw delay is the groundwater delay time d 3 2 2 2 model calibration in this study we calibrate the model by multi step manual calibration method arnold et al 2012 following the sensitivity analysis it can be seen from fig 7b and table 4 that model performance in terms of estimating the monthly runoff was significantly improved for all four lulc datasets following model calibration all nse values were above 0 89 all rsr values were below 0 33 and all pbias values were within 10 in addition there were no significant differences among the monthly runoff values among the four datasets nludc yearly resulted in the best swat model performance for the monthly runoff with nse rse and pbias values of 0 92 0 28 and 0 72 respectively miclu resulted in the poorest performance with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 89 0 30 and 1 27 respectively it can be seen from fig 7d and table 4 that model performance in terms of estimating yearly runoff also improved following model calibration with nse values all above 0 72 rsr values all below 0 53 and pbias values all within 10 although the estimated differences in annual total runoff were broader than those in the monthly runoff case nludc yearly produced the best swat model performance for the yearly runoff with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 82 0 42 and 0 72 respectively miclu produced the worst model performance with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 72 0 53 and 1 27 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 impacts on the runoff modelling the uncalibrated model performances of all four datasets in terms of monthly and yearly runoff simulation were all precise because calibration masks differences between lulc datasets comparing the uncalibrated models enabled determination of how well each simulation predicted runoff prior to calibration as an indication of the effort required for calibration for each dataset and differences in the model prediction ability jin et al 2015 heathman et al 2008 also noted that hydrologic models in uncalibrated mode eliminate bias arising from parameter optimisation for the uncalibrated model the nludc yearly dataset had the best model performance which indicates that models built by this dataset will be easier to calibrate for simulating runoff than those built by the other datasets it was noted above that the runoff predictions for the non calibrated models showed that when using the four lulc datasets as input swat could accurately predict monthly and yearly runoff even prior to calibration however calibration generally improved the model performance in fact following calibration the performance achieved with each dataset during estimation of the monthly and yearly runoff improved significantly the nludc yearly dataset had the best post calibration swat model performance while the miclu dataset performed the worst the superior results of the nludc yearly dataset can potentially be ascribed to its particularly high spatial resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy as the dataset applies yearly intervals over the simulation period to better describe lulc changes within the study area by smoothing deviations over the input data the miclu dataset had more lulc types but lower spatial resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy than the other three datasets a large number of parameter combinations were required to verify that the model performance was different not only because of parameter modification but also because of the use of the different lulc datasets therefore we used the sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting algorithm sufi 2 of swat cup a calibration and uncertainty program for mathematical details please refer to abbaspour et al 2015 an auto calibration tool together with the range constrained sensitive parameters to calibrate swat the algorithm was run 20 000 times in total the results showed that the yearly lulc dataset corresponded to the best model performance and the miclu datatset corresponded to the worst model performance this suggests that use of an lulc dataset with high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and a reduced number of lulc type classifications can improve hydrologic model performance in simulating monthly and in particular yearly runoff when using only one year worth of lulc data furthermore the accuracy of results from multiple year lulc datasets with high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced lulc types can be improved by modifying the model to use yearly lulc data 4 2 impacts on the calculation complexity of the swat model an hru is an area with a uniform land use soil type and topography the delineation of hrus allows swat to consider the spatial heterogeneity of lulc and soils in a watershed for which the model carries out hydraulic and other calculations for various lulc datasets increasing the number of hrus is expected to increase the complexity of the simulation gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 for the four datasets the nludc yearly dataset had a much larger number of lulc patches than the other datasets this indicates that the nludc yearly corresponded to the greatest calculation complexity in addition hrus are lumped and there is no interaction among them in the swat model large numbers of hrus in this study may reduce the defects of lumped hrus however future research requires to consider interaction among hrus and setting a proper hru threshold is a necessary step similar studies reveal the impacts of lulc data on hydrological modelling chen et al 2005 kalyanapu et al 2009 but may fail to call for the lulc data year by year in this study the swat model is improved to call for multiple years of lulc data because human activities cause the lulc to change over time one year datasets can perform very poorly when generalizing the descriptions of lulc over multiple years the improvement of the swat model may reduce the defects of the original swat model and we find that if multiple years of lulc data exist a lulc dataset with smaller time intervals e g yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in swat to get a better model performance 5 conclusion the following important findings were made in this study 1 a yearly lulc dataset may result in a higher simulation complexity in the swat model because of the greater number of lulc patches 2 if multiple years of lulc data exist a lulc dataset with smaller time intervals e g yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in swat to get better model performance the model performance can be improved by 2 2 13 9 compared to one year lulc datasets 3 if only one year lulc datasets exist we suggest inputting a dataset with a high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced numbers of lulc classification types into swat to improve the hydrologic model performance with such an approach the model performance may improve by 1 1 6 9 compared to other one year lulc datasets acknowledgments this research was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of

impact of rainfall data resolution on modelling different conclusions have been reached with respect to the effects of lulc data resolution on hydrological modelling chen et al 2005 studied the impacts of lulc data resolution on the modelling of hydrologic processes at the watershed scale in the united states and concluded that lulc data resolution did not affect streamflow simulation results contrarily romanowicz et al 2005 and kalyanapu et al 2009 reported that the lulc resolution had a significant effect on streamflow and other hydrologic features lulc data resolutionremote sensing interpretation accuracy generally differences in the accuracy of lulc data in hydrologic modelling can lead to different interpretation accuracies lulc classifications and spatial resolutions for one year lulc datasets typically hydrologic models only use one year lulc datasets in the simulation period to simply the calculation process arnold et al 2012 however because human activities cause the lulc to change over time one year datasets can perform very poorly when generalizing the descriptions of lulc over multiple years furthermore reliance on one year lulc datasets can increase model uncertainty with further impacts on model results therefore in this study we investigated how the model performance would change if multiple years of lulc data were input into hydrologic models as well although some studies have noted that more accurate or multiple period lulc data are not necessary in the hydrologic modelling of large catchments because the calibration process smooths out the effects of input data chen et al 2005 arnold et al 2012 li et al 2012 in general hydrologic process modelling is primarily impacted by the model inputs zhang et al 2014 furthermore it is necessary to take into account the accuracy of input data to reduce model uncertainty and maintain model parameters within reasonable ranges moriasi et al 2007 jin et al 2015 correspondingly multi year lulc data can be used to describe the land use and land cover change over time and the input of such yearly lulc data may be essential in hydrologic modelling under certain conditions e g watershed with severe human activities because lulc can affect watershed hydrologic and ecologic processes by altering the rates of interception inﬁltration evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge that drive the timing and volume of surface and river runoff it is an important driving input for hydrologic modelling baker and miller 2013 in some models lulc soil and topography are overlaid to obtain basic computational units one example is the swat soil and water assessment tool model a partially explicit physically based long term simulation model that computes the characteristics of hydrologic pathways on hrus hydrologic response units arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 each hru represents a unique combination of soil topography and lulc within each sub basin the lulc resolution influences how the model is divided into hrus and as a result how the characteristics of the hydrologic pathways are computed however owing to computational limitations the swat model must simulate hydrologic process over multiple year periods and cannot apply yearly lulc data in a seamless manner in applying hydrologic modelling to a watershed accurate simulation of river runoff is the basis for reasonable modelling of other hydrologic processes accordingly this study sought to obtain a better understanding of the effects of lulc data resolution on river runoff simulation model performance to better support basin management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river watershed is a typical inland river or terminal lake basin with a drainage area of approximately 130 000 km2 in the arid region of northwest china jin et al 2015 it lies between 98 and 101 3 e and 38 and 42 n the upper reach of the heihe river in the qilian mountains was selected for this study this area is monitored by the yingluoxia hydrological station which is located at an elevation of about 1600 m at the outlet of the upper reach of the heihe river watershed fig 1 the drainage area is 10 009 km2 the upper reach is the main runoff generation area for the entire watershed and has a very complex topography with elevations ranging widely from 1674 to 5584 m li et al 2009 precipitation increases 15 5 16 4 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation and the annual precipitation ranges from over 200 mm in areas above 2600 m to 700 mm at the summit li et al 2009 the annual average runoff is 1 605 109 m3 with weak intra annual variability the dominant lulc types within the watershed are grassland forestland and barren land li et al 2009 ran et al 2012 2 2 lulc datasets the four lulc datasets used in this study were obtained from different satellites during different years and have differing spectral and spatial resolutions table 1 the first which is called nludc for the purposes of this study was compiled by liu et al 2003 via visual interpretations of the national land use cover database of china at a scale of 1 100 000 in 2000 these data are based on 30 m resolution landsat thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images the remote sensing interpretation accuracy for these lulc classifications is greater than 90 liu et al 2003 the second dataset nludc 1 km was obtained by reclassifying the nludc map to a 1000 m resolution by using the arcgis environmental systems research institute 2012 data management tool s nearest resampling technique the third dataset miclu was a multi source integrated chinese lulc map obtained by integrating the following five relevant lulc datasets ran et al 2012 a 1 km land use map of china at a 1 100 000 scale obtained from the year 2000 land use database liu et al 2003 a 1 1000 000 vegetation map of china hou 2001 a 1 100 000 glacier distribution map wu and li 2004 a 1 1000 000 swamp map of china zhang 2002 and the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer global 1 km land cover classiﬁcation product for 2001 friedl et al 2002 the miclu dataset applies the international geosphere biosphere program igbp igbp 1990 lulc classiﬁcation system at a spatial resolution of 1000 m the overall accuracy of the miclu map is 71 the final dataset nludc yearly was comprised of yearly datasets from 2000 to 2009 obtained from the national land use cover database of china at a scale of 1 100 000 with data based on 30 m resolution landsat tm etm images compiled by liu et al 2003 via visual interpretations the dataset considers the land use land cover change over time fig 3 following application of the nludc igbp and other land use classification systems applied in the swat model the nludc nludc 1 km and nludc yearly datasets contained six primary lulc types namely farmland forestland grassland water built up land and barren land the miclu dataset had more lulc classifications and included 10 primary lulc types farmland brushland grassland wetlands evergreen forest deciduous forest mixed forest water built up land and barren land because it was obtained by integrating the five relevant lulc datasets fig 2 and table 2 show the spatial distributions and areas by lulc type the miclu dataset differed significantly from the other datasets particularly in terms of the distributions and areas of forest barren land and grassland nludc yearly also differed from the others in that it contained one year lulc data that as can be seen from table 2 varied by type from year to year and therefore could not represent the lulc over multiple years thus yearly lulc data might be required for hydrologic modelling 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model description the swat model arnold et al 1998 which is one of the most widely used hydrologic models is sufficiently powerful for simulating nearly all watershed characteristics gassman et al 2007 li et al 2009 this study focused on only the hydrologic component of this model the swat model uses physical algorithms to estimate runoff by using input data comprised mainly of precipitation soil properties topography and lulc the model calculates runoff with the soil conservation service scs curve number equation abbaspour et al 2007 in addition to its use of topography land use and soil data swat can divide a watershed into hrus by breaking the main basin into smaller units by selecting points on the stream network that act as outlets in this manner the model can provide output data such as discharge at speciﬁc points along a river network as has been summarized the responses of each hru in terms of water sediment nutrient and pesticide transformations are determined individually and then aggregated at the sub basin level and routed to the associated reach and to the catchment outlet through the channel network arnold et al 1998 the hydrologic component of swat is based on the following water balance equation 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where s w t is the final soil water content mm h2o s w 0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is the elapsed time d r d a y is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o q s u r f is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o w s e e p is the amount of percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom on day i mm h2o and q g w is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o swat incorporates some of the most common hydrologic equations for ﬂow simulations accurate implementation of these equations requires accurate input data in the form of watershed dems and local soil lulc and climate data of particular importance in terms of lulc is the model s ability to compute surface runoff with the help of the scs curve arnold et al 1998 the model s database includes different lulc types each with an associated curve for antecedent soil moisture ii cnii values which can be assigned by the user to a modelled watershed 2 3 2 model setup in addition to lulc data swat model input data include topography soil hydrology and meteorology data over the selected watershed the dem derived topographic data are used to divide the watershed into sub basins each of which is assigned information on climate groundwater main channels streams and outlets within each sub basin swat identiﬁes hrus with different combinations of unique land cover soil type and slope information water balance computations are performed at the hru level of spatial discretisation with the contributions of each hru averaged to represent the water yield to the main channel water is then routed to the outlet of the watershed arnold et al 1998 li et al 2009 jin et al 2015 owing to the difficulty of obtaining yearly lulc data and shortcomings in the swat computational process the hydrologic process is simulated at one period per pass while multiple periods e g multiple years of lulc cannot be continuously simulated i e the swat model cannot seamlessly call lulc data on a year by year basis to assess model performance in simulating the hydrologic process based on the multiple year lulc data contained in the nludc yearly dataset we modified the methods used by the swat model to produce hrus fig 4 along with some of its computational steps the modified swat model identifies hrus by first overlaying yearly lulc data to obtain a map showing areas in which the lulc type changes by year this map is then overlaid with soil and slope maps to obtain yearly hrus for those with unchanging areas but changing lulc types finally a yearly loop function introduced under the amended swat structure fig 5 a is used to assign parameters for hrus in different years fig 5b note that under this modification the basic formulas used by the swat model remain unchanged arcgis 10 0 was used to derive input files for the modified swat model based on the following datasets for the study area 1 dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m fig 6 2 detailed soil map containing 97 types of soil with different hydraulic properties fig 6 derived from in situ observations of the hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density available water content and particle size distribution jin et al 2015 3 climatic data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures daily precipitation daily relative humidity daily solar radiation and daily wind speed at meteorological stations all climate data were obtained as daily averages and 4 ﬂow data at the yingluoxia hydrological station which was used to evaluate the model performance all of these datasets were provided by the environmental ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn the swat model was run from 2000 to 2009 at monthly and yearly intervals model performance in ﬁtting the observations was measured by using the following three objective functions according to moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ratio of the root mean square error rmse to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and the percent bias pbias the nse is used to measure the goodness of ﬁt the rsr standardises the rmse in terms of the standard deviation of the measured data and has an optimal value of zero the pbias is used to measure the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than observed data and is expressed as a percentage positive and negative values indicate model underestimation and overestimation bias respectively nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 according to moriasi et al 2007 model simulation of flow can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 the nse rsr and pbias are calculated as follows 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s 2 3 r s r i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s 2 4 p b i a s i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 100 i 1 n q o b s i where q o b s i is the observed value on day or month i q s i m i is the simulated value on day or month i and q o b s is the average of the observed data over the simulation period 3 results 3 1 changes in hrus the four datasets used in this study had significantly varying hru numbers and the numbers for the nludc yearly miclu nludc and nludc 1 km datasets corresponded to 2 276 1 460 1261 and 1310 hrus respectively 3 2 model performance during the runoff simulation the swat outputs for the four lulc datasets were compared both prior to and following calibration 3 2 1 before calibration fig 7 and table 3 show the results of the comparison of monthly and yearly runoff across four different lulc datasets prior to model calibration from fig 7a it can be seen that the simulated monthly runoffs for the four lulc datasets were similar no significant differences and that the simulated runoffs in winter were much lower than the observed values the nse values for the prediction of monthly runoff were 0 70 0 61 0 63 and 0 75 the rsr values were 0 54 0 62 0 61 and 0 50 and the pbias values were 0 16 0 99 1 00 and 0 85 for the miclu nludc nludc 1 km and nludc yearly datasets respectively table 3 the four datasets had similar pbias values which were all negative and between 10 the nludc yearly dataset had the best model performance with the highest nse and lowest rsr values it can be seen from fig 7c that the simulated yearly runoffs produced by the four lulc datasets followed similar trends with the nludc yearly datasets producing the highest runoff the miclu dataset had the lowest nse value 0 26 and the highest rsr value 0 85 for yearly runoff the nludc yearly dataset produced both the highest nse value and the lowest rsr value which indicates that this dataset performed best in simulating the yearly runoff without calibration 3 2 2 with calibration 3 2 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameters for a given watershed must be determined prior to the swat calibration process in this study we used streamflow data from 2000 to 2009 at the yingluoxia station to conduct a global sensitivity analysis which involves allowing all parameter values to change arnold et al 2012 table 4 shows the results of this sensitivity analysis for the miclu nludc and nludc 1 km datasets over the study area because two of the datasets had the same spatial resolution and lulc classifications we assumed that the nludc yearly dataset had the same sensitive parameters as the nludc dataset table 4 lists the top 10 sensitive parameters for the miclu dataset these were as follows cn2 slsubbsn ch k2 hru slp canmx gw revap esco alpha bf ch n2 and gwqmn where cn2 denotes the initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii slsubbsn is the average slope length m ch k2 is the effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel alluvium mm h hru slp is the average slope steepness m m canmx is the maximum canopy storage mm h2o gw revap is the groundwater revap coefficient esco is the soil evaporation compensation factor alpha bf is the base flow alpha factor 1 d ch n2 is manning s n value for the main channel and gwqmn is the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur mm h2o for the nludc dataset the 10 most sensitive parameters were as follows ch k2 esco ch n2 canmx hru slp slsubbsn cn2 smtmp tlaps and rchrg d where smtmp denotes the snow melt base temperature c tlaps is the temperature lapse rate c km and rchrg dp is the deep aquifer percolation fraction for the nludc dataset the 10 most sensitive parameters were as follows cn2 slsubbsn esco ch k2 hru slp canmx gw revap gw delay alpha bf and smtmp where gw delay is the groundwater delay time d 3 2 2 2 model calibration in this study we calibrate the model by multi step manual calibration method arnold et al 2012 following the sensitivity analysis it can be seen from fig 7b and table 4 that model performance in terms of estimating the monthly runoff was significantly improved for all four lulc datasets following model calibration all nse values were above 0 89 all rsr values were below 0 33 and all pbias values were within 10 in addition there were no significant differences among the monthly runoff values among the four datasets nludc yearly resulted in the best swat model performance for the monthly runoff with nse rse and pbias values of 0 92 0 28 and 0 72 respectively miclu resulted in the poorest performance with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 89 0 30 and 1 27 respectively it can be seen from fig 7d and table 4 that model performance in terms of estimating yearly runoff also improved following model calibration with nse values all above 0 72 rsr values all below 0 53 and pbias values all within 10 although the estimated differences in annual total runoff were broader than those in the monthly runoff case nludc yearly produced the best swat model performance for the yearly runoff with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 82 0 42 and 0 72 respectively miclu produced the worst model performance with nse rsr and pbias values of 0 72 0 53 and 1 27 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 impacts on the runoff modelling the uncalibrated model performances of all four datasets in terms of monthly and yearly runoff simulation were all precise because calibration masks differences between lulc datasets comparing the uncalibrated models enabled determination of how well each simulation predicted runoff prior to calibration as an indication of the effort required for calibration for each dataset and differences in the model prediction ability jin et al 2015 heathman et al 2008 also noted that hydrologic models in uncalibrated mode eliminate bias arising from parameter optimisation for the uncalibrated model the nludc yearly dataset had the best model performance which indicates that models built by this dataset will be easier to calibrate for simulating runoff than those built by the other datasets it was noted above that the runoff predictions for the non calibrated models showed that when using the four lulc datasets as input swat could accurately predict monthly and yearly runoff even prior to calibration however calibration generally improved the model performance in fact following calibration the performance achieved with each dataset during estimation of the monthly and yearly runoff improved significantly the nludc yearly dataset had the best post calibration swat model performance while the miclu dataset performed the worst the superior results of the nludc yearly dataset can potentially be ascribed to its particularly high spatial resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy as the dataset applies yearly intervals over the simulation period to better describe lulc changes within the study area by smoothing deviations over the input data the miclu dataset had more lulc types but lower spatial resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy than the other three datasets a large number of parameter combinations were required to verify that the model performance was different not only because of parameter modification but also because of the use of the different lulc datasets therefore we used the sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting algorithm sufi 2 of swat cup a calibration and uncertainty program for mathematical details please refer to abbaspour et al 2015 an auto calibration tool together with the range constrained sensitive parameters to calibrate swat the algorithm was run 20 000 times in total the results showed that the yearly lulc dataset corresponded to the best model performance and the miclu datatset corresponded to the worst model performance this suggests that use of an lulc dataset with high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and a reduced number of lulc type classifications can improve hydrologic model performance in simulating monthly and in particular yearly runoff when using only one year worth of lulc data furthermore the accuracy of results from multiple year lulc datasets with high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced lulc types can be improved by modifying the model to use yearly lulc data 4 2 impacts on the calculation complexity of the swat model an hru is an area with a uniform land use soil type and topography the delineation of hrus allows swat to consider the spatial heterogeneity of lulc and soils in a watershed for which the model carries out hydraulic and other calculations for various lulc datasets increasing the number of hrus is expected to increase the complexity of the simulation gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 for the four datasets the nludc yearly dataset had a much larger number of lulc patches than the other datasets this indicates that the nludc yearly corresponded to the greatest calculation complexity in addition hrus are lumped and there is no interaction among them in the swat model large numbers of hrus in this study may reduce the defects of lumped hrus however future research requires to consider interaction among hrus and setting a proper hru threshold is a necessary step similar studies reveal the impacts of lulc data on hydrological modelling chen et al 2005 kalyanapu et al 2009 but may fail to call for the lulc data year by year in this study the swat model is improved to call for multiple years of lulc data because human activities cause the lulc to change over time one year datasets can perform very poorly when generalizing the descriptions of lulc over multiple years the improvement of the swat model may reduce the defects of the original swat model and we find that if multiple years of lulc data exist a lulc dataset with smaller time intervals e g yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in swat to get a better model performance 5 conclusion the following important findings were made in this study 1 a yearly lulc dataset may result in a higher simulation complexity in the swat model because of the greater number of lulc patches 2 if multiple years of lulc data exist a lulc dataset with smaller time intervals e g yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in swat to get better model performance the model performance can be improved by 2 2 13 9 compared to one year lulc datasets 3 if only one year lulc datasets exist we suggest inputting a dataset with a high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced numbers of lulc classification types into swat to improve the hydrologic model performance with such an approach the model performance may improve by 1 1 6 9 compared to other one year lulc datasets acknowledgments this research was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of
