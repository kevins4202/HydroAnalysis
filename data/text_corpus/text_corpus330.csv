1650,agricultural contamination of groundwater with nitrate no3 is one of the most widespread and pressing environmental issues the preservation and planting of hedgerows around agricultural fields can reduce no3 flux but the efficacy of hedgerows depends on the amount of no3 in soil and groundwater hydrological flowpath and timing and biogeochemical conditions surrounding and below roots quantifying these parameters is a major challenge usually requiring involved and destructive fieldwork here we present a new analytical method to characterize no3 stratification using water chemistry sampled during piezometer slug tests we tested this method with a network of wells in a hillslope intersected by an oak hedgerow during high and low water conditions respectively spring and autumn we found that hedgerows had a strong seasonal effect on near surface no3 dynamics in the proximity of the root system reducing annual hillslope level fluxes by 26 to 63 comparable to no3 removal from cover crop techniques hedgerow root uptake accounted for two thirds of this reduction with the remaining third attributable to secondary effects potentially hedgerow induced microbial retention or denitrification due to increased organic carbon and heterogeneous redox conditions in the rooting zone however a simple scaling exercise suggested that at the catchment level hedgerow no3 removal has a smaller effect ca 1 10 reduction of annual flux due to the large legacy of no3 in the aquifer from past fertilizer application these results suggest that while hedgerows cannot immediately solve

contributing area for each of the clustered piezometers see houben et al 2018 for a quantitative comparison of methods to quantify the no3 removal capacity of hedgerows and address the methodological challenge of sampling piezometers we developed a new protocol for sampling and analyzing water chemistry in shallow wells we repeatedly sampled piezometer water chemistry during slug tests where water in the well casing was emptied then allowed to refill and used these curves to characterize gradients of no3 in soil water and groundwater with reactive transport modeling we tested this method for characterizing no3 profiles with a network of shallow wells in a hillslope intersected by an oak hedgerow we estimated how much of the observed no3 removal was due to hedgerow root uptake and quantified the potential impact of these processes on hillslope and catchment scale no3 flux specifically we were interested in the efficacy of hedgerows in reducing surface no3 inputs from current agricultural activity and historical no3 contamination of near surface groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study site is located in a 4 4 km2 agricultural catchment in western france fig 1a

mg l 1 abbott et al 2018 who 2007 since the 1950s the region surrounding the research catchment has been subject to intense agriculture with 90 of arable land cultivated for corn wheat and pastureland thomas et al 2016 the research catchment has a mix of these land use types and mean hedgerow coverage of approximately 2 the climate is temperate with average monthly temperature ranging from 17 5 c in july to 5 c in december mean annual precipitation of 720 mm and potential evapotranspiration pet of 620 mm thomas et al 2012 soils are approximately 1 2 m thick in the uplands and 0 6 m thick in the lowlands ghazavi et al 2008 the water table fluctuates seasonally from ca 2 to 4 m below the surface groundwater circulation is mainly constrained to a 30 to 100 m weathered layer underlain by schist bedrock kolbe et al 2016 marçais et al 2018 2 2 sampling design we installed 7 piezometer wells along a 28 m transect extending from an agricultural pasture to a riparian zone fig 1b hillslope monitoring was performed from september 1 2005 to december 31 2006 an oak hedgerow intersects the piezometer transect at the boundary between well drained upland soils and waterlogged wetland soils fig 1 ghazavi et al 2008 piezometer wells were named in relation to the hedgerow up for upslope of the hedgerow and dw for downslope followed by the distance from the hedgerow fig 1 table s1 piezometers were 4 5 or 7 5 m deep 68 or 112 mm in diameter and screened along the deepest 2 or 4 m fig 1 table s1 the differences in piezometer depth were to account for the topographical gradient between upslope and downslope portions of the transect and a consequence of accessibility the truck based drill was too heavy to reach the downslope sites which were drilled manually to test how seasonal differences in hydrology and biogeochemistry affect hedgerow no3 uptake and the applicability of this method we carried out slug tests in june and october of 2006 corresponding to high and low water periods the slug tests consisted of two phases fig 2 first we emptied the well with a portable pump koshin se 25f until the water level reached the bottom of the screened section of the piezometer which took approximately 20 min second we removed the pump and collected water samples as the well refilled with lateral flow from the surrounding aquifer and soil we monitored water level with a pressure transducer and collected a sample every 30 to 60 s until the groundwater level stabilized all samples were filtered to 0 45 μm with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane millipore and were stored at 4 c in the dark until analysis within two weeks samples were analyzed for no3 chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 by ion chromatography dionex dx 100 2 3 hydraulic properties we determined saturated hydraulic conductivity following hvorslev 1951 this analysis assumes a homogeneous isotropic infinite medium in which both the fluid and soil are incompressible the hvorslev formulation is 1 k s r w 2 ln l r b 2 lt l where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity rw is radius of the well l is height of screened part of the piezometer rb is radius of the borehole and t l is the time lag defined as 2 t l h t h 0 0 37 where ht is the variable water head measured during recovery period at time t and h0 is the water head at the time of maximum drawdown t0 in this case t at the end of the first phase saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is determined using eq 1 and the time lag is graphically estimated using eq 2 note that the difference between rw and rb is approximately 4 mm the thickness of the casing for each well we calculated horizontal flow discharge with measured parameters using eq 3 two dimensional hydraulics of unconfined flow can be calculated analytically assuming that equipotential surfaces are vertical and flow is essentially horizontal i e dupuit assumptions bear 1979 the two dimensional flow in a homogeneous domain is approximated by a one dimensional equation which can be solved analytically given appropriate boundary conditions for rectangular flow systems the equation for the discharge and phreatic surface is bear 1979 3 q π k s h 2 h 0 2 ln r a r w where q is the total discharge through the system ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h is the initial water head before pumping ra is the radius of influence and rw is radius of the well based on observations of drawdown during pumping from wells within 3 to 10 m we set the radius of influence to 10 m 2 4 saturated unsaturated flow model we used the measured and calculated parameters from the slug tests to calibrate a groundwater flow model using the finite element subsurface flow software feflow diersch 1988 diersch 2013 the model for variably saturated porous media was based on a continuum approach satisfying richards equation first we performed simulations of water and no3 uptake using a 2d hillslope model 82 m wide and 32 m deep fig 3a we fixed boundary conditions using a dirichlet boundary condition for the hydraulic head at the stream level h t and a neumann condition for the atmospheric net precipitation i e precipitation minus pet at the top of the flow domain we estimated stream stage as the difference in elevation between measured groundwater level in the wetland and stream bed hedgerow root uptake was parameterized with prior measurements from the site thomas et al 2012 root density profiles measured as root area per soil area are presented fig s1 based on the range of observed no3 concentration in the soil and groundwater we set the initial groundwater no3 c0 concentration at 100 mg l 1 the boundary condition concentration cbc net precipitation and stream water was also set to 100 mg l 1 to assess the seasonality of no3 transport and attenuation we simulated water and no3 transfer over a one year period from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2006 we compared model predictions with observed hydraulic head and no3 concentration for the spring and autumn field campaigns from the location situated 1 m upslope of the hedgerow up1 calculating water and no3 uptake from the field data and calculating discharge with eq 3 for the 2d model we used a homogenous flow domain with a porosity of 0 3 and a hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s 1 transpiration was set at 1 5 pet based on previous observations thomas et al 2012 given the typically high concentration of no3 we assumed root uptake was proportional to the water taken by roots i e passive uptake we then calculated the proportion of no3 removal due to denitrification or other processes referred to here as degradation by the difference between predicted and observed no3 concentrations based on the root uptake parameters from thomas et al 2012 we did two model runs one considering only no3 uptake and the other including no3 uptake and degradation sink c in fig 3a we calculated transit time using the particle tracking algorithm of feflow diersch 2013 particles injected at the top surface of the flow domain hillslope at a frequency of 1 particle per node to scale estimates of hedgerow no3 removal to the catchment we implemented a 3d model fig 3b with the same calibration and boundary conditions as the 2d model with an aquifer thickness of 30 m based on the observed extent of hedgerow influence we applied the water and no3 removal rates to a 5 m zone around the mapped hedgerow network fig 1a to explore the possible effect of increase or decrease in the hedgerow network we varied hedgerow coverage from 0 to 30 of total catchment area by changing the width of the existing network and calculated no3 removal for the hillslope and catchment scale near surface groundwater at to a 5 m depth and total groundwater to a 30 m depth as for the 2d model we ran the 3d model from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2006 3 results 3 1 hydraulic properties inferred from slug tests groundwater level dropped approximately 1 5 m between the high and low water slug tests fig 4 and table 1 smaller drawdowns were observed during the june test compared to the october test 2 9 6 9 m and 4 5 7 2 m respectively indicating enhanced shallow flow during the high water period compared to low water period especially for wells upslope of the hedgerow table 1 discharge refilling rate after pumping increased with groundwater depth for the upslope wells but remained low for downslope wells table 1 again suggesting preferential flow from shallow layers as predicted by eq 3 discharge increased monotonically with depth during the june test table 1 but showed dispersion during the october test table 1 suggesting non stationary flow rates after a long dry period 3 2 dynamic response of no3 during slug tests reveals hedgerow removal cl and so4 2 were generally stable across sites and during slug tests with mean concentrations of 67 mg l 1 and 53 mg l 1 respectively tables s3 and s4 ph and electrical conductivity also showed only minor variation during the slug tests tables s3 and s4 in contrast no3 concentration was substantially different between wells and changed dramatically during refilling of the wells closest to the hedgerow figs 5a 6a table s2 indicating hedgerow effects on no3 distribution in the soil column and near surface groundwater during the june slug test initial no3 concentration varied from 4 to 100 mg l 1 between wells with the lowest values in wells closest to the hedgerow fig 4a table s2 the lowest no3 concentrations occurred at the beginning of the recovery period coincident with high hydraulic gradient likely originating near the surface of the water table the 2d reactive transport simulation revealed strong vertical gradients of no3 in the soil and near surface groundwater below and upslope of the hedgerow fig 5b attributable to higher hydraulic conductivity upslope table 1 during the october test when the groundwater table was approximately 2 m lower no3 concentration varied less across wells and showed only minor variation during refilling fig 6a table s2 likely due to the disconnection of low no3 soil water flowpaths and the predominance of flow from high no3 groundwater the 2d simulation suggested a more diffuse and symmetrical zone of hedgerow influence but weaker no3 gradients in october fig 6b the annual simulation of no3 profiles accurately estimated spring no3 gradients but underestimated autumn gradients figs 7 and s3 though the overall trends were well represented fig 8 simulated no3 concentration below the root zone was very low nodes 1 and 2 uz in fig 7 in the deep aquifer groundwater concentration remained high 50 mg l 1 as the effect of near surface no3 uptake was outstripped by high concentration in the aquifer 3 3 hillslope water and no3 budgets based on the observed hydraulic properties the 2d flow model estimated 109 8 m3 annual water input including 40 m3 from precipitation and 69 8 m3 from stream flow table s5 though hedgerow coverage was only 15 of the modelled domain hedgerow transpiration accounted for 30 of atmospheric losses and 16 6 of total water losses including stream contributions the mean transit time of water in the hillslope was approximately 2 4 years with 50 of water spending less than one year in the hillslope and 80 of water spending 4 years in the hillslope fig s2a and b for the sites influenced by the hedgerow from 5 m downslope to 10 m upslope hydrological change was the primary driver of seasonal variation in no3 profiles fig 7 a decrease of no3 concentration was observed at all depths during high water fig 8a due to high connectivity between groundwater and the root system and increasing hedgerow evapotranspiration the measured no3 concentration profile in autumn was substantially higher than the predicted values figs 7 and s3 potentially due to higher no3 inputs a decrease in hedgerow transpiration prior to leaf senescence and hydrological disconnection of near surface and deeper groundwater during the low water period no3 concentration for shallow depths increased rapidly and stabilized at greater depths likely due to increased precipitation leaching surface no3 and the rising water table bringing groundwater no3 to the rooting zone at the hillslope scale the annual mass balance from 2d simulations integrating all depths and wells showed that no3 removal from root uptake is about 26 of total mass balance table s6 hedgerow root uptake could account for two thirds of this removal suggesting that the remaining third was due to other processes of no3 removal or immobilization such as denitrification or soil immobilization fig 9 3 4 scaling to the catchment using the mapped hedgerow network of the research catchment we scaled the no3 removal rates from the hillslope to the catchment level hedgerow root uptake and hedgerow induced denitrification reduced near surface no3 concentration causing stratification in the unsaturated zone and shallow part of the groundwater fig s4 the effect of hedgerows on annual no3 fluxes was directly proportional to the hedgerow network density and the considered aquifer depth i e 5 m or 30 m current hedgerow coverage 15 reduced no3 concentration in near surface groundwater to a 5 m depth and total groundwater to a 30 m depth by 1 annually fig s4 though hedgerows effectively reduced surface no3 inputs at the hillslope scale large groundwater volume and high no3 concentration from historical loading 132 000 kg no3 in the whole catchment meant that even with 30 coverage hedgerows would only reduce no3 pools by 2 2 and 15 annually for total and near surface groundwater respectively 4 discussion in this study we developed a new method for interpreting slug tests in near surface piezometers to quantify subsurface no3 profiles and estimate no3 removal by hedgerows we found that hedgerows had a strong seasonal effect on near surface no3 dynamics in their vicinity reducing hillslope level fluxes by 26 to 63 hedgerow no3 uptake accounted for two thirds of this reduction with the remaining third attributable to other processes potentially hedgerow induced denitrification from increased organic carbon and heterogeneous redox conditions grimaldi et al 2012 hedgerow effects were more modest at the catchment level 1 decrease in total catchment no3 annually due to the large amount of no3 in the aquifer from historical agricultural inputs these results suggest that while hedgerows cannot immediately solve problems of past groundwater contamination protection and reestablishment of hedgerow networks is effective at reducing new no3 inputs to groundwater which could substantially accelerate recovery of groundwater quality on decadal timescales considering both root uptake and other losses e g denitrification and immobilization no3 attenuation appears to persist beyond the period of active hedgerow growth for example the hedgerow in this study was mature but still had a strong attenuating effect on no3 concentration demonstrating that nitrogen input from hedgerow leaf litter was more than compensated by uptake and immobilization 4 1 direct and indirect hedgerow effects on no3 removal hedgerows directly and indirectly enhanced no3 removal in the soil unsaturated zone and near surface groundwater changes in spatial extent and temporal duration of this removal demonstrate how hydrological flowpaths interact with the distribution of carbon and nutrients to determine reaction rates abbott et al 2016 pinay et al 2018 throughout the season hedgerow effects were limited to the immediate vicinity of the hedgerow grimaldi et al 2012 thomas et al 2012 corresponding with the spatial extent of the hedgerow root system besides taking up water and no3 directly hedgerow roots can enhance no3 removal via three mechanisms first fine root biomass and root exudates are extremely biodegradable bakker et al 2009 and as the root network grows and contracts depending on water table position and photosynthetic activity of the trees root turnover and exudation provide a bioavailable carbon source for heterotrophic microorganisms including denitrifiers in most environments plants compete with microorganisms for nitrogen meaning plant nitrogen uptake often depresses denitrification abbott and jones 2015 pinay et al 2018 however in this environment where no3 is available in excess from polluted groundwater grimaldi et al 2012 hedgerow root carbon can stimulate denitrification throughout the season despite hedgerow nutrient uptake second because soil beneath and adjacent to hedgerows is not plowed soil aggregates can form in combination with higher organic carbon content from hedgerow roots aggregates accelerate the development of anoxic microsites where denitrification can occur pinay et al 2015 2018 finally hedgerow evapotranspiration and interception of precipitation increase preferential flow to the root zone ghazavi et al 2008 thomas et al 2008 sustaining no3 supply together these three phenomena provide the necessary conditions for denitrification a biodegradable carbon source anoxia and a no3 supply mcclain et al 2003 in our study this hedgerow induced denitrification may occur during the winter and spring when no3 rich groundwater inundated the rooting zone from the previous year 4 2 hedgerows complement other best management practices at the hillslope scale hedgerow coverage of 15 removed 63 of new no3 inputs to the groundwater this removal rate is at the high end of gains achieved with winter cover cropping one of the most common techniques for reducing nutrient leaching constantin et al 2010 because hedgerow restoration is an intervention carried out around fields rather than within them it is wholly compatible with cover cropping and these two techniques should be considered together as best practice at the catchment scale in a typical intensively cultivated catchment such as ours with ca 2 hedgerow coverage hedgerows cannot quickly reduce large groundwater no3 stocks however the influence of hedgerows at the catchment scale is directly proportional to their extent fig s5 while reducing pollutant loads is the proven first step towards effective mitigation of groundwater and surface water pollution seitzinger et al 2010 increasing catchment removal capacity with hedgerows and cover crops can enhance resilience to and recovery from agricultural disturbance 5 conclusion evaluation of no3 uptake remains a challenge because it depends on both hydrological flow and the subsurface profiles of no3 in the contributing area interpreting the change in concentration of no3 in piezometers during slug tests is an effective method to characterize hydrological parameters and no3 profiles complementing other more time consuming and destructive methods for measuring subsurface no3 using this new method in combination with numerical modeling we found that hedgerows efficiently reduced no3 in their root zone we hypothesized that the difference between total no3 removal and no3 uptake was due to denitrification scaled to the catchment and annual levels our findings suggest that hedgerows alone cannot solve no3 groundwater contamination but that in combination with decreased no3 loading realistic hedgerow coverages can accelerate water quality recovery substantially ultimately hedgerows have many benefits beyond nutrient removal baudry et al 2000 rowe et al 1999 and decisions regarding their protection and restoration should be made in consideration of all these

low water periods the slug tests consisted of two phases fig 2 first we emptied the well with a portable pump koshin se 25f until the water level reached the bottom of the screened section of the piezometer which took approximately 20 min second we removed the pump and collected water samples as the well refilled with lateral flow from the surrounding aquifer and soil we monitored water level with a pressure transducer and collected a sample every 30 to 60 s until the groundwater level stabilized all samples were filtered to 0 45 μm with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane millipore and were stored at 4 c in the dark until analysis within two weeks samples were analyzed for no3 chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 by ion chromatography dionex dx 100 2 3 hydraulic properties we determined saturated hydraulic conductivity following hvorslev 1951 this analysis assumes a homogeneous isotropic infinite medium in which both the fluid and soil are incompressible the hvorslev formulation is 1 k s r w 2 ln l r b 2 lt l where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity rw is radius of the well l is height of screened part of the piezometer rb is radius of the borehole and t l is the time lag defined as 2 t l h t h 0 0 37 where ht is the variable water head measured during recovery period at time t and h0 is the water head at the time of maximum drawdown t0 in this case t at the end of the first phase saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is determined using eq 1 and the time lag is graphically estimated using eq 2 note that the difference between rw and rb is approximately 4 mm the thickness of the casing for each well we calculated horizontal flow discharge with measured parameters using eq 3 two dimensional hydraulics of unconfined flow can be calculated analytically assuming that equipotential surfaces are vertical and flow is essentially horizontal i e dupuit assumptions bear 1979 the two dimensional flow in a homogeneous domain is approximated by a one dimensional equation which can be solved analytically given appropriate boundary conditions for rectangular flow systems the equation for the discharge and phreatic surface is bear 1979 3 q π k s h 2 h 0 2 ln r a r w where q is the total discharge through the system ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h is the initial water head before pumping ra is the radius of influence and rw is radius of the well based on observations of drawdown during pumping from wells within 3 to 10 m we set the radius of influence to 10 m 2 4 saturated unsaturated flow model we used the measured and calculated parameters from the slug tests to calibrate a groundwater flow model using the finite element subsurface flow software feflow diersch 1988 diersch 2013 the model for variably saturated porous media was based on a continuum approach satisfying richards equation first we performed simulations of water and no3 uptake using a 2d hillslope model 82 m wide and 32 m deep fig 3a we fixed boundary conditions using a dirichlet boundary condition for the hydraulic head at the stream level h t and a neumann condition for the atmospheric net precipitation i e precipitation minus pet at the top of the flow domain we estimated stream stage as the difference in elevation between measured groundwater level in the wetland and stream bed hedgerow root uptake was parameterized with prior measurements from the site thomas et al 2012 root density profiles measured as root area per soil area are presented fig s1 based on the range of observed no3 concentration in the soil and groundwater we set the initial groundwater no3 c0 concentration at 100 mg l 1 the boundary condition concentration cbc net precipitation and stream water was also set to 100 mg l 1 to assess the seasonality of no3 transport and attenuation we simulated water and no3 transfer over a one year period from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2006 we compared model predictions with observed hydraulic head and no3 concentration for the spring and autumn field campaigns from the location situated 1 m upslope of the hedgerow up1 calculating water and no3 uptake from the field data and calculating discharge with eq 3 for the 2d model we used a homogenous flow domain with a porosity of 0 3 and a hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s 1 transpiration was set at 1 5 pet based on previous observations thomas et al 2012 given the typically high concentration of no3 we assumed root uptake was proportional to the water taken by roots i e passive uptake we then calculated the proportion of no3 removal due to denitrification or other processes referred to here as degradation by the difference between predicted and observed no3 concentrations based on the root uptake parameters from thomas et al 2012 we did two model runs one considering only no3 uptake and the other including no3 uptake and degradation sink c in fig 3a we calculated transit time using the particle tracking algorithm of feflow diersch 2013 particles injected at the top surface of the flow domain hillslope at a frequency of 1 particle per node to scale estimates of hedgerow no3 removal to the catchment we implemented a 3d model fig 3b with the same calibration and boundary conditions as the 2d model with an aquifer thickness of 30 m based on the observed extent of hedgerow influence we applied the water and no3 removal rates to a 5 m zone around the mapped hedgerow network fig 1a to explore the possible effect of increase or decrease in the hedgerow network we varied hedgerow coverage from 0 to 30 of total catchment area by changing the width of the existing network and calculated no3 removal for the hillslope and catchment scale near surface groundwater at to a 5 m depth and total groundwater to a 30 m depth as for the 2d model we ran the 3d model from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2006 3 results 3 1 hydraulic properties inferred from slug tests groundwater level dropped approximately 1 5 m between the high and low water slug tests fig 4 and table 1 smaller drawdowns were observed during the june test compared to the october test 2 9 6 9 m and 4 5 7 2 m respectively indicating enhanced shallow flow during the high water period compared to low water period especially for wells upslope of the hedgerow table 1 discharge refilling rate after pumping increased with groundwater depth for the upslope wells but remained low for downslope wells table 1 again suggesting preferential flow from shallow layers as predicted by eq 3 discharge increased monotonically with depth during the june test table 1 but showed dispersion during the october test table 1 suggesting non stationary flow rates after a long dry period 3 2 dynamic response of no3 during slug tests reveals hedgerow removal cl and so4 2 were generally stable across sites and during slug tests with mean concentrations of 67 mg l 1 and 53 mg l 1 respectively tables s3 and s4 ph and electrical conductivity also showed only minor variation during the slug tests tables s3 and s4 in contrast no3 concentration was substantially different between wells and changed dramatically during refilling of the wells closest to the hedgerow figs 5a 6a table s2 indicating hedgerow effects on no3 distribution in the soil column and near surface groundwater during the june slug test initial no3 concentration varied from 4 to 100 mg l 1 between wells with the lowest values in wells closest to the hedgerow fig 4a table s2 the lowest no3 concentrations occurred at the beginning of the recovery period coincident with high hydraulic gradient likely originating near the surface of the water table the 2d reactive transport simulation revealed strong vertical gradients of no3 in the soil and near surface groundwater below and upslope of the hedgerow fig 5b attributable to higher hydraulic conductivity upslope table 1 during the october test when the groundwater table was approximately 2 m lower no3 concentration varied less across wells and showed only minor variation during refilling fig 6a table s2 likely due to the disconnection of low no3 soil water flowpaths and the predominance of flow from high no3 groundwater the 2d simulation suggested a more diffuse and symmetrical zone of hedgerow influence but weaker no3 gradients in october fig 6b the annual simulation of no3 profiles accurately estimated spring no3 gradients but underestimated autumn gradients figs 7 and s3 though the overall trends were well represented fig 8 simulated no3 concentration below the root zone was very low nodes 1 and 2 uz in fig 7 in the deep aquifer groundwater concentration remained high 50 mg l 1 as the effect of near surface no3 uptake was outstripped by high concentration in the aquifer 3 3 hillslope water and no3 budgets based on the observed hydraulic properties the 2d flow model estimated 109 8 m3 annual water input including 40 m3 from precipitation and 69 8 m3 from stream flow table s5 though hedgerow coverage was only 15 of the modelled domain hedgerow transpiration accounted for 30 of atmospheric losses and 16 6 of total water losses including stream contributions the mean transit time of water in the hillslope was approximately 2 4 years with 50 of water spending less than one year in the hillslope and 80 of water spending 4 years in the hillslope fig s2a and b for the sites influenced by the hedgerow from 5 m downslope to 10 m upslope hydrological change was the primary driver of seasonal variation in no3 profiles fig 7 a decrease of no3 concentration was observed at all depths during high water fig 8a due to high connectivity between groundwater and the root system and increasing hedgerow evapotranspiration the measured no3 concentration profile in autumn was substantially higher than the predicted values figs 7 and s3 potentially due to higher no3 inputs a decrease in hedgerow transpiration prior to leaf senescence and hydrological disconnection of near surface and deeper groundwater during the low water period no3 concentration for shallow depths increased rapidly and stabilized at greater depths likely due to increased precipitation leaching surface no3 and the rising water table bringing groundwater no3 to the rooting zone at the hillslope scale the annual mass balance from 2d simulations integrating all depths and wells showed that no3 removal from root uptake is about 26 of total mass balance table s6 hedgerow root uptake could account for two thirds of this removal suggesting that the remaining third was due to other processes of no3 removal or immobilization such as denitrification or soil immobilization fig 9 3 4 scaling to the catchment using the mapped hedgerow network of the research catchment we scaled the no3 removal rates from the hillslope to the catchment level hedgerow root uptake and hedgerow induced denitrification reduced near surface no3 concentration causing stratification in the unsaturated zone and shallow part of the groundwater fig s4 the effect of hedgerows on annual no3 fluxes was directly proportional to the hedgerow network density and the considered aquifer depth i e 5 m or 30 m current hedgerow coverage 15 reduced no3 concentration in near surface groundwater to a 5 m depth and total groundwater to a 30 m depth by 1 annually fig s4 though hedgerows effectively reduced surface no3 inputs at the hillslope scale large groundwater volume and high no3 concentration from historical loading 132 000 kg no3 in the whole catchment meant that even with 30 coverage hedgerows would only reduce no3 pools by 2 2 and 15 annually for total and near surface groundwater respectively 4 discussion in this study we developed a new method for interpreting slug tests in near surface piezometers to quantify subsurface no3 profiles and estimate no3 removal by hedgerows we found that hedgerows had a strong seasonal effect on near surface no3 dynamics in their vicinity reducing hillslope level fluxes by 26 to 63 hedgerow no3 uptake accounted for two thirds of this reduction with the remaining third attributable to other processes potentially hedgerow induced denitrification from increased organic carbon and heterogeneous redox conditions grimaldi et al 2012 hedgerow effects were more modest at the catchment level 1 decrease in total catchment no3 annually due to the large amount of no3 in the aquifer from historical agricultural inputs these results suggest that while hedgerows cannot immediately solve problems of past groundwater contamination protection and reestablishment of hedgerow networks is effective at reducing new no3 inputs to groundwater which could substantially accelerate recovery of groundwater quality on decadal timescales considering both root uptake and other losses e g denitrification and immobilization no3 attenuation appears to persist beyond the period of active hedgerow growth for example the hedgerow in this study was mature but still had a strong attenuating effect on no3 concentration demonstrating that nitrogen input from hedgerow leaf litter was more than compensated by uptake and immobilization 4 1 direct and indirect hedgerow effects on no3 removal hedgerows directly and indirectly enhanced no3 removal in the soil unsaturated zone and near surface groundwater changes in spatial extent and temporal duration of this removal demonstrate how hydrological flowpaths interact with the distribution of carbon and nutrients to determine reaction rates abbott et al 2016 pinay et al 2018 throughout the season hedgerow effects were limited to the immediate vicinity of the hedgerow grimaldi et al 2012 thomas et al 2012 corresponding with the spatial extent of the hedgerow root system besides taking up water and no3 directly hedgerow roots can enhance no3 removal via three mechanisms first fine root biomass and root exudates are extremely biodegradable bakker et al 2009 and as the root network grows and contracts depending on water table position and photosynthetic activity of the trees root turnover and exudation provide a bioavailable carbon source for heterotrophic microorganisms including denitrifiers in most environments plants compete with microorganisms for nitrogen meaning plant nitrogen uptake often depresses denitrification abbott and jones 2015 pinay et al 2018 however in this environment where no3 is available in excess from polluted groundwater grimaldi et al 2012 hedgerow root carbon can stimulate denitrification throughout the season despite hedgerow nutrient uptake second because soil beneath and adjacent to hedgerows is not plowed soil aggregates can form in combination with higher organic carbon content from hedgerow roots aggregates accelerate the development of anoxic microsites where denitrification can occur pinay et al 2015 2018 finally hedgerow evapotranspiration and interception of precipitation increase preferential flow to the root zone ghazavi et al 2008 thomas et al 2008 sustaining no3 supply together these three phenomena provide the necessary conditions for denitrification a biodegradable carbon source anoxia and a no3 supply mcclain et al 2003 in our study this hedgerow induced denitrification may occur during the winter and spring when no3 rich groundwater inundated the rooting zone from the previous year 4 2 hedgerows complement other best management practices at the hillslope scale hedgerow coverage of 15 removed 63 of new no3 inputs to the groundwater this removal rate is at the high end of gains achieved with winter cover cropping one of the most common techniques for reducing nutrient leaching constantin et al 2010 because hedgerow restoration is an intervention carried out around fields rather than within them it is wholly compatible with cover cropping and these two techniques should be considered together as best practice at the catchment scale in a typical intensively cultivated catchment such as ours with ca 2 hedgerow coverage hedgerows cannot quickly reduce large groundwater no3 stocks however the influence of hedgerows at the catchment scale is directly proportional to their extent fig s5 while reducing pollutant loads is the proven first step towards effective mitigation of groundwater and surface water pollution seitzinger et al 2010 increasing catchment removal capacity with hedgerows and cover crops can enhance resilience to and recovery from agricultural disturbance 5 conclusion evaluation of no3 uptake remains a challenge because it depends on both hydrological flow and the subsurface profiles of no3 in the contributing area interpreting the change in concentration of no3 in piezometers during slug tests is an effective method to characterize hydrological parameters and no3 profiles complementing other more time consuming and destructive methods for measuring subsurface no3 using this new method in combination with numerical modeling we found that hedgerows efficiently reduced no3 in their root zone we hypothesized that the difference between total no3 removal and no3 uptake was due to denitrification scaled to the catchment and annual levels our findings suggest that hedgerows alone cannot solve no3 groundwater contamination but that in combination with decreased no3 loading realistic hedgerow coverages can accelerate water quality recovery substantially ultimately hedgerows have many benefits beyond nutrient removal baudry et al 2000 rowe et al 1999 and decisions regarding their protection and restoration should be made in consideration of all these

1651,groundwater contamination from ethanol e g alternative fuels can support vigorous biodegradation with many possible reactions producing dissolved gases the objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the development and evolution of trapped gas phase changes occurring within an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation the experiment performed involved highly detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of gas phase saturations using time domain reflectometry probes embedded in a 2 dimensional 175 cm high 525 cm long synthetic aquifer homogeneous sand tank with horizontal groundwater flow ethanol injection immediately promoted gas producing reactions including fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction with methanogenesis developing between 69 and 109 days substantial in situ increases in trapped gas were observed over 330 days with maximum gas saturations reaching 27 of the pore volume despite sustained gas production this maximum was never exceeded likely due to the onset of gas phase mobilization i e ebullition upon reaching a buoyancy capillarity threshold reductions in the quasi saturated hydraulic conductivity resulting from the gas phase accumulation were restricted by ebullition to a factor of 2 but still appeared to alter the groundwater flow field overall trapped gas saturations exhibited high spatial and temporal variability including declines within the plume and increases outside of the plume influential factors included vertically shifting ethanol inputs and resultant secondary redox reactions microbial

examined biogenic gas production and associated trapped gas dynamics using small scale laboratory systems 100 cm in length under stagnant no flow conditions for instance istok et al 2007 measured increases in trapped gas saturations during denitrification in a 2 d glass flow cell packed with crushed limestone using a gamma imaging system the temporal images revealed that the expanding gas phase coalesced into larger ganglia before migrating upward through disconnected gas filled channels and out the top of the cell as a result the maximum gas saturations measured over experimental duration 14 days did not exceed 23 of the pore volume and had no significant impacts on sediment pack hydraulic conductivity based on manometer readings furthermore amos and mayer 2006a quantified ebullition from a 1 d sand column over 56 days using dissolved gas analysis and numerical modeling results demonstrated that 36 of the ch4 and 19 of the carbon dioxide co2 produced from an organic layer at the bottom of the column was rapidly transported to the top as a result of gas phase mobilization i e ebullition recently chong and mayer 2017 demonstrated gas exsolution and ebullition for both in situ chemical oxidation and enhanced biodegradation of trichloroethylene free phase solvent in source zone using a similar 1 d sand column they observed the associated stripping of volatile

distinguished a numerical model see amos and mayer 2006a 2006b though largely empirically based has also been employed for both lab and field based studies to better elucidate the effects of such gas phase behaviours on groundwater flow and aqueous biogeochemistry the primary objective of this study was to examine at a field representative scale under active flow conditions trapped gas changes within a groundwater plume of dissolved ethanol undergoing anaerobic biodegradation of particular interest was the pattern of biogenic gas production and associated gas phase dynamics including the potential for trapped gas mobilization i e ebullition all of which have not been fully investigated especially over larger spatial and temporal scales ethanol was targeted given its high potential for substantial gas production and its increasing use as a green biofuel though the results of this study have broader applications to biogenic gas production in groundwater plumes of other organic contaminants as well this experiment was implemented in a highly instrumented 2 dimensional 175 cm high 525 cm long pilot scale laboratory sand tank experimental conditions mimicked a homogeneous unconfined sand aquifer with horizontal groundwater flow and a residual gas phase following a rise in the water table in situ trapped gas saturations were directly and continually measured with time

relevant theory on gas phase dynamics with respect to the biodegradation of dissolved organics derived from petroleum and or ethanol fuel spills the microbial reactions with high gas producing potential occur under anaerobic conditions these reactions may include fermentation denitrification reduction of iron oxides and sulphate and methanogenesis table 1 the occurrence and distribution of these reactions within contaminant plumes will depend on the bioavailability of electron acceptors nutrients and organic substrates in addition to the predominant redox conditions and microbial ecology wiedemeier et al 1999 significant dissolved gas production associated with biodegradation can result in dissolved gas over saturation and lead to the formation and or expansion of an in situ trapped gas phase a brief synopsis of relevant gas phase processes in groundwater systems focusing on gas production but including trapped gas dissolution and the key controlling factors is provided here the expansion or dissolution of a trapped gas phase is controlled by the inter phase mass transfer between dissolved gases in the groundwater aqueous phase and the gas phase for an individual gas i at equilibrium its partial pressure in the gas phase p gi will be related to its dissolved concentration c gi as described by henry s law 1 k hi t s p gi r t c gi where r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and k hi is the gas dimensionless henry s law proportionality coefficient which is dependent on temperature t and salinity s but is otherwise constant it is apparent from eq 1 that an increase in c gi will induce mass transfer from the groundwater into the gas phase increasing p gi or vice versa equilibrium partitioning between the phases is more complicated when multiple gases are involved because equilibrium must be established for each individual gas species thus mass transfer of different gases may occur in opposite directions according to eq 1 and each gas specific k hi and c gi however these will be coupled through dalton s law which states that the total pressure of the trapped gas phase p g is equal to the sum of all the partial pressures of the gases present that is 2 p g p gi likewise the full suite of dissolved gases can be measured as the total dissolved gas pressure p tdg which is the sum of partial pressures of gases that would be in equilibrium with the concentrations of dissolved gases in the bulk aqueous phase for an existing trapped gas phase dissolution will occur if p tdg p g under saturation whereas expansion of the gas phase will occur if p tdg p g over saturation conditions of over saturation are typically expected in ethanol plumes given that they can sustain intensive biodegradation and dissolved gas production furthermore continued mass transfer and expansion can result in gas phase fragmentation and vertical mobilization i e ebullition as buoyancy forces surpass the local capillary forces that trap the gas phase in situ e g tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 roy and smith 2007 in groundwater systems trapped gas formation exsolution is believed to originate at pre existing microscopic seed bubbles that are maintained within imperfections of the solid grains or rock surfaces and act as nucleation sites jones et al 1999 exsolution is expected to occur when p tdg exceeds the bubbling pressure p g representing the assumed p g for a macroscopic bubble that would form within the larger pore space adjacent to those seed bubbles that is when p tdg p g li and yortsos 1995 jones et al 1999 inter phase mass transfer of the groundwater gas species including for exsolution will also be influenced by external forces that can alter p g and thus p g according to 3 p g p w p c p atm ρ g h σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 where p w water pressure is a function of the barometric pressure p atm the density of water ρ the acceleration due to gravity g and the hydraulic head h equal to the depth below the water table under hydrostatic conditions and where p c capillary pressure is related to the interfacial tension of water σ and the curvature of gas water interfaces where r 1 and r 2 represent the principal radii of curvature of the trapped gas ganglia which have a simplified ellipsoid shape following the young laplace equation for simplicity p c is commonly ignored or assumed to be negligible for coarse grained aquifers given the expected radii of the gas water interfaces manning et al 2003 klump et al 2007 2008 though this may potentially overestimate gas phase expansion or exsolution amos and mayer 2006b thus considering eq 3 gas phase exsolution and expansion should preferentially occur at shallower depths following declines in the water table and in coarser materials all else being equal finally gas water mass transfer can influence gas phase dynamics further along the groundwater flow path as equilibration between the phases regulates groundwater p tdg to match p g the chemical gradient for mass transfer at down gradient locations will be minimized especially under strict horizontal flow conditions thus gas water exchange in the up gradient quasi saturated zone will tend to inhibit trapped gas dissolution klump et al 2008 mcleod et al 2015 or growth including the potential for gas phase mobilization mumford et al 2009b at down gradient locations if dissolved gas production is negligible there 2 methods most of the set up and procedures of this experiment have been outlined in the companion paper mcleod et al 2018 except for the time domain

biodegradation linked geochemical changes that occurred in the tank following initial ethanol injection are thoroughly described and discussed in the companion paper to this work mcleod et al 2018 a brief synopsis of these observations is given here with a focus on those most relevant to dissolved gas production and gas phase dynamics first the formation of the ethanol plume was not vertically homogenous fig 2a during early times stage 1 up to day 126 it was mainly shallow with ethanol concentrations decreasing with depth while at later times stage 2 days 147 the plume was predominantly deep the time of the shift in plume position is termed the transition period or tp days 126 147 the suspected cause of the vertical variation in the distribution of injected ethanol is bioclogging around the iws but the reason for the shift i e transition period is unknown second aqueous geochemistry fig 2 and dissolved gas data total dissolved gas pressure p tdg in roy et al 2017 and dissolved gas composition shown in fig 3 illustrated rapid onset of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction and eventual widespread development of methanogenesis all of which were associated with ethanol plume biodegradation note ethanol oxidation by do reaction 2 table 1 was negligible since much of the available do was consumed in the ht via nitrification of nh4 reaction 1 table 1 increasing dissolved inorganic carbon dic speciated form of co2 concentrations indicate the production of carbon dioxide co2 product of several reactions see table 1 which is highly soluble kh at 25 c 3 4 10 4 mol l 1 kpa 1 refer to sander 1999 and subject to chemical speciation and thus was unlikely to drive substantial increases in p tdg and gas phase saturations hydrogen sulphide h2s produced from sulphate reduction reaction 7 table 1 was noticeable by smell in the laboratory but was not analyzed like co2 it too is quite soluble kh at 25 c 9 7 10 4 mol l 1 kpa 1 forms hs with pka 6 9 with limited potential to influence trapped gas dynamics on the other hand nitrate no3 removal in the ethanol plume was predominantly attributed to heterotrophic denitrification reaction 4 table 1 which commonly produces n2 a low solubility gas kh at 25 c 6 2 10 6 mol l 1 kpa 1 some no3 was also lost to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra reaction 5 table 1 see elevated nh4 in plume fig 2c on day 187 for example tied to ethanol degradation in stage 2 which does not produce n2 and likely limited n2 production at later times i e days 147 given the abundance of n2 in the source water its production was not apparent in the composition data fig 3 however a rapid increase in p tdg at mw1 immediately following initial ethanol injection was predominantly attributed to substantial n2 production roy et al 2017 fermentation of ethanol reaction 8 table 1 generated another poorly soluble gas h2 kh at 25 c 7 7 10 6 mol l 1 kpa 1 which is approximately 2 times less soluble than ch4 kh at 25 c 1 4 10 5 mol l 1 kpa 1 typically it is quickly scavenged for use in other common terminal electron accepting processes i e aerobic oxidation denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction but in this experiment it accumulated to notable levels reaching the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater up to 60 900 nm especially at mw1 during stage 1 day 67 in fig 3 mcleod et al 2018 suggested that these extreme h2 levels were the result of vigorous fermentation in the absence of terminal electron acceptors i e dissolved species o2 no3 and so4 2 and iron iii minerals previously exhausted by up gradient reactions with ethanol and prior to the onset of methanogenesis between days 69 109 reaction 9 in table 1 following this h2 levels decreased and ch4 was detected throughout the tank at steadily increasing concentrations over the remaining experimental duration fig 3 with a maximum concentration reaching 850 μm 13 6 mg l on day 300 lastly it appears that autotrophic denitrification e g reaction 3 table 1 utilized inorganic electron donors such as h2s and or iron sulphide minerals in this case to reduce no3 to n2 above the ethanol plume at shallow depths during stage 2 see declines in no3 and increases in so4 2 in fig 2b and e this process will be further discussed in section 3 3 overall throughout the experiment the inflowing groundwater sourced from the ht was significantly under saturated p tdg p g refer to roy et al 2017 due to nitrification reaction 1 table 1 of nh4 in the ht which consumed nearly all of the do thus dissolved gas production occurring with ethanol biodegradation and related autotrophic denitrification were needed to create favourable conditions i e p tdg p g recall section 1 1 for gas phase formation and or expansion within the synthetic aquifer 3 2 evolution of gas phase changes with ethanol biodegradation gas phase contents interpolated across the entire tank for the initial condition and several key times during the experiment are shown in fig 4a with similar plots for additional dates provided in the supporting information fig s3a cumulative changes in the gas phase over time were highlighted by plotting the net difference in gas saturations at a given time from the initial distribution day 37 measured prior to initial ethanol injection fig 4b also considered were the monthly rates of change in trapped gas saturations which reflect the change in saturation over a single pore volume of groundwater passed fig 4c note it is quite possible that the distributions in gas contents or saturations were more variable in space i e patchy especially along the length of the sand tank than portrayed in figs 4 and s3 by the contoured plots based on tdr point data as previously mentioned in section 2 0 the initial condition day 37 included a residual gas phase that was trapped in the sand upon initial wetting of the tank simulating a water table fluctuation but was then partly removed during the previous tank experiment on trapped gas dissolution mcleod et al 2015 a dissolution zone wedge shaped of near zero gas content was formed adjacent to the ht while within the persisting quasi saturated zone further down gradient the gas contents ranged from approximately 2 5 to 7 6 of the bulk volume note that prior to ethanol contamination between days 37 to 0 not shown here residual gas contents were still actively undergoing dissolution by the under saturated groundwater at several tdr locations following the pattern described in mcleod et al 2015 immediately following the start of ethanol injection increases in gas contents occurred at several tdr locations and were quite apparent within 2 6 pv of groundwater passed day 67 fig 4a and b throughout stage 1 this gas phase growth occurred in the upper section of the synthetic aquifer coinciding with the vertical positioning of the plume fig 2a and was largely confined to the area immediately down gradient of the ht 200 cm day 67 fig 4c these locations coincided with the near complete consumption of no3 and so4 2 that occurred mainly by the first monitoring array 70 cm down gradient of ht fig 2b and e where ethanol inputs were high suggesting this gas phase growth was driven by n2 predominantly and h2s minor production here fermentation likely contributed to trapped gas increases as well with peak h2 levels measured at mw1 during stage 1 fig 3 day 67 gas contents assuredly increased in the un instrumented area between the iws and the first tdr array i e between 30 and 70 cm down gradient of ht as well which likely contributed to the iw bioclogging issues down gradient of this shallow hotspot however the resulting absence of no3 and so4 2 further along the flow path fig 2b and e restricted gas phase increases there fig 4 in addition fermentation apparently diminished down gradient with h2 levels decreasing by a factor between 7 and 13 from mw1 and mw3 fig 3 day 67 further reducing the potential for gas phase increases there fermentation was likely stalled due to a p limitation as discussed in mcleod et al 2018 therefore restrictions on electron acceptor and nutrient availability inhibited ethanol biodegradation and ultimately gas phase dynamics within the plume during stage 1 unexpectedly sustained steady decreases in gas saturations were observed at several shallow locations within the actively biodegrading ethanol plume in amongst trapped gas growth depths 105 cm during stage 1 fig 4b and c the maximum decrease was 6 6 of the pore volume at 45 cm depth 155 cm down gradient of ht fig 4b day 67 the probable cause of these decreases was dissolution related to non horizontal downward flow in this area which will be discussed further in section 3 6 this dissolution ceased with the onset of methanogenesis and an increase in nutrient inputs just before the transition period fig s3 day 109 note that more gradual trapped gas dissolution was generally observed during stage 1 at depth 105 cm below the sand surface where ethanol concentrations were low fig 2a and biodegradation likely restricted following the first detections of low to moderate ch4 levels in all of the mws not shown rapid increases in trapped gas were observed throughout much of the synthetic aquifer 109 days fig s3c reaching saturation increases up to 4 per month indeed gas contents through the transition period days 126 147 and during stage 2 days 147 were substantially greater than in stage 1 figs 4 and s3 rising above their initial values over the majority of the sand tank fig 4b in accordance with the proliferation of methanogenesis during stage 2 throughout stage 2 gas phase growth was most predominant further down gradient in the synthetic aquifer i e 205 cm from ht fig 4c where ch4 levels were always greatest fig 3 which may reflect more vigorous methanogenesis there denitrification and sulphate reduction likely still contributed to gas phase growth at the up gradient end of the tank though now deeper fig 4b and c in line with the ethanol plume fig 2a b and e however competition for no3 by fermentative bacteria performing dnra no n2 end product reaction 5 in table 1 which only appeared during stage 2 mcleod et al 2018 likely limited n2 production via heterogeneous denitrification during this stage in fact trapped gas increases in this area of no3 consumption i e 70 cm from ht at depths 105 cm below the sand surface were very gradual with monthly rates of increase 1 of pore volume dissolved gas contributions from fermentation also likely diminished during stage 2 noting that the h2 levels were lower in stage 2 and declining over time fig 3 furthermore minor decreases in trapped gas content only occurred near the top of the synthetic aquifer where ethanol concentrations were low through stage 2 fig 2a at the up gradient end of the tank fig 4c increases in gas content at shallow depths further down gradient fig 4c but still above the ethanol plume fig 2a will be discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 by day 330 end of ethanol injection trapped gas saturations had increased by up to 11 of the pore volume compared to initial conditions fig 4b these increases returned trapped gas to the initially fully water saturated zone created during the previous tank study mcleod et al 2015 and raised gas contents to higher levels down gradient fig 4a however gas contents appeared to be limited to 9 5 of bulk volume 1 2 on average fig 4a even during continued biogenic gas production predominantly ch4 this likely indicates that vertical gas phase mobilization i e ebullition was preventing higher gas contents from accumulating locally ebullition will be revisited in more detail in section 3 4 as a result a zone of maximum gas contents 9 0 contour fig 4a days 213 300 developed approximately 320 cm down gradient of the ht eventually covering 25 of the tank length finally in the absence of ethanol days 330 declining gas saturations indicate the dissolution of the trapped gas by the passing of under saturated groundwater blue areas in fig 4c also see 135 cm probe 320 cm from ht in fig 5 with presumably minimal if any remaining biogenic gas production this dissolution occurred at many locations in the tank but was greatest along the bottom edge of the high gas content zone fig 4a further discussion on this focused area of dissolution is provided in section 3 6 3 3 alternative gas producing pathways not all of the observed increases in gas content likely resulted from dissolved gas produced by ethanol biodegradation reactions for example an increase in gas saturations was measured at shallow depths i e 75 cm during stage 2 e g day 187 fig 4c when the ethanol source was predominantly deep fig 2a this likely reflects some addition of gas from below via ebullition as discussed in section 3 4 however this location also experienced decreases in no3 fig 2b and no2 increases not shown mcleod et al 2018 coupled with so4 2 increases above source water conditions i e concentrations 300 μm approximately fig 2e which is suggestive of autotrophic denitrification of no3 using reduced sulphur species e g reaction 3 table 1 these sulphur species were likely created as a result of ethanol degradation under iron iii and sulphate reducing conditions when the plume was shallow in stage 1 mcleod et al 2018 thus this alternate process representing a secondary post plume redox reaction could be a potential source of dissolved gas for gas phase growth and ebullition that is only indirectly related to biodegradation and that could persist after ethanol contamination has diminished 3 4 evidence of ebullition there are several lines of evidence that suggest that ebullition was occurring within the pilot scale aquifer first as noted above in section 3 2 gas contents appeared to reach an upper limit e g 15 cm to 75 cm probes in fig 5 leading to a maximum gas content zone 9 0 contour in fig 4a days 213 330 despite sustained gas producing reactions both within the ethanol plume i e largely methanogenesis and beyond i e autotrophic denitrification in section 3 3 this maximum gas content level 9 5 1 2 of the bulk volume is consistent with reported critical gas saturations s cg representing the storage threshold for the onset of gas phase mobilization du and yortsos 1999 for coarse grained materials e g amos and mayer 2006b istok et al 2007 hegele and mumford 2014 homogeneous porous aquifer materials are unable to retain trapped gas volumes greater than the s cg because the local capillary forces that trap the gas ganglia in situ are exceeded by buoyancy forces tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 had the experiment and ethanol injection been extended indefinitely gas contents at many of the other tdr locations e g 105 cm 135 cm and 165 cm depths shown in fig 5 would likely have achieved the s cg eventually and as a result the maximum gas content zone fig 4a would have extended further throughout the synthetic aquifer second after the s cg was achieved at a given tdr location episodic oscillations in gas content above instrument variability 0 5 of the bulk volume were commonly observed e g 15 cm and 75 cm probes in fig 5 these often consisted of a more gradual rise followed by a sharp decline in gas contents that occurred over a time scale of hours this pattern is characteristic of an ebullition event that is the slower expansion of the gas phase due to dissolved gas production followed by rapid fragmentation and vertical mobilization of gas ganglia or loss of gas at a given location as observed by numerous laboratory studies e g roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 geistlinger et al 2006 roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a 2009b such sharp declines by 1 by volume or more are characteristic of ebullition in uniform coarse grained sands with low capillary pressure thresholds mumford et al 2009a and do not fit with dissolution which typically exhibits slow declines in gas contents occurring over weeks or more e g 135 cm depth after day 340 fig 5 also refer to the findings of mcleod et al 2015 it should be noted that the ability of tdr to resolve or capture the pore scale nature of ebullition was perhaps limited due to coarse log rates every 2 6 h and averaging along the full length of the probes 30 cm long which may have experienced multiple points of gas release or inputs from below at varying times furthermore gas contents generally did not exhibit characteristic oscillations indicative of ebullition prior to attaining the s cg fig 5 however some exceptions were observed for example the tdr probe at the 105 cm depth along the third in situ array 205 cm from ht showed oscillations around the time of the transition period days 100 200 fig 5 this may reflect a localized pocket of maximum gas content situated along only a partial section of that tdr probe as a result the measured gas content representing the average value along the full length of the tdr probe would be less than s cg but still reveal changes due to ebullition localized ebullition may result from spatially variable biodegradation and or heterogeneous sand packing around the probe the latter giving rise to an area with a lower capillary pressure threshold or s cg finally there are some suggestive signs that ebullition from below led to increases in gas content higher in the sand tank at locations outside of the ethanol plume and the autotrophic denitrification zone a prime example is the increasing gas saturations observed at shallow 15 45 cm depths at the down gradient end of the tank 450 cm from ht observed later in stage 2 days 213 in figs 4c and s3c the ethanol plume was in the bottom part of the synthetic aquifer during this stage fig 2a suggesting dissolved gas production via ethanol biodegradation should have been limited to depths 45 cm below the sand surface meanwhile autotrophic denitrification was occurring at shallow depths but at distances of 150 350 cm from the ht mcleod et al 2018 in addition several rapid increases in gas content were observed at shallow locations e g 15 cm depth fig 5 which may reflect gas phase inputs from ebullition below such inputs may also obscure gas content declines that would otherwise identify an ebullition event geistlinger et al 2006 mumford et al 2009a 2009b 3 5 changes in the hydraulic conductivity field the calculated reductions in hydraulic conductivity of the sand caused by the presence of the gas phase is illustrated in the plots of the relative hydraulic conductivity k r k qs k s prior to and at the end of the biodegradation experiment days 37 and 328 respectively fig 6 note that any compounding k r effects potentially associated with biodegradation such as microbial biomass build up and or mineral precipitation e g baveye et al 1998 were not considered in this study and thus reported changes in k r may have been underestimated the initial residual trapped gas phase meant that k r was below 0 95 throughout a large portion of the aquifer 16 out of 30 tdr probes with a minimum of nearly 0 60 at the onset of the experiment the k r field at day 330 when ethanol injection ceased displayed a similar spatial pattern but nearly all tdr locations had k r values below 0 95 29 out of 30 probes and a minimum k r of 0 47 was reached within the zone of maximum trapped gas contents indeed a value of approximately 0 50 was applicable to all locations that achieved the maximum gas content or the s cg the magnitude of the decrease in k r observed over this experiment i e from its initial to final value was constrained by several factors first gas accumulations were limited to areas of biogenic gas production both within the ethanol plume and the zone of autotrophic denitrification with limiting factors on both processes as described by mcleod et al 2018 and those areas above vigorous gas production where ebullition had commenced second this experiment had a limited temporal extent not quite 1 year where gas contents were still steadily increasing towards the s cg at many locations in the sand tank when ethanol injection ceased on day 330 fig 5 third the occurrence of ebullition at s cg restricted the maximum change in gas content i e from zero fully water saturated conditions to a maximum gas content of 9 5 and thus the maximum change in k r in this homogeneous coarse grained sand to a factor of 2 istok et al 2007 and jeen et al 2012 reported similar ebullition driven restrictions on the k r change in their laboratory experiments finally the pre existing residual trapped gas i e up to 7 5 of bulk volume day 37 in fig 4a from the previous tank experiment mcleod et al 2015 further restricted this maximum change in k r by setting a non zero initial condition at nearly half of the tdr locations ultimately within the zone of the fluctuating water table field changes in k r resulting from biogenic gas production will likely be limited by both persisting quasi saturation initial trapped gas and the maximum saturation threshold i e s cg associated with ebullition this should be applicable at many contaminated sites given that ethanol and other labile organic contaminants tend to form shallow groundwater plumes 3 6 altered groundwater flow previous studies have shown that k r differences of a similar magnitude as observed here factor of 2 though not overly large can still significantly alter groundwater flow patterns this results from reduced flow or flow bypassing in and around those areas with the lowest k r i e the highest gas saturations soares et al 1991 schroth et al 2001 amos and mayer 2006b in this experiment although the groundwater flow lines were not traced or modelled there was evidence of flow field distortion caused by the gas phase accumulations revealed by the gas phase dissolution patterns that developed after ethanol injection ceased for strict horizontal flow conditions dissolution is expected to occur only where the inflowing under saturated groundwater here sourced from the ht first contacts the trapped gas phase in this case that should be along a vertical plane just down gradient of the iws there the resultant mass transfer from the trapped gas should soon saturate the groundwater with dissolved gases assuming no substantial kinetics involved holocher et al 2003 mcleod et al 2015 raising the groundwater p tdg to p g because p g for trapped gas bubbles down gradient should be similar i e slightly lower p w perhaps slightly higher p c recall eq 3 then according to henry s law eq 1 there should be minimal drive for further dissolution indeed declining gas saturations along a vertical plane at the up gradient end of the tank was observed day 370 fig 4c however other areas further down gradient e g 135 cm depth 320 cm from the ht in fig 4c on day 370 also experienced dissolution and at greater rates along a sloping zone that matches the steepest changes in hydraulic conductivity i e tight k r contours fig 6b this dissolution pattern implies that downward refraction or deflection of the flow lines occurred at this low k zone boundary as this would result in p g increasing along the sub vertical flow path eq 3 allowing for continued dissolution i e continued increases in p tdg holocher et al 2003 klump et al 2008 interestingly trapped gas dissolution occurred during stage 1 within the ethanol plume in a zone where active biodegradation and dissolved gas production was occurring fig 4b on day 67 fig s3 recall section 3 2 for example the tdr at 45 cm depth 155 cm from ht showed continuous declines in gas saturation fig 4c on day 67 s3b and c on days 42 89 likewise the continuous tdr data for 45 cm depth probe at 205 cm from ht showed slow declines during this time fig 5 this observation may also be a result of the downward inflection of groundwater flow due to trapped gas build up in this area numerical modeling of groundwater flow considering gas phase entrapment would help better elucidate this phenomenon but was beyond the scope of this study 3 7 application to heterogeneous aquifers heterogeneity of natural porous media aquifers will introduce capillarity differences that will alter some of the gas phase patterns observed here in this homogeneous medium sand tank for instance because p c thresholds will tend to be higher as particle size and thus pore size distributions increase and grain sizes decrease tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 a greater increase in gas content to a higher s cg will likely be required before the onset of ebullition for both non uniform poorly sorted and layered sediments indeed finer grained horizontal lenses or layering can act as capillary barriers hindering gas phase ebullition into or through them over time substantial gas volumes can accumulate into gas phase pools on the underside of such capillary barriers e g glass et al 2000 creating significantly higher gas saturations than measured here these higher gas contents will lead to greater reductions in k r within the coarser materials in addition ebullition event gas volumes will likely be larger and the frequency of mobilization events likely lower as p c increases mumford et al 2008 under similar dissolved gas production rates deviations from this study s observations are likely to increase with added complexity of the heterogeneous material s which should receive additional study to clearly elucidate the gas phase behaviours 4 summary and conclusions these results directly show for the first time significant in situ gas phase development growth and ebullition stemming from gas producing organic contaminant here ethanol biodegradation reactions within field representative natural porous media gas phase saturations in the plume increased by up to 11 of the pore volume and showed substantial spatiotemporal variability including expected increases and surprising decreases this variability was largely controlled by the variation in the types of biodegradation reactions occurring which was itself dependent on electron acceptor and nutrient availability and potentially on acclimation periods mcleod et al 2018 other factors included the vertical position of the ethanol plume and enhanced gas phase dissolution supported by downward groundwater flow around the areas of higher gas contents gas phase growth also occurred outside the ethanol plume during stage 2 after it shifted down in the synthetic aquifer fueled by secondary redox reactions autotrophic denitrification in this case using leftover products from ethanol biodegradation during stage 1 such as h2s or sulphide minerals gas saturations never exceeded 27 of the pore volume or 9 5 1 2 of the bulk volume despite continued dissolved gas production this limit resulted from ebullition gas phase mobilization upward into the aquifer upon reaching a gas mobilization threshold the critical gas saturation s cg in heterogeneous aquifers capillary barriers may lead to higher saturation thresholds and affect the timing and direction of ebullition events further work is needed to investigate these differences however the general nature of trapped gas accumulation and ebullition seen here may provide insight into hydrocarbon vapour and biogenic gas transport in the subsurface with implications for air quality and explosion and asphyxiation risks at contaminated sites with ethanol or other highly degradable organics the calculated maximum reduction in relative hydraulic conductivity k r based on laboratory column results resulting from the increased gas contents in this homogeneous coarse grained sand i e from fully water saturated conditions to the s cg was restricted to a factor of 2 by ebullition and yet the limited reductions in k r still appeared to alter the groundwater flow field such gas induced flow by passing may impact source zone longevity schroth et al 2001 amos and mayer 2006b and remediation efforts at contaminated sites by diverting remediation fluids e g oxidants and nutrients and tracers away from target zones for example li and schwartz 2000 schroth et al 2001 for real world heterogeneous aquifers gas accumulations may be higher causing greater reductions in k r and greater flow by passing around these areas overall it is anticipated that an improved understanding of gas phase dynamics within biodegrading organic rich e g ethanol contaminant plumes and their associated impacts on hydraulic conductivity will be

1651,groundwater contamination from ethanol e g alternative fuels can support vigorous biodegradation with many possible reactions producing dissolved gases the objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the development and evolution of trapped gas phase changes occurring within an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation the experiment performed involved highly detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of gas phase saturations using time domain reflectometry probes embedded in a 2 dimensional 175 cm high 525 cm long synthetic aquifer homogeneous sand tank with horizontal groundwater flow ethanol injection immediately promoted gas producing reactions including fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction with methanogenesis developing between 69 and 109 days substantial in situ increases in trapped gas were observed over 330 days with maximum gas saturations reaching 27 of the pore volume despite sustained gas production this maximum was never exceeded likely due to the onset of gas phase mobilization i e ebullition upon reaching a buoyancy capillarity threshold reductions in the quasi saturated hydraulic conductivity resulting from the gas phase accumulation were restricted by ebullition to a factor of 2 but still appeared to alter the groundwater flow field overall trapped gas saturations exhibited high spatial and temporal variability including declines within the plume and increases outside of the plume influential factors included vertically shifting ethanol inputs and resultant secondary redox reactions microbial controls on redox zonation ebullition and altered groundwater flows these observations have implications for the transport of gases and volatile compounds within plumes and above the water table at

conductivity e g soares et al 1991 dror et al 2004 amos and mayer 2006b potentially affecting the longevity and remediation potential of the ethanol source zone several groundwater studies have examined biogenic gas production and associated trapped gas dynamics using small scale laboratory systems 100 cm in length under stagnant no flow conditions for instance istok et al 2007 measured increases in trapped gas saturations during denitrification in a 2 d glass flow cell packed with crushed limestone using a gamma imaging system the temporal images revealed that the expanding gas phase coalesced into larger ganglia before migrating upward through disconnected gas filled channels and out the top of the cell as a result the maximum gas saturations measured over experimental duration 14 days did not exceed 23 of the pore volume and had no significant impacts on sediment pack hydraulic conductivity based on manometer readings furthermore amos and mayer 2006a quantified ebullition from a 1 d sand column over 56 days using dissolved gas analysis and numerical modeling results demonstrated that 36 of the ch4 and 19 of the carbon dioxide co2 produced from an organic layer at the bottom of the column was rapidly transported to the top as a result of gas phase mobilization i e ebullition recently chong and mayer 2017 demonstrated gas exsolution and ebullition for both in situ chemical oxidation and enhanced biodegradation of trichloroethylene free phase solvent in source zone using a similar 1 d sand column they observed the associated stripping of volatile compounds and their upward transport to the vadose zone over 94 to 175 days gas phase formation and upward mobilization due to biogenic gas generation has also been inferred at hydrocarbon and ethanol

distinguished a numerical model see amos and mayer 2006a 2006b though largely empirically based has also been employed for both lab and field based studies to better elucidate the effects of such gas phase behaviours on groundwater flow and aqueous biogeochemistry the primary objective of this study was to examine at a field representative scale under active flow conditions trapped gas changes within a groundwater plume of dissolved ethanol undergoing anaerobic biodegradation of particular interest was the pattern of biogenic gas production and associated gas phase dynamics including the potential for trapped gas mobilization i e ebullition all of which have not been fully investigated especially over larger spatial and temporal scales ethanol was targeted given its high potential for substantial gas production and its increasing use as a green biofuel though the results of this study have broader applications to biogenic gas production in groundwater plumes of other organic contaminants as well this experiment was implemented in a highly instrumented 2 dimensional 175 cm high 525 cm long pilot scale laboratory sand tank experimental conditions mimicked a homogeneous unconfined sand aquifer with horizontal groundwater flow and a residual gas phase following a rise in the water table in situ trapped gas saturations were directly and continually measured with time domain reflectometry tdr probes while dissolved gas and aqueous geochemical analyses of the groundwater were used to monitor the biodegradation processes dissolved ethanol with minor amounts of methyl

ecology wiedemeier et al 1999 significant dissolved gas production associated with biodegradation can result in dissolved gas over saturation and lead to the formation and or expansion of an in situ trapped gas phase a brief synopsis of relevant gas phase processes in groundwater systems focusing on gas production but including trapped gas dissolution and the key controlling factors is provided here the expansion or dissolution of a trapped gas phase is controlled by the inter phase mass transfer between dissolved gases in the groundwater aqueous phase and the gas phase for an individual gas i at equilibrium its partial pressure in the gas phase p gi will be related to its dissolved concentration c gi as described by henry s law 1 k hi t s p gi r t c gi where r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and k hi is the gas dimensionless henry s law proportionality coefficient which is dependent on temperature t and salinity s but is otherwise constant it is apparent from eq 1 that an increase in c gi will induce mass transfer from the groundwater into the gas phase increasing p gi or vice versa equilibrium partitioning between the phases is more complicated when multiple gases are involved because equilibrium must be established for each individual gas species thus mass transfer of different gases may occur in opposite directions according to eq 1 and each gas specific k hi and c gi however these will be coupled through dalton s law which states that the total pressure of the trapped gas phase p g is equal to the sum of all the partial pressures of the gases present that is 2 p g p gi likewise the full suite of dissolved gases can be measured as the total dissolved gas pressure p tdg which is the sum of partial pressures of gases that would be in equilibrium with the concentrations of dissolved gases in the bulk aqueous phase for an existing trapped gas phase dissolution will occur if p tdg p g under saturation whereas expansion of the gas phase will occur if p tdg p g over saturation conditions of over saturation are typically expected in ethanol plumes given that they can sustain intensive biodegradation and dissolved gas production furthermore continued mass transfer and expansion can result in gas phase fragmentation and vertical mobilization i e ebullition as buoyancy forces surpass the local capillary forces that trap the gas phase in situ e g tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 roy and smith 2007 in groundwater systems trapped gas formation exsolution is believed to originate at pre existing microscopic seed bubbles that are maintained within imperfections of the solid grains or rock surfaces and act as nucleation sites jones et al 1999 exsolution is expected to occur when p tdg exceeds the bubbling pressure p g representing the assumed p g for a macroscopic bubble that would form within the larger pore space adjacent to those seed bubbles that is when p tdg p g li and yortsos 1995 jones et al 1999 inter phase mass transfer of the groundwater gas species including for exsolution will also be influenced by external forces that can alter p g and thus p g according to 3 p g p w p c p atm ρ g h σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 where p w water pressure is a function of the barometric pressure p atm the density of water ρ the acceleration due to gravity g and the hydraulic head h equal to the depth below the water table under hydrostatic conditions and where p c capillary pressure is related to the interfacial tension of water σ and the curvature of gas water interfaces where r 1 and r 2 represent the principal radii of curvature of the trapped gas ganglia which have a simplified ellipsoid shape following the young laplace equation for simplicity p c is commonly ignored or assumed to be negligible for coarse grained aquifers given the expected radii of the gas water interfaces manning et al 2003 klump et al 2007 2008 though this may potentially overestimate gas phase expansion or exsolution amos and mayer 2006b thus considering eq 3 gas phase exsolution and expansion should preferentially occur at shallower depths following declines in the water table and in coarser materials all else being equal finally gas water mass transfer can influence gas phase dynamics further along the groundwater flow path as equilibration between the phases regulates groundwater p tdg to match p g the chemical gradient for mass transfer at down gradient locations will be minimized especially under strict horizontal flow conditions thus gas water exchange in the up gradient quasi saturated zone will tend to inhibit trapped gas dissolution klump et al 2008 mcleod et al 2015 or growth including the potential for gas phase mobilization mumford et al 2009b at down gradient locations if dissolved gas production is negligible there 2 methods most of the set up and procedures of this experiment have been outlined in the companion paper mcleod et al 2018 except for the time domain

180 cm deep stainless steel sand tank fig 1 located at the canada centre for inland waters in burlington ontario canada each lane had an open reservoir or head tank ht 75 cm long located at one end

of dechlorinated tap water amended with nutrients nh4no3 and k2hpo4 which had their concentrations increased by a factor of 2 several months into the experiment i e on day 93 to prevent nutrient

ethanol injection are provided in mcleod et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of ethanol biodegradation and associated reactions the temporal development and spatial distribution of biodegradation linked geochemical changes that occurred in the tank following initial ethanol injection are thoroughly described and discussed in the companion paper to this work mcleod et al 2018 a brief synopsis of these observations is given here with a focus on those most relevant to dissolved gas production and gas phase dynamics first the formation of the ethanol plume was not vertically homogenous fig 2a during early times stage 1 up to day 126 it was mainly shallow with ethanol concentrations decreasing with depth while at later times stage 2 days 147 the plume was predominantly deep the time of the shift in plume position is termed the transition period or tp days 126 147 the suspected cause of the vertical variation in the distribution of injected ethanol is bioclogging around the iws but the reason for the shift i e transition period is unknown second aqueous geochemistry fig 2 and dissolved gas data total dissolved gas pressure p tdg in roy et al 2017 and dissolved gas composition shown in fig 3 illustrated rapid onset of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction and eventual widespread development of methanogenesis all of which were associated with ethanol plume biodegradation note ethanol oxidation by do reaction 2 table 1 was negligible since much of the available do was consumed in the ht via nitrification of nh4 reaction 1 table 1 increasing dissolved inorganic carbon dic speciated form of co2 concentrations indicate the production of carbon dioxide co2 product of several reactions see table 1 which is highly soluble kh at 25 c 3 4 10 4 mol l 1 kpa 1 refer to sander 1999 and subject to chemical speciation and thus was unlikely to drive substantial increases in p tdg and gas phase saturations hydrogen sulphide h2s produced from sulphate reduction reaction 7 table 1 was noticeable by smell in the laboratory but was not analyzed like co2 it too is quite soluble kh at 25 c 9 7 10 4 mol l 1 kpa 1 forms hs with pka 6 9 with limited potential to influence trapped gas dynamics on the other hand nitrate no3 removal in the ethanol plume was predominantly attributed to heterotrophic denitrification reaction 4 table 1 which commonly produces n2 a low solubility gas kh at 25 c 6 2 10 6 mol l 1 kpa 1 some no3 was also lost to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra reaction 5 table 1 see elevated nh4 in plume fig 2c on day 187 for example tied to ethanol degradation in stage 2 which does not produce n2 and likely limited n2 production at later times i e days 147 given the abundance of n2 in the source water its production was not apparent in the composition data fig 3 however a rapid increase in p tdg at mw1 immediately following initial ethanol injection was predominantly attributed to substantial n2 production roy et al 2017 fermentation of ethanol reaction 8 table 1 generated another poorly soluble gas h2 kh at 25 c 7 7 10 6 mol l 1 kpa 1 which is approximately 2 times less soluble than ch4 kh at 25 c 1 4 10 5 mol l 1 kpa 1 typically it is quickly scavenged for use in other common terminal electron accepting processes i e aerobic oxidation denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction but in this experiment it accumulated to notable levels reaching the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater up to 60 900 nm especially at mw1 during stage 1 day 67 in fig 3 mcleod et al 2018 suggested that these extreme h2 levels were the result of vigorous fermentation in the absence of terminal electron acceptors i e dissolved species o2 no3 and so4 2 and iron iii minerals previously exhausted by up gradient reactions with ethanol and prior to the onset of methanogenesis between days 69 109 reaction 9 in table 1 following this h2 levels decreased and ch4 was detected throughout the tank at steadily increasing concentrations over the remaining experimental duration fig 3 with a maximum concentration reaching 850 μm 13 6 mg l on day 300 lastly it appears that autotrophic denitrification e g reaction 3 table 1 utilized inorganic electron donors such as h2s and or iron sulphide minerals in this case to reduce no3 to n2 above the ethanol plume at shallow depths during stage 2 see declines in no3 and increases in so4 2 in fig 2b and e this process will be further discussed in section 3 3 overall throughout the experiment the inflowing groundwater sourced from the ht was significantly under saturated p tdg p g refer to roy et al 2017 due to nitrification reaction 1 table 1 of nh4 in the ht which consumed nearly all of the do thus dissolved gas production occurring with ethanol biodegradation and related autotrophic denitrification were needed to create favourable conditions i e p tdg p g recall section 1 1 for gas phase formation and or expansion within the synthetic aquifer 3 2 evolution of gas phase changes with ethanol biodegradation gas phase contents interpolated across the entire tank for the initial condition and several key times during the experiment are shown in fig 4a with similar plots for additional dates provided in the supporting information fig s3a cumulative changes in the gas phase over time were highlighted by plotting the net difference in gas saturations at a given time from the initial distribution day 37 measured prior to initial ethanol injection fig 4b also considered were the monthly rates of change in trapped gas saturations which reflect the change in saturation over a single pore volume of groundwater passed fig 4c note it is quite possible that the distributions in gas contents or saturations were more variable in space i e patchy especially along the length of the sand tank than portrayed in figs 4 and s3 by the contoured plots based on tdr point data as previously mentioned in section 2 0 the initial condition day 37 included a residual gas phase that was trapped in the sand upon initial wetting of the tank simulating a water table fluctuation but was then partly removed during the previous tank experiment on trapped gas dissolution mcleod et al 2015 a dissolution zone wedge shaped of near zero gas content was formed adjacent to the ht while within the persisting quasi saturated zone further down gradient the gas contents ranged from approximately 2 5 to 7 6 of the bulk volume note that prior to ethanol contamination between days 37 to 0 not shown here residual gas contents were still actively undergoing dissolution by the under saturated groundwater at several tdr locations following the pattern described in mcleod et al 2015 immediately following the start of ethanol injection increases in gas contents occurred at several tdr locations and were quite apparent within 2 6 pv of groundwater passed day 67 fig 4a and b throughout stage 1 this gas phase growth occurred in the upper section of the synthetic aquifer coinciding with the vertical positioning of the plume fig 2a and was largely confined to the area immediately down gradient of the ht 200 cm day 67 fig 4c these locations coincided with the near complete consumption of no3 and so4 2 that occurred mainly by the first monitoring array 70 cm down gradient of ht fig 2b and e where ethanol inputs were high suggesting this gas phase growth was driven by n2 predominantly and h2s minor production here fermentation likely contributed to trapped gas increases as well with peak h2 levels measured at mw1 during stage 1 fig 3 day 67 gas contents assuredly increased in the un instrumented area between the iws and the first tdr array i e between 30 and 70 cm down gradient of ht as well which likely contributed to the iw bioclogging issues down gradient of this shallow hotspot however the resulting absence of no3 and so4 2 further along the flow path fig 2b and e restricted gas phase increases there fig 4 in addition fermentation apparently diminished down gradient with h2 levels decreasing by a factor between 7 and 13 from mw1 and mw3 fig 3 day 67 further reducing the potential for gas phase increases there fermentation was likely stalled due to a p limitation as discussed in mcleod et al 2018 therefore restrictions on electron acceptor and nutrient availability inhibited ethanol biodegradation and ultimately gas phase dynamics within the plume during stage 1 unexpectedly sustained steady decreases in gas saturations were observed at several shallow locations within the actively biodegrading ethanol plume in amongst trapped gas growth depths 105 cm during stage 1 fig 4b and c the maximum decrease was 6 6 of the pore volume at 45 cm depth 155 cm down gradient of ht fig 4b day 67 the probable cause of these decreases was dissolution related to non horizontal downward flow in this area which will be discussed further in section 3 6 this dissolution ceased with the onset of methanogenesis and an increase in nutrient inputs just before the transition period fig s3 day 109 note that more gradual trapped gas dissolution was generally observed during stage 1 at depth 105 cm below the sand surface where ethanol concentrations were low fig 2a and biodegradation likely restricted following the first detections of low to moderate ch4 levels in all of the mws not shown rapid increases in trapped gas were observed throughout much of the synthetic aquifer 109 days fig s3c reaching saturation increases up to 4 per month indeed gas contents through the transition period days 126 147 and during stage 2 days 147 were substantially greater than in stage 1 figs 4 and s3 rising above their initial values over the majority of the sand tank fig 4b in accordance with the proliferation of methanogenesis during stage 2 throughout stage 2 gas phase growth was most predominant further down gradient in the synthetic aquifer i e 205 cm from ht fig 4c where ch4 levels were always greatest fig 3 which may reflect more vigorous methanogenesis there denitrification and sulphate reduction likely still contributed to gas phase growth at the up gradient end of the tank though now deeper fig 4b and c in line with the ethanol plume fig 2a b and e however competition for no3 by fermentative bacteria performing dnra no n2 end product reaction 5 in table 1 which only appeared during stage 2 mcleod et al 2018 likely limited n2 production via heterogeneous denitrification during this stage in fact trapped gas increases in this area of no3 consumption i e 70 cm from ht at depths 105 cm below the sand surface were very gradual with monthly rates of increase 1 of pore volume dissolved gas contributions from fermentation also likely diminished during stage 2 noting that the h2 levels were lower in stage 2 and declining over time fig 3 furthermore minor decreases in trapped gas content only occurred near the top of the synthetic aquifer where ethanol concentrations were low through stage 2 fig 2a at the up gradient end of the tank fig 4c increases in gas content at shallow depths further down gradient fig 4c but still above the ethanol plume fig 2a will be discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 by day 330 end of ethanol injection trapped gas saturations had increased by up to 11 of the pore volume compared to initial conditions fig 4b these increases returned trapped gas to the initially fully water saturated zone created during the previous tank study mcleod et al 2015 and raised gas contents to higher levels down gradient fig 4a however gas contents appeared to be limited to 9 5 of bulk volume 1 2 on average fig 4a even during continued biogenic gas production predominantly ch4 this likely indicates that vertical gas phase mobilization i e ebullition was preventing higher gas contents from accumulating locally ebullition will be revisited in more detail in section 3 4 as a result a zone of maximum gas contents 9 0 contour fig 4a days 213 300 developed approximately 320 cm down gradient of the ht eventually covering 25 of the tank length finally in the absence of ethanol days 330 declining gas saturations indicate the dissolution of the trapped gas by the passing of under saturated groundwater blue areas in fig 4c also see 135 cm probe 320 cm from ht in fig 5 with presumably minimal if any remaining biogenic gas production this dissolution occurred at many locations in the tank but was greatest along the bottom edge of the high gas content zone fig 4a further discussion on this focused area of dissolution is provided in section 3 6 3 3 alternative gas producing pathways not all of the observed increases in gas content likely resulted from dissolved gas produced by ethanol biodegradation reactions for example an increase in gas saturations was measured at shallow depths i e 75 cm during stage 2 e g day 187 fig 4c when the ethanol source was predominantly deep fig 2a this likely reflects some addition of gas from below via ebullition as discussed in section 3 4 however this location also experienced decreases in no3 fig 2b and no2 increases not shown mcleod et al 2018 coupled with so4 2 increases above source water conditions i e concentrations 300 μm approximately fig 2e which is suggestive of autotrophic denitrification of no3 using reduced sulphur species e g reaction 3 table 1 these sulphur species were likely created as a result of ethanol degradation under iron iii and sulphate reducing conditions when the plume was shallow in stage 1 mcleod et al 2018 thus this alternate process representing a secondary post plume redox reaction could be a potential source of dissolved gas for gas phase growth and ebullition that is only indirectly related to biodegradation and that could persist after ethanol contamination has diminished 3 4 evidence of ebullition there are several lines of evidence that suggest that ebullition was occurring within the pilot scale aquifer first as noted above in section 3 2 gas contents appeared to reach an upper limit e g 15 cm to 75 cm probes in fig 5 leading to a maximum gas content zone 9 0 contour in fig 4a days 213 330 despite sustained gas producing reactions both within the ethanol plume i e largely methanogenesis and beyond i e autotrophic denitrification in section 3 3 this maximum gas content level 9 5 1 2 of the bulk volume is consistent with reported critical gas saturations s cg representing the storage threshold for the onset of gas phase mobilization du and yortsos 1999 for coarse grained materials e g amos and mayer 2006b istok et al 2007 hegele and mumford 2014 homogeneous porous aquifer materials are unable to retain trapped gas volumes greater than the s cg because the local capillary forces that trap the gas ganglia in situ are exceeded by buoyancy forces tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 had the experiment and ethanol injection been extended indefinitely gas contents at many of the other tdr locations e g 105 cm 135 cm and 165 cm depths shown in fig 5 would likely have achieved the s cg eventually and as a result the maximum gas content zone fig 4a would have extended further throughout the synthetic aquifer second after the s cg was achieved at a given tdr location episodic oscillations in gas content above instrument variability 0 5 of the bulk volume were commonly observed e g 15 cm and 75 cm probes in fig 5 these often consisted of a more gradual rise followed by a sharp decline in gas contents that occurred over a time scale of hours this pattern is characteristic of an ebullition event that is the slower expansion of the gas phase due to dissolved gas production followed by rapid fragmentation and vertical mobilization of gas ganglia or loss of gas at a given location as observed by numerous laboratory studies e g roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 geistlinger et al 2006 roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a 2009b such sharp declines by 1 by volume or more are characteristic of ebullition in uniform coarse grained sands with low capillary pressure thresholds mumford et al 2009a and do not fit with dissolution which typically exhibits slow declines in gas contents occurring over weeks or more e g 135 cm depth after day 340 fig 5 also refer to the findings of mcleod et al 2015 it should be noted that the ability of tdr to resolve or capture the pore scale nature of ebullition was perhaps limited due to coarse log rates every 2 6 h and averaging along the full length of the probes 30 cm long which may have experienced multiple points of gas release or inputs from below at varying times furthermore gas contents generally did not exhibit characteristic oscillations indicative of ebullition prior to attaining the s cg fig 5 however some exceptions were observed for example the tdr probe at the 105 cm depth along the third in situ array 205 cm from ht showed oscillations around the time of the transition period days 100 200 fig 5 this may reflect a localized pocket of maximum gas content situated along only a partial section of that tdr probe as a result the measured gas content representing the average value along the full length of the tdr probe would be less than s cg but still reveal changes due to ebullition localized ebullition may result from spatially variable biodegradation and or heterogeneous sand packing around the probe the latter giving rise to an area with a lower capillary pressure threshold or s cg finally there are some suggestive signs that ebullition from below led to increases in gas content higher in the sand tank at locations outside of the ethanol plume and the autotrophic denitrification zone a prime example is the increasing gas saturations observed at shallow 15 45 cm depths at the down gradient end of the tank 450 cm from ht observed later in stage 2 days 213 in figs 4c and s3c the ethanol plume was in the bottom part of the synthetic aquifer during this stage fig 2a suggesting dissolved gas production via ethanol biodegradation should have been limited to depths 45 cm below the sand surface meanwhile autotrophic denitrification was occurring at shallow depths but at distances of 150 350 cm from the ht mcleod et al 2018 in addition several rapid increases in gas content were observed at shallow locations e g 15 cm depth fig 5 which may reflect gas phase inputs from ebullition below such inputs may also obscure gas content declines that would otherwise identify an ebullition event geistlinger et al 2006 mumford et al 2009a 2009b 3 5 changes in the hydraulic conductivity field the calculated reductions in hydraulic conductivity of the sand caused by the presence of the gas phase is illustrated in the plots of the relative hydraulic conductivity k r k qs k s prior to and at the end of the biodegradation experiment days 37 and 328 respectively fig 6 note that any compounding k r effects potentially associated with biodegradation such as microbial biomass build up and or mineral precipitation e g baveye et al 1998 were not considered in this study and thus reported changes in k r may have been underestimated the initial residual trapped gas phase meant that k r was below 0 95 throughout a large portion of the aquifer 16 out of 30 tdr probes with a minimum of nearly 0 60 at the onset of the experiment the k r field at day 330 when ethanol injection ceased displayed a similar spatial pattern but nearly all tdr locations had k r values below 0 95 29 out of 30 probes and a minimum k r of 0 47 was reached within the zone of maximum trapped gas contents indeed a value of approximately 0 50 was applicable to all locations that achieved the maximum gas content or the s cg the magnitude of the decrease in k r observed over this experiment i e from its initial to final value was constrained by several factors first gas accumulations were limited to areas of biogenic gas production both within the ethanol plume and the zone of autotrophic denitrification with limiting factors on both processes as described by mcleod et al 2018 and those areas above vigorous gas production where ebullition had commenced second this experiment had a limited temporal extent not quite 1 year where gas contents were still steadily increasing towards the s cg at many locations in the sand tank when ethanol injection ceased on day 330 fig 5 third the occurrence of ebullition at s cg restricted the maximum change in gas content i e from zero fully water saturated conditions to a maximum gas content of 9 5 and thus the maximum change in k r in this homogeneous coarse grained sand to a factor of 2 istok et al 2007 and jeen et al 2012 reported similar ebullition driven restrictions on the k r change in their laboratory experiments finally the pre existing residual trapped gas i e up to 7 5 of bulk volume day 37 in fig 4a from the previous tank experiment mcleod et al 2015 further restricted this maximum change in k r by setting a non zero initial condition at nearly half of the tdr locations ultimately within the zone of the fluctuating water table field changes in k r resulting from biogenic gas production will likely be limited by both persisting quasi saturation initial trapped gas and the maximum saturation threshold i e s cg associated with ebullition this should be applicable at many contaminated sites given that ethanol and other labile organic contaminants tend to form shallow groundwater plumes 3 6 altered groundwater flow previous studies have shown that k r differences of a similar magnitude as observed here factor of 2 though not overly large can still significantly alter groundwater flow patterns this results from reduced flow or flow bypassing in and around those areas with the lowest k r i e the highest gas saturations soares et al 1991 schroth et al 2001 amos and mayer 2006b in this experiment although the groundwater flow lines were not traced or modelled there was evidence of flow field distortion caused by the gas phase accumulations revealed by the gas phase dissolution patterns that developed after ethanol injection ceased for strict horizontal flow conditions dissolution is expected to occur only where the inflowing under saturated groundwater here sourced from the ht first contacts the trapped gas phase in this case that should be along a vertical plane just down gradient of the iws there the resultant mass transfer from the trapped gas should soon saturate the groundwater with dissolved gases assuming no substantial kinetics involved holocher et al 2003 mcleod et al 2015 raising the groundwater p tdg to p g because p g for trapped gas bubbles down gradient should be similar i e slightly lower p w perhaps slightly higher p c recall eq 3 then according to henry s law eq 1 there should be minimal drive for further dissolution indeed declining gas saturations along a vertical plane at the up gradient end of the tank was observed day 370 fig 4c however other areas further down gradient e g 135 cm depth 320 cm from the ht in fig 4c on day 370 also experienced dissolution and at greater rates along a sloping zone that matches the steepest changes in hydraulic conductivity i e tight k r contours fig 6b this dissolution pattern implies that downward refraction or deflection of the flow lines occurred at this low k zone boundary as this would result in p g increasing along the sub vertical flow path eq 3 allowing for continued dissolution i e continued increases in p tdg holocher et al 2003 klump et al 2008 interestingly trapped gas dissolution occurred during stage 1 within the ethanol plume in a zone where active biodegradation and dissolved gas production was occurring fig 4b on day 67 fig s3 recall section 3 2 for example the tdr at 45 cm depth 155 cm from ht showed continuous declines in gas saturation fig 4c on day 67 s3b and c on days 42 89 likewise the continuous tdr data for 45 cm depth probe at 205 cm from ht showed slow declines during this time fig 5 this observation may also be a result of the downward inflection of groundwater flow due to trapped gas build up in this area numerical modeling of groundwater flow considering gas phase entrapment would help better elucidate this phenomenon but was beyond the scope of this study 3 7 application to heterogeneous aquifers heterogeneity of natural porous media aquifers will introduce capillarity differences that will alter some of the gas phase patterns observed here in this homogeneous medium sand tank for instance because p c thresholds will tend to be higher as particle size and thus pore size distributions increase and grain sizes decrease tsimpanogiannis and yortsos 2004 a greater increase in gas content to a higher s cg will likely be required before the onset of ebullition for both non uniform poorly sorted and layered sediments indeed finer grained horizontal lenses or layering can act as capillary barriers hindering gas phase ebullition into or through them over time substantial gas volumes can accumulate into gas phase pools on the underside of such capillary barriers e g glass et al 2000 creating significantly higher gas saturations than measured here these higher gas contents will lead to greater reductions in k r within the coarser materials in addition ebullition event gas volumes will likely be larger and the frequency of mobilization events likely lower as p c increases mumford et al 2008 under similar dissolved gas production rates deviations from this study s observations are likely to increase with added complexity of the heterogeneous material s which should receive additional study to clearly elucidate the gas phase behaviours 4 summary and conclusions these results directly show for the first time significant in situ gas phase development growth and ebullition stemming from gas producing organic contaminant here ethanol biodegradation reactions within field representative natural porous media gas phase saturations in the plume increased by up to 11 of the pore volume and showed substantial spatiotemporal variability including expected increases and surprising decreases this variability was largely controlled by the variation in the types of biodegradation reactions occurring which was itself dependent on electron acceptor and nutrient availability and potentially on acclimation periods mcleod et al 2018 other factors included the vertical position of the ethanol plume and enhanced gas phase dissolution supported by downward groundwater flow around the areas of higher gas contents gas phase growth also occurred outside the ethanol plume during stage 2 after it shifted down in the synthetic aquifer fueled by secondary redox reactions autotrophic denitrification in this case using leftover products from ethanol biodegradation during stage 1 such as h2s or sulphide minerals gas saturations never exceeded 27 of the pore volume or 9 5 1 2 of the bulk volume despite continued dissolved gas production this limit resulted from ebullition gas phase mobilization upward into the aquifer upon reaching a gas mobilization threshold the critical gas saturation s cg in heterogeneous aquifers capillary barriers may lead to higher saturation thresholds and affect the timing and direction of ebullition events further work is needed to investigate these differences however the general nature of trapped gas accumulation and ebullition seen here may provide insight into hydrocarbon vapour and biogenic gas transport in the subsurface with implications for air quality and explosion and asphyxiation risks at contaminated sites with ethanol or other highly degradable organics the calculated maximum reduction in relative hydraulic conductivity k r based on laboratory column results resulting from the increased gas contents in this homogeneous coarse grained sand i e from fully water saturated conditions to the s cg was restricted to a factor of 2 by ebullition and yet the limited reductions in k r still appeared to alter the groundwater flow field such gas induced flow by passing may impact source zone longevity schroth et al 2001 amos and mayer 2006b and remediation efforts at contaminated sites by diverting remediation fluids e g oxidants and nutrients and tracers away from target zones for example li and schwartz 2000 schroth et al 2001 for real world heterogeneous aquifers gas accumulations may be higher causing greater reductions in k r and greater flow by passing around these areas overall it is anticipated that an improved understanding of gas phase dynamics within biodegrading organic rich e g ethanol contaminant plumes and their associated impacts on hydraulic conductivity will be

1652,due to the widespread application of persulphate ps for in situ chemical oxidation isco the ps activating role of naturally occurring minerals such as iron oxides has been the subject of a number of studies however major discrepancies remain as to the effectiveness mode and factors that influence iron oxides activation of ps in this study an attempt has been made to bridge this important knowledge gaps by a systematic study of ps activation measured by orange g degradation using commercial and self synthesised magnetite maghemite and haematite particles the results showed that the activation of ps by iron oxides does not depend on mineralogy surface area or concentration of surface oh groups but on crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities significant dissolution of iron oxides accompanied ps activation in a mainly homogeneous process requiring a low ph environment to be effective the activation of ps by iron oxides at neutral ph was found to be no better than dissolved iron activation contrary to some earlier publications the results also suggest that under alkaline conditions ps alone was more effective in degrading orange g than with iron oxides or dissolved iron activation phosphate buffer significantly retarded orange g degradation by iron activated or unactivated ps with negative implication for isco in non acidic buffering environments the results of this study contribute to enhancing the fundamental understanding of isco processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate iron oxide in situ chemical oxidation crystalline inhomogeneities mineralogy surface area abbreviations isco in situ chemical oxidation ms saturation magnetisation og orange g ps persulphate ssa specific surface area 1 introduction within the last two decades the application of persulphate ps for in situ chemical oxidation isco of pollutants in subsurface environments has attracted significant practical and research attention this is due to the ability of ps to oxidise a variety of contaminants tsitonaki et al 2010 devi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 consequently the role of naturally occurring minerals such as iron oxides in activating ps to produce the reactive sulphate radical so4 has been the subject of a number of experimental investigations these investigations were aimed at improving the efficiency of ps isco for the remediation of subsurface contaminations wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 the higher selectivity and the limited reaction with the natural organic matter of so4 compared to the hydroxyl radical ho commonly produced from h2o2 is one reason for the increasing interest in ps isco ahmed et al 2012 ike et al 2018a avetta et al 2015 however under certain conditions so4 may be substantially converted to ho lutze et al 2015 liang and su 2009 iron oxides have also been advanced as substitutes for soluble ferrous ion fe2 in the activation of ps reduced consumption of ps and circumneutral activation are cited as advantages of iron oxides over dissolved fe wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 ike et al 2017a despite the progress made in understanding the mechanisms of iron oxides activation of ps ding et al ding et al 2017 maintained that there are still important unresolved questions one of which is whether the activation of ps by iron oxides is mainly heterogeneous or homogeneous in homogeneous activation soluble fe derived from the dissolution of the original iron oxide is principally responsible for ps activation where ps activation arises primarily from the interaction between the oxidant and the surfaces of the oxide particles with or without some iron dissolution the activation process is described as heterogeneous homogeneous processes are limited to conditions where soluble fe is stable i e conditions in which substantial dissolved fe precipitation does not occur typically acidic conditions while heterogeneous processes are not dependent on dissolved fe stability in solution consequently homogeneous processes are effective only in acidic environments while the effectiveness of heterogeneous processes is less dependent on ph as the ph in subsurface environments may not always be acidic a knowledge of whether iron oxide activation of persulphate is principally heterogeneous or principally homogeneous is important in evaluating iron oxide contribution to the effectiveness of ps isco processes another unresolved question is whether the ps activation ability of a particular iron oxide is influenced more by the synthesis route and local crystalline defects than by mineralogy ding et al 2017 to illustrate usman et al usman et al 2012 suggested that feii bearing iron oxides such as magnetite may be more effective in activating ps compared to feiii oxides such as haematite an assertion that may be supported by fe2 faster activation of ps compared to fe3 rodriguez et al 2014 however the results published by do et al do et al 2010 showed that haematite was more effective in activating ps measured by a target pollutant degradation compared to magnetite under the same condition particle concentration 8 3 g l ph 3 ps concentration 500 mm on the one hand ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 reported 60 degradation of nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane after 3 days 3 d by ps activated by haematite particle specific surface area ssa 28 m2 g particle concentration 400 g l ph 6 3 or 13 12 ps concentration 500 mm on the other an almost complete degradation of fluorenone was reported by usman et al usman et al 2012 after only 50 h due to oxidisation by ps under magnetite activation particle concentration 10 g l ph circumneutral ps concentration 130 mm see section s 1 in the supplementary material for the computation of the concentrations a still more rapid degradation was reported by yan et al yan et al 2011 according to the report sulfamonomethoxine was almost completely degraded in 2 min by ps activated by magnetite nanoparticles computed ssa using particle size ike et al 2017b 78 m2 g particle concentration 0 6 g l ph 6 4 ps concentration 1 8 mm it may be appreciated from the ssa values and the concentrations supplied that for instance surface area cannot explain the difference in the degradation periods reported by ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 and yan et al yan et al 2011 even when consideration is made for the difference in experimental conditions borggaard o k borggaard 1983 demonstrated that mineralogy does not seem to affect certain physical and chemical properties of iron oxides such as surface charge hydroxyl buffering fluoride and phosphate adsorption capacities it is therefore important to carry out controlled experiments to determine the impact of mineralogy and other properties of iron oxides such as ssa on ps activation understanding the factors that influence the effectiveness and duration of pollutant degradation under iron oxide activated ps oxidation is crucial for the development of a better description of ps isco processes as well as a more complete explanation of wastewater treatment schemes this study is a first pass qualitative assessment of the effects of crystalline phase feii content particle size the degree of sintering hydroxyl group concentration and surface coating by co existing minerals on ps activation by iron oxides the specific aims embrace the advancement of a greater understanding of the modes homogeneous or heterogeneous and effectiveness of ps activation by the three common iron oxides magnetite maghemite and haematite for this purpose both commercial and self synthesised iron oxide particles were evaluated with respect to their effectiveness in activating ps the extent of ps activation was measured by the degree of orange g og degradation decolourisation and mineralisation the particle synthesis involved a stepwise modification of a base material to limit the effects of synthesis variability og a typical azo dye although not a common groundwater contaminant was chosen for this study as its degradation behaviour under the influence of activated ps is fairly established ike et al 2017a rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 and its colour provides for a convenient analysis this is to focus the research on the effects of the iron oxides and the reaction environment nevertheless og as an azo dye still remains an important environmental contaminant in its own right due largely to the popularity of azo dyes in the textile industry and because og is structurally similar to more toxic azo dyes such as o aminoazotoluene ike et al 2017a drumond chequer et al 2013 2 methods milli q water and analytical grade chemicals were used throughout the study the iron oxide particles and their modifications used in this study are summarised in table 1 magnetite nanoparticles were synthesised according to a method already published ike et al 2017b three sets of black powders hereafter referred to as s1 s2 and s3 were produced by varying the ageing time of the nanoparticles under atmospheric conditions for 1 min 2 h and 10 h respectively the ageing was done to produce magnetite powders with varying degrees of surface oxidation the aim was to evaluate the effect of surface oxidation feii content on the effectiveness of magnetite activation of ps to compare the activation potential of magnetite to the other common iron oxides maghemite and haematite s2 was oxidised according to a literature procedure cornell and schwertmann 2003 a portion of the black s2 powder was subjected to air oxidation at 250 c for 5 h in a muffle furnace which resulted in the production of a brownish red maghemite powder cornell and schwertmann 2003 the maghemite powder is hereafter referred to as s4 an oxidation of a portion of the s2 sample at 500 c for 5 h produced a red haematite powder cornell and schwertmann 2003 which is hereafter referred to as s5 to determine whether the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of an iron oxide play a role in ps activation a portion of s5 was subjected to a further thermal treatment at 800 c for 5 h the heat treated powder is hereafter referred to as s6 such heat treatment results in irreversible sintering of particles and removal of surface hydroxyl groups cornell and schwertmann 2003 an attempt was also made to increase the concentration of the surface hydroxyl groups on a portion of s5 by boiling in milli q water the boiling lasted for 5 h the aim of the boiling was to hydroxylate some oxo bonds that may have been formed during the initial production of s5 at a temperature of 500 c cornell and schwertmann 2003 the tentatively hydroxylated powder is referred to as s7 hereafter to assess the potential effect of iron oxide particles being coated by soil minerals a portion of the s2 sample was coated with silica according to a published procedure ike et al 2017b the silica coated s2 sample is referred to as s8 subsequently in this paper calcium carbonate coating was also applied on a portion of the s2 sample because carbonate minerals abound in the environment to apply the carbonate coating a wet portion of the s2 sample was placed in a flask to which 100 mm nahco3 and 180 mm nacl solutions were added a solution of 300 mm naoh was gently added to the mixture under rapid stirring a solution of 100 mm cacl2 was added dropwise to precipitate caco3 on s2 as s9 babou kammoe et al 2012 sanciolo et al 2008 three commercial iron oxide samples were also evaluated in this study a commercial magnetite nanopowder from aldrich 637106 with a specified size range of 50 100 nm was designated as s10 s11 represents another commercial magnetite powder from aldrich 310069 with a manufacturer s specified size of 5 μm a commercial maghemite nanopowder from aldrich 544884 with a specified particle size of 50 nm will hereafter be referred to as s12 the surface area and morphology of particles were characterised by n2 adsorption which was conducted using a micrometrics tristar surface area and porosity analyzer with a tristar 3000 version 6 04 analysis software powders were degassed at 105 c for 24 h for the analysis magnetometric data at room temperature was acquired using a riken denshi vibrating sample magnetometer vsm for the magnetic parameter measurement a given portion of an iron oxide sample was embedded in a plastic holder using epoxy adhesive a measurement was taken after solidification colourimetric studies of the particles were conducted using a chroma meter cr 400 konica minolta sensing powders for colourimetric measurements were placed in a transparent plastic bag and positioned under the measuring head of the chroma meter an empty transparent plastic bag was placed over the supplied calibrating plate before instrument calibrations colourimetric measurements were in the cielab cartesian system in which lightness is measured by l ranges from 0 for pure black to 100 for white and hue and saturation are quantified by chromatic a ranges from a for green to a for red and chromatic b ranges from b for blue to b for yellow cornell and schwertmann 2003 micrographs of s2 were obtained using a jeol jem 2100 transmission electron microscope tem operated at 200 kv and 101 μa for tem imaging a portion of a dry s2 sample was embedded in araldite resin the embedded sample was ultramicrotomed to nanometre thick sections before being placed on formvar coated copper grids the sample preparation was to ensure sample stability during imaging attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopic study was conducted using a perkin elmer ftir spectrometer with universal atr diamond znse crystals ftir scans from 4000 to 600 cm 1 at 64 accumulations and a resolution of 2 cm 1 were collected the degradation study was conducted using a 0 1 mm og solution initial ps concentration was 10 mm for all experiments except where otherwise stated 0 1 g l iron oxide was used for ps activation compared to some of the concentrations reported in the studies reviewed in the introduction the concentrations of ps and iron oxide used in this study is relatively low the lower concentrations were chosen to reflect the observation that restrained diffusion under subsurface conditions significantly reduces ps availability ike et al 2018a and the observation that the available mineral for ps activation in real soil is relatively small ahmad et al 2010 the diffusion of ps is restrained due to the finite permeability of subsurface rock materials resulting in the slow migration of the oxidant and radicals when compared to the lifespan of the radicals hence especially when an activator is introduced alongside ps the concentration of the oxidant radicals away from the injection well may be significantly lower than the concentrations close to the well concentrations of ps comparable to the amount used in this study has also been reported in previous works yan et al 2011 chen et al 2016 the degradation experiments were conducted under ambient laboratory temperature condition of 24 c in an orbital shaker borosilicate glass beads were added to ensure adequate stirring of the iron oxide suspensions 1 ml samples were withdrawn at specified intervals collected samples were filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters into microtubes the microtubes contain 0 5 ml methanol to quench the radical reactions to evaluate the effects of ph on the activation of ps experiments were conducted with suitable ph modifications of the orange g solution with or without the addition of 10 mm phosphate serving as a ph buffer lutze et al 2015 ike et al 2018b the extent of og decolourisation in the collected samples was measured spectrophotometrically at the azo bond characteristic absorption wavelength of 478 nm ike et al 2017a a biochrom libra s22 uv visible spectrophotometer was used for the measurement the extent of mineralisation was evaluated by measuring the total carbon tc content of collected samples using a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer for tc measurement samples were quenched in an ice bath ike et al 2017a the concentration of total fe in a solution was measured using a shimadzu plasma atomic spectrometer icp e 9000 after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe filter the ph of solutions and suspensions was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions as required average values of at least duplicate measurements are reported the degradation results are presented in the manuscript without error bars to make the identification of symbols easier the relevant figures with error bars representing standard errors of at least duplicate experiments are reproduced in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterisation the summarised descriptions and the colour of the particles studied are presented in table 1 magnetite is typically black in colour maghemite brown or brownish red and haematite red cornell and schwertmann 2003 hence based on the colour of the particles as seen by the unaided eye table 1 shows that the particles produced correspond to the expected mineralogy the bet ssas for the particles studied are shown in fig 1 the n2 adsorption desorption plots all showing type iv isotherms with monolayer multilayer adsorption trends and narrow hysteric loops characteristic of slightly mesoporous materials sing et al 1985 are presented in the supplementary material figs s 1 s 2 s 3 following the conclusion of kirillov kirillov 2009 that any dispersed solid with ssa exceeding 30 m2 g is nanoparticulate s1 s2 s3 s4 and s12 are considered nanoparticles other samples are considered microparticles the ssa fig 1 and n2 adsorption desorption plots fig s 1 for s1 s2 s3 and s4 are similar but are markedly different from the ssa and n2 adsorption desorption plot for s5 these results imply that s2 oxidation at 250 c to give s4 did not result in a significant morphological change consistent with the literature cornell and schwertmann 2003 but the production of s5 from s2 by oxidation at 500 c did hence based on the similarity of their ssa and n2 adsorption isotherms s1 s2 s3 and s4 is considered morphologically similar nanoparticles further heat treatment at 800 c of s5 resulted in reduced ssa for s6 implying particle sintering sintering is preceded by the loss of surface hydroxyl groups which is replaced by oxo bonds cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 consequently the higher ssa of s7 compared to s5 is tentatively interpreted as an increase in the number of surface hydroxyl groups in s7 due to the boiling of s5 in water cornell and schwertmann 2003 both s8 silica coated and s9 calcium carbonate coated particles produced from s2 exhibited reduced ssa the reduction in ssa following coating had been attributed to the coating of aggregated particles ike et al 2017b the xrd patterns in fig 2a show characteristics magnetite maghemite peaks as expected the distinguishing maghemite peaks is best developed in s4 as this sample was subjected to a treatment known to produce maghemite cornell and schwertmann 2003 compared to s1 and s2 s3 shows a slightly more pronounced characteristic maghemite peaks suggesting that the extended ageing time of 10 h resulted in more surface oxidation fig 2b shows well developed haematite peaks for s5 s6 and s7 these results support the conclusion that the heat treatments of s5 as described in the experimental section did not result in a phase change consistent with the literature data cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 calcium carbonate and magnetite peaks were observed in fig 2c as was expected for s9 which was the magnetite sample s2 coated with calcium carbonate the xrd and ftir characterisations of the silica coated particles s8 showing silica coating on magnetite have been previously published ike et al 2017b colour may be used to distinguish between various iron oxide phases cornell and schwertmann 2003 the colour of a particular iron oxide sample is determined not only by the mineralogy of the sample but also by the morphological properties cornell and schwertmann 2003 however as s1 s2 s3 and s4 are morphologically similar as argued above differences in their colourimetric parameters are strongly phase dependent table 2 shows the colourimetric and magnetic properties of s1 s2 s3 and s4 the low a and b values of s1 and s2 is consistent with the achromatic black colour of magnetite which is indicative of limited surface oxidation of s1 and s2 these results corroborate the interpretation of the xrd patterns of fig 2a the slightly higher chromatic parameters of s3 are indicative of a greater surface oxidation the significantly higher a and b parameters for s4 are consistent with a maghemite phase magnetite and maghemite are both ferrimagnetic minerals with high room temperature saturation magnetisation ms compared to other iron oxides the ms of bulk magnetite is about 82 100 am2 kg cornell and schwertmann 2003 but magnetite nanoparticles may have a value of only 68 am2 kg mahmed et al 2014 the lower ms values of nanoparticles have been attributed to the canting of the surface spins goya et al 2003 the ms value of bulk maghemite ranges between 60 and 80 am2 kg but nanoparticles may have a reduced value of 34 50 am2 kg mahmed et al 2014 s4 with fully developed maghemite properties has a lower ms compared to s1 s2 and s3 the lower ms value of s3 compared to s1 and s2 is consistent with the proposed greater oxidation of s3 due to extended ageing in air the xrd colourimetric and magnetic analyses all point to a more magnetite property for s1 and s2 compared to s3 s4 exhibits clear maghemite features this conclusion implies that s1 and s2 have a greater proportion of feii compared to s3 and s4 the tem image of s2 which was the base material for the production of several of the samples studied is shown in fig 3 inset is a high resolution tem image showing well developed lattice spacing matching the fe3o4 2 x 311 planes the infrared ir absorption spectra for the haematite samples s5 s6 and s7 are shown in fig 4 it has been reported that the ir band positions for haematite are sensitive to the size and shape of the particles cornell and schwertmann 2003 rendon and serna 1981 reported bands often occur at wavelengths 900 cm 1 rendon and serna 1981 bands 900 cm 1 are often attributed to oh groups cornell and schwertmann 2003 rendon and serna 1981 the broad peak centred at 3350 cm 1 in the spectrum of s7 the haematite sample produced by boiling in water may be attributed to the oh group following conventional assignment cornell and schwertmann 2003 this peak is completely absent in the s6 spectrum the haematite sample sintered at 800 c suggesting an apparent complete dehydroxylation cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 the 3350 cm 1 peak is barely discernible in the s5 spectrum suggesting the limited presence of oh groups rendon and serna rendon and serna 1981 attributed a 950 cm 1 peak in haematite to the oh group this peak is associated with the 910 cm 1 absorption maxima in this study allowance being made for the effects of the variations in the sizes and shapes of the particles between samples rendon and serna 1981 the 910 cm 1 peak is identifiable in the ir patterns of the three haematite samples the highest 910 cm 1 peak occurred in the s7 spectrum and the least in the s6 spectrum the observation indicates that the largest presence of the oh group occurred on s7 and the least on s6 the presence of the 910 cm 1 peak in the s6 spectrum suggests that a limited amount of oh groups remained on the sample despite the heat treatment at 800 c the 910 cm 1 peak is more sensitive to the presence of the oh group compared to the 3350 cm 1 peak the 1150 1220 and 1640 cm 1 peaks observed on the s7 spectrum but which are almost completely absent in the s6 spectrum is also associated with the presence of oh groups as a mineralogical difference between the haematite samples were excluded on the basis of the similarity of their xrd patterns fig 2b 3 2 orange g degradation the effect of the proportion of feii in an oxide with reference to the activation of ps measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5a after 3 d 90 decolourisation of og was recorded due to ps being activated by the magnetite samples s1 and s2 meanwhile 85 decolourisation was achieved with the more oxidised s3 sample for the maghemite sample s4 with the least proportion if any of feii the corresponding decolourisation of og was 70 without iron oxide activation ps alone degradation only 30 decolourisation of og was achieved under the same condition these results show a positive correlation between the amount of feii present in an iron oxide sample and the effectiveness of ps activation as measured by og degradation similar trends but longer reaction times are shown in fig 5b for og mineralisation except for the relatively poorer performance of s3 as it has been demonstrated that fe2 is more effective than fe3 in activating ps rodriguez et al 2014 the results of fig 5a is attributed to the influence of the greater proportion of feii in s1 and s2 compared to s3 and s4 the effect of common iron oxide phases namely magnetite s2 and s10 maghemite s4 and s12 and haematite s5 on ps activation measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5c the magnetite samples of differing ssa s2 40 5 m2 g and s10 9 7 m2 g showed similar ps activation trends as assessed by the degree of og degradation however the maghemite samples with roughly similar ssa s4 41 2 m2 g and s12 34 8 m2 g showed different activation effectiveness the og degradation trend for s5 a haematite sample with ssa of 21 m2 g is close to the trends of the magnetite samples and the more effective maghemite sample from these results it is concluded that mineralogy does not have a strong effect on ps activation by iron oxides the conclusion corroborates the opinion of borggaard borggaard 1983 that mineralogy plays a limited role in determining some physical and chemical properties of iron oxides the mineralisation results fig 5d roughly followed on a longer time scale the trends of og decolourisation the effect of particle sintering or the amount of surface oh groups on ps activation measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5e the most sintered sample s6 with the least presence of oh groups and the lowest ssa of the three haematite samples showed the least effectiveness in activating ps as measured by og decolourisation the least sintered sample and with the greatest amount of oh groups s7 however did not show the best effectiveness in activating ps hence oh group presence does not determine iron oxides effectiveness in activating ps this is despite the fact that surface oh groups are the principal functional groups of iron oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 the mineralisation trends for the haematite samples are little influenced by the degree of particle sintering surface oh presence the amounts of dissolved fe in the course of the degradation experiments are shown in fig 6a the dissolved fe concentrations were 1 mg l after 1 d however with the exception of the calcium carbonate coated s9 sample the concentrations were 1 mg l after 3 d the concentration rose to about 4 mg l for s1 s2 s3 s4 and s11 between 3 d and 7 d the inherent ph of og was about 5 but this decreased to a ph of 2 5 within 1 d of the experiment and remained at this value for much of the experiment under this acidic environment combined with the oxidising effect of ps resulting in the destabilisation of the coordination sphere of fe as well as the complexation effect of the degradation products cornell and schwertmann 2003 the dissolution of the iron oxides was expected the differences in the amounts of dissolved fe did not follow any obvious pattern regarding ssa or mineralogy the non uniqueness of the dissolution properties of iron oxides is well documented and has been attributed to crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities such as point defects dislocations microfractures kinks domain boundaries corners ledges and edges cornell and schwertmann 2003 similar structural irregularities may explain the observed limited effects of iron oxide mineralogy and the presence or absence of oh groups in determining ps activation the particularly low concentration of dissolved fe for s9 with calcium carbonate coating may suggest some influence of the carbonate on fe dissolution it is notable that the errors in the measurement of dissolved fe for the four samples s1 s2 s3 and s4 synthesised in the air with limited subsequent heat treatment are relatively high this outcome may reflect relatively significant structural irregularities or defects in these samples when compared to the samples that were heat treated at 500 c s5 s6 and s7 or that were sourced from commercial suppliers s10 s11 s12 fig 6b shows that the concentrations of dissolved fe correlated fairly well with the degree of mineralisation of og after 7 d the result supports a conclusion that dissolved iron is principally responsible for ps activation and orange g degradation the correlation was poor mainly for s2 s3 and s4 with significant errors in the 7 d measurement of dissolved fe a number of recent publications on activation of ps by iron oxides proposed heterogeneous activation usman et al 2012 yan et al 2011 even under acidic conditions wu et al 2017 with the negligible dissolution of the oxides these results appear counterintuitive since electron transfer resulting in the change of the oxidation state of fe fe3 fe2 is often cited as the mechanism for ps activation wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 as mentioned above such a modification is expected to destabilise the coordination sphere of the fe promoting dissolution because of the change in the electrical charge and the size of the cations 0 078 nm for fe2 and 0 064 nm for fe3 cornell and schwertmann 2003 one of the studies that reported negligible dissolved fe yan et al 2011 reportedly evaluated the amount of dissolved fe by immersing iron oxide particles in a test solution for 3 d without ps addition however in the absence of ps complexing degradation products are not formed and the destabilising effect of ps oxidation is lacking consequently the amount and effect of dissolved fe may have been underestimated in the study in another study ding et al 2017 although as much as 0 6 mg l dissolved fe was observed in an experiment where 0 015 mg l fe2 showed significant ps activating effect heterogeneous reactions with negligible effect of dissolved fe was claimed hence it appears that the effect of dissolved fe in the activation of ps by iron oxides is sometimes not adequately recognised having determined the significant dissolution of the iron oxides during og degradation and its correlation to orange g mineralisation the effects of dissolved fe as fe2 and fe3 on og degradation were evaluated as shown in fig 7a for a fe concentration of 5 mg l which corresponds to the maximum amount of dissolved fe in solution as shown in fig 6a og decolourisation was complete before the sampling time of 1 d for both fe2 and fe3 the decolourisation trend of s10 a commercial magnetite nanopowder showed complete og degradation only after 3 d under the same condition fe2 and fe3 also achieved more rapid og mineralisation compared to s10 even at the higher equivalent fe concentration of the latter 0 1 g l s10 amounts to 72 mg l fe the results show that dissolved fe can provide effective activation of ps under acidic condition ph 5 2 5 as is well established wu et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 the results also indicate that at the concentration of dissolved fe observed in this study the activation of ps is better described as a homogeneous process it should be mentioned that fe3 in fig 7b achieved a mineralisation of 60 against the slightly 80 mineralisation recorded for fe2 in 3 d these values appear to correspond to the 3 d 70 decolourisation of og associated with the feiii oxide s4 against the 90 decolourisation associated with the feii oxides s1 and s2 see fig 5a hence the more effective activation of ps by magnetite over maghemite is due to the presence of feii in the former but not in the latter as previously suggested the effect of surface area particle size on og degradation is shown in fig 7c two commercial magnetite samples s10 and s11 described by the manufacturer as 50 100 nm and 5 μm particles respectively were compared with respect to their effectiveness in activating ps as measured by og degradation probably due to aggregation the bet ssa for s10 was found to be 9 7 m2 g this translates to an average particle size of 120 nm for a magnetite density of 5 15 g cm3 ike et al 2017b which is higher than the manufacturer s specification of 100 nm the bet ssa of s11 was measured as 7 7 m2 g which amounts to an average particle size of 150 nm the og decolourisation trends shown in fig 7c are roughly similar but the mineralisation trends are very different s11 with the lower ssa larger particle size achieved more effective mineralisation especially after 5 d the higher dissolved fe concentration at 7 d for s11 compared to s10 fig 6a is considered responsible for the better mineralisation recorded for s11 at the latter part of the test the rapid mineralisation achieved by s11 due to a high dissolved fe after 5 d is not surprising as similarly fast mineralisation was achieved by dissolved fe as fe3 and fe2 in fig 7b hence for s10 and s11 the particle size surface area is less important in determining ps activation compared to the ease of particle dissolution the result is indicative of the predominance of homogeneous over heterogeneous activation of ps it has already been mentioned with reference to fig 5c that the magnetite samples s2 ssa 40 5 m2 g and s10 ssa 9 7 m2 g showed similar degradation trends while maghemite samples s4 ssa 41 2 m2 g and s12 ssa 34 8 m2 g resulted in different pollutant degradation over the same period these results show that particle size or ssa did not determine the effectiveness of ps activation structural irregularities is a more viable explanation for the results the effects of silica and calcium carbonate coating of iron oxide particles with respect to ps activation is shown in fig 7e f the silica coated sample s8 ssa 22 0 m2 g shows a slightly better degradation profile when compared to the calcium carbonate sample s9 ssa 16 1 m2 g but is itself slightly outperformed by the uncoated magnetite sample s2 ssa 40 5 m2 g the effectiveness of og decolourisation and mineralisation appears to follow a pattern consistent with the ssa of the particles and the concentration of dissolved fe see fig 6a hence the silica and carbonate coating of the iron oxide decreased ps activation to the degree the ssa of the original iron oxide was reduced and or dissolution inhibited however the limited mineralisation of 40 at the end of 16 d recorded for s9 is suggestive of the scavenging effect of carbonate lutze et al 2015 wacławek et al 2017 the effect of unbuffered initial basic ph on the rate of ps activation measured by og decolourisation and mineralisation is shown in fig 8 compared to fe2 and fe3 activation of ps that completely decolourised og within 1 d under acidic condition ph 5 2 5 fig 7a 40 decolourisation was achieved within 1 d for fe2 and fe3 activation of ps as shown in fig 8a with ph reducing from 9 to 4 fig 8c for the same period ps alone achieved complete decolourisation of og with or without s11 activation s11 is a commercial magnetite particle the ph variation within 1 d for the ps degradation experiment with or without s11 activation was 10 to 9 indicating that the fast degradation observed was achieved under alkaline conditions the relatively fast decolourisation of og achieved in fig 8 by ps alone contrasts the slow decolourisation of og achieved under the acidic condition as shown in fig 5a highlighting the effectiveness of alkaline activation of ps since the same trend of ps decolourisation of og was achieved with or without s11 it follows that the iron oxide did not contribute significantly towards ps activation the iron oxide is thus dispensable under the specific experimental condition although significant decolourisation of og was achieved in the presence of s11 mineralisation was poor however ps alone achieved significant mineralisation it seems that dissolved fe from s11 produced in the course of the 1 d degradation of og in the presence of ps interacted with the remaining ps to limit mineralisation this hypothetical effect is comparable to the limited decolourisation of og by ps activated by fe2 and fe3 under basic condition i e 1 d in fig 8a residual radicals produced by base activation of persulphate or organic molecules in solution produced from the degradation of og may have contributed to the activation of ps to support the mineralisation achieved for the ps alone case below neutral ph fang et al 2013 ahmad et al 2013 ocampo 2009 stirling 1965 both the limited og decolourisation recorded at 1 d before the drop of ph to an acidic condition for the case of dissolved fe activation of ps and the significantly limited mineralisation of og in the presence of s11 strongly contrast with the effective og decolourisation and mineralisation achieved by ps alone these results suggest that dissolved fe species inhibited ps activation under non acidic conditions ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 also reported lower pollutant degradation by ps in the presence of haematite particles compared to ps alone the authors proposed radical generation inhibition by the iron oxide sample to explain their results this observation requires further investigation as it may have significant practical implication on the effectiveness of isco in certain cases one of such cases is where dissolved fe activation of ps is adopted for the treatment of contaminants in non acidic subsurface environments another is where the non acidic subsurface environment contains fe minerals evaluation of the effect of buffered ph conditions on og degradation is shown in fig 9 under the phosphate buffered neutral ph condition the activation of ps for the decolourisation and mineralisation of og by iron oxide and fe2 was relatively poor in fact the unactivated ps was as good as the fe activated systems suggesting that the fe materials provided no effective activation although a few authors had reported effective iron oxide activation of ps at circumneutral conditions usman et al 2012 yan et al 2011 the results of this investigation do not support this claim the observed low orange g degradation by fe2 activated and unactivated ps under a buffered neutral condition is not surprising as the solubility of fe2 is relatively poor in a neutral environment and the concentration of oh for alkaline activation of ps is low as well however it should be pointed out that the phosphate ions are important radical scavengers and may have hindered og degradation wei et al 2016 the rate of reaction of so4 with the phosphate ion is strongly dependent on the degree of phosphate ion protonation as follows wei et al 2016 neta et al 1988 1 s o 4 h po 4 2 so 4 2 hp o 4 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 2 s o 4 h 2 po 4 so 4 2 hp o 4 h k 7 104 m 1 s 1 the computed pka1 pka2 and pka3 of the phosphate ion are 1 80 6 95 and 12 90 respectively www chemicalize com hence at a neutral ph one half of the phosphate ion may exist as h2po4 and the other half as hpo4 2 under this condition relative to the acidic condition more significant radical scavenging may result from the presence of 50 hpo4 2 nevertheless compared to the rate constants for so4 reaction with common aromatic compounds neta et al 1977 the rate constants for the reactions between the phosphate ions and so4 is relatively small hence other phenomena such as complex formation might have played important roles in the observed limited degradation of og in the phosphate solutions to evaluate the impact of phosphate in basic and acidic conditions buffered experiments at alkaline and acidic conditions were performed for the buffered ph of 11 the decolourisation of og by ps was substantially fast completed in 1 d in the presence or absence of fe2 notwithstanding that the phosphate ions exists principally in the more radical scavenging form hpo4 2 however the retarding role of phosphate on og degradation is evident in the limited mineralisation recorded this clearly shows that og decolourisation involving only the destruction of the azo bond is more readily achieved than the oxidation of aromatic structures to co2 and h2o ike et al 2017a rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 ps activation at the ph of 11 in the presence or absence of fe2 may be attributed totally to the effect of oh under a buffered acidic ph condition complete og decolourisation was observed after 4 d in the presence of fe2 but even after 7 d decolourisation was incomplete for the ps alone case similarly about 60 mineralisation was achieved after 7 d in the presence of fe2 while mineralisation was negligible in its absence hence in the buffered systems only under acidic condition was a significant mineralisation of og obtained this may be due to the predominance of h2po4 with a limited scavenging ability and possibly less complex formation ability under acidic conditions nevertheless the scavenging effects of the phosphate ion are still significant the retarding effect of the phosphate ion on fe2 activation of ps in an acidic environment can be appreciated by noting that complete og decolourisation and 60 mineralisation was achieved in 1 d in the absence of the phosphate ion fig 7a b while 60 mineralisation was recorded after 7 d in the presence of the phosphate ions subsurface environments naturally existing or contaminated may have varying chloride concentrations exceeding the taste threshold of 250 mg l who 2003 mullaney et al 2009 sometimes the concentration is close to seawater chloride content of 19 400 mg l stein et al 2016 fig 10 highlights the results of experiments conducted to determine the effects of a neutral buffered saline solution 20 times the chloride taste threshold on the effectiveness of ps activation by iron oxides and dissolved fe the experiments were designed to mimic a highly saline neutral groundwater condition the significant radical scavenging effect of a high concentration of chloride ion has been previously reported lutze et al 2015 with or without iron oxide and dissolved fe only 60 decolourisation of og was observed after 7 d mineralisation was negligible for the same period since the results are similar to those of fig 9 which was conducted in the absence of chloride ions it is concluded that the effect of the chloride ions is negligible under the condition of the investigation even at a much higher iron oxide concentration up to 5 g l og degradation was still very poor consequently for practical application of ps degradation of subsurface contaminations a different route of activation such as thermal particularly where waste heat is available ike et al 2018b tsitonaki et al 2010 ike et al 2018a johnson et al 2008 may be required for a strongly phosphate buffering neutral subsurface environment as a final note it may be pointed out that at a sufficiently high concentration fe3 fe3 fe2 redox potential is 0 771 but not fe2 fe2 fe0 redox potential is 0 44 may directly oxidise an organic pollutant such as orange g see fig s 9 however under practical conditions the ferric oxidation may be considered negligible compared to oxidation by persulphate s2o8 2 so4 2 redox potential is 2 01 and activated persulphate so4 so4 2 redox potential is 2 5 3 1 ike et al 2018a for details of the mechanisms of fe3 and fe2 activation of ps the interested reader is referred to a recent review by ike et al ike et al 2018a 4 conclusions the objectives of this study were the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness the mode homogeneous or heterogeneous and the factors that influence the activation of ps by iron oxides from the results obtained and the discussions presented the following conclusions have been drawn 1 in comparison to unactivated ps iron oxides as magnetite maghemite and haematite activated ps to enhance the degradation of a target pollutant og under acidic conditions but they were less effective than dissolved fe 2 some enhancement in the effectiveness of ps activation by iron oxides was observed as the proportion of feii relative to feiii increased 3 the activation of ps by iron oxides does not depend on mineralogy ssa or the presence of surface oh groups 4 crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities are the most important determinant of the activation properties of a given iron oxide 5 significant dissolution of iron oxides up to 5 mg l for 0 1 g l iron oxide suspensions accompanied activation of ps by iron oxides and the extent of dissolution like ps activation was influenced more by structural irregularities than by mineralogy or ssa 6 the mode of iron oxide activation of ps is predominantly homogeneous which implies a strong ph dependence as fe has limited solubility under non acidic conditions 7 for unbuffered alkaline condition ps alone was more effective in degrading the target pollutant than ps activated by iron oxide or dissolved fe 8 no evidence was found for the common claim that iron oxides are more effective than dissolved fe in activating ps at circumneutral conditions 9 under a buffered neutral condition neither iron oxide nor dissolved fe effectively activated ps 10 phosphate buffer significantly retarded pollutant degradation by fe activated or unactivated ps it is important to extend this study to fe hydroxides due to their abundance in the subsurface more work is still required for a fuller understanding of the interaction between ionic fe and ps under non acidic conditions finally further research is required to characterise and quantify the contribution of the structural defects of iron oxides to ps activation acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by victoria university to ike ikechukwu

1652,due to the widespread application of persulphate ps for in situ chemical oxidation isco the ps activating role of naturally occurring minerals such as iron oxides has been the subject of a number of studies however major discrepancies remain as to the effectiveness mode and factors that influence iron oxides activation of ps in this study an attempt has been made to bridge this important knowledge gaps by a systematic study of ps activation measured by orange g degradation using commercial and self synthesised magnetite maghemite and haematite particles the results showed that the activation of ps by iron oxides does not depend on mineralogy surface area or concentration of surface oh groups but on crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities significant dissolution of iron oxides accompanied ps activation in a mainly homogeneous process requiring a low ph environment to be effective the activation of ps by iron oxides at neutral ph was found to be no better than dissolved iron activation contrary to some earlier publications the results also suggest that under alkaline conditions ps alone was more effective in degrading orange g than with iron oxides or dissolved iron activation phosphate buffer significantly retarded orange g degradation by iron activated or unactivated ps with negative implication for isco in non acidic buffering environments the results of this study contribute to enhancing the fundamental understanding of isco processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate iron oxide in situ chemical oxidation crystalline inhomogeneities mineralogy surface area abbreviations isco in situ chemical oxidation ms saturation magnetisation og orange g ps persulphate ssa specific surface area 1 introduction within the last two decades the application of persulphate ps for in situ chemical oxidation isco of pollutants in subsurface environments has attracted significant practical and research attention this is due to the ability of ps to oxidise a variety of contaminants tsitonaki et al 2010 devi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 consequently the role of naturally occurring minerals such as iron oxides in activating ps to produce the reactive sulphate radical so4 has been the subject of a number of experimental investigations these investigations were aimed at improving the efficiency of ps isco for the remediation of subsurface contaminations wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 the higher selectivity and the limited reaction with the natural organic matter of so4 compared to the hydroxyl radical ho commonly produced from h2o2 is one reason for the increasing interest in ps isco ahmed et al 2012 ike et al 2018a avetta et al 2015 however under certain conditions so4 may be substantially converted to ho lutze et al 2015 liang and su 2009 iron oxides have also been advanced as substitutes for soluble ferrous ion fe2 in the activation of ps reduced consumption of ps and circumneutral activation are cited as advantages of iron oxides over dissolved fe wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 ike et al 2017a despite the progress made in understanding the mechanisms of iron oxides activation of ps ding et al ding et al 2017 maintained that there are still important unresolved questions one of which is whether the activation of ps by iron oxides is mainly heterogeneous or homogeneous in homogeneous activation soluble fe derived from the dissolution of the original iron oxide is principally responsible for ps activation where ps activation arises primarily from the interaction between the oxidant and the surfaces of the oxide particles with or without some iron dissolution the activation process is described as heterogeneous homogeneous processes are limited to conditions where soluble fe is stable i e conditions in which substantial dissolved fe precipitation does not occur typically acidic conditions while heterogeneous processes are not dependent on dissolved fe stability in solution consequently homogeneous processes are effective only in acidic environments while the effectiveness of heterogeneous processes is less dependent on ph as the ph in subsurface environments may not always be acidic a knowledge of whether iron oxide activation of persulphate is principally heterogeneous or principally homogeneous is important in evaluating iron oxide contribution to the effectiveness of ps isco processes another unresolved question is whether the ps activation ability of a particular iron oxide is influenced more by the synthesis route and local crystalline defects than by mineralogy ding et al 2017 to illustrate usman et al usman et al 2012 suggested that feii bearing iron oxides such as magnetite may be more effective in activating ps compared to feiii oxides such as haematite an assertion that may be supported by fe2 faster activation of ps compared to fe3 rodriguez et al 2014 however the results published by do et al do et al 2010 showed that haematite was more effective in activating ps measured by a target pollutant degradation compared to magnetite under the same condition particle concentration 8 3 g l ph 3 ps concentration 500 mm on the one hand ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 reported 60 degradation of nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane after 3 days 3 d by ps activated by haematite particle specific surface area ssa 28 m2 g particle concentration 400 g l ph 6 3 or 13 12 ps concentration 500 mm on the other an almost complete degradation of fluorenone was reported by usman et al usman et al 2012 after only 50 h due to oxidisation by ps under magnetite activation particle concentration 10 g l ph circumneutral ps concentration 130 mm see section s 1 in the supplementary material for the computation of the concentrations a still more rapid degradation was reported by yan et al yan et al 2011 according to the report sulfamonomethoxine was almost completely degraded in 2 min by ps activated by magnetite nanoparticles computed ssa using particle size ike et al 2017b 78 m2 g particle concentration 0 6 g l ph 6 4 ps concentration 1 8 mm it may be appreciated from the ssa values and the concentrations supplied that for instance surface area cannot explain the difference in the degradation periods reported by ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 and yan et al yan et al 2011 even when consideration is made for the difference in experimental conditions borggaard o k borggaard 1983 demonstrated that mineralogy does not seem to affect certain physical and chemical properties of iron oxides such as surface charge hydroxyl buffering fluoride and phosphate adsorption capacities it is therefore important to carry out controlled experiments to determine the impact of mineralogy and other properties of iron oxides such as ssa on ps activation understanding the factors that influence the effectiveness and duration of pollutant degradation under iron oxide activated ps oxidation is crucial for the development of a better description of ps isco processes as well as a more complete explanation of wastewater treatment schemes this study is a first pass qualitative assessment of the effects of crystalline phase feii content particle size the degree of sintering hydroxyl group concentration and surface coating by co existing minerals on ps activation by iron oxides the specific aims embrace the advancement of a greater understanding of the modes homogeneous or heterogeneous and effectiveness of ps activation by the three common iron oxides magnetite maghemite and haematite for this purpose both commercial and self synthesised iron oxide particles were evaluated with respect to their effectiveness in activating ps the extent of ps activation was measured by the degree of orange g og degradation decolourisation and mineralisation the particle synthesis involved a stepwise modification of a base material to limit the effects of synthesis variability og a typical azo dye although not a common groundwater contaminant was chosen for this study as its degradation behaviour under the influence of activated ps is fairly established ike et al 2017a rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 and its colour provides for a convenient analysis this is to focus the research on the effects of the iron oxides and the reaction environment nevertheless og as an azo dye still remains an important environmental contaminant in its own right due largely to the popularity of azo dyes in the textile industry and because og is structurally similar to more toxic azo dyes such as o aminoazotoluene ike et al 2017a drumond chequer et al 2013 2 methods milli q water and analytical grade chemicals were used throughout the study the iron oxide particles and their modifications used in this study are summarised in table 1 magnetite nanoparticles were synthesised according to a method already published ike et al 2017b three sets of black powders hereafter referred to as s1 s2 and s3 were produced by varying the ageing time of the nanoparticles under atmospheric conditions for 1 min 2 h and 10 h respectively the ageing was done to produce magnetite powders with varying degrees of surface oxidation the aim was to evaluate the effect of surface oxidation feii content on the effectiveness of magnetite activation of ps to compare the activation potential of magnetite to the other common iron oxides maghemite and haematite s2 was oxidised according to a literature procedure cornell and schwertmann 2003 a portion of the black s2 powder was subjected to air oxidation at 250 c for 5 h in a muffle furnace which resulted in the production of a brownish red maghemite powder cornell and schwertmann 2003 the maghemite powder is hereafter referred to as s4 an oxidation of a portion of the s2 sample at 500 c for 5 h produced a red haematite powder cornell and schwertmann 2003 which is hereafter referred to as s5 to determine whether the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of an iron oxide play a role in ps activation a portion of s5 was subjected to a further thermal treatment at 800 c for 5 h the heat treated powder is hereafter referred to as s6 such heat treatment results in irreversible sintering of particles and removal of surface hydroxyl groups cornell and schwertmann 2003 an attempt was also made to increase the concentration of the surface hydroxyl groups on a portion of s5 by boiling in milli q water the boiling lasted for 5 h the aim of the boiling was to hydroxylate some oxo bonds that may have been formed during the initial production of s5 at a temperature of 500 c cornell and schwertmann 2003 the tentatively hydroxylated powder is referred to as s7 hereafter to assess the potential effect of iron oxide particles being coated by soil minerals a portion of the s2 sample was coated with silica according to a published procedure ike et al 2017b the silica coated s2 sample is referred to as s8 subsequently in this paper calcium carbonate coating was also applied on a portion of the s2 sample because carbonate minerals abound in the environment to apply the carbonate coating a wet portion of the s2 sample was placed in a flask to which 100 mm nahco3 and 180 mm nacl solutions were added a solution of 300 mm naoh was gently added to the mixture under rapid stirring a solution of 100 mm cacl2 was added dropwise to precipitate caco3 on s2 as s9 babou kammoe et al 2012 sanciolo et al 2008 three commercial iron oxide samples were also evaluated in this study a commercial magnetite nanopowder from aldrich 637106 with a specified size range of 50 100 nm was designated as s10 s11 represents another commercial magnetite powder from aldrich 310069 with a manufacturer s specified size of 5 μm a commercial maghemite nanopowder from aldrich 544884 with a specified particle size of 50 nm will hereafter be referred to as s12 the surface area and morphology of particles were characterised by n2 adsorption which was conducted using a micrometrics tristar surface area and porosity analyzer with a tristar 3000 version 6 04 analysis software powders were degassed at 105 c for 24 h for the analysis magnetometric data at room temperature was acquired using a riken denshi vibrating sample magnetometer vsm for the magnetic parameter measurement a given portion of an iron oxide sample was embedded in a plastic holder using epoxy adhesive a measurement was taken after solidification colourimetric studies of the particles were conducted using a chroma meter cr 400 konica minolta sensing powders for colourimetric measurements were placed in a transparent plastic bag and positioned under the measuring head of the chroma meter an empty transparent plastic bag was placed over the supplied calibrating plate before instrument calibrations colourimetric measurements were in the cielab cartesian system in which lightness is measured by l ranges from 0 for pure black to 100 for white and hue and saturation are quantified by chromatic a ranges from a for green to a for red and chromatic b ranges from b for blue to b for yellow cornell and schwertmann 2003 micrographs of s2 were obtained using a jeol jem 2100 transmission electron microscope tem operated at 200 kv and 101 μa for tem imaging a portion of a dry s2 sample was embedded in araldite resin the embedded sample was ultramicrotomed to nanometre thick sections before being placed on formvar coated copper grids the sample preparation was to ensure sample stability during imaging attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopic study was conducted using a perkin elmer ftir spectrometer with universal atr diamond znse crystals ftir scans from 4000 to 600 cm 1 at 64 accumulations and a resolution of 2 cm 1 were collected the degradation study was conducted using a 0 1 mm og solution initial ps concentration was 10 mm for all experiments except where otherwise stated 0 1 g l iron oxide was used for ps activation compared to some of the concentrations reported in the studies reviewed in the introduction the concentrations of ps and iron oxide used in this study is relatively low the lower concentrations were chosen to reflect the observation that restrained diffusion under subsurface conditions significantly reduces ps availability ike et al 2018a and the observation that the available mineral for ps activation in real soil is relatively small ahmad et al 2010 the diffusion of ps is restrained due to the finite permeability of subsurface rock materials resulting in the slow migration of the oxidant and radicals when compared to the lifespan of the radicals hence especially when an activator is introduced alongside ps the concentration of the oxidant radicals away from the injection well may be significantly lower than the concentrations close to the well concentrations of ps comparable to the amount used in this study has also been reported in previous works yan et al 2011 chen et al 2016 the degradation experiments were conducted under ambient laboratory temperature condition of 24 c in an orbital shaker borosilicate glass beads were added to ensure adequate stirring of the iron oxide suspensions 1 ml samples were withdrawn at specified intervals collected samples were filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters into microtubes the microtubes contain 0 5 ml methanol to quench the radical reactions to evaluate the effects of ph on the activation of ps experiments were conducted with suitable ph modifications of the orange g solution with or without the addition of 10 mm phosphate serving as a ph buffer lutze et al 2015 ike et al 2018b the extent of og decolourisation in the collected samples was measured spectrophotometrically at the azo bond characteristic absorption wavelength of 478 nm ike et al 2017a a biochrom libra s22 uv visible spectrophotometer was used for the measurement the extent of mineralisation was evaluated by measuring the total carbon tc content of collected samples using a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer for tc measurement samples were quenched in an ice bath ike et al 2017a the concentration of total fe in a solution was measured using a shimadzu plasma atomic spectrometer icp e 9000 after filtration through a 0 2 μm syringe filter the ph of solutions and suspensions was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions as required average values of at least duplicate measurements are reported the degradation results are presented in the manuscript without error bars to make the identification of symbols easier the relevant figures with error bars representing standard errors of at least duplicate experiments are reproduced in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterisation the summarised descriptions and the colour of the particles studied are presented in table 1 magnetite is typically black in colour maghemite brown or brownish red and haematite red cornell and schwertmann 2003 hence based on the colour of the particles as seen by the unaided eye table 1 shows that the particles produced correspond to the expected mineralogy the bet ssas for the particles studied are shown in fig 1 the n2 adsorption desorption plots all showing type iv isotherms with monolayer multilayer adsorption trends and narrow hysteric loops characteristic of slightly mesoporous materials sing et al 1985 are presented in the supplementary material figs s 1 s 2 s 3 following the conclusion of kirillov kirillov 2009 that any dispersed solid with ssa exceeding 30 m2 g is nanoparticulate s1 s2 s3 s4 and s12 are considered nanoparticles other samples are considered microparticles the ssa fig 1 and n2 adsorption desorption plots fig s 1 for s1 s2 s3 and s4 are similar but are markedly different from the ssa and n2 adsorption desorption plot for s5 these results imply that s2 oxidation at 250 c to give s4 did not result in a significant morphological change consistent with the literature cornell and schwertmann 2003 but the production of s5 from s2 by oxidation at 500 c did hence based on the similarity of their ssa and n2 adsorption isotherms s1 s2 s3 and s4 is considered morphologically similar nanoparticles further heat treatment at 800 c of s5 resulted in reduced ssa for s6 implying particle sintering sintering is preceded by the loss of surface hydroxyl groups which is replaced by oxo bonds cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 consequently the higher ssa of s7 compared to s5 is tentatively interpreted as an increase in the number of surface hydroxyl groups in s7 due to the boiling of s5 in water cornell and schwertmann 2003 both s8 silica coated and s9 calcium carbonate coated particles produced from s2 exhibited reduced ssa the reduction in ssa following coating had been attributed to the coating of aggregated particles ike et al 2017b the xrd patterns in fig 2a show characteristics magnetite maghemite peaks as expected the distinguishing maghemite peaks is best developed in s4 as this sample was subjected to a treatment known to produce maghemite cornell and schwertmann 2003 compared to s1 and s2 s3 shows a slightly more pronounced characteristic maghemite peaks suggesting that the extended ageing time of 10 h resulted in more surface oxidation fig 2b shows well developed haematite peaks for s5 s6 and s7 these results support the conclusion that the heat treatments of s5 as described in the experimental section did not result in a phase change consistent with the literature data cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 calcium carbonate and magnetite peaks were observed in fig 2c as was expected for s9 which was the magnetite sample s2 coated with calcium carbonate the xrd and ftir characterisations of the silica coated particles s8 showing silica coating on magnetite have been previously published ike et al 2017b colour may be used to distinguish between various iron oxide phases cornell and schwertmann 2003 the colour of a particular iron oxide sample is determined not only by the mineralogy of the sample but also by the morphological properties cornell and schwertmann 2003 however as s1 s2 s3 and s4 are morphologically similar as argued above differences in their colourimetric parameters are strongly phase dependent table 2 shows the colourimetric and magnetic properties of s1 s2 s3 and s4 the low a and b values of s1 and s2 is consistent with the achromatic black colour of magnetite which is indicative of limited surface oxidation of s1 and s2 these results corroborate the interpretation of the xrd patterns of fig 2a the slightly higher chromatic parameters of s3 are indicative of a greater surface oxidation the significantly higher a and b parameters for s4 are consistent with a maghemite phase magnetite and maghemite are both ferrimagnetic minerals with high room temperature saturation magnetisation ms compared to other iron oxides the ms of bulk magnetite is about 82 100 am2 kg cornell and schwertmann 2003 but magnetite nanoparticles may have a value of only 68 am2 kg mahmed et al 2014 the lower ms values of nanoparticles have been attributed to the canting of the surface spins goya et al 2003 the ms value of bulk maghemite ranges between 60 and 80 am2 kg but nanoparticles may have a reduced value of 34 50 am2 kg mahmed et al 2014 s4 with fully developed maghemite properties has a lower ms compared to s1 s2 and s3 the lower ms value of s3 compared to s1 and s2 is consistent with the proposed greater oxidation of s3 due to extended ageing in air the xrd colourimetric and magnetic analyses all point to a more magnetite property for s1 and s2 compared to s3 s4 exhibits clear maghemite features this conclusion implies that s1 and s2 have a greater proportion of feii compared to s3 and s4 the tem image of s2 which was the base material for the production of several of the samples studied is shown in fig 3 inset is a high resolution tem image showing well developed lattice spacing matching the fe3o4 2 x 311 planes the infrared ir absorption spectra for the haematite samples s5 s6 and s7 are shown in fig 4 it has been reported that the ir band positions for haematite are sensitive to the size and shape of the particles cornell and schwertmann 2003 rendon and serna 1981 reported bands often occur at wavelengths 900 cm 1 rendon and serna 1981 bands 900 cm 1 are often attributed to oh groups cornell and schwertmann 2003 rendon and serna 1981 the broad peak centred at 3350 cm 1 in the spectrum of s7 the haematite sample produced by boiling in water may be attributed to the oh group following conventional assignment cornell and schwertmann 2003 this peak is completely absent in the s6 spectrum the haematite sample sintered at 800 c suggesting an apparent complete dehydroxylation cornell and schwertmann 2003 rochester and topham 1979 the 3350 cm 1 peak is barely discernible in the s5 spectrum suggesting the limited presence of oh groups rendon and serna rendon and serna 1981 attributed a 950 cm 1 peak in haematite to the oh group this peak is associated with the 910 cm 1 absorption maxima in this study allowance being made for the effects of the variations in the sizes and shapes of the particles between samples rendon and serna 1981 the 910 cm 1 peak is identifiable in the ir patterns of the three haematite samples the highest 910 cm 1 peak occurred in the s7 spectrum and the least in the s6 spectrum the observation indicates that the largest presence of the oh group occurred on s7 and the least on s6 the presence of the 910 cm 1 peak in the s6 spectrum suggests that a limited amount of oh groups remained on the sample despite the heat treatment at 800 c the 910 cm 1 peak is more sensitive to the presence of the oh group compared to the 3350 cm 1 peak the 1150 1220 and 1640 cm 1 peaks observed on the s7 spectrum but which are almost completely absent in the s6 spectrum is also associated with the presence of oh groups as a mineralogical difference between the haematite samples were excluded on the basis of the similarity of their xrd patterns fig 2b 3 2 orange g degradation the effect of the proportion of feii in an oxide with reference to the activation of ps measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5a after 3 d 90 decolourisation of og was recorded due to ps being activated by the magnetite samples s1 and s2 meanwhile 85 decolourisation was achieved with the more oxidised s3 sample for the maghemite sample s4 with the least proportion if any of feii the corresponding decolourisation of og was 70 without iron oxide activation ps alone degradation only 30 decolourisation of og was achieved under the same condition these results show a positive correlation between the amount of feii present in an iron oxide sample and the effectiveness of ps activation as measured by og degradation similar trends but longer reaction times are shown in fig 5b for og mineralisation except for the relatively poorer performance of s3 as it has been demonstrated that fe2 is more effective than fe3 in activating ps rodriguez et al 2014 the results of fig 5a is attributed to the influence of the greater proportion of feii in s1 and s2 compared to s3 and s4 the effect of common iron oxide phases namely magnetite s2 and s10 maghemite s4 and s12 and haematite s5 on ps activation measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5c the magnetite samples of differing ssa s2 40 5 m2 g and s10 9 7 m2 g showed similar ps activation trends as assessed by the degree of og degradation however the maghemite samples with roughly similar ssa s4 41 2 m2 g and s12 34 8 m2 g showed different activation effectiveness the og degradation trend for s5 a haematite sample with ssa of 21 m2 g is close to the trends of the magnetite samples and the more effective maghemite sample from these results it is concluded that mineralogy does not have a strong effect on ps activation by iron oxides the conclusion corroborates the opinion of borggaard borggaard 1983 that mineralogy plays a limited role in determining some physical and chemical properties of iron oxides the mineralisation results fig 5d roughly followed on a longer time scale the trends of og decolourisation the effect of particle sintering or the amount of surface oh groups on ps activation measured by og decolourisation is shown in fig 5e the most sintered sample s6 with the least presence of oh groups and the lowest ssa of the three haematite samples showed the least effectiveness in activating ps as measured by og decolourisation the least sintered sample and with the greatest amount of oh groups s7 however did not show the best effectiveness in activating ps hence oh group presence does not determine iron oxides effectiveness in activating ps this is despite the fact that surface oh groups are the principal functional groups of iron oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 the mineralisation trends for the haematite samples are little influenced by the degree of particle sintering surface oh presence the amounts of dissolved fe in the course of the degradation experiments are shown in fig 6a the dissolved fe concentrations were 1 mg l after 1 d however with the exception of the calcium carbonate coated s9 sample the concentrations were 1 mg l after 3 d the concentration rose to about 4 mg l for s1 s2 s3 s4 and s11 between 3 d and 7 d the inherent ph of og was about 5 but this decreased to a ph of 2 5 within 1 d of the experiment and remained at this value for much of the experiment under this acidic environment combined with the oxidising effect of ps resulting in the destabilisation of the coordination sphere of fe as well as the complexation effect of the degradation products cornell and schwertmann 2003 the dissolution of the iron oxides was expected the differences in the amounts of dissolved fe did not follow any obvious pattern regarding ssa or mineralogy the non uniqueness of the dissolution properties of iron oxides is well documented and has been attributed to crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities such as point defects dislocations microfractures kinks domain boundaries corners ledges and edges cornell and schwertmann 2003 similar structural irregularities may explain the observed limited effects of iron oxide mineralogy and the presence or absence of oh groups in determining ps activation the particularly low concentration of dissolved fe for s9 with calcium carbonate coating may suggest some influence of the carbonate on fe dissolution it is notable that the errors in the measurement of dissolved fe for the four samples s1 s2 s3 and s4 synthesised in the air with limited subsequent heat treatment are relatively high this outcome may reflect relatively significant structural irregularities or defects in these samples when compared to the samples that were heat treated at 500 c s5 s6 and s7 or that were sourced from commercial suppliers s10 s11 s12 fig 6b shows that the concentrations of dissolved fe correlated fairly well with the degree of mineralisation of og after 7 d the result supports a conclusion that dissolved iron is principally responsible for ps activation and orange g degradation the correlation was poor mainly for s2 s3 and s4 with significant errors in the 7 d measurement of dissolved fe a number of recent publications on activation of ps by iron oxides proposed heterogeneous activation usman et al 2012 yan et al 2011 even under acidic conditions wu et al 2017 with the negligible dissolution of the oxides these results appear counterintuitive since electron transfer resulting in the change of the oxidation state of fe fe3 fe2 is often cited as the mechanism for ps activation wu et al 2017 usman et al 2012 as mentioned above such a modification is expected to destabilise the coordination sphere of the fe promoting dissolution because of the change in the electrical charge and the size of the cations 0 078 nm for fe2 and 0 064 nm for fe3 cornell and schwertmann 2003 one of the studies that reported negligible dissolved fe yan et al 2011 reportedly evaluated the amount of dissolved fe by immersing iron oxide particles in a test solution for 3 d without ps addition however in the absence of ps complexing degradation products are not formed and the destabilising effect of ps oxidation is lacking consequently the amount and effect of dissolved fe may have been underestimated in the study in another study ding et al 2017 although as much as 0 6 mg l dissolved fe was observed in an experiment where 0 015 mg l fe2 showed significant ps activating effect heterogeneous reactions with negligible effect of dissolved fe was claimed hence it appears that the effect of dissolved fe in the activation of ps by iron oxides is sometimes not adequately recognised having determined the significant dissolution of the iron oxides during og degradation and its correlation to orange g mineralisation the effects of dissolved fe as fe2 and fe3 on og degradation were evaluated as shown in fig 7a for a fe concentration of 5 mg l which corresponds to the maximum amount of dissolved fe in solution as shown in fig 6a og decolourisation was complete before the sampling time of 1 d for both fe2 and fe3 the decolourisation trend of s10 a commercial magnetite nanopowder showed complete og degradation only after 3 d under the same condition fe2 and fe3 also achieved more rapid og mineralisation compared to s10 even at the higher equivalent fe concentration of the latter 0 1 g l s10 amounts to 72 mg l fe the results show that dissolved fe can provide effective activation of ps under acidic condition ph 5 2 5 as is well established wu et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 the results also indicate that at the concentration of dissolved fe observed in this study the activation of ps is better described as a homogeneous process it should be mentioned that fe3 in fig 7b achieved a mineralisation of 60 against the slightly 80 mineralisation recorded for fe2 in 3 d these values appear to correspond to the 3 d 70 decolourisation of og associated with the feiii oxide s4 against the 90 decolourisation associated with the feii oxides s1 and s2 see fig 5a hence the more effective activation of ps by magnetite over maghemite is due to the presence of feii in the former but not in the latter as previously suggested the effect of surface area particle size on og degradation is shown in fig 7c two commercial magnetite samples s10 and s11 described by the manufacturer as 50 100 nm and 5 μm particles respectively were compared with respect to their effectiveness in activating ps as measured by og degradation probably due to aggregation the bet ssa for s10 was found to be 9 7 m2 g this translates to an average particle size of 120 nm for a magnetite density of 5 15 g cm3 ike et al 2017b which is higher than the manufacturer s specification of 100 nm the bet ssa of s11 was measured as 7 7 m2 g which amounts to an average particle size of 150 nm the og decolourisation trends shown in fig 7c are roughly similar but the mineralisation trends are very different s11 with the lower ssa larger particle size achieved more effective mineralisation especially after 5 d the higher dissolved fe concentration at 7 d for s11 compared to s10 fig 6a is considered responsible for the better mineralisation recorded for s11 at the latter part of the test the rapid mineralisation achieved by s11 due to a high dissolved fe after 5 d is not surprising as similarly fast mineralisation was achieved by dissolved fe as fe3 and fe2 in fig 7b hence for s10 and s11 the particle size surface area is less important in determining ps activation compared to the ease of particle dissolution the result is indicative of the predominance of homogeneous over heterogeneous activation of ps it has already been mentioned with reference to fig 5c that the magnetite samples s2 ssa 40 5 m2 g and s10 ssa 9 7 m2 g showed similar degradation trends while maghemite samples s4 ssa 41 2 m2 g and s12 ssa 34 8 m2 g resulted in different pollutant degradation over the same period these results show that particle size or ssa did not determine the effectiveness of ps activation structural irregularities is a more viable explanation for the results the effects of silica and calcium carbonate coating of iron oxide particles with respect to ps activation is shown in fig 7e f the silica coated sample s8 ssa 22 0 m2 g shows a slightly better degradation profile when compared to the calcium carbonate sample s9 ssa 16 1 m2 g but is itself slightly outperformed by the uncoated magnetite sample s2 ssa 40 5 m2 g the effectiveness of og decolourisation and mineralisation appears to follow a pattern consistent with the ssa of the particles and the concentration of dissolved fe see fig 6a hence the silica and carbonate coating of the iron oxide decreased ps activation to the degree the ssa of the original iron oxide was reduced and or dissolution inhibited however the limited mineralisation of 40 at the end of 16 d recorded for s9 is suggestive of the scavenging effect of carbonate lutze et al 2015 wacławek et al 2017 the effect of unbuffered initial basic ph on the rate of ps activation measured by og decolourisation and mineralisation is shown in fig 8 compared to fe2 and fe3 activation of ps that completely decolourised og within 1 d under acidic condition ph 5 2 5 fig 7a 40 decolourisation was achieved within 1 d for fe2 and fe3 activation of ps as shown in fig 8a with ph reducing from 9 to 4 fig 8c for the same period ps alone achieved complete decolourisation of og with or without s11 activation s11 is a commercial magnetite particle the ph variation within 1 d for the ps degradation experiment with or without s11 activation was 10 to 9 indicating that the fast degradation observed was achieved under alkaline conditions the relatively fast decolourisation of og achieved in fig 8 by ps alone contrasts the slow decolourisation of og achieved under the acidic condition as shown in fig 5a highlighting the effectiveness of alkaline activation of ps since the same trend of ps decolourisation of og was achieved with or without s11 it follows that the iron oxide did not contribute significantly towards ps activation the iron oxide is thus dispensable under the specific experimental condition although significant decolourisation of og was achieved in the presence of s11 mineralisation was poor however ps alone achieved significant mineralisation it seems that dissolved fe from s11 produced in the course of the 1 d degradation of og in the presence of ps interacted with the remaining ps to limit mineralisation this hypothetical effect is comparable to the limited decolourisation of og by ps activated by fe2 and fe3 under basic condition i e 1 d in fig 8a residual radicals produced by base activation of persulphate or organic molecules in solution produced from the degradation of og may have contributed to the activation of ps to support the mineralisation achieved for the ps alone case below neutral ph fang et al 2013 ahmad et al 2013 ocampo 2009 stirling 1965 both the limited og decolourisation recorded at 1 d before the drop of ph to an acidic condition for the case of dissolved fe activation of ps and the significantly limited mineralisation of og in the presence of s11 strongly contrast with the effective og decolourisation and mineralisation achieved by ps alone these results suggest that dissolved fe species inhibited ps activation under non acidic conditions ahmad et al ahmad et al 2010 also reported lower pollutant degradation by ps in the presence of haematite particles compared to ps alone the authors proposed radical generation inhibition by the iron oxide sample to explain their results this observation requires further investigation as it may have significant practical implication on the effectiveness of isco in certain cases one of such cases is where dissolved fe activation of ps is adopted for the treatment of contaminants in non acidic subsurface environments another is where the non acidic subsurface environment contains fe minerals evaluation of the effect of buffered ph conditions on og degradation is shown in fig 9 under the phosphate buffered neutral ph condition the activation of ps for the decolourisation and mineralisation of og by iron oxide and fe2 was relatively poor in fact the unactivated ps was as good as the fe activated systems suggesting that the fe materials provided no effective activation although a few authors had reported effective iron oxide activation of ps at circumneutral conditions usman et al 2012 yan et al 2011 the results of this investigation do not support this claim the observed low orange g degradation by fe2 activated and unactivated ps under a buffered neutral condition is not surprising as the solubility of fe2 is relatively poor in a neutral environment and the concentration of oh for alkaline activation of ps is low as well however it should be pointed out that the phosphate ions are important radical scavengers and may have hindered og degradation wei et al 2016 the rate of reaction of so4 with the phosphate ion is strongly dependent on the degree of phosphate ion protonation as follows wei et al 2016 neta et al 1988 1 s o 4 h po 4 2 so 4 2 hp o 4 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 2 s o 4 h 2 po 4 so 4 2 hp o 4 h k 7 104 m 1 s 1 the computed pka1 pka2 and pka3 of the phosphate ion are 1 80 6 95 and 12 90 respectively www chemicalize com hence at a neutral ph one half of the phosphate ion may exist as h2po4 and the other half as hpo4 2 under this condition relative to the acidic condition more significant radical scavenging may result from the presence of 50 hpo4 2 nevertheless compared to the rate constants for so4 reaction with common aromatic compounds neta et al 1977 the rate constants for the reactions between the phosphate ions and so4 is relatively small hence other phenomena such as complex formation might have played important roles in the observed limited degradation of og in the phosphate solutions to evaluate the impact of phosphate in basic and acidic conditions buffered experiments at alkaline and acidic conditions were performed for the buffered ph of 11 the decolourisation of og by ps was substantially fast completed in 1 d in the presence or absence of fe2 notwithstanding that the phosphate ions exists principally in the more radical scavenging form hpo4 2 however the retarding role of phosphate on og degradation is evident in the limited mineralisation recorded this clearly shows that og decolourisation involving only the destruction of the azo bond is more readily achieved than the oxidation of aromatic structures to co2 and h2o ike et al 2017a rodriguez et al 2014 xu and li 2010 ps activation at the ph of 11 in the presence or absence of fe2 may be attributed totally to the effect of oh under a buffered acidic ph condition complete og decolourisation was observed after 4 d in the presence of fe2 but even after 7 d decolourisation was incomplete for the ps alone case similarly about 60 mineralisation was achieved after 7 d in the presence of fe2 while mineralisation was negligible in its absence hence in the buffered systems only under acidic condition was a significant mineralisation of og obtained this may be due to the predominance of h2po4 with a limited scavenging ability and possibly less complex formation ability under acidic conditions nevertheless the scavenging effects of the phosphate ion are still significant the retarding effect of the phosphate ion on fe2 activation of ps in an acidic environment can be appreciated by noting that complete og decolourisation and 60 mineralisation was achieved in 1 d in the absence of the phosphate ion fig 7a b while 60 mineralisation was recorded after 7 d in the presence of the phosphate ions subsurface environments naturally existing or contaminated may have varying chloride concentrations exceeding the taste threshold of 250 mg l who 2003 mullaney et al 2009 sometimes the concentration is close to seawater chloride content of 19 400 mg l stein et al 2016 fig 10 highlights the results of experiments conducted to determine the effects of a neutral buffered saline solution 20 times the chloride taste threshold on the effectiveness of ps activation by iron oxides and dissolved fe the experiments were designed to mimic a highly saline neutral groundwater condition the significant radical scavenging effect of a high concentration of chloride ion has been previously reported lutze et al 2015 with or without iron oxide and dissolved fe only 60 decolourisation of og was observed after 7 d mineralisation was negligible for the same period since the results are similar to those of fig 9 which was conducted in the absence of chloride ions it is concluded that the effect of the chloride ions is negligible under the condition of the investigation even at a much higher iron oxide concentration up to 5 g l og degradation was still very poor consequently for practical application of ps degradation of subsurface contaminations a different route of activation such as thermal particularly where waste heat is available ike et al 2018b tsitonaki et al 2010 ike et al 2018a johnson et al 2008 may be required for a strongly phosphate buffering neutral subsurface environment as a final note it may be pointed out that at a sufficiently high concentration fe3 fe3 fe2 redox potential is 0 771 but not fe2 fe2 fe0 redox potential is 0 44 may directly oxidise an organic pollutant such as orange g see fig s 9 however under practical conditions the ferric oxidation may be considered negligible compared to oxidation by persulphate s2o8 2 so4 2 redox potential is 2 01 and activated persulphate so4 so4 2 redox potential is 2 5 3 1 ike et al 2018a for details of the mechanisms of fe3 and fe2 activation of ps the interested reader is referred to a recent review by ike et al ike et al 2018a 4 conclusions the objectives of this study were the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness the mode homogeneous or heterogeneous and the factors that influence the activation of ps by iron oxides from the results obtained and the discussions presented the following conclusions have been drawn 1 in comparison to unactivated ps iron oxides as magnetite maghemite and haematite activated ps to enhance the degradation of a target pollutant og under acidic conditions but they were less effective than dissolved fe 2 some enhancement in the effectiveness of ps activation by iron oxides was observed as the proportion of feii relative to feiii increased 3 the activation of ps by iron oxides does not depend on mineralogy ssa or the presence of surface oh groups 4 crystalline inhomogeneities or structural irregularities are the most important determinant of the activation properties of a given iron oxide 5 significant dissolution of iron oxides up to 5 mg l for 0 1 g l iron oxide suspensions accompanied activation of ps by iron oxides and the extent of dissolution like ps activation was influenced more by structural irregularities than by mineralogy or ssa 6 the mode of iron oxide activation of ps is predominantly homogeneous which implies a strong ph dependence as fe has limited solubility under non acidic conditions 7 for unbuffered alkaline condition ps alone was more effective in degrading the target pollutant than ps activated by iron oxide or dissolved fe 8 no evidence was found for the common claim that iron oxides are more effective than dissolved fe in activating ps at circumneutral conditions 9 under a buffered neutral condition neither iron oxide nor dissolved fe effectively activated ps 10 phosphate buffer significantly retarded pollutant degradation by fe activated or unactivated ps it is important to extend this study to fe hydroxides due to their abundance in the subsurface more work is still required for a fuller understanding of the interaction between ionic fe and ps under non acidic conditions finally further research is required to characterise and quantify the contribution of the structural defects of iron oxides to ps activation acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by victoria university to ike ikechukwu

1653,a novel approach using foam to manage hazardous waste was successfully demonstrated under active site conditions the purpose of the foam was to divert groundwater flow that would normally enter the source zone area to reduce dissolved contaminant release to the aquifer during the demonstration foam was pre generated and directly injected surrounding the chlorinated solvent source zone despite the constraints related to the industrial activities and non optimal position of the injection points the applicability and effectiveness of the approach have been highlighted using multiple metrics a combination of measurements and modelling allowed definition of the foam extent surrounding each injection point and this appears to be the critical metric to define the success of the foam injection approach information on the transport of chlorinated solvents in groundwater showed a decrease of contaminant flux by a factor of 4 4 downstream of the confined area the effective permeability reduction was maintained over a period of three months the successful containment provides evidence for consideration of the use of foam to improve traditional flushing techniques by increasing the targeting of contaminants by remedial agents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam groundwater chlorinated solvents in situ dnapl containment 1 introduction contamination of soil and groundwater by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls remains a major challenge for site managers extensive research has been carried out highlighting the inherent difficulties of removing dnapls from heterogeneous aquifers traditional flushing techniques or pump and treat suffer limitations with respect to removing contaminant due to the chemical properties of dnapls low solubility high density high low viscosity and the aquifer configuration i e heterogeneity in heterogeneous aquifers liquids used for remediation tend to flow through the most permeable layers and residual dnapls can often remain tapped in low permeability zones mobility control has emerged as a promising alternative technique to enhance the recovery of dnapls by using a low mobility agent i e high viscosity such as polymers giese and powers 2002 martel et al 1998 2004 robert et al 2006 or surfactant foam hirasaki et al 1997 longpré girard et al 2016 maire et al 2015 maire and fatin rouge 2017 rothmel et al 1998 wang and mulligan 2004 to improve the sweep efficiency in aquifers foam appears as a suitable candidate for mobility control to support remedial goals foam was originally used for enhanced oil recovery eor surfactant stabilized lamellae are responsible of trapping gas in a discontinuous form by the creation of fine bubbles bikerman 1973 foam is defined as strong if gas bubbles occupy all of the pore space while it is weak if some gas channels exist rossen 1996 schramm 1994 one of the benefits of using foam in environmental remediation er is its ability to act as a selective permeability reduction agent bertin et al 1999 kovscek and bertin 2003 bertin et al 2017 demonstrated in 2d laboratory pilot tests that foam is generated in the high permeability layer and subsequently diverts flow towards the low permeability region using a tracer test bertin et al 2017 demonstrated that the generation of foam into porous media leads to the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity where the foam is in place this process was also confirmed by singh and mohanty 2017 a field demonstration of the foam er process was successfully conducted by hirasaki et al 1997 where foam was used to block high permeability zones to divert the subsequent surfactant flushing into low permeability zones to improve the recovery of trapped dnapls hirasaki et al selected an optimal field site to demonstrate foam effectiveness hill air force base utah ou2 site at the ou2 site dnapl was located in a buried channel incised into the underlying aquitard that provided favourable conditions to propagate foam these authors however did not assess the radius of influence of the injected foam the objective of the present study was to use foam as a blocking agent to confine a source zone of chlorinated solvents mainly trichloroethylene tce the blocking ability of foam was used to divert groundwater flow around the source zone area the second objective was to present tools to assess the foam extent and the reduction of contaminants moving into the aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 site characterization the study site is an active factory of 26 ha where several contaminants chlorinated solvents btex mineral oil have been found in soil and groundwater the study is focused on one specific contamination event around 1980 from a storage tank containing tce since 2013 given the apparent complexity of the system iterative modelling and well drilling was conducted to target the source zone and design the foam injection the location of wells was driven by constrains typical of an active industrial site such as machinery work areas or various underground networks mainly electrical the identified dnapl source zone is located in the quaternary aquifer fig s1 soil and water analyses combined with hydrogeological modelling helped to approximately delineate the extent of the tce source zone using pumping and slug tests the hydraulic conductivity field was determined prior to foam injection heterogeneities were observed visually by analysing drilling cuttings and was observed through hydraulic conductivity measurements to vary by more than one order of magnitude fig 1 darcy flux in the study zone ranged from 5 to 15 cm day two dominant clay layer zones were identified by modelling using piezometers 128 125 129 and 114 injection of foam in low permeability zones requires higher injection pressures and also risks soil heaving and soil fracturing gauglitz et al 2002 khatib et al 1988 based on these concerns we choose to inject foam to surround the source zone by only injecting in the relatively high permeability zones the quaternary aquifer lies on an impervious aquitard in the injection area transfer of groundwater contaminant between the quaternary and tertiary aquifers is avoided in this area moreover the quaternary aquifer is also confined at the top in the source zone area with the exception of the region near piezometer 133 these characteristics allowed for the use of foam in the aquifer 2 2 foam characterisation initial laboratory experiments consisted of a series of foam floods in a 1d column where foam was pre generated before flowing through a 10 darcy homogeneous sand grain diameter ranged from 0 25 to 0 50 mm table s1 the aim of this series of measurements was to define parameters leading to the generation of a strong foam in order to increase the efficiency of liquid displacement the impact on foam generation of surfactant concentration foam quality which is the ratio between air and water flow rate and fluid flow rates were investigated in order to select suitable conditions to generate strong foam kam and rossen 2003 gauglitz et al 2002 the setup used for the 1d column experiments comprised a 12 cm long 3 5 cm diameter homogeneous sandpack a syringe pump and a bronkhorst el flow f 201cv gas flow controller was used to inject surfactant solution and gas into the system respectively during the injection process the foam s effectiveness was determined by monitoring the pressure drop over the sandpack using idroscan aep transducers the pressure drop results are given as resistance factors rf which is the ratio of the steady state pressure drop during the period of foam injection compared to that obtained during a single phase waterflood at the same flow rate higher rf implies a more effective foam liquid production and residual water saturation were calculated by weighting the column rf p foam p water observed at the same flow rate then a darcy experiment was conducted by injecting pressurized water between 0 6 and 1 2 bar in relative pressure to measure the relative permeability to water in the two phase system foam water scaling to the water flood experiment in a saturated column allowed calculation of krw 2 3 design of injection the injection wells drilled for this study 126 127 130 131 132 133 had an inside diameter of 80 mm with a stainless steel casing injection wells were 7 5 m deep and screened over a height of 2 m corresponding to the thickness of the targeted aquifer to avoid air leaks to the surface each injection well was isolated using bentonite sealing over 2 m above the screen and a steel lid at the surface lids were modified to allow recording of the injection pressure and to allow injection of foam in the surfactant selection process the site management required the use of a biodegradable surfactant additionally the surfactant was selected to render the remediation economically feasible based on laboratory results and krw reduction a surfactant mixture of sodium laureth sulfate cocamidopropyl betain and lauryl glucoside were selected these surfactants were commonly tested separately in the literature gauglitz et al 2002 ma et al 2012 maire et al 2015 because of the good foaming performance the biodegradability of the mixture and the relative low cost for large amounts of product to avoid solubilisation and mobilization of chlorinated solvents or wasting too much surfactant in high hydraulic conductivity zones renkema and rossen 2007 no pre saturation of the aquifer with surfactant solution was performed in order to limit the size and cost of the injection material a single foam generator was connected to two injection wells fig s2 injection line il1 for wells 127 and 131 injection line il2 for wells 130 133 injection line il3 for wells 126 and 132 based on the water flow rate and the surfactant mass injected into the delivery line the surfactant concentration delivered in wells was easily calculated this configuration permitted regulation of the surfactant concentration to increase the foaming performance with regard to the injection pressure fig s2 in other words if the pressure was too low we could increase the surfactant concentration to enhanced foaming performance during the process the surfactant concentration was maintained over a range of 0 3 0 9 wt 4 to 14 times the critical micellar concentration cmc of capb and a foam quality ranging from 95 to 99 based on laboratory experiments air was supplied by an air compressor and air pressure and gas flow rates were regulated by the operator the air flow rate and liquid flow rate with dissolved surfactant were recorded and displayed in terms of fluxes at atmospheric pressure foam quality was established by using the air flow and water flow controllers relative pressure was continually recorded in each well with pressure transducers aep transducers 2 4 performance evaluation several test were conducted at different times before and after the foam injection immediately after the foam injection t1 1 month after foam injection t 1m and 3 months after foam injection t 3m 2 4 1 slug tests slug tests are often used to determine the hydraulic conductivity surrounding a well slug tests were performed before and after foam injection t1 and t 3m in order to evaluate the efficiency of foam in the immediate vicinity of the injection well the slug tests conducted were mechanical using a low volume of water 2 5 l in order to observe an instantaneous change the water level changes during the test were monitored using a pressure transducer placed at the bottom of the well drawdown curves for each well were analysed using the bouwer and rice 1976 solution bouwer 1989 to calculate the hydraulic conductivity k 2 4 2 pumping test in order to define the radius of foam influence a pumping test was conducted 1 month after foam injection t 1m well 38 located in the centre of the

measurement caution was taken to prevent displacement of the pressure sensor over the duration of the pump test and the extraction flow rate was continuously measured to support interpretation of the results we developed a 2d groundwater flow model using the numerical model modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 the model extent was 100 m length and 100 m width grid size resolution was locally refined near well 38 to reach a cell size equal to the diameter of the pumping well to represent the foam in the aquifer we positioned different hydraulic conductivity zones with a given k and storage coefficient s around the injection wells the size and position of the zones as well as the values of k and s were varied in order to simultaneously fit all of the monitored drawdown curves this was done manually since several tests for automatic fitting were unsuccessful 2 4 3 targeted sampler the targeted samplers used in this study and presented in fig 2 were developed by innovasol for low hydraulic conductivity settings the tools provide three windows for sampling groundwater each separated by small packers during sampling before the foam injection and 3 months after the foam injection all pumps were simultaneously activated to extract water from each horizontal layer to avoid communication between the filter pack of the piezometer and each layer 2 4 4 passive flux meter the passive flux meter pfm was developed by hatfield et al 2004 to measure contaminant and groundwater fluxes in the saturated zone fields tests have demonstrated the use of this tools for measuring groundwater and chlorinated solvents fluxes annable et al 2005 basu et al 2006 calculating groundwater and contaminant fluxes requires the evaluation of the mass fraction of resident tracers lost and the mass of contaminant sorbed on activated carbon extraction of organic constituents following annable et al 2005 were performed and analysis were carried out using gc ms wells 117 118 134 and 135 located downstream of the predicted foam blocked area were selected as monitoring wells to measure fluxes before and after foam injection in order to characterize flux changes pfms were deployed for a period of 15 days prior to the foam injection based on the expected groundwater velocity at the site based on groundwater velocity calculated in the first campaign we installed pfms 3 months later t 3m during a 28 day period in order to observe the reduction of fluxes downstream of the foam confined area pfm concentration results were compared to traditional groundwater sampling and analysis targeted sampler method 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory columns in order to select a strong foam several tests were conducted in the column by changing the concentration of surfactant two trends were observed increasing surfactant concentration implies higher rf until reaching a plateau at 0 6 0 75 wt with a rf equal to 38 foam quality fq was set at 99 based on these results foam was injected into a sand column fq 95 total flow rate qt 10 ml min and surfactant concentration 0 75 wt and residual water saturations were measured at sw 0 17 after 5 pore volume pv of foam injection darcy experiments were conducted following foam flooding and showed a reduction of the foam krw by 3 orders of magnitude krw 0 0015 for sw 0 23 after the water injection test strong foams are needed to enhance fluid displacement but pressure constrains are an important factor in order to avoid soil heaving and fracturing the above cited experiments suggest that field injection could be realized with the following specifications concentration range 0 3 0 9 wt and foam quality range from 95 to 99 3 2 pressure and rate histories during field injection the field site injection pressure air and water flow rates are provided in fig 3 foam injection was performed continually during a 96 h period the first 24 h allowed the injection system to be established and ensure the validity of the injected flows and to regulate the system so that it operates independently at 67 h the surfactant tank was empty leading to the injection of only air and water into the aquifer this event can be seen on the pressure record with a drop in all the injection pathways then the injection was shut down for 30 min based on the injection pressure record we fixed the air flow rate water flow rate and surfactant concentration to 1 avoid high pressure because the design of the injection was built in order to inject below 3 bar by reducing flow rates for instance at 47 h on il1 the pressure reached 3 bar fig 3 we decreased air flow rate from 35 l min to 12 l min water flow rate was also decreased from 0 35 l min to 0 07 l min 2 increase the injection pressure to generate a strong foam by increasing flow rates and surfactant concentration on il2 to satisfy the generation of a strong foam we increased the surfactant concentration at 9 h and total flow rates at 48 h in each case this change was followed by a significant increase in pressure the first indication of the foaming performance is the increase of the injection pressure in all injection lines for il2 injection pressure increased during the first 12 h before reaching a maximum of 2 55 bar subsequently the pressure stabilized around 1 8 1 9 bar until the end of the injection period 3 3 injected volume based on the air and water flow at atmospheric pressure the foam volume injected into piezometers can be approximated assuming that for a given injection line all air is transformed to foam and that foam is homogenously injected in both piezometers a theoretical radius of foam penetration ranging from 4 to 7 m is calculated table s2 this calculation might be reduced due to gas segregation farther from the injection well rossen et al 2010 shi and rossen 1998 and due to heterogeneities renkema and rossen 2007 shi and rossen 1998 suggest that maintaining a high horizontal pressure gradient increases the distance from the injection well where gas segregates from the foam thus the calculated volume and radius may be the maximum possible based on simulations 3 4 slug tests results the slug tests provide a quick overview of the success of the injection near the injection wells field observation showed that all injection piezometers were completely dry just after the end of the foam injection test because the recovery of water was quite long more than 14 h to reach initial water levels for the fastest recoveries slug tests could not be performed in piezometers 132 126 130 127 fig s3 provides an indication of the time required to displace a given volume of water before and after foam injection calculated hydraulic conductivity using bouwer and rice 1976 solution bouwer 1989 are provided in table 1 reduction factors of k higher than 100 were measured right after the foam injection indicating the presence of foam around the injection well the persistence of foam was characterized by slug test measurements after 3 months with a k reduction over 10 these measurements show the local efficiency of the foam injection but do not provide information about the foam radius of influence 3 5 pumping test the first modelling step was to fit the observed drawdowns at the pumping well 38 and monitoring wells 126 127 128 130 131 132 133 using an initial hydraulic conductivity field pre foam injection the model provided a good reproduction of the drawdown when using an average hydraulic conductivity of 1 6 10 4 m s 1 and a classical value for the storage coefficient 10 4 following foam injection the heads observed at the foam injection wells required significantly different values of both hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient due to the presence of foam we thus established a low hydraulic conductivity zone to define the influence of foam and its propagation within the aquifer for a zone around each injection well the estimated radius of those zones were first input considering the injected foam volume however in order to reproduce the drawdown curves it was necessary to individually fit the diameter of the foam zone for each injection well indeed a sensitivity analysis fig s4 showed that the shape of the drawdown curve was mainly related to the diameter and position of the foam zone while only the maximum drawdown was linked to the hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient fig 4 due to this sensitivity and the interactions of foam zones as they blocked a part of the flow automated parameter estimation hydraulic conductivity k storage coefficient s and foam size and position through pest was unsuccessful the drawdown curves were quite different from what may occur in a natural aquifer with a fast response but a very small amplitude one well 130 shows a difference between the measured and modelled value which may be due to the presence of a very low hydraulic conductivity zone leading to values that may not be at equilibrium with the rest of the aquifer the fitted foam zone radii ranged between 2 0 and 3 2 m fig 5 calculated drawdowns only matched observed data when foam zones were smaller than those estimated based on injected foam volume and with a very low hydraulic conductivity value range from 9 2 10 9 to 1 0 10 10 m s 1 the fitted storage coefficient for foam are higher than the original value in the aquifer range between 2 10 3 and 5 10 2 which may be related to the presence of air in the foam 3 6 passive flux meter and targeted sampler results following methods from annable et al 2005 darcy fluxes were calculated for each pfm layer the permeability contrast between the aquifer and the pfm leads to convergent or divergent flow and were taken into account based on strack and haitjema 1981 equation annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 the pfm placed in a well screen induces a coefficient alpha representing the convergence of the aquifer flow due to the contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer range between 1 10 5 and 5 10 5 m s 1 and the hydraulic conductivity of the pfm 5 10 3 m s 1 applying the convergence equation from annable et al 2005 α was set equal to 2 using the chlorinated solvent mass accumulation on each pfm layer the deployment period and the α coefficient provides the average mass flux of chlorinated solvents expressed in mmol m 2 day 1 during the sampling campaign concentrations were also obtained with the use of targeted sampling the fluxes for this method were calculated by multiplying these concentrations by darcy velocity measured by pfms traditional groundwater samples represent an instantaneous snapshot of the contamination while pfm gives a temporal integration of the mass flux results of both pfm and targeted sampler were plotted before and after the foam injection in terms of total fluxes integrated over the thickness of the aquifer fig 6 vertical distributions are given in supplementary information fig s5 total molar concentrations of all chlorinated solvents cs calculated for the pfms was globally in the same range as the analysis of groundwater from classical sampling techniques except 118 which is lower for traditional sampling and analysis all monitoring wells recorded a decrease of chlorinated solvents fluxes ranging between 39 and 206 mmol m 2 day 1 the maximum reduction was recorded for well 117 at one order of magnitude from 51 to 5 mmol m 2 day 1 the reduction factor ranged between 4 5 well 135 and 6 1 well 118 after foam injection the concentration gradient was maintained with a maximum in well 135 and a decline further west as the results of well 118 were difficult to interpret we defined the reduction factor based on the three other wells which sum up to a value of approx 265 mmol m 2 day 1 for both techniques before the injection and an average of 60 mmol m 2 day 1 after the injection 47 for targeted sampler and 76 for pfm or a reduction factor of approximately 4 4 corresponding to t 3m the total flux measurement highlighted the significant impact of foam injection downstream of the confined area these results are confirmed by modelling the source dissolution with and without foam the foam model was used to calculate the dissolved flux of cs delivered form the source zone fig 7 by considering an estimated source zone dimension and a fixed concentration at the source boundary by only using the calibration obtained with pumping test data correspond to t 1m the flux was reduced by a factor of 3 05 due to foam injection which is similar to the reduction based on flux measurements up gradient of the foam injection area a certain percentage of groundwater was diverted around the confined area that lead to the reduction of the mobilisation of chlorinated solvents even if the area was not completely confined as suggested by the 2d groundwater flow model therefore foam clearly acts as a hydraulic barrier and leads to the reduction of contaminant fluxes downstream of this area 3 7 foam efficiency although the reduction of cs flux is significant the results show that the injected foam did not block the entire area the blocked areas have a very low hydraulic conductivity i e lowered by a factor of more than 100 laboratory experiments showed that the reduction of krw was linked to a lower water saturation of the porous medium during foam injection portois et al 2018 showed that this effect seems to occur only after injection of several pore volumes it is therefore possible that the foam identified in the flow model is the only part where the water saturation is close to residual leading to very low krw values the first pvs of injected foam could thus be a weak foam and have limited effect on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium portois et al 2018 this is not considered in the flow model and could play some role justifying the higher downgradient cs fluxes in the model rather than those measured the overall foam efficiency could be improved using two approaches a different mixture of surfactant that decreases the weak foam effect or injecting at higher velocity to favour the strong foam rossen and gauglitz 1990 or by using surfactant alternating gas sag boeije and rossen 2014 hirasaki et al 1997 shan and rossen 2002 shi and rossen 1998 4 conclusions surfactant foams were shown to be a very effective permeability reduction strategy and was used for the confinement of a chlorinated solvents source zone foam injection was performed over a 96 h period using a commercial mixture applying the foaming formulation investigated in this study provided drastic reduction in hydraulic conductivity to water over a 100 fold over several meters around injections wells a modelling procedure allowed estimation of the foam size and extent of penetration through the aquifer with a maximum radius of 3 2 m pfm measurements recorded the highest flux reduction 206 mmol m 2 day 1 in well 117 and documenting the efficiency of foam for management a contaminant source zone here foam was demonstrated as a confinement agent further study is needed to evaluate the economics of foam combined with conventional remediation techniques the impact of foam on the residence time of oxidizing reductive or biological agents must be clarified acknowledgments the authors want to thank m momtbrun and p

1653,a novel approach using foam to manage hazardous waste was successfully demonstrated under active site conditions the purpose of the foam was to divert groundwater flow that would normally enter the source zone area to reduce dissolved contaminant release to the aquifer during the demonstration foam was pre generated and directly injected surrounding the chlorinated solvent source zone despite the constraints related to the industrial activities and non optimal position of the injection points the applicability and effectiveness of the approach have been highlighted using multiple metrics a combination of measurements and modelling allowed definition of the foam extent surrounding each injection point and this appears to be the critical metric to define the success of the foam injection approach information on the transport of chlorinated solvents in groundwater showed a decrease of contaminant flux by a factor of 4 4 downstream of the confined area the effective permeability reduction was maintained over a period of three months the successful containment provides evidence for consideration of the use of foam to improve traditional flushing techniques by increasing the targeting of contaminants by remedial agents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam groundwater chlorinated solvents in situ dnapl containment 1 introduction contamination of soil and groundwater by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls remains a major challenge for site managers extensive research has been carried out highlighting the inherent difficulties of removing dnapls from heterogeneous aquifers traditional flushing techniques or pump and treat suffer limitations with respect to removing contaminant due to the chemical properties of dnapls low solubility high density high low viscosity and the aquifer configuration i e heterogeneity in heterogeneous aquifers liquids used for remediation tend to flow through the most permeable layers and residual dnapls can often remain tapped in low permeability zones mobility control has emerged as a promising alternative technique to enhance the recovery of dnapls by using a low mobility agent i e high

rothmel et al 1998 wang and mulligan 2004 to improve the sweep efficiency in aquifers foam appears as a suitable candidate for mobility control to support remedial goals foam was originally used for enhanced oil recovery eor surfactant stabilized lamellae are responsible of trapping gas in a discontinuous form by the creation of fine bubbles bikerman 1973 foam is defined as strong if gas bubbles occupy all of the pore space while it is weak if some gas channels exist rossen 1996 schramm 1994 one of the benefits of using foam in environmental remediation er is its ability to act as a selective permeability reduction agent bertin et al 1999 kovscek and bertin 2003 bertin et al 2017 demonstrated in 2d laboratory pilot tests that foam is generated in the high permeability layer and subsequently diverts flow towards the low permeability region using a tracer test bertin et al 2017 demonstrated that the generation of foam into porous media leads to the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity where the foam is in place this process was also confirmed by singh and mohanty 2017 a field demonstration of the foam er process was successfully conducted by hirasaki et al 1997 where foam was used to block high permeability zones to divert the subsequent surfactant flushing into low permeability zones to improve the recovery of trapped dnapls hirasaki et al selected an optimal field site to demonstrate foam effectiveness hill air force base utah ou2 site at the ou2 site dnapl was located in a buried channel incised into the underlying aquitard that provided favourable conditions to propagate foam these authors however did not assess the radius of influence of the injected foam the objective of the present study was to use foam as a blocking agent to confine a source zone of chlorinated solvents mainly trichloroethylene tce the blocking ability of foam was used to divert groundwater flow around the source zone area the second objective was to present tools to assess the foam extent and the reduction of contaminants moving into the aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 site characterization the study site is an active factory of 26 ha where several contaminants chlorinated solvents btex mineral oil have been found in soil and groundwater the study is focused on one specific contamination event around 1980 from a storage tank containing tce since 2013 given the apparent complexity of the system iterative modelling and well drilling was conducted to target the source zone and design the foam injection the location of wells was driven by constrains typical of an active industrial site such as machinery work areas or various underground networks mainly electrical the identified dnapl source zone is located in the quaternary aquifer fig s1 soil and water analyses combined with hydrogeological modelling helped to approximately delineate the extent of the tce source zone using pumping and slug tests the hydraulic conductivity field was determined prior to foam injection heterogeneities were observed visually by analysing drilling cuttings and was observed through hydraulic conductivity measurements to vary by more than one order of magnitude fig 1 darcy flux in the study zone ranged from 5 to 15 cm day two dominant clay layer zones were identified by modelling using piezometers 128 125 129 and 114 injection of foam in low permeability zones requires higher injection pressures and also risks soil heaving and soil fracturing gauglitz et al 2002 khatib et al 1988 based on these concerns we choose to inject foam to surround the source zone by only injecting in the relatively high permeability zones the quaternary aquifer lies on an impervious aquitard in the injection area transfer of groundwater contaminant between the quaternary and tertiary aquifers is avoided in this area moreover the quaternary aquifer is also confined at the top in the source zone area with the exception of the region near piezometer 133 these characteristics allowed for the use of foam in the aquifer 2 2 foam characterisation initial laboratory experiments consisted of a series of foam floods in a 1d column where foam was pre generated before flowing through a 10 darcy homogeneous sand grain diameter ranged from 0 25 to 0 50 mm table s1 the aim of this series of measurements was to define parameters leading to the generation of a strong foam in order to increase the efficiency of liquid displacement the impact on foam generation of surfactant concentration foam quality which is the ratio between air and water flow rate and fluid flow rates were investigated in order to select suitable conditions to generate strong foam kam and rossen 2003 gauglitz et al 2002 the setup used for the 1d column experiments comprised a 12 cm long 3 5 cm diameter homogeneous sandpack a syringe pump and a bronkhorst el flow f 201cv gas flow controller was used to inject surfactant solution and gas into the system respectively during the injection process the foam s effectiveness was determined by monitoring the pressure drop over the sandpack using idroscan aep transducers the pressure drop results are given as resistance factors rf which is the ratio of the steady state pressure drop during the period of foam injection compared to that obtained during a single phase waterflood at the same flow rate higher rf implies a more effective foam liquid production and residual water saturation were calculated by weighting the column rf p foam p water observed at the same flow rate then a darcy experiment was conducted by injecting pressurized water between 0 6 and 1 2 bar in relative pressure to measure the relative permeability to water in the two phase system foam water scaling to the water flood experiment in a saturated column allowed calculation of krw 2 3 design of injection the injection wells drilled for this study 126 127 130 131 132 133 had an inside diameter of 80 mm with a stainless steel casing injection wells were 7 5 m deep and screened over a height of 2 m corresponding to the thickness of the targeted aquifer to avoid air leaks to the surface each injection well was isolated using bentonite sealing over 2 m above the screen and a steel lid at the surface lids were modified to allow recording of the injection pressure and to allow injection of foam in the surfactant selection process the site management required the use of a biodegradable surfactant additionally the surfactant was selected to render the remediation economically feasible based on laboratory results and krw reduction a surfactant mixture of sodium laureth sulfate cocamidopropyl betain and lauryl glucoside were selected these surfactants were commonly tested separately in the literature gauglitz et al 2002 ma et al 2012 maire et al 2015 because of the good foaming performance the biodegradability of the mixture and the relative low cost for large amounts of product to avoid solubilisation and mobilization of chlorinated solvents or wasting too much surfactant in high hydraulic conductivity zones renkema and rossen 2007 no pre saturation of the aquifer with surfactant solution was performed in order to limit the size and cost of the injection material a single foam generator was connected to two injection wells fig s2 injection line il1 for wells 127 and 131 injection line il2 for wells 130 133 injection line il3 for wells 126 and 132 based on the water flow rate and the surfactant mass injected into the delivery line the surfactant concentration delivered in wells was easily calculated this configuration permitted regulation of the surfactant concentration to increase the foaming performance with regard to the injection pressure fig s2 in other words if the pressure was too low we could increase the surfactant concentration to enhanced foaming performance during the process the surfactant concentration was maintained over a range of 0 3 0 9 wt 4 to 14 times the critical micellar concentration cmc of capb and a foam quality ranging from 95 to 99 based on laboratory experiments air was supplied by an air compressor and air pressure and gas flow rates were regulated by the operator the air flow rate and liquid flow rate with dissolved surfactant were recorded and displayed in terms of fluxes at atmospheric pressure foam quality was established by using the air flow and water flow controllers relative pressure was continually recorded in each well with pressure transducers aep transducers 2 4 performance evaluation several

velocity measured by pfms traditional groundwater samples represent an instantaneous snapshot of the contamination while pfm gives a temporal integration of the mass flux results of both pfm and targeted sampler were plotted before and after the foam injection in terms of total fluxes integrated over the thickness of the aquifer fig 6 vertical distributions are given in supplementary information fig s5 total molar concentrations of all chlorinated solvents cs calculated for the pfms was globally in the same range as the analysis of groundwater from classical sampling techniques except 118 which is lower for traditional sampling and analysis all monitoring wells recorded a decrease of chlorinated solvents fluxes ranging between 39 and 206 mmol m 2 day 1 the maximum reduction was recorded for well 117 at one order of magnitude from 51 to 5 mmol m 2 day 1 the reduction factor ranged between 4 5 well 135 and 6 1 well 118 after foam injection the concentration gradient was maintained with a maximum in well 135 and a decline further west as the results of well 118 were difficult to interpret we defined the reduction factor based on the three other wells which sum up to a value of approx 265 mmol m 2 day 1 for both techniques before the injection and an average of 60 mmol m 2 day 1 after the injection 47 for targeted sampler and 76 for pfm or a reduction factor of approximately 4 4 corresponding to t 3m the total flux measurement highlighted the significant impact of foam injection downstream of the confined area these results are confirmed by modelling the source dissolution with and without foam the foam model was used to calculate the dissolved flux of cs delivered form the source zone fig 7 by considering an estimated source zone dimension and a fixed concentration at the source boundary by only using the calibration obtained with pumping test data correspond to t 1m the flux was reduced by a factor of 3 05 due to foam injection which is similar to the reduction based on flux measurements up gradient of the foam injection area a certain percentage of groundwater was diverted around the confined area that lead to the reduction of the mobilisation of chlorinated solvents even if the area was not completely confined as suggested by the 2d groundwater flow model therefore foam clearly acts as a hydraulic barrier and leads to the reduction of contaminant fluxes downstream of this area 3 7 foam efficiency although the reduction of cs flux is significant the results show that the injected foam did not block the entire area the blocked areas have a very low hydraulic conductivity i e lowered by a factor of more than 100 laboratory experiments showed that the reduction of krw was linked to a lower water saturation of the porous medium during foam injection portois et al 2018 showed that this effect seems to occur only after injection of several pore volumes it is therefore possible that the foam identified in the flow model is the only part where the water saturation is close to residual leading to very low krw values the first pvs of injected foam could thus be a weak foam and have limited effect on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium portois et al 2018 this is not considered in the flow model and could play some role justifying the higher downgradient cs fluxes in the model rather than those measured the overall foam efficiency could be improved using two approaches a different mixture of surfactant that decreases the weak foam effect or injecting at higher velocity to favour the strong foam rossen and gauglitz 1990 or by using surfactant alternating gas sag boeije and rossen 2014 hirasaki et al 1997 shan and rossen 2002 shi and rossen 1998 4 conclusions surfactant foams were shown to be a very effective permeability reduction strategy and was used for the confinement of a chlorinated solvents source zone foam injection was performed over a 96 h period using a commercial mixture applying the foaming formulation investigated in this study provided drastic reduction in hydraulic conductivity to water over a 100 fold over several meters around injections wells a modelling procedure allowed estimation of the foam size and extent of penetration through the aquifer with a maximum radius of 3 2 m pfm measurements recorded the highest flux reduction 206 mmol m 2 day 1 in well 117 and documenting the efficiency of foam for management a contaminant source zone here foam was demonstrated as a confinement agent further study is needed to evaluate the economics of foam combined with conventional remediation techniques the impact of foam on the residence time of oxidizing reductive or biological agents must be clarified acknowledgments the authors want to thank m momtbrun and p

1654,remediation of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls represents a challenging issue because of their persistent behaviour in the environment this pilot scale study investigates by means of in situ experiments and numerical modelling the feasibility of the pulsed pumping process of a large amount of a dnapl in an alluvial aquifer the main compound of the dnapl is hexachlorobutadiene hcbd added in 2015 to the persistent organic pollutants list pop a low permeability keyed enclosure was built at the location of the dnapl source zone in order to isolate a finite volume of soil and a 3 month pulsed pumping process was applied inside the enclosure to exclusively extract the dnapl the water dnapl interface elevation at both the pumping well and an observation well was recorded the cumulated pumped volume of dnapl was also monitored a total volume of about 20 m3 of pure dnapl was recovered since no water was extracted during the process the three dimensional and multiphase flow simulator tmvoc was used and a conceptual model was elaborated and generated with the pre post processing tool mview numerical simulations reproduce the pulsed pumping process and show an excellent match between simulated and field data of dnapl cumulated pumped volume and a reasonable agreement between modelled and observed data for the evolution of the water dnapl interface elevations at the two wells this study offers a new perspective in remediation since dnapl pumping system optimisation may be performed where a large amount of dnapl is encountered keywords dnapl multiphase numerical modelling in situ pulsed pumping hexachlorobutadiene porous media tmvoc 1 introduction in france chlorinated organic compounds are responsible of about 15 of soils and groundwater contamination ademe 2014 they are commonly referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls pankow et al 1996 denser than water with a very low water solubility they migrate under pressure and gravity forces through the vadose zone and the aquifer until reaching a low permeability barrier mercer and cohen 1990 their behaviour and fate have been studied since the 1980s de marsily 1981 lyman et al 1982 mackay et al 1985 parker et al 1987 kueper and frind 1988 schwille 1988 kueper et al 1989 parker 1989 wilson et al 1990 mercer and cohen 1990 cohen and mercer 1993 and dnapls are still subject to prolific scientific environmental publication see e q chen et al 2014 mobile et al 2016 xie et al 2016 zhu and sun 2016 several chlorinated organic compounds encountered in this study are of much concern as records of the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pop list hexachlorobenzene hcbz unep 2005 pentachlorobenzene qcbz unep 2009 and recently hexachlorobutadiene hcbd unep 2015 hcbd is the main compound of the dnapl found at our study site hcbd is an anthropic compound which has a very low solubility in water of 2 55 mg l 1 montgomery and welkom 1990 and which is an excellent solvent for many organic substances mcbee and hatton 1949 in the past it was used in different technical and agricultural applications such as an insecticide smoke in french vineyards ineris 2005b but now it is unintentionally formed and released from industrial processes and other sources such as the production of certain chlorinated hydrocarbons unep 2016 hcbd presence in europe has been monitored for a long time whereas hcbd was identified in 1976 in fish from inland waters fed by the rhine goldbach et al 1976 forty years later hcbd is obviously of no concern in german freshwaters any more fliedner et al 2016 it does not seem to be of widespread concern in the english rivers jürgens et al 2013 it was detected in eels in scotland macgregor et al 2010 and belgium roose et al 2004 but not detected in arctic vorkamp and rigét 2014 in north america it has been detected in louisiana noble et al 1998 and in canada in surface waters sediments aquatic organisms and occasionally air taylor et al 2003 recently hcbd has been studied and detected in china tang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 an estimated total amount of 7350 kg was unintentionally produced during the methanol based production of chlorinated methanes in 2010 zhang et al 2015 hcbd had been detected and assessed in soils in taiwan area for nearly a decade lee and fang 1997 lee et al 2000 2005 therefore hcbd was detected in industrialised countries and is still unintentionally produced leading to a potential threat to the environment and human health this study deals with the 3d numerical interpretation of an in situ pulsed pumping experiment of a large dnapl pool conducted within a low permeability keyed enclosure where a very large amount of dnapl is present its valuable interest relies on the large volume of free product dnapl extracted from a shallow alluvial aquifer at a pilot scale in situ enclosure and on an efficiency analysis of a pumping hydraulically isolated from the surrounding dnapl pool and groundwater to the best knowledge of the authors this field scale study is the first one to deal with the field scale pumping of a large pool of dnapl combined with its numerical modelling for several reasons first the very large dnapl pool on site estimated at around 30000m3 is unique and justifies the use of pumping technique then the dnapl encountered at the study site can be extracted efficiently under forced hydraulic gradient thanks to its high mobility finally the alluvial geology characterised by the absence of high clay content which prevents the absorption of a large amount of dnapl while the field proven pump and treat technique has been applied to groundwater contaminated with dnapls cherry et al 1996 mackay et al 2000 soga et al 2004 brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2013 saenton and illangasekare 2013 zhao et al 2013 chen et al 2014 mobile et al 2016 xie et al 2016 cherry et al 1996 stated that some pools are large enough to allow pumping of free product dnapl from wells screened at the bottom of the pool meanwhile under the most favourable circumstances free product pumping recovers at most one half to two thirds of the dnapl leaving abundant dnapl acting as a long term source the general industrial and historical contexts of the site is first presented and shows the selection of this unique contaminated area in france after a description of the experimental data obtained during the pulsed pumping process in a keyed enclosure the numerical model run with the tmvoc simulator is presented calculations of the dnapl volume initially present in the compartment yield an alteration of the conceptual model by introducing a leaky behaviour of the enclosure to reproduce the observed data for this purpose a sensitivity analysis on intrinsic permeabilities was performed to obtain more realistic simulations of the pumping experiment 2 study site and industrial background 2 1 industrial and historical contexts of the study site the study site is located in the vicinity of a chlorine based chemical factory in the city of tavaux france the factory first produced in 1930 sodium carbonate and derivative products plus chlorine since the 1950s plastic compounds based on the chlorine chemistry were produced for instance polyvinyl chloride pvc was first produced in 1953 between 1964 and 1986 chlorinated organic residues were stored in a clay lined waste containment facility during the 1970s a plume composed of chlorides and halogenated organic compounds was discovered in the groundwater downstream from the factory the source of the pollution was identified as a leakage of the landfill in 1975 a pump and treat facility was implemented to limit and control the spatial extension of the dissolved contamination in 1987 a free phase pool of volatile organic halogenated compounds vohc was discovered on top of the bedrock at 10 m depth at the location of the keyed enclosure site the total mass of accumulated dnapl is estimated at 50000 tons of vohc basol 2015 mainly hexachlorobutadiene hcbd spread out over 10 ha 2 2 study site description 2 2 1 geological context the geological context which is summarised here can be found in more details in fleury et al 1982 the regional geological formations from the bottom to the top are described 1 auvillars marls these clayey marls of characteristic blue grey colour represent the substratum of the aquifer their hydraulic conductivity in the order of 10 9 m s makes them a low permeability formation this formation is the substratum of the aquifer and acts as an aquitard 2 saint cosme formation fine sands with a hydraulic conductivity lower than 10 4 m s 3 quaternary alluvial deposits more or less clayey sands and gravel stones alluvial deposits with a hydraulic conductivity between 10 4 m s and 10 2 m s and highly depending on the proportion of clay in the sands and gravel stones 4 modern alluvium superficial clays and loams from floods with a low hydraulic conductivity between 10 10 m s and 10 7 m s a soil sampling campaign was conducted to determine the composition of the geological formations at the study site the four regional formations cited above are all found on site the substratum of the aquifer is at 12 m below ground level therefore at 178 m asl above sea level 2 2 2 keyed enclosures or compartments the dnapl source zone pool has a surface extension of several thousands of square meters it has been decided to install keyed enclosures in order to isolate hydraulically a part of the dnapl from the remaining parts of the aquifer to work on a closed and controlled environment the site of the keyed enclosures was selected north west of the containment basins where the dnapl source zone was supposed to be largely present data from the soil sampling survey see section 2 2 1 and a geophysical survey was used to identify the best location for the keyed enclosures they consist of four cubic compartments 10 m wide and 10 m deep with slurry walls embedded into the substratum the latter made of marls of low hydraulic permeability the four compartments c1 c2 c3 and c4 are aligned next to each other and form a rectangle of 10 m wide by 40 m long see fig 1 due to the substratum elevation at around 178 m asl the length of the blade of the trenchmix machine of 10 m long and the level of 190 m asl of the natural ground an excavation of 2 m depth was dug in order for the base of the compartments to be located within the substratum the dimension of the excavation is 30 m wide by 60 m long fig 1 shows the location of the compartments into the excavation pulsed pumping experiment of the dnapl was made in the c4 compartment c4 compartment is equipped with a pumping well and four observation wells shown in fig 2 c4p pumping well bottom is located 3 26 m within the substratum where a pneumatic pump is installed the pneumatic pump is a ssp cm from silex international c4p casing starts from groundlevel down to 4 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 4 m below groundlevel to the substratum casing finishes the c4p well from the substratum until the bottom of c4p the very large volume of free phase dnapl encountered on site investing the pores of the saint cosme sands formation falls down to the bottom of the c4p well where the pneumatic pump lies the dnapl fills the c4p well up to the water dnapl interface more than 1 m above the substratum hence the pneumatic pump is submerged within dnapl only observation wells c4a to c4d are located at the corners of the compartment at a 1 5 m equidistant length from the walls c4a and c4d casings start from groundlevel down to 4 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 4 m below groundlevel to the substratum c4b and c4c casings start from groundlevel down to 6 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 6 m below groundlevel to the substratum recording was done only at c4p and c4d the substratum at the location of the southern wall of c4 might be lower than 178 m asl therefore the 10 m deep southern wall might not be totally embedded into the substratum and the keyed enclosure might be leaky this assumption is tested below see section 5 2 3 pulsed pumping process experiment 3 1 pumping protocol the pulsed pumping process was controlled at the c4p pumping well by two fixed pressure loggers installed within c4p in order to pump exclusively dnapl one logger is set below the water dnapl interface between the pump and the substratum elevation hence within dnapl only the other one is set above the water dnapl interface within groundwater only if the measured pressure in the dnapl are lower than the given value related to the water dnapl interface elevation the pump stops until the required water dnapl interface elevation value is recovered after running tests the average cycle was made by a 10s pumping period followed by a 150 s recovery stage the pulsed pumping process took place between 21 07 2015 and 27 10 2015 for a total duration of 98 days the overall instantaneous pumping yields are depicted in fig 3 3 2 experimental results since the pneumatic pump was installed at the bottom of the c4p pumping well and the cycles were controlled by pressure loggers exclusively free phase dnapl was pumped without any groundwater contribution a total cumulated volume of 20 049m3 of dnapl was extracted at the end of the pulsed pumping process free product dnapl is temporarily stored in a container of 1 m 3 on site depicted in fig 4 when full the container is emptied and the dnapl is sent for incineration the temporal evolution of the dnapl cumulated pumped volume is shown in fig 11 water dnapl interface elevation was calculated by measuring the differential pressures recorded by the two fixed pressure loggers in each well both in the c4p pumping well and the c4d observation well see section 3 1 due to issues encountered on site data between 20 09 2015 and 07 10 2015 must be rejected and hence is not displayed as the pressure loggers were moved perturbed by the presence of mud or were not functioning correctly the record of the water dnapl interface elevation at c4p is depicted in fig 3 the initial and final interface elevations are 178 96 m asl and 179 07 m asl respectively the initial and final thickness of dnapl above the substratum at c4p are 1 32 m and 1 43 m the substratum is at 177 64 m asl and the bottom of c4p is at 174 38 m asl the general decreasing trend of the interface elevation starts from the beginning of the pulsed pumping until 08 10 2015 when the pumping stops during this period the interface elevation response to the frequent stimulations is rapid with up and down movements closely following the pulsed pumping cycles between 17 08 2015 and 19 09 2015 the minimum values of the interface elevation oscillate around 177 64 m asl the control elevation corresponding to the substratum elevation at c4p during the final recovery period from 08 10 2015 until the end of the recorded period interface elevation rises rapidly until reaching a slightly increasing linear trend correlation between interface elevation evolution and pulsed pumping yields is illustrated in fig 3 the temporal evolution of the water dnapl interface elevation at c4d is also shown in fig 3 the initial and final interface elevations are respectively 179 09 m asl and 178 36 m asl the initial and final thickness of dnapl above the substratum at c4d are 1 01 m and 0 28 m the substratum is at 178 08 m asl and the bottom of c4d is at 176 44 m asl the interface elevation decreases almost monotonically until 08 10 2015 when the pumping stops during this period a clear effect of the pumping is observed since the interface responds closely in frequency to the pulsed yields and recovery periods however amplitudes much lower than the ones recorded in c4p are observed because of the distance between c4p and c4d and the quadratic losses not present in c4d well in general over the 3 month pumping process the interface elevation in c4d corresponds to the upper envelop of the oscillations recorded in c4p as shown in fig 3 during the final recovery period from 08 10 2015 until the end of recording interface elevation follows a slight increasing trend similar to the one in c4p for both c4p and c4d the interface elevation rises at an average rate of 5 5 mm d 1 in the wells between 10 10 2015 and 27 10 2015 4 numerical modelling approach 4 1 tmvoc model and dnapl compounds implementation tmvoc is a numerical simulator for three phase non isothermal flow of water soil gas and a multicomponent mixture of volatile organic chemicals in a multidimensional heterogeneous porous media pruess and battistelli 2002 it is an extension of the tough2 general purpose simulation program developed at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory tmvoc is designed for applications to contamination problems that involve hydrocarbon fuel or organic solvent spills in saturated or unsaturated zones it is able to simulate contaminant behaviour under natural environmental conditions battistelli 2004 battistelli and pruess 2005 fagerlund and niemi 2007 battistelli 2008 jung et al 2011 yang et al 2012 lari et al 2016 lekmine et al 2017 as well as engineered systems such as co2 sequestration zheng et al 2013 or steam assisted source remediation chen et al 2012 tmvoc was recently combined with the tough suite simulators into the unique parallel and inverse software tough3 jung et al 2016 in this study the 2 0 tmvoc version was used studied dnapl is made of eleven compounds listed in table 1 hexachlorobutadiene hcbd hexachloroethane hca tetrachloroethylene pce pentachlorobenzene qcbz perchlorocyclopentene occp carbon tetrachloride ctec tetrachlorobenzene tecbz trichloroethylene tce pentachloroethane qca hexachlorobenzene hcbz and trichloroethane teca eight out of the eleven compounds representing 87 5 of dnapl are modelled since full data required for tmvoc is not available for three compounds qcbz occp and tecbz the physico chemical input parameters for tmvoc are listed for the eight selected compounds in the table a 1 in appendix at the first stage of numerical building we wanted to spill the dnapl as a single component with properties that reflect the mixture it would have reduced the equations to be solved but no satisfying volume averaging formalism to describe the overall properties of the mixture were identified to allow a simple input in tmvoc therefore dnapl is treated as a multi component mixture 4 2 hydrogeological units and parameters of the model three hydrogeological units are modelled the substratum the fine sand layer and the alluvial deposits hydraulic parameters for the substratum are taken as follows porosity is 15 and intrinsic hydraulic permeability is 4 10 14 m2 barret 2014 a soil sample of fine sands was collected in a non contaminated area of the study site the sand sample was sieved to select a fraction between 0 8 mm and 8 mm the measured sand porosity is 36 and the measured intrinsic hydraulic permeability is 1 10 10 m2 water dnapl retention curve for this sand sample was determined experimentally for this study and is presented in fig 5 data correspond to the calculated mean of the primary and secondary drainage imbibition measured cycles measured water maximum saturation is 93 66 leading to a measured dnapl residual saturation of 6 34 the parameters for the alluvial deposits are taken from maire et al 2015 i e a porosity of 35 and an intrinsic hydraulic permeability of 4 10 11 m2 the water air retention curve values by maire et al 2015 were also used the two phase experimental retention data for the fine sand and the alluvial deposits was interpolated with the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 then the previous two phase van genuchten parameters were modified to meet the three phase function tmvoc requirements using the scaling method described in fagerlund et al 2006 three phase capillary and relative permeability functions used in tmvoc come from parker et al 1987 and are 1 s g s g 1 s rw 2 s w s w s rw 1 s rw 3 s s w s n s rw 1 s rw 4 m 1 1 n 5 α gn

relative permeabilities respectively ρ w is the density of water and g the gravitational constant it should be noted that the three phase model of parker induces a water maximal saturation of one leading to a zero residual saturation of dnapl this assumption will be discussed in the conclusions the parameters to be entered in tmvoc are s rw n α gn and α nw and are given in table 2 4 3 conceptual model geologic logging from 39 boreholes are used to describe by kriging with the leapfrog software the topography of the geological layers tops of the substratum and the fine sand layer both shown in fig 6 alluvial deposits are also modelled and start from the top of the fine sand layer to end at 178 m asl the mview software was used to build the geometrical model of the c4 compartment we consider a 3d cartesian numerical model depicted in fig 7 consisting of 10 horizontal square numerical layers of variable thickness made of 22 rows and 23 columns for a total of 5060 grid blocks the substratum is made of the two basal numerical layers the fine sands lay above the substratum on one numerical layer and the six upper numerical layers represent the alluvial deposits the topmost numerical layer representing the atmosphere is 0 001 m thick it allows the vaporisation of volatile napls and maintain atmospheric conditions of pressure and temperature for the calculations of unsaturated zone conditions the model grid is refined around the wells three spatial areas are considered in the model the interior of the compartment 9 25 m long the compartment walls 0 4 m wide and a belt of 0 5 m wide surrounding the walls considering the 0 5 m width belt around the compartment will enable the analysis of the leaky enclosure assumption see below section 5 2 the total length of the model is 11 05 m and its total height is 14 m starting at 174 m asl and culminating at 188 m asl vertical grid spacing is between several centimetres to metres and horizontal xy grid spacing is between 0 06 m and 1 37 m 4 3 1 a simple realistic well model a simple realistic well model is used for the c4p pumping and the c4d observation wells the inner volumes of the wells are respected as well as the locations of the screened interval and the casing the wells are described by a fictitious porous medium characterised by a porosity of 99 99 a zero capillary pressure a vertical intrinsic permeability of 10 8 ms 1 the same horizontal intrinsic permeability value as the surrounding layer around the well grid blocks and the simple following relative permeability

phase for numerical calculations in the shallow unsaturated zone both in porous media and in the wells especially during the spill of dnapl where water level rises see section 4 3 3 4 3 2 initial interior dnapl volume estimation 4 3 2 1 theoretical expression of the dnapl volume the dnapl pool encountered on site lies on the top of an aquitard the auvillars marls as described in section 2 2 1 the vertical distribution of capillary pressure p cnw at a given location x y within a dnapl pool above an aquitard is given by mcwhorter and kueper 1996 19 p cnw δ ρg t x y z where t x y is the thickness of the dnapl pool at the location x y δρ ρ nw ρ w with ρ nw the density of dnapl and z the vertical axis positive upwards from the top of the aquitard the vertical variation of capillary pressure through the dnapl pool as described by eq 19 is readily translated into a vertical distribution of fluid saturations using the capillary pressure saturation function described by eq 9 substituting eq 19 into eq 9 gives the explicit expression of water saturation as a function of z 20 z t p 0 δ ρg s w s rw 1 s rw 1 m 1 n with p 0 ρ w g α nw once the thickness t x y of the dnapl pool is known across the horizontal contaminated domain it is possible to estimate the volume of dnapl in the pool by evaluating mcwhorter and kueper 1996 21 v nw t x y ϕ 0 t x y 1 s w dz the volume of dnapl per unit area for a fixed value of dnapl thickness t x y with ϕ the porosity of the porous medium substituting eq 20 into eq 21 gives the explicit expression of v nw t x y 22 v nw t x y ϕ 0 t x y 1 1 s rw δ ρg p 0 t z n m s rw dz finally the total volume of a variable thickness dnapl pool is given by integrating eq 22 across the whole horizontal contaminated domain 23 v nw x y v nw t x y d x d y 4 3 2 2 estimation of dnapl volume in order to estimate the initial dnapl volume in c4 the thickness and the corresponding contaminated domain of the dnapl pool must be calculated dnapl thickness is the difference between the elevation of the upper surface of the pool and the substratum elevation we assume that the upper surface of the dnapl pool is at the same elevation as the water dnapl interface in c4p and c4d wells this assumption could be criticised under certain conditions but according to mcwhorter and kueper 1996 since the c4p and c4d wells are terminated at the base of the pool and the dnapl has experienced a lowering of its upper surface following the halt of the dnapl source the accidental spillage of the dnapl stopped after the source was exhausted the water dnapl interfaces measured in the c4p and c4d wells correspond to the upper surface of the dnapl pool initial water dnapl interface elevations at the beginning of the pumping process are 178 96 m asl and 179 09 m asl in c4p and c4d respectively no information is available at c4a c4b nor c4c as these monitoring wells were not available for this experiment the average interface elevation 179 025 m asl corresponds to the initial upper surface elevation of the dnapl pool assumed homogeneous across the whole domain fine sands are supposed to be the only materials to be invaded by the dnapl fig 8 shows the calculated dnapl thickness in c4 and its corresponding area based on an elevation of 179 025 m asl of the upper surface of the dnapl pool and the interpolated substratum top elevation see section 4 3 maximum thickness t max is 1 374 m one must give an approximation of eq 23 to estimate the volume of dnapl across the whole horizontal contaminated domain the dnapl pool area is discretized using the grid spacing of the fig 8 with horizontal space steps δx δy 0 1 m each interpolated thickness value t i j at node i j is used to compute by the gauss legendre method v nw t i j given by eq 22 this value is multiplied by the grid cell surface δs δx δy 0 01 m2 yielding the dnapl volume at each grid cell finally the total dnapl volume is given by the sum of the dnapl volume of each grid cell across the whole contaminated domain calculations give an initial dnapl volume within c4 of 6 182m3 leading to an initial dnapl volume of 8 372 m 3 across the whole domain including the 0 5 m wide belt surrounding the compartment which will be used below see section 5 2 4 3 3 boundary conditions and initial state before pumping of dnapl since the initial conditions used in tmvoc the pressure and the saturation of each phase and the mole fractions of the compounds in the different phases are unknown a first step consists in reproducing the domain filled with both water and dnapl to obtain a plausible initial state therefore before running pulsed pumping process simulations injection of the initial dnapl volume laying in the c4 compartment must be made in order to finally reproduce the water dnapl interface elevations measured in c4p and c4d wells see section 4 3 2 this step is made in five stages partial filling with water of the domain prior to introduction of dnapl dnapl spill in the saturated zone at the bottom of the aquifer within the fine sand layer redistribution of dnapl within the whole domain building of the compartment walls described below redistribution of dnapl inside and outside the compartment necessary for the section 5 2 heat transfer is neglected and thus the simulations are isothermal at a temperature of 12 c and no flux neumann conditions apply to the bottom and the four lateral sides of the model for all of the simulations of this study no precipitation is included in the model since it is negligible all over the pumping process c4 compartment is first partially filled with water to anticipate the future volume of dnapl to be numerically injected see section 4 3 2 for this first stage starting from a dry state dirichlet atmospheric conditions are assigned to the topmost elements of the grid and dirichlet single phase boundary conditions are assigned to the fourth top layer of the mesh with an appropriate water pressure to reproduce by gravity capillary pressure a water table level at 186 62 m asl for the whole domain the other grid blocks are made active the second stage the dnapl injection stage uses the final conditions of the first stage as initial conditions the dnapl injection is made into the fine sand layer grid blocks chronologically the eight compounds were first injected all together for 7 days the simulation reached a steady state and stopped unexpectedly before simulated 7 days we do not have an explanation for these numerical issues therefore it has been decided to inject the dnapl compounds sequentially in order of their proportion for 7 days for each injection in the following order 1 hcbd 2 hca 3 pce 4 tecc 5 tce qca hcbz and teca simulations were complete with this exploratory method for this sequential dnapl injection stage dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the rising of the water level due to the injection of the dnapl up to the initial water level of 187 5 m asl observed at the site the third stage simulates the redistribution of the dnapl and the water until equilibrium is reached i e 120 days here again dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the redistribution of the water and the dnapl the fourth stage simulates the building of the walls for this purpose wall material properties are affected to the soil grid blocks located at the walls position dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active finally the fifth stage simulates the redistribution of the dnapl and the water both inside and outside the compartment until equilibrium is reached i e 45 days here again dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the redistribution of the water and the dnapl the redistribution runs are necessary to reproduce the recessions of the dnapl before and after the construction of the compartment walls 5 results and discussion 5 1 fully low permeability keyed enclosure assumption this section deals with the assumption of a fully low permeability keyed enclosure for the c4 compartment with its impermeable walls totally embedded within the substratum as seen above see section 4 3 2 the estimated interior initial dnapl volume in c4 is 6 089m3 however final dnapl cumulated pumped volume was 20 049 m 3 which is substantially higher than the estimated volume the results of the simulation concerning the fully low permeability keyed enclosure are shown below 5 1 1 simulated pumping process description in order to discuss the efficiency of a pulsed pumping in a fully keyed enclosure exploratory pumping process simulation is run to assess the behaviour of dnapl within a c4 compartment assumed isolated simulation follows the experiment description in section 3 pulsed pumping process is applied to the c4p well grid cell located within the substratum elevation of the pumping grid cell is between 174 38 m and 177 67 m asl hence the middle of the pumping cell is at 176 02 m asl pulsed pumping yields are calculated from daily pumped dnapl volumes and functioning durations of the pump mass pumping yields are applied allowing the theoretical pumping of both water and dnapl the latter being the only pumped phase during the experiment measured and simulated water dnapl interface elevations are given in fig 9 and fig 10 for c4p and c4d wells respectively and simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl are given in fig 11 5 1 2 results of the exploratory simulation except from the beginning of the pumping to 02 08 2015 or 08 08 2015 where the simulated data for pumped volume and water dnapl interfaces are in very good agreement with the experimental data in general simulated data does not match the experimental one after 03 08 2015 simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl reach a plateau with a lower value than the observed pumped dnapl volume of 20 049m3 during the simulation water was extracted which is in contradiction with the field experiment where no water was recovered during the pumping between 02 08 2015 and 08 08 2015 the interface elevation at c4p drops rapidly to a minimum plateau value at around 174 38 m asl the c4p bottom elevation see fig 9 as soon as the interface drops it rises and falls following the pulsed pumping process it rises when the pump is off as the dnapl is allowed to redistribute itself above the substratum and re enter the well without being pumped and falls down to reach the c4p bottom when the pump is functioning as the dnapl entering the well is instantly pumped and cannot accumulate at the bottom of the well finally when almost all the dnapl is pumped interface elevation stays close to the c4p bottom from the beginning simulated interface elevation in c4d is lower than the experimental data and the decreasing trend rate is faster than in the experiment see fig 10 dnapl is mobilised too rapidly towards the c4p well interface elevation reaches a low plateau value at around 178 70 m asl before 04 08 2015 5 1 3 efficiency of the exploratory simulation in the case of the impermeable keyed enclosure at the end of the simulated pulsed pumping process 6 070 m 3 of dnapl are finally extracted while 0 112 m 3 remained inside the compartment therefore the pulsed pumping process efficiency would be 98 2 after three months considering all the conceptual assumptions which is extremely high the high mobility of the dnapl partially explains this result it also must be noted that water has been extracted from 03 08 2015 and from this date the dnapl recovery rate drops dramatically at 03 08 2015 after only about thirteen days of pumping 5 160 m 3 of dnapl are extracted representing 85 of 6 070 m 3 and five days later on 09 08 2015 95 of the extracted simulated dnapl volume were recovered finally on 31 08 2015 after forty one days of pumping 99 of 6 070 m 3 were recovered depending on the efficiency targets pumping could have been stopped after forty one days reducing the process time by 58 and thus the process costs compared to the three month pumping 5 1 4 c4 a fully low permeability keyed enclosure the average value of the initial simulated interface elevations at c4p and c4d is 179 02 m asl and does match the average value of the experimental data hence initial calculated volume of dnapl within the interior of the c4 compartment is likely correct however neither simulated water dnapl interface elevations nor simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl are in agreement with the experimental data hence an entering massic flux of dnapl into the c4 compartment must be considered to reproduce the final cumulated pumped volume of dnapl the assumption of a low permeability keyed enclosure must be questioned 5 2 leaking keyed enclosure assumption 5 2 1 c4 a leaky enclosure the model must be corrected to introduce a leaky behaviour of the c4 compartment southern wall as seen in section 2 2 2 c4 southern wall might not be totally embedded into the substratum making the interior of c4 connected with the surrounding dnapl pool we assume that only a part of the southern wall bottom ends into the altered fine sand layer and that the three other walls are fully embedded into the substratum southern wall grid cells which bottom is lower than 178 m asl minimum elevation of the bottom of the walls are replaced by fine sand layer ones to reproduce the vertical gap between the substratum and the bottom of the wall this gap of perturbed porous media between the substratum and the bottom of the wall is called the breach and its height is 0 965 m in the model due to grid spacing real vertical gap is about 0 1 m because the estimated altitude of the low point below the southern wall is at around 177 9 m asl therefore we consider dirichlet conditions for the surrounding belt grid blocks outside the four walls where pressure and saturation values of the dnapl pool and the groundwater come from the section 4 3 3 the four walls are assigned the same very low permeability as in the fully keyed compartment see section 5 1 except the gap in the southern wall the updated geometry of the model is shown in fig 12 since the value of the breach permeability is unknown exploratory simulations must be run to better reproduce the experimental data therefore a 1d parameter space of the breach permeability is explored by means of a simple sensitivity analysis 5 2 2 calibration of the breach permeability against data several simulations were run to determine the best value of the breach permeability to describe the quality of the simulations the root mean square errors rmse for the interface elevations and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume are used a total of 10 simulations see fig 13 are run to explore the 1d parameter space of the breach permeability simulations are labelled sim a to sim j where the breach permeability starts from 1 10 12 m2 for sim a to 1 10 11 m2 for sim j with a 1 10 12 m2 increment simulations are run on a intel core i7 7820 hq cpu at 2 90 ghz calculation durations of the 10 runs vary from 2 49 h to 5 46 h with a median value of 3 67 h therefore a total calculation duration of 40 h was needed to run the 10 simulations 5 2 3 results of the calibration both qualitative and quantitative criteria must be taken into account in order to identify the simulation showing the closest agreement with the experimental data in particular as discussed in section 3 2 pulsed pumping process was designed for exclusive dnapl recovery without any water extracted however only for sim a water was also pumped alongside dnapl thus this simulation must be rejected for the determination of the best simulation quantitative criteria are the rmse for the dnapl cumulated pumped volume and the interface elevations at c4p and c4d rmse values for the interface elevations and the cumulated volume are respectively depicted in fig 13a and b interface elevations at c4d show a weak sensitivity to permeability since the rmse values vary from 0 170 m to 0 218 m conversely interface elevations at c4p are strongly influenced by the position within the 1d parameter space since the rmse values vary from 0 661 m to 1 056 m the dnapl cumulated pumped volume shows high variations in the course of the sampling in the 1d parameter space since the rmse varies from 0 107 m 3 to 0 926m3 determination of the closest simulation is based on the 9 remaining simulations for which water was not extracted during the pulsed pumping process rmse analysis on the interface elevations at c4d at c4p and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume shows that sim d should be considered as the simulation closest to the experimental data simulated data of sim d for the interface elevations at c4p and c4d and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume are depicted in figs 9 11 sim d interface elevations at c4p match at first order the observed data the frequency of the oscillations is respected meaning that the pulsed pumping process is perfectly reproduced however the amplitude of simulated data does not correspond perfectly to the observed one since the simulated data reach neither the bottom points during pumping conversely the initial and final interface elevations do correspond to the observed data concerning the simulation of the interface elevation at c4d results are not as fairly good in comparison to c4p although from the beginning to 15 09 2015 the absolute error is less than 0 2 m simulated values after 15 09 2015 do not match the observed interface levels as for c4p the observed frequency is respected but the amplitude of simulated data is lower than the measured one one explanation relies on the fact that the model layers are homogeneous while more heterogeneous natural alluvial deposits drive the flow of both water and dnapl towards the c4p well following preferable hydraulic paths the results for cumulated pumped volume of dnapl are very close to the experimental values for sim d the final simulated cumulated volume is 19 783m3 representing a relative error of 1 33 compared to the measured value of 20 049 m3 5 2 4 conclusion on the assumption of a leaky enclosure we demonstrated that the assumption of a leaky enclosure with a breach in the southern wall of the c4 compartment allows a better simulation of the observed data the optimised parameters for the intrinsic permeabilities of the breach were obtained through 10 simulation runs the modelled intrinsic permeability of the breach is 4 10 12 m2 corresponding to the perturbed medium where fine sand wall and traces of substratum materials are mixed together during the building of the compartments finally the corresponding horizontal intrinsic permeability of the real breach is in fact about 4 10 11 m2 considering the real height of the breach 6 conclusions this pilot scale study is part of the silphes project a technology demonstrator aiming the development of innovative solutions for vohc polluted site remediation we focus here on a treatment method we investigate by means of in situ experiments and numerical modelling the feasibility of the pulsed pumping process of a large amount of a dnapl pool in an alluvial aquifer the dnapl is made of eleven compounds and the main one is hexachlorobutadiene hcbd a low permeability keyed enclosure was built at the location of the dnapl source zone and a three month pulsed pumping process was applied inside the enclosure to exclusively extract the dnapl the temporal variation of the water dnapl interface elevations at both the pumping and an observation wells and of the cumulated pumped volume of dnapl were recorded a total volume of about 20m3 of purely dnapl were recovered since no water was extracted during the process we were able to reproduce the dnapl cumulated pumped volume and the water dnapl interface elevations at the two wells simulations show an excellent agreement between field and simulated data for extracted dnapl free product volumes the lower but reasonable agreement between simulated and observed interface elevations at the two wells c4p and c4d might be improved using the well model developed by sleep et al 2015 to better reproduce the amplitude of the oscillations especially in the pumping well c4p the lack of hysteretic behaviour for the capillary pressure function and the absence of dnapl residual saturation can be corrected for future studies with the functions developed by doughty 2013 to improve the model it should be noted that eight out of eleven compounds were modelled and the behaviour of the dnapl is treated as a mix of vohc and not as a single compound dnapl one the main findings is provided in the appendix and summarised in table 3 i e the values of the physico chemical properties required by tmvoc should the following compounds be encountered on site hexachlorobutadiene hcbd hexachloroethane hca tetrachloroethylene pce carbon tetrachloride ctec trichloroethylene tce pentachloroethane qca hexachlorobenzene hcbz and trichloroethane teca finally this study offers a new perspective in remediation assessment of groundwater contaminated with a large amount of dnapl since pumping system optimisation may be performed to reduce costs as seen in section 5 1 3 pumping process duration could have been reduced by 58 still recovering 99 of the

1654,remediation of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls represents a challenging issue because of their persistent behaviour in the environment this pilot scale study investigates by means of in situ experiments and numerical modelling the feasibility of the pulsed pumping process of a large amount of a dnapl in an alluvial aquifer the main compound of the dnapl is hexachlorobutadiene hcbd added in 2015 to the persistent organic pollutants list pop a low permeability keyed enclosure was built at the location of the dnapl source zone in order to isolate a finite volume of soil and a 3 month pulsed pumping process was applied inside the enclosure to exclusively extract the dnapl the water dnapl interface elevation at both the pumping well and an observation well was recorded the cumulated pumped volume of dnapl was also monitored a total volume of about 20 m3 of pure dnapl was recovered since no water was extracted during the process the three dimensional and multiphase flow simulator tmvoc was used and a conceptual model was elaborated and generated with the pre post processing tool mview numerical simulations reproduce the pulsed pumping process and show an excellent match between simulated and field data of dnapl cumulated pumped volume and a reasonable agreement between modelled and observed data for the evolution of the water dnapl interface elevations at the two wells this study offers a new perspective in remediation since dnapl pumping system optimisation may be performed where a large amount of dnapl is encountered keywords dnapl multiphase numerical

2014 they are commonly referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls pankow et al 1996 denser than water with a very low water solubility they migrate under pressure and gravity forces through the vadose zone and the aquifer until reaching a low permeability barrier mercer and cohen 1990 their behaviour and fate have been studied since the 1980s de marsily 1981 lyman et al 1982 mackay et al

solvent for many organic substances mcbee and hatton 1949 in the past it was used in different technical and agricultural applications such as an insecticide smoke in french vineyards ineris 2005b but now it is unintentionally formed and released from industrial processes and other sources such as the production of certain chlorinated hydrocarbons unep 2016 hcbd presence in europe has been monitored for a long time whereas hcbd was identified in 1976 in fish from inland waters fed by the rhine goldbach et al 1976 forty years later hcbd is obviously of no concern in german freshwaters any more fliedner et al 2016 it does not seem to be of widespread concern in the english rivers jürgens et al 2013 it was detected in eels in scotland macgregor et al 2010 and belgium roose et al 2004 but not detected in arctic vorkamp and rigét 2014 in north america it has been detected in louisiana noble et al 1998 and in canada in surface waters sediments aquatic organisms and occasionally air taylor et al 2003 recently hcbd has been studied and detected in china tang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 an estimated total amount of 7350 kg was unintentionally produced during the methanol based production of chlorinated methanes in 2010 zhang et al 2015 hcbd had been detected and assessed in soils in taiwan area for nearly a decade lee and fang 1997 lee et al 2000 2005 therefore hcbd was detected in industrialised countries and is still unintentionally produced leading to a potential threat to the environment and human health this study deals with the 3d numerical interpretation of an in situ pulsed pumping experiment of a large dnapl pool conducted within a low permeability keyed enclosure where a very large amount of dnapl is present its valuable interest relies on the large volume of free product dnapl extracted from a shallow alluvial aquifer at a pilot scale in situ enclosure and on an efficiency analysis of a pumping hydraulically isolated from the surrounding dnapl pool and groundwater to the best knowledge of the authors this field scale study is the first one to deal with the field scale pumping of a large pool of dnapl combined with its numerical modelling for several reasons first the very large dnapl pool on site estimated at around 30000m3 is unique and justifies the use of pumping technique then the dnapl encountered at the study site can be extracted efficiently under forced hydraulic gradient thanks to its high mobility finally the alluvial geology characterised by the absence of high clay content which prevents the absorption of a large amount of dnapl while the field proven pump and treat technique has been applied to groundwater contaminated with dnapls cherry et al 1996 mackay et al 2000 soga et al 2004 brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2013 saenton and illangasekare 2013 zhao et al 2013 chen et al 2014 mobile et al 2016 xie et al 2016 cherry et al 1996 stated that some pools are large enough to allow pumping of free product dnapl from wells screened at the bottom of the pool meanwhile under the most favourable circumstances free product pumping recovers at most one half to two thirds of the dnapl leaving abundant dnapl acting as a long term source the general industrial and historical contexts of the site is first presented and shows the selection of this unique contaminated area in france after a description of the experimental data obtained during the pulsed pumping process in a keyed enclosure the numerical model run with the tmvoc simulator is presented calculations of the dnapl volume initially present in the compartment yield an alteration of the conceptual model by introducing a leaky behaviour of the enclosure to reproduce the observed data for this purpose a sensitivity analysis on intrinsic permeabilities was performed to obtain more realistic simulations of the pumping experiment 2 study site and industrial background 2 1 industrial and historical contexts of the study site the study site is located in the vicinity of a chlorine based chemical factory in the city of tavaux france the factory first produced in 1930 sodium carbonate and derivative products plus chlorine since the 1950s plastic compounds based on the chlorine chemistry were produced for instance polyvinyl chloride pvc was first produced in 1953 between 1964 and 1986 chlorinated organic residues were stored in a clay lined waste containment facility during the 1970s a plume composed of chlorides and halogenated organic compounds was discovered in the groundwater downstream from the factory the source of the pollution was identified as a leakage of the landfill in 1975 a pump and treat facility was implemented to limit and control the spatial extension of the dissolved contamination in 1987 a free phase pool of volatile organic halogenated compounds vohc was discovered on top of the bedrock at 10 m depth at the location of the keyed enclosure site the total mass of accumulated dnapl is estimated at 50000 tons of vohc basol 2015 mainly hexachlorobutadiene hcbd spread out over 10 ha 2 2 study site description 2 2 1 geological context the geological context which is summarised here can be found in more details in fleury et al 1982 the regional geological formations from the bottom to the top are described 1 auvillars marls these clayey marls of characteristic blue grey colour represent the substratum of the aquifer their hydraulic conductivity in the order of 10 9 m s makes them a low permeability formation this formation is the substratum of the aquifer and acts as an aquitard 2 saint cosme formation fine sands with a hydraulic conductivity lower than 10 4 m s 3 quaternary alluvial deposits more or less clayey sands and gravel stones alluvial deposits with a hydraulic conductivity between 10 4 m s and 10 2 m s and highly depending on the proportion of clay in the sands and gravel stones 4 modern alluvium superficial clays and loams from floods with a low hydraulic conductivity between 10 10 m s and 10 7 m s a soil sampling campaign was conducted to determine the composition of the geological formations at the study site the four regional formations cited above are all found on site the substratum of the aquifer is at 12 m below ground level therefore at 178 m asl above sea level 2 2 2 keyed enclosures or compartments the dnapl source zone pool has a surface extension of several thousands of square meters it has been decided to install keyed enclosures in order to isolate hydraulically a part of the dnapl from the remaining parts of the aquifer to work on a closed and controlled environment the site of the keyed enclosures was selected north west of the containment basins where the dnapl source zone was supposed to be largely present data from the soil sampling survey see section 2 2 1 and a geophysical survey was used to identify the best location for the keyed enclosures they consist of four cubic compartments 10 m wide and 10 m deep with slurry walls embedded into the substratum the latter made of marls of low hydraulic permeability the four compartments c1 c2 c3 and c4 are aligned next to each other and form a rectangle of 10 m wide by 40 m long see fig 1 due to the substratum elevation at around 178 m asl the length of the blade of the trenchmix machine of 10 m long and the level of 190 m asl of the natural ground an excavation of 2 m depth was dug in order for the base of the compartments to be located within the substratum the dimension of the excavation is 30 m wide by 60 m long fig 1 shows the location of the compartments into the excavation pulsed pumping experiment of the dnapl was made in the c4 compartment c4 compartment is equipped with a pumping well and four observation wells shown in fig 2 c4p pumping well bottom is located 3 26 m within the substratum where a pneumatic pump is installed the pneumatic pump is a ssp cm from silex international c4p casing starts from groundlevel down to 4 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 4 m below groundlevel to the substratum casing finishes the c4p well from the substratum until the bottom of c4p the very large volume of free phase dnapl encountered on site investing the pores of the saint cosme sands formation falls down to the bottom of the c4p well where the pneumatic pump lies the dnapl fills the c4p well up to the water dnapl interface more than 1 m above the substratum hence the pneumatic pump is submerged within dnapl only observation wells c4a to c4d are located at the corners of the compartment at a 1 5 m equidistant length from the walls c4a and c4d casings start from groundlevel down to 4 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 4 m below groundlevel to the substratum c4b and c4c casings start from groundlevel down to 6 m below groundlevel screen interval starts from 6 m below groundlevel to the substratum recording was done only at c4p and c4d the substratum at the location of the southern wall of c4 might be lower than 178 m asl therefore the 10 m deep southern wall might not be totally embedded into the substratum and the keyed enclosure might be leaky this assumption is tested below see section 5 2 3 pulsed pumping process experiment 3 1 pumping protocol the pulsed pumping process was controlled at the c4p pumping well by two fixed pressure loggers installed within c4p in order to pump exclusively dnapl one logger is set below the water dnapl interface between the pump and the substratum elevation hence within dnapl only the other one is set above the water dnapl interface within groundwater only if the measured pressure in the dnapl are lower than the given value related to the water dnapl interface elevation the pump stops until the required water dnapl interface elevation value is recovered after running tests the average cycle was made by a 10s pumping period followed by a 150 s recovery stage the pulsed pumping process took place between 21 07 2015 and 27 10 2015 for a total duration of 98 days the overall instantaneous pumping yields are depicted in fig 3 3 2 experimental results since the pneumatic pump was installed at the bottom of the c4p pumping well and the cycles were controlled by pressure loggers exclusively free phase dnapl was pumped without any groundwater contribution a total cumulated volume of 20 049m3 of dnapl was extracted at the end of the pulsed pumping process free product dnapl is temporarily stored in a container of 1 m 3 on site depicted in fig 4 when full the container is emptied and the dnapl is sent for incineration the temporal evolution of the dnapl cumulated pumped volume is shown in fig 11 water dnapl interface elevation was calculated by measuring the differential pressures recorded by the two fixed pressure loggers in each well both in the c4p pumping well and the c4d observation well see section 3 1 due to issues encountered on site data between 20 09 2015 and 07 10 2015 must be rejected and hence is not displayed as the pressure loggers were moved perturbed by the presence of mud or were not functioning correctly the record of the water dnapl interface elevation at c4p is depicted in fig 3 the initial and final interface elevations are 178 96 m asl and 179 07 m asl respectively the initial and final thickness of dnapl above the substratum at c4p are 1 32 m and 1 43 m the substratum is at 177 64 m asl and the bottom of c4p is at 174 38 m asl the general decreasing trend of the interface elevation starts from the beginning of the pulsed pumping until 08 10 2015 when the pumping stops during this period the interface elevation response to the frequent stimulations is rapid with up and down movements closely following the pulsed pumping cycles between 17 08 2015 and 19 09 2015 the minimum values of the interface elevation oscillate around 177 64 m asl the control elevation corresponding to the substratum elevation at c4p during the final recovery period from 08 10 2015 until the end of the recorded period interface elevation rises rapidly until reaching a slightly increasing linear trend correlation between interface elevation evolution and pulsed pumping yields is illustrated in fig 3 the temporal evolution of the water dnapl interface elevation at c4d is also shown in fig 3 the initial and final interface elevations are respectively 179 09 m asl and 178 36 m asl the initial and final thickness of dnapl above the substratum at c4d are 1 01 m and 0 28 m the substratum is at 178 08 m asl and the bottom of c4d is at 176 44 m asl the interface elevation decreases almost monotonically until 08 10 2015 when the pumping stops during this period a clear effect of the pumping is observed since the interface responds closely in frequency to the pulsed yields and recovery periods however amplitudes much lower than the ones recorded in c4p are observed because of the distance between c4p and c4d and the quadratic losses not present in c4d well in general over the 3 month pumping process the interface elevation in c4d corresponds to the upper envelop of the oscillations recorded in c4p as shown in fig 3 during the final recovery period from 08 10 2015 until the end of recording interface elevation follows a slight increasing trend similar to the one in c4p for both c4p and c4d the interface elevation rises at an average rate of 5 5 mm d 1 in the wells between 10 10 2015 and 27 10 2015 4 numerical modelling approach 4 1 tmvoc model and dnapl compounds implementation tmvoc is a numerical simulator for three phase non isothermal flow of water soil gas and a multicomponent mixture of volatile organic chemicals in a multidimensional heterogeneous porous media pruess and battistelli 2002 it is an extension of the tough2 general purpose simulation program developed at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory tmvoc is designed for applications to contamination problems that involve hydrocarbon fuel or organic solvent spills in saturated or unsaturated zones it is able to simulate contaminant behaviour under natural environmental conditions battistelli 2004 battistelli and pruess 2005 fagerlund and niemi 2007 battistelli 2008 jung et al 2011 yang et al 2012 lari et al 2016 lekmine et al 2017 as well as engineered systems such as co2 sequestration zheng et al 2013 or steam assisted source remediation chen et al 2012 tmvoc was recently combined with the tough suite simulators into the unique parallel and inverse software tough3 jung et al 2016 in this study the 2 0 tmvoc version was used studied dnapl is made of eleven compounds listed in table 1 hexachlorobutadiene hcbd hexachloroethane hca tetrachloroethylene pce pentachlorobenzene qcbz perchlorocyclopentene occp carbon tetrachloride ctec tetrachlorobenzene tecbz trichloroethylene tce pentachloroethane qca hexachlorobenzene hcbz and trichloroethane teca eight out of the eleven compounds representing 87 5 of dnapl are modelled since full data required for tmvoc is not available for three compounds qcbz occp and tecbz the physico chemical input parameters for tmvoc are listed for the eight selected compounds in the table a 1 in appendix at the first stage of numerical building we wanted to spill the dnapl as a single component with properties that reflect the mixture it would have reduced the equations to be solved but no satisfying volume averaging formalism to describe the overall properties of the mixture were identified to allow a simple input in tmvoc therefore dnapl is treated as a multi component mixture 4 2 hydrogeological units and parameters of the model three hydrogeological units are modelled the substratum the fine sand layer and the alluvial deposits hydraulic parameters for the substratum are taken as follows porosity is 15 and intrinsic hydraulic permeability is 4 10 14 m2 barret 2014 a soil sample of fine sands was collected in a non contaminated area of the study site the sand sample was sieved to select a fraction between 0 8 mm and 8 mm the measured sand porosity is 36 and the measured intrinsic hydraulic permeability is 1 10 10 m2 water dnapl retention curve for this sand sample was determined experimentally for this study and is presented in fig 5 data correspond to the calculated mean of the primary and secondary drainage imbibition measured cycles measured water maximum saturation is 93 66 leading to a measured dnapl residual saturation of 6 34 the parameters for the alluvial deposits are taken from maire et al 2015 i e a porosity of 35 and an intrinsic hydraulic permeability of 4 10 11 m2 the water air retention curve values by maire et al 2015 were also used the two phase experimental retention data for the fine sand and the alluvial deposits was interpolated with the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 then the previous two phase van genuchten parameters were modified to meet the three phase function tmvoc requirements using the scaling method described in fagerlund et al 2006 three phase capillary and relative permeability functions used in tmvoc come from parker et al 1987 and are 1 s g s g 1 s rw 2 s w s w s rw 1 s rw 3 s s w s n s rw 1 s rw 4 m 1 1 n 5 α gn

relative permeabilities respectively ρ w is the density of water and g the gravitational constant it should be noted that the three phase model of parker induces a water maximal saturation of one leading to a zero residual saturation of dnapl this assumption will be discussed in the conclusions the parameters to be entered in tmvoc are s rw n α gn and α nw and are given in table 2 4 3 conceptual model geologic logging from 39 boreholes are used to describe by kriging with the leapfrog software the topography of the geological layers tops of the substratum and the fine sand layer both shown in fig 6 alluvial deposits are also modelled and start from the top of the fine sand layer to end at 178 m asl the mview software was used to build the geometrical model of the c4 compartment we consider a 3d cartesian numerical model depicted in fig 7 consisting of 10 horizontal square numerical layers of variable thickness made of 22 rows and 23 columns for a total of 5060 grid blocks the substratum is made of the two basal numerical layers the fine sands lay above the substratum on one numerical layer and the six upper numerical layers represent the alluvial deposits the topmost numerical layer representing the atmosphere is 0 001 m thick it allows the vaporisation of volatile napls and maintain atmospheric conditions of pressure and temperature for the calculations of unsaturated zone conditions the model grid is refined around the wells three spatial areas are considered in the model the interior of the compartment 9 25 m long the compartment walls 0 4 m wide and a belt of 0 5 m wide surrounding the walls considering the 0 5 m width belt around the compartment will enable the analysis of the leaky enclosure assumption see below section 5 2 the total length of the model is 11 05 m and its total height is 14 m starting at 174 m asl and culminating at 188 m asl vertical grid spacing is between several centimetres to metres and horizontal xy grid spacing is between 0 06 m and 1 37 m 4 3 1 a simple realistic well model a simple realistic well model is used for the c4p pumping and the c4d observation wells the inner volumes of the wells are respected as well as the locations of the screened interval and the casing the wells are described by a fictitious porous medium characterised by a porosity of 99 99 a zero capillary pressure a vertical intrinsic permeability of 10 8 ms 1 the same horizontal intrinsic permeability value as the surrounding layer around the well grid blocks and the simple following relative permeability

phase for numerical calculations in the shallow unsaturated zone both in porous media and in the wells especially during the spill of dnapl where water level rises see section 4 3 3 4 3 2 initial interior dnapl volume estimation 4 3 2 1 theoretical expression of the dnapl volume the dnapl pool encountered on site lies on the top of an aquitard the auvillars marls as described in section 2 2 1 the vertical distribution of capillary pressure p cnw at a given location x y within a dnapl pool above an aquitard is given by mcwhorter and kueper 1996 19 p cnw δ ρg t x y z where t x y is the thickness of the dnapl pool at the location x y δρ ρ nw ρ w with ρ nw the density of dnapl and z the vertical axis positive upwards from the top of the aquitard the vertical variation of capillary pressure through the dnapl pool as described by eq 19 is readily translated into a vertical distribution of fluid saturations using the capillary pressure saturation function described by eq 9 substituting eq 19 into eq 9 gives the explicit expression of water saturation as a function of z 20 z t p 0 δ ρg s w s rw 1 s rw 1 m 1 n with p 0 ρ w g α nw once the thickness t x y of the dnapl pool is known across the horizontal contaminated domain it is possible to estimate the volume of dnapl in the pool by evaluating mcwhorter and kueper 1996 21 v nw t x y ϕ 0 t x y 1 s w dz the volume of dnapl per unit area for a fixed value of dnapl thickness t x y with ϕ the porosity of the porous medium substituting eq 20 into eq 21 gives the explicit expression of v nw t x y 22 v nw t x y ϕ 0 t x y 1 1 s rw δ ρg p 0 t z n m s rw dz finally the total volume of a variable thickness dnapl pool is given by integrating eq 22 across the whole horizontal contaminated domain 23 v nw x y v nw t x y d x d y 4 3 2 2 estimation of dnapl volume in order to estimate the initial dnapl volume in c4 the thickness and the corresponding contaminated domain of the dnapl pool must be calculated dnapl thickness is the difference between the elevation of the upper surface of the pool and the substratum elevation we assume that the upper surface of the dnapl pool is at the same elevation as the water dnapl interface in c4p and c4d wells this assumption could be criticised under certain conditions but according to mcwhorter and kueper 1996 since the c4p and c4d wells are terminated at the base of the pool and the dnapl has experienced a lowering of its upper surface following the halt of the dnapl source the accidental spillage of the dnapl stopped after the source was exhausted the water dnapl interfaces measured in the c4p and c4d wells correspond to the upper surface of the dnapl pool initial water dnapl interface elevations at the beginning of the pumping process are 178 96 m asl and 179 09 m asl in c4p and c4d respectively no information is available at c4a c4b nor c4c as these monitoring wells were not available for this experiment the average interface elevation 179 025 m asl corresponds to the initial upper surface elevation of the dnapl pool assumed homogeneous across the whole domain fine sands are supposed to be the only materials to be invaded by the dnapl fig 8 shows the calculated dnapl thickness in c4 and its corresponding area based on an elevation of 179 025 m asl of the upper surface of the dnapl pool and the interpolated substratum top elevation see section 4 3 maximum thickness t max is 1 374 m one must give an approximation of eq 23 to estimate the volume of dnapl across the whole horizontal contaminated domain the dnapl pool area is discretized using the grid spacing of the fig 8 with horizontal space steps δx δy 0 1 m each interpolated thickness value t i j at node i j is used to compute by the gauss legendre method v nw t i j given by eq 22 this value is multiplied by the grid cell surface δs δx δy 0 01 m2 yielding the dnapl volume at each grid cell finally the total dnapl volume is given by the sum of the dnapl volume of each grid cell across the whole contaminated domain calculations give an initial dnapl volume within c4 of 6 182m3 leading to an initial dnapl volume of 8 372 m 3 across the whole domain including the 0 5 m wide belt surrounding the compartment which will be used below see section 5 2 4 3 3 boundary conditions and initial state before pumping of dnapl since the initial conditions used in tmvoc the pressure and the saturation of each phase and the mole fractions of the compounds in the different phases are unknown a first step consists in reproducing the domain filled with both water and dnapl to obtain a plausible initial state therefore before running pulsed pumping process simulations injection of the initial dnapl volume laying in the c4 compartment must be made in order to finally reproduce the water dnapl interface elevations measured in c4p and c4d wells see section 4 3 2 this step is made in five stages partial filling with water of the domain prior to introduction of dnapl dnapl spill in the saturated zone at the bottom of the aquifer within the fine sand layer redistribution of dnapl within the whole domain building of the compartment walls described below redistribution of dnapl inside and outside the compartment necessary for the section 5 2 heat transfer is neglected and thus the simulations are isothermal at a temperature of 12 c and no flux neumann conditions apply to the bottom and the four lateral sides of the model for all of the simulations of this study no precipitation is included in the model since it is negligible all over the pumping process c4 compartment is first partially filled with water to anticipate the future volume of dnapl to be numerically injected see section 4 3 2 for this first stage starting from a dry state dirichlet atmospheric conditions are assigned to the topmost elements of the grid and dirichlet single phase boundary conditions are assigned to the fourth top layer of the mesh with an appropriate water pressure to reproduce by gravity capillary pressure a water table level at 186 62 m asl for the whole domain the other grid blocks are made active the second stage the dnapl injection stage uses the final conditions of the first stage as initial conditions the dnapl injection is made into the fine sand layer grid blocks chronologically the eight compounds were first injected all together for 7 days the simulation reached a steady state and stopped unexpectedly before simulated 7 days we do not have an explanation for these numerical issues therefore it has been decided to inject the dnapl compounds sequentially in order of their proportion for 7 days for each injection in the following order 1 hcbd 2 hca 3 pce 4 tecc 5 tce qca hcbz and teca simulations were complete with this exploratory method for this sequential dnapl injection stage dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the rising of the water level due to the injection of the dnapl up to the initial water level of 187 5 m asl observed at the site the third stage simulates the redistribution of the dnapl and the water until equilibrium is reached i e 120 days here again dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the redistribution of the water and the dnapl the fourth stage simulates the building of the walls for this purpose wall material properties are affected to the soil grid blocks located at the walls position dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active finally the fifth stage simulates the redistribution of the dnapl and the water both inside and outside the compartment until equilibrium is reached i e 45 days here again dirichlet conditions apply only for the atmospheric grid blocks when the other grid blocks of the mesh are made active to allow the redistribution of the water and the dnapl the redistribution runs are necessary to reproduce the recessions of the dnapl before and after the construction of the compartment walls 5 results and discussion 5 1 fully low permeability keyed enclosure assumption this section deals with the assumption of a fully low permeability keyed enclosure for the c4 compartment with its impermeable walls totally embedded within the substratum as seen above see section 4 3 2 the estimated interior initial dnapl volume in c4 is 6 089m3 however final dnapl cumulated pumped volume was 20 049 m 3 which is substantially higher than the estimated volume the results of the simulation concerning the fully low permeability keyed enclosure are shown below 5 1 1 simulated pumping process description in order to discuss the efficiency of a pulsed pumping in a fully keyed enclosure exploratory pumping process simulation is run to assess the behaviour of dnapl within a c4 compartment assumed isolated simulation follows the experiment description in section 3 pulsed pumping process is applied to the c4p well grid cell located within the substratum elevation of the pumping grid cell is between 174 38 m and 177 67 m asl hence the middle of the pumping cell is at 176 02 m asl pulsed pumping yields are calculated from daily pumped dnapl volumes and functioning durations of the pump mass pumping yields are applied allowing the theoretical pumping of both water and dnapl the latter being the only pumped phase during the experiment measured and simulated water dnapl interface elevations are given in fig 9 and fig 10 for c4p and c4d wells respectively and simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl are given in fig 11 5 1 2 results of the exploratory simulation except from the beginning of the pumping to 02 08 2015 or 08 08 2015 where the simulated data for pumped volume and water dnapl interfaces are in very good agreement with the experimental data in general simulated data does not match the experimental one after 03 08 2015 simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl reach a plateau with a lower value than the observed pumped dnapl volume of 20 049m3 during the simulation water was extracted which is in contradiction with the field experiment where no water was recovered during the pumping between 02 08 2015 and 08 08 2015 the interface elevation at c4p drops rapidly to a minimum plateau value at around 174 38 m asl the c4p bottom elevation see fig 9 as soon as the interface drops it rises and falls following the pulsed pumping process it rises when the pump is off as the dnapl is allowed to redistribute itself above the substratum and re enter the well without being pumped and falls down to reach the c4p bottom when the pump is functioning as the dnapl entering the well is instantly pumped and cannot accumulate at the bottom of the well finally when almost all the dnapl is pumped interface elevation stays close to the c4p bottom from the beginning simulated interface elevation in c4d is lower than the experimental data and the decreasing trend rate is faster than in the experiment see fig 10 dnapl is mobilised too rapidly towards the c4p well interface elevation reaches a low plateau value at around 178 70 m asl before 04 08 2015 5 1 3 efficiency of the exploratory simulation in the case of the impermeable keyed enclosure at the end of the simulated pulsed pumping process 6 070 m 3 of dnapl are finally extracted while 0 112 m 3 remained inside the compartment therefore the pulsed pumping process efficiency would be 98 2 after three months considering all the conceptual assumptions which is extremely high the high mobility of the dnapl partially explains this result it also must be noted that water has been extracted from 03 08 2015 and from this date the dnapl recovery rate drops dramatically at 03 08 2015 after only about thirteen days of pumping 5 160 m 3 of dnapl are extracted representing 85 of 6 070 m 3 and five days later on 09 08 2015 95 of the extracted simulated dnapl volume were recovered finally on 31 08 2015 after forty one days of pumping 99 of 6 070 m 3 were recovered depending on the efficiency targets pumping could have been stopped after forty one days reducing the process time by 58 and thus the process costs compared to the three month pumping 5 1 4 c4 a fully low permeability keyed enclosure the average value of the initial simulated interface elevations at c4p and c4d is 179 02 m asl and does match the average value of the experimental data hence initial calculated volume of dnapl within the interior of the c4 compartment is likely correct however neither simulated water dnapl interface elevations nor simulated cumulated pumped volumes of dnapl are in agreement with the experimental data hence an entering massic flux of dnapl into the c4 compartment must be considered to reproduce the final cumulated pumped volume of dnapl the assumption of a low permeability keyed enclosure must be questioned 5 2 leaking keyed enclosure assumption 5 2 1 c4 a leaky enclosure the model must be corrected to introduce a leaky behaviour of the c4 compartment southern wall as seen in section 2 2 2 c4 southern wall might not be totally embedded into the substratum making the interior of c4 connected with the surrounding dnapl pool we assume that only a part of the southern wall bottom ends into the altered fine sand layer and that the three other walls are fully embedded into the substratum southern wall grid cells which bottom is lower than 178 m asl minimum elevation of the bottom of the walls are replaced by fine sand layer ones to reproduce the vertical gap between the substratum and the bottom of the wall this gap of perturbed porous media between the substratum and the bottom of the wall is called the breach and its height is 0 965 m in the model due to grid spacing real vertical gap is about 0 1 m because the estimated altitude of the low point below the southern wall is at around 177 9 m asl therefore we consider dirichlet conditions for the surrounding belt grid blocks outside the four walls where pressure and saturation values of the dnapl pool and the groundwater come from the section 4 3 3 the four walls are assigned the same very low permeability as in the fully keyed compartment see section 5 1 except the gap in the southern wall the updated geometry of the model is shown in fig 12 since the value of the breach permeability is unknown exploratory simulations must be run to better reproduce the experimental data therefore a 1d parameter space of the breach permeability is explored by means of a simple sensitivity analysis 5 2 2 calibration of the breach permeability against data several simulations were run to determine the best value of the breach permeability to describe the quality of the simulations the root mean square errors rmse for the interface elevations and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume are used a total of 10 simulations see fig 13 are run to explore the 1d parameter space of the breach permeability simulations are labelled sim a to sim j where the breach permeability starts from 1 10 12 m2 for sim a to 1 10 11 m2 for sim j with a 1 10 12 m2 increment simulations are run on a intel core i7 7820 hq cpu at 2 90 ghz calculation durations of the 10 runs vary from 2 49 h to 5 46 h with a median value of 3 67 h therefore a total calculation duration of 40 h was needed to run the 10 simulations 5 2 3 results of the calibration both qualitative and quantitative criteria must be taken into account in order to identify the simulation showing the closest agreement with the experimental data in particular as discussed in section 3 2 pulsed pumping process was designed for exclusive dnapl recovery without any water extracted however only for sim a water was also pumped alongside dnapl thus this simulation must be rejected for the determination of the best simulation quantitative criteria are the rmse for the dnapl cumulated pumped volume and the interface elevations at c4p and c4d rmse values for the interface elevations and the cumulated volume are respectively depicted in fig 13a and b interface elevations at c4d show a weak sensitivity to permeability since the rmse values vary from 0 170 m to 0 218 m conversely interface elevations at c4p are strongly influenced by the position within the 1d parameter space since the rmse values vary from 0 661 m to 1 056 m the dnapl cumulated pumped volume shows high variations in the course of the sampling in the 1d parameter space since the rmse varies from 0 107 m 3 to 0 926m3 determination of the closest simulation is based on the 9 remaining simulations for which water was not extracted during the pulsed pumping process rmse analysis on the interface elevations at c4d at c4p and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume shows that sim d should be considered as the simulation closest to the experimental data simulated data of sim d for the interface elevations at c4p and c4d and the dnapl cumulated pumped volume are depicted in figs 9 11 sim d interface elevations at c4p match at first order the observed data the frequency of the oscillations is respected meaning that the pulsed pumping process is perfectly reproduced however the amplitude of simulated data does not correspond perfectly to the observed one since the simulated data reach neither the bottom points during pumping conversely the initial and final interface elevations do correspond to the observed data concerning the simulation of the interface elevation at c4d results are not as fairly good in comparison to c4p although from the beginning to 15 09 2015 the absolute error is less than 0 2 m simulated values after 15 09 2015 do not match the observed interface levels as for c4p the observed frequency is respected but the amplitude of simulated data is lower than the measured one one explanation relies on the fact that the model layers are homogeneous while more heterogeneous natural alluvial deposits drive the flow of both water and dnapl towards the c4p well following preferable hydraulic paths the results for cumulated pumped volume of dnapl are very close to the experimental values for sim d the final simulated cumulated volume is 19 783m3 representing a relative error of 1 33 compared to the measured value of 20 049 m3 5 2 4 conclusion on the assumption of a leaky enclosure we demonstrated that the assumption of a leaky enclosure with a breach in the southern wall of the c4 compartment allows a better simulation of the observed data the optimised parameters for the intrinsic permeabilities of the breach were obtained through 10 simulation runs the modelled intrinsic permeability of the breach is 4 10 12 m2 corresponding to the perturbed medium where fine sand wall and traces of substratum materials are mixed together during the building of the compartments finally the corresponding horizontal intrinsic permeability of the real breach is in fact about 4 10 11 m2 considering the real height of the breach 6 conclusions this pilot scale study is part of the silphes project a technology demonstrator aiming the development of innovative solutions for vohc polluted site remediation we focus here on a treatment method we investigate by means of in situ experiments and numerical modelling the feasibility of the pulsed pumping process of a large amount of a dnapl pool in an alluvial aquifer the dnapl is made of eleven compounds and the main one is hexachlorobutadiene hcbd a low permeability keyed enclosure was built at the location of the dnapl source zone and a three month pulsed pumping process was applied inside the enclosure to exclusively extract the dnapl the temporal variation of the water dnapl interface elevations at both the pumping and an observation wells and of the cumulated pumped volume of dnapl were recorded a total volume of about 20m3 of purely dnapl were recovered since no water was extracted during the process we were able to reproduce the dnapl cumulated pumped volume and the water dnapl interface elevations at the two wells simulations show an excellent agreement between field and simulated data for extracted dnapl free product volumes the lower but reasonable agreement between simulated and observed interface elevations at the two wells c4p and c4d might be improved using the well model developed by sleep et al 2015 to better reproduce the amplitude of the oscillations especially in the pumping well c4p the lack of hysteretic behaviour for the capillary pressure function and the absence of dnapl residual saturation can be corrected for future studies with the functions developed by doughty 2013 to improve the model it should be noted that eight out of eleven compounds were modelled and the behaviour of the dnapl is treated as a mix of vohc and not as a single compound dnapl one the main findings is provided in the appendix and summarised in table 3 i e the values of the physico chemical properties required by tmvoc should the following compounds be encountered on site hexachlorobutadiene hcbd hexachloroethane hca tetrachloroethylene pce carbon tetrachloride ctec trichloroethylene tce pentachloroethane qca hexachlorobenzene hcbz and trichloroethane teca finally this study offers a new perspective in remediation assessment of groundwater contaminated with a large amount of dnapl since pumping system optimisation may be performed to reduce costs as seen in section 5 1 3 pumping process duration could have been reduced by 58 still recovering 99 of the
