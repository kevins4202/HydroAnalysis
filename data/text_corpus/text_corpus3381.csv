16905,anaerobically digested ad sludge is widely applied to agricultural land as fertilizer however heavy metals in ad sludge potentially pose a significant threat to environment this study reports a novel bioleaching approach with no need for externally added chemicals sludge acidification was achieved using the protons produced from microbial oxidation of the inherent ammonium in ad sludge an acid tolerant microbial consortium dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria from the genus candidatus nitrosoglobus i e relative abundance of 72 5 2 3 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing was enriched after 120 days incubation in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor the consortium oxidizes ammonium even at ph 2 5 at approximately 30 of its maximum rate measured at ph 5 5 inoculating the consortium at a solid ratio of 1 20 caused the ph of the ad sludge to decrease from 7 5 to 2 0 over five days under aerobic conditions as a result metals in the ad sludge were efficiently extracted into the liquid phase in particular two of the most abundant toxic metals cu and zn were solubilized with high efficiencies of 88 4 and 96 3 respectively overall the results of this study enable the economical and safe reuse of excess sludge generated during biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioleaching biosolids reuse acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers candidatus nitrosoglobus toxic metal removal 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment generates a large amount of sludge sludge treatment and disposal account for up to 50 of the total operational expenditure in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp campbell 2000 one of the most commonly used methods of sludge treatment is anaerobic digestion which can reduce sludge organic content by 30 50 while recovering bioenergy i e ch4 appels et al 2008 anaerobically digested ad sludge can be applied to agricultural land as fertilizer whereby nitrogen phosphorus organic substances and other micronutrients in the sludge are recycled for agricultural production beck et al 1996 epstein 1975 despite tremendous economic benefits land application of ad sludge is limited due to the presence of toxic metals such as cd cr cu ni pb and zn kemper and sommer 2002 when leached into soil these metals can contaminate groundwater and accumulate up the food chain if ingested mcgrath et al 2000 ozores hampton et al 2005 wei and liu 2005 ultimately the accumulation of toxic metals in humans can lead to metabolic disorders and chronic diseases tchounwou et al 2012 therefore it is essential for environmental and human health that toxic metals are removed prior to land application in ad sludge metals predominantly co exist with sulfides oxides hydroxides silicates or organic matter complexes lake et al 1984 in these forms most metals can be solubilized through chemical leaching at ph 2 0 3 0 with the addition of inorganic acids e g h2so4 hcl or hno3 bayat and sari 2010 lo and chen 1990 the chemical dosage can be reduced by up to 80 with bioleaching which uses microbial metabolism to leach metals from sludge pathak et al 2009 bioleaching can be carried out under anaerobic or aerobic conditions anaerobic bioleaching relies on the volatile fatty acids vfas produced from the first stage of anaerobic digestion i e sludge fermentation to leach metals molaey et al 2021 however the generation of vfas requires readily biodegradable cod therefore anaerobic bioleaching is more appropriate for wasted activated sludge was meulepas et al 2015 rather than ad sludge in which the readily biodegradable cod has been converted to biogas in the preceding anaerobic digestion process existing aerobic bioleaching approaches mainly exploit two types of microorganisms to generate acids i e iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria blais et al 1992 bosecker 1997 jain and tyagi 1992 pathak et al 2009 ryu et al 2003 tyagi et al 1988 wong et al 2004 wong and henry 1983 xiang et al 2000 for instance wong et al 2004 cultivated an indigenous iron oxidizing bacterium from wastewater sludge when inoculated into ad sludge the bacterium acidified it to ph 1 7 2 0 over 16 days by oxidizing fes2 leading to 99 zn and 74 cu solubilization however the dosage of ferrous and sulfur containing compounds such as feso4 fes2 or s0 incurs considerable cost in addition the residual sulfur and iron compounds in biosolids can cause secondary pollution through soil acidification chan et al 2003 microbial ammonium oxidation is an acid producing process which can generate two moles of protons h per mole of ammonium nh4 oxidized eq 1 ad sludge typically contains ammonium at 35 7 107 1 mmol 500 1500 mg nh4 n l 1 in the supernatant appels et al 2008 parkin and owen 1986 which can generate 71 214 mmol l 1 of protons when fully oxidized this concentration of protons is able to drive the ph of ad sludge to less than 2 during chemical leaching tyagi et al 1988 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o hereby we hypothesize that it is possible to leach metals from ad sludge utilizing the protons generated from microbial oxidation of ammonium inherent in the ad sludge to achieve this a key challenge is to cultivate ammonia oxidizers that are able to function at low ph i e 2 0 to date a few acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing microbial cultures have been obtained from natural environments such as acidic soils date et al 2012 hayatsu et al 2017 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 however microbial ammonium oxidation in engineered wastewater treatment systems normally proceeds at neutral ph the role of extremely acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers in a wastewater treatment system is not well understood although the low ph had been observed in some engineered nitrification reactors fumasoli et al 2017 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b the goal of this study is to develop a bioleaching approach to remove toxic metals from ad sludge without addition of external chemicals the two specific objectives are i to enrich and characterize indigenous acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers from activated sludge and ii to evaluate leaching efficiencies for toxic metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn using ammonium based bioleaching the ammonia oxidizing enrichment was conducted in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor sbr with conventional activated sludge as inoculum and the supernatant of ad sludge as a source of ammonium the bioleaching experiment was conducted by inoculating the enriched ammonia oxidizing consortium into ad sludge to achieve sludge acidification and metal leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of a reactor to enrich an acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing consortium a laboratory sbr with a working volume of 2 l was set up to cultivate acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers the sbr was initially inoculated with 1 l conventional activated sludge from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wwtp the sbr was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm unless otherwise specified and the temperature was maintained at 22 1 c in an air conditioned laboratory the sbr was fed with ad sludge supernatant ad liquor which was collected weekly from the local wwtp transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c prior to use the ad liquor had an average ammonium concentration of 881 79 mg n l 1 63 0 5 6 mmol l 1 n 11 and alkalinity of 32 1 2 3 mmol caco3 l 1 n 11 with an alkalinity calculated as caco3 to ammonium molar ratio of 0 51 the ad liquor ph was 8 1 0 2 n 11 and the total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble cod scod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp

40 u s the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the reactor was constantly above 5 mg o2 l 1 as monitored with an optical do sensor mettler toledo inpro6860i 12 120 ma hd switzerland in each 10 day aerobic period 1 l ad liquor was fed to the sbr with a peristaltic pump which was switched on for 10 min per day by a programmed timer once the total volume reached two litres in 10 days the sbr entered a settling period where the feeding pump aerator and stirrer were stopped subsequent to settling one litre of supernatant was discharged exchange ratio 50 after which the next 10 day cycle was initiated thereby the sbr had a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days corresponding to an average ammonium loading rate of 44 mg n l 1 d 1 the ph in the sbr was continuously monitored with a ph probe tps 121207 australia and a transmitter minichem p australia but not controlled at any time throughout the 110 day operation the influent tkn effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate volatile suspended solids vss and tss in the reactor were measured every 10 days sampling of sludge 10 ml for microbial community analysis were carried out every 20 days the sampled biomass was stored at 80 c prior to microbial community profiling no excess sludge was discharged during the reactor operation except for sampling accordingly sludge retention time srt was estimated to be more than 100 days 2 2 metal leaching experiments after ammonium removal was stably achieved at an acidic ph range of 2 0 3 0 in the enrichment sbr metal leaching experiments were carried out in four 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks three as experimental and one as control initially each of the four flasks was filled with 200 ml ad sludge with composition described below and was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm subsequently 200 ml mixed liquor collected from the sbr day 100 was added to each of the three experimental flasks in contrast the control flask was supplemented with sterilized 120 c for 30 min sbr culture in the following five days compressed air was constantly supplied via air diffusers giving a do level above 5 mg o2 l 1 in the flasks mettler toledo inpro6860i 12 120 ma hd switzerland mixed liquor samples were taken every 24 h after 0 45 µm membrane filtration of the mixed liquor supernatant ph ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved metal concentrations were determined as described in section 2 4 the solubilization efficiency of respective metals was then calculated as the dissolved metal concentration c s divided by initial total metal concentration c t the ad sludge was collected from the full scale anaerobic digester at the same wwtp and stored at 4 c prior to use the full scale anaerobic digester was operated at an srt of 25 days the stored ad sludge contained 26 3 0 7 g l 1 n 3 total solids ts 19 2 0 8 g l 1 n 3 volatile solids vs 1628 119 mg l 1 tkn n 3 and 1000 95 mg l 1 tp n 3 respectively the solids ratio of the sbr culture to ad sludge in leaching experiments was set at 1 20 2 3 batch assays to determine the effects of ph and ammonium concentration on ammonium oxidation activity the ph and ammonium concentration are two critical operational parameters for the ammonium based leaching approach as such a group of batch assays was designed to assess how different ph values and ammonium concentrations impact the ammonia oxidizing activity of the cultivated consortium during sbr operation from day 90 to day 110 the oxygen uptake rate our due to ammonium oxidation ournh4 was used as an indicator of ammonia oxidizing activity in this work the determination of ournh4 is detailed in supplementary materials to explore the effect of ammonium the ournh4 was determined at various ammonium levels from 0 to 500 mg n l 1 0 6 12 28 24 30 60 80 120 180 240 300 400 500 mg n l 1 at a fixed ph of 5 5 to investigate the ph effect the ournh4 was determined at ph levels of 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 with the initial ammonium concentration controlled at approximately 160 mg n l 1 dosing 2 5 ml nh4cl stock solution 62 5 g n l 1 to avoid ammonium limitation at low ph the specific our sour was calculated as the quotient of ournh4 and the vss concentration with the

supernatant 3 6 ml was mixed with 70 hno3 0 4 ml and digested at 160 c for 20 min 10 min for temperature increase to 160 c and 10 min at 160 c solubilized metal concentrations were determined from icp oes analysis of the digested supernatant the respective n2o and no emission factors were measured and calculated adopting the methodology of wang et al 2021b 2 5 microbial analyses the dna extraction from biomass and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were carried out as detailed in supplementary materials raw amplicon reads were processed using dada2 callahan et al 2016 to infer amplicon sequence variants asvs of 463 bp length the filtered merged denoised and chimera free reads were classified against the silva small subunit ssu database release 138 quast et al 2013 visualization of the amplicon sequencing data was performed using r package tidyverse in rstudio the raw sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra database with the accession numbers srr13341537 srr13341542 2 5 1 full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis full length 16s rrna gene sequences were recovered from the dna sample on day 100 following the procedures in supplementary materials three valid full length 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained and aligned by clustal x software version 1 81 thompson et al 1997 phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the neighbour joining method with kimura 2 parameter mode kimura 1980 implemented in the mega package version 7 kumar et al 2016 the statistical reliability was assessed with 1000 bootstrap replicates a full length 16s rrna gene sequence 1508 bp was submitted to genbank database with the accession number mw431319 2 5 2 scanning electron microscopy micro morphology of the biomass sample collection

26l australia then the dried samples were coated twice with a carbon coater quorum q150t uk following the three heavy burst model to obtain a carbon thickness of 30 40 nm 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance anova in this study the p values less than 0 001 0 01 0 05 were summarized with three two and one asterisks respectively 3 results 3 1 enrichment of an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium fig 1 shows the ph variation nitrification performance and microbial community shift during the continuous operation of the enrichment sbr the ph in the sbr gradually decreased from 7 2 to 5 0 in the first 10 days fig 1a ammonium was converted to nitrate with no nitrite accumulated in the reactor fig 1b suggesting the presence of both ammonium oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing activity during day 10 20 the ph further dropped from 5 0 to 3 5 fig 1a while 80 mg no2 n l 1 accumulated fig 1b the accumulation of nitrite indicated that nob was suppressed likely due to the low ph 3 5 the accumulated nitrite formed free nitrous acid fna hno2 h no2 in situ which further intensified the inhibition of nob leading to more nitrite accumulation and less nitrate li et al 2020 due to the higher nitrite fna accumulation ammonium oxidizing activity was also inhibited vadivelu et al 2006 zheng et al 2018 likely responsible for the temporary ph increase from 3 5 to 6 0 during day 20 30 fig 1a nevertheless ph decreased again from 6 0 to 4 0 during day 30 60 fig 1a even in the presence of 300 mg no2 n l 1 implying that an acid and fna tolerant ammonia oxidizer could emerge in the reactor during this period the no and n2o emission ratios were measured to be 1 1 0 2 and 0 3 0 1 of the influent ammonium load representing only a small proportion of nitrogen loss considering do was constantly higher than 5 mg l 1 denitrification should be negligible from day 60 the ph further decreased to below 4 0 and finally stabilized at 2 5 meanwhile nitrite accumulation ceased nitrate concentration gradually built up and 30 tn loss was observed this was likely due to chemical disproportion of nitrite into nitrate and multiple volatile nitrogenous compounds e g no n2o at ph 4 fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 the emission factors of no and n2o during day 80 110 were measured to be 26 5 2 3 and 0 2 0 1 of the influent ammonia load respectively which are roughly commensurate with the nitrogen loss fig 1c and d present the microbial community dynamics revealed by amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes nitrosomonas and nitrospira populations were detected in the inoculum day 0 with a relative abundance of 1 5 0 2 and 3 3 0 1 respectively these common nitrifiers gradually disappeared instead a single gamma proteobacterial genus of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob candidatus nitrosoglobus gradually became predominant in the microbial community with relative abundance increasing from 0 on day 0 to 0 5 0 02 on day 20 and finally to 72 5 2 3 on day 100 fig 1c a previous isolate from acidic soil ca nitrosoglobus terrae was reported to perform ammonium oxidation at acidic ph as low as 2 0 hayatsu et al 2017 together with the nitrification performance these results indicate the enrichment of an extremely acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium moreover another genus mycobacterium was also found to be abundant in the sbr on day 100 with a relative abundance of 15 2 0 4 however all reported species within the mycobacterium genus are heterotrophs with no capacity for ammonium oxidation emde et al 1992 song et al 2019 additionally the biodiversity significantly reduced in the extremely acidic conditions as indicated by the decreased shannon s and simpson s indices over time fig 1d amplicon sequencing can only generate 16s rrna gene fragments of relatively short lengths i e 463 bp in this study in order to perform phylogenetic identification of the enriched ca nitrosoglobus at a species level full length 16s rrna gene sequences 1456 bp were retrieved by cloning sequencing the three clone sequences obtained share 99 1 100 similarity with each other therefore only one clone sequence was chosen to infer a phylogenetic tree that encompasses 21 full length 16s rrna gene sequences from genera nitrosospira nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and ca nitrosoglobus fig 2 a it should be noted that ca nitrosoglobus was recently identified as a new gamma proteobacterial aob γ aob genus with only one representative ca nitrososglobus terrae isolated from an acidic soil sample hayatsu et al 2017 the sequence retrieved from the sbr biomass has 99 6 identity to ca nitrososglobus terrae these two ca nitrosoglobus populations are closely affiliated with another γ aob genus nitrosococcus these γ aob members altogether form a monophyletic lineage distinct from nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the sem analysis shows that the enriched consortium largely comprises coccoid cells of 1 2 μm diameter fig 2b which is similar to the morphology of other γ aob species such as nitrosococcus and ca nitrosoglobus terrae hayatsu et al 2017 koops et al 1990 these results indicate the successful cultivation and enrichment of ca nitrosoglobus sp from an activated sludge sample 3 2 effects of ph and ammonium concentration on ammonium oxidation activity batch activity assays were carried out to shed light on how ph and ammonium concentration would impact ammonium oxidation activity of the enriched microbial consortium fig 3 a shows that the maximum sour of the consortium 37 5 mg o2 g 1vss h 1 was achieved under slightly acidic conditions i e ph 5 5 between ph 5 5 to 8 5 the sour was maintained above 30 mg o2 g 1vss h 1 in the ph range of 2 5 5 5 the ammonium oxidation activity declined with decreased ph nevertheless ammonium oxidation did not cease to occur at ph 2 5 the sour at ph 2 5 was approximately 30 of its maximum at ph 5 5 suggesting that the ammonia oxidizing consortium can efficiently perform ammonium oxidation under extremely acidic conditions the effect of ammonium concentration on the activity was investigated at the optimal ph of 5 5 fig 3b this result was fitted well by the michaelis menten equation r 2 0 93 the substrate affinity constant of the enriched consortium was estimated to be 9 6 4 6 mg nh3 nh4 n l 1 3 3 bioleaching of metals from ad sludge by inoculation with enriched ammonia oxidizing consortium bioleaching experiments were conducted to evaluate removal efficiencies of various metals from ad sludge fig 4 a shows the nitrogen and ph profiles over a 5 day aeration period in the first 24 h when ph decreased from 7 24 to 5 10 the amount of ammonium oxidation 53 3 mg n l 1 was comparable to nitrite formation 52 2 mg n l 1 fig 4a no nitrate formed due to the absence of nob in the inoculum from time 24 h to 120 h as ammonium oxidation continued the ph further decreased to 2 03 meanwhile the nitrite decreased to zero and nitrate concentration rose instead this is consistent with reactor performance fig 1a and literature showing the chemical oxidation of nitrite to nitrate at ph 4 0 fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 nitrite oxidation to nitrate was accompanied by a tn loss of 50 mg n l 1 representing 10 of the initial ammonium concentration the tn loss in the batch system was lower than that in the reactor system 30 presumably due to the shorter time span in batch 5 days than in the reactor hrt 20 days in contrast since ad sludge does not contain active ammonia oxidizers the ph remained unchanged in the control group i e initially inoculated with a sterilized consortium data not shown these results demonstrate that the inoculated acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium is essential to the ph decrease in ad sludge low ph can facilitate metal solubilization fig 4 b d show the respective solubilization efficiencies of 16 metals over time as the ph decreased with time the solubilization of all metals increased concomitantly fig 4 e compares the metal distributions between solid and liquid phases at 0 h and 120 h at the beginning of the leaching experiment apart from na b ca k mg the metals predominantly reside in the solid phase 95 after 5 day aeration a removal efficiency of over 60 was achieved for the majority of the 16 metals the four remaining metals with limited solubilization were cr pb fe and mo these metals were previously reported to bind with complex organic substances which cannot be easily solubilized at acidic ph du et al 2015 overall the metal solubilization efficiencies were comparable to those achieved in sulfur iron based aerobic bioleaching jain and tyagi 1992 tyagi et al 1988 wong and henry 1983 xiang et al 2000 and anaerobic bioleaching meulepas et al 2015 demonstrating the effectiveness of ammonium based bioleaching 4 discussion 4 1 ammonium based bioleaching as an innovative approach for removal of toxic metals from ad sludge through the successful microbial enrichment and leaching experiments this study for the first time demonstrates a novel ammonium based bioleaching approach without external chemical addition the approach relies on an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium to generate protons h while oxidizing the ammonium inherent in ad sludge the consortium was enriched in a laboratory sbr which performed stable ammonium oxidation at ph 2 6 0 1 over a period of 120 days fig 1 the 16s rrna gene based pcr and sequence analysis revealed that a nitrosoglobus like population was the sole ammonia oxidizer in the consortium reaching a relative abundance of above 70 based on its capacity to create a strongly acidic environment via ammonium oxidation the consortium was inoculated into ad sludge successfully acidifying the sludge to ph 2 over a 5 day aeration period fig 4 a as expected the acidification of ad sludge led to efficient metal solubilization fig 4 b e among the 16 metals assessed 12 were solubilized with efficiencies higher than 60 while four cr pb fe and mo had efficiencies below 30 the acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium enriched from activated sludge is critical to the ammonium based bioleaching approach proposed in this study common ammonia oxidizers in activated sludge are acid sensitive for example nitrosomonas ceased to oxidize ammonia at ph below 6 fumasoli et al 2015 nitrosospira although detected in slightly acidic soils ph 4 6 showed no growth below ph 6 in a pure culture study jiang and bakken 1999 certain ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were shown to be obligate acidophiles but completely lost activity at ph 4 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 hence these previously known ammonia oxidizers cannot drive ph down to 2 as required for metal leaching to the best of our knowledge γ proteobacterial ca nitrosoglobus terrae is the only known aob that is able to survive at extremely acidic conditions ph 2 indeed in strongly acidic soils ca nitrosoglobus terrae was found to have higher transcript activity than aoa and β aob hayatsu et al 2017 unfortunately this soil borne γ aob species has a low affinity for total ammonium high half saturation constant of 2100 mg n l 1 at optimal ph 6 0 the low ammonium affinity makes it unsuitable for ammonium based metal leaching from ad sludge as the relatively low ammonium level i e 500 1500 mg n l 1 in the ad sludge would limit microbial activity in contrast the ca nitrosoglobus like population presented in this study has a substantially high affinity to ammonium with an affinity constant of 9 6 4 6 mg n l 1 at optimal ph of 5 5 fig 3 b therefore the ca nitrosoglobus from sludge represents the only known ammonia oxidizer to date which is appropriate for ammonium based bioleaching of ad sludge ammonium based bioleaching utilizes the ammonium inherent in ad sludge thereby avoiding the use of external chemicals previous studies of ad sludge leaching via chemical leaching or sulfur iron based bioleaching demand substantial external chemical dosing with inorganic acids sulfur and iron jain and tyagi 1992 xiang et al 2000 chemical addition not only incurs extra cost but also generates secondary pollution e g soil acidification when the treated ad sludge is applied to agricultural land for instance in the case of sulfur based bioleaching powdered elemental sulfur needs to be supplied in excess 5 10 g s l 1 to prevent sulfur limitation tyagi et al 1994 usually around 50 of the sulfur powder remains in the bioleached sludge leading to soil acidification when the sludge is applied to land blais et al 1992 in contrast ammonium based bioleaching utilizes the abundant ammonium in ad sludge thus avoiding the need for external chemicals after dewatering about 90 residual ammonium and its oxidative products nitrates remain in the liquid phase i e the ad supernatant ad supernatant can be separately treated or returned to the mainstream wastewater for nitrogen removal the remaining 10 ammonium nitrite in the solid phase could serve as nitrogen fertilizer for soil moreover the ammonium based bioleaching does not require pre acidification of ad sludge as required in the previously reported iron based bioleaching process conventional iron oxidizing bacteria such as thiobacillus ferrooxidans cannot grow at ph 4 5 tyagi et al 1988 as such in order to employ thiobacillus ferrooxidans for bioleaching the ph of ad sludge must be pre acidified to 4 5 using inorganic acids in contrast the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture maintains ammonium oxidizing activity within the broad range of ph 2 0 8 5 fig 3 a in the presented bioleaching experiment the ph effectively decreased from 7 5 to about 2 0 without external chemical acidification fig 4 a therefore ammonium based bioleaching represents a cost effective and environmentally friendly process for removing toxic metals prior to final disposal of ad sludge for comparison with ammonium based bioleaching the ph of ad sludge was directly adjusted to 2 0 with hcl the metal solubilization efficiencies were compared with bioleaching results fig s1 it can be seen that most metals including mn na ni al ba ca k and mg were solubilized at comparable efficiencies with no significant differences p 0 05 between chemical and ammonium based bioleaching however bioleaching achieved significantly higher cu 88 4 versus 19 2 and zn 96 3 versus 50 5 solubilization efficiencies than chemical leaching the reason could be that cu and zn are bound with organics which cannot be released solely with acidic ph molaey et al 2021 it is important to note that cu and zn concentrations failed to meet the grade a biosolids standard table 1 with chemical leaching the cu content remained grade c and zn grade b demonstrating that chemical leaching is not as efficient as ammonium based bioleaching a direct quantitative comparison of ammonium based bioleaching with previous leaching methods including fe s based bioleaching chemical leaching and anaerobic bioleaching is difficult at the current stage as the results are highly dependent on the characteristics of ad sludge in the future a comparison should be done using standardized ad sludge herein to estimate the economic potential of the proposed technology a desktop scale up study on a plant with 800 000 population equivalents was conducted details in supplementary materials the results show that ammonium based bioleaching can achieve annual savings of aud 657 750 the savings could be up to aud 1 860 000 if the improvement in quality from grade c to a is considered nevertheless the cost benefit analysis can only be regarded as indicative at the current stage a rigorous economic analysis and a quantitative comparison should be performed with a practical scale up study it is noted that the present study is proof of concept research demonstrating the technological feasibility of ammonium based bioleaching the process concept consists of two parts i enrichment of acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers and ii metal leaching from ad sludge by inoculating the enriched culture the two steps could potentially be integrated into a single process which receives and discharges ad sludge in a semi or continuous pattern as such key operational parameters such as srt and hrt require further optimization in addition at ph 4 multiple volatile nitrogenous compounds such as no no2 and n2o3 would be generated fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 which explains the nitrogen loss in the sbr these compounds pose potential risks to human health medinets et al 2015 therefore off gas treatment to remove these gaseous compounds may be required for instance via denitrification biofilters jiang et al 2008 lu et al 2011 4 2 implications for biosolids management ad sludge is an important biosolid generated in biological wastewater treatment the ad sludge in this study contained cu and zn concentrations of 676 12 and 930 34 mg kg 1 dry solids which merely meet the grade c biosolids standard new south wales environment protection authority sydney 2000 through the ammonium based bioleaching process the quality of ad sludge with respect to metals can be upgraded from c to a table 1 the improved quality could significantly reduce sludge disposal costs as the sludge can be disposed locally rather than be transported to remote sites batstone et al 2011 on a global scale the concentration of toxic metals in biosolids is stringently regulated both the u s environmental protection agency and european communities directive set a maximum annual metal loading rate for the land application of biosolids european council 1986 usepa 1993 therefore the decreased metal concentration in bioleached sludge means that more sludge can be applied to the same land annually without exceeding the allowable cumulative toxic metal loading rate hence ammonium based bioleaching of ad sludge would benefit the water industry by reducing operational costs as well as promoting biosolids reuse in a circular economy it should be noted that along with the toxic metal removal some nutritionally valuable metals e g ca k mo na were also solubilized from ad sludge the lack of these elements could exert negative impacts on plant growth when biosolids are applied to agricultural land thus requiring further investigation in future field studies in addition if directly returned to the wwtp the solubilized metals in the liquid phase would precipitate into the sludge again as such downstream recovery needs to be explored to extract valuable metals from the liquid phase the biosolids ph also needs to be adjusted to neutral before disposal however according to titration tests 30 kg lime is required per ton ts to adjust the ph from 2 0 to 7 0 which will only incur aud 1 5 per ton ts processed 5 conclusion this study proposes and demonstrates a novel ammonium based bioleaching approach to remove toxic metals from ad sludge the approach leverages an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium to generate protons h while oxidizing the ammonium inherent in ad sludge the main conclusions are as follows an acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing consortium was

16905,anaerobically digested ad sludge is widely applied to agricultural land as fertilizer however heavy metals in ad sludge potentially pose a significant threat to environment this study reports a novel bioleaching approach with no need for externally added chemicals sludge acidification was achieved using the protons produced from microbial oxidation of the inherent ammonium in ad sludge an acid tolerant microbial consortium dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria from the genus candidatus nitrosoglobus i e relative abundance of 72 5 2 3 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing was enriched after 120 days incubation in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor the consortium oxidizes ammonium even at ph 2 5 at approximately 30 of its maximum rate measured at ph 5 5 inoculating the consortium at a solid ratio of 1 20 caused the ph of the ad sludge to decrease from 7 5 to 2 0 over five days under aerobic conditions as a result metals in the ad sludge were efficiently extracted into the liquid phase in particular two of the most abundant toxic metals cu and zn were solubilized with high efficiencies of 88 4 and 96 3 respectively overall the results of this study enable the economical and safe reuse of excess sludge generated during biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioleaching biosolids reuse acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers candidatus nitrosoglobus toxic metal removal 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment generates a large amount of sludge sludge treatment and disposal account for up to 50 of the total operational expenditure in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp campbell 2000 one of the most commonly used methods of sludge treatment is anaerobic digestion which can reduce sludge organic content by 30 50 while recovering bioenergy i e ch4 appels et al 2008 anaerobically digested ad sludge can be applied to agricultural land as fertilizer whereby nitrogen phosphorus organic substances and other micronutrients in the sludge are recycled for agricultural production beck et al 1996 epstein 1975 despite tremendous economic benefits land application of ad sludge is limited due to the presence of toxic metals such as cd cr cu ni pb and zn kemper and sommer 2002 when leached into soil these metals can contaminate groundwater and accumulate up the food chain if ingested mcgrath et al 2000 ozores hampton et al 2005 wei and liu 2005 ultimately the accumulation of toxic metals in humans can lead to metabolic disorders and chronic diseases tchounwou et al 2012 therefore it is essential for environmental and human health that toxic metals are removed prior to land application in ad sludge metals predominantly co exist with sulfides oxides hydroxides silicates or organic matter complexes lake et al 1984 in these forms most metals can be solubilized through chemical leaching at ph 2 0 3 0 with the addition of inorganic acids e g h2so4 hcl or hno3 bayat and sari 2010 lo and chen 1990 the chemical dosage can be reduced by up to 80 with bioleaching which uses microbial metabolism to leach metals from sludge pathak et al 2009 bioleaching can be carried out under anaerobic or aerobic conditions anaerobic bioleaching relies on the volatile fatty acids vfas produced from the first stage of anaerobic digestion i e sludge fermentation to leach metals molaey et al 2021 however the generation of vfas requires readily biodegradable cod therefore anaerobic bioleaching is more appropriate for wasted activated sludge was meulepas et al 2015 rather than ad sludge in which the readily biodegradable cod has been converted to biogas in the preceding anaerobic digestion process existing aerobic bioleaching approaches mainly exploit two types of microorganisms to generate acids i e iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria blais et al 1992 bosecker 1997 jain and tyagi 1992 pathak et al 2009 ryu et al 2003 tyagi et al 1988 wong et al 2004 wong and henry 1983 xiang et al 2000 for instance wong et al 2004 cultivated an indigenous iron oxidizing bacterium from wastewater sludge when inoculated into ad sludge the bacterium acidified it to ph 1 7 2 0 over 16 days by oxidizing fes2 leading to 99 zn and 74 cu solubilization however the dosage of ferrous and sulfur containing compounds such as feso4 fes2 or s0 incurs considerable cost in addition the residual sulfur and iron compounds in biosolids can cause secondary pollution through soil acidification chan et al 2003 microbial ammonium oxidation is an acid producing process which can generate two moles of protons h per mole of ammonium nh4 oxidized eq 1 ad sludge typically contains ammonium at 35 7 107 1 mmol 500 1500 mg nh4 n l 1 in the supernatant appels et al 2008 parkin and owen 1986 which can generate 71 214 mmol l 1 of protons when fully oxidized this concentration of protons is able to drive the ph of ad sludge to less than 2 during chemical leaching tyagi et al 1988 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o hereby we hypothesize that it is possible to leach metals from ad sludge utilizing the protons generated from microbial oxidation of ammonium inherent in the ad sludge to achieve this a key challenge is to cultivate ammonia oxidizers that are able to function at low ph i e 2 0 to date a few acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing microbial cultures have been obtained from natural environments such as acidic soils date et al 2012 hayatsu et al 2017 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 however microbial ammonium oxidation in engineered wastewater treatment systems normally proceeds at neutral ph the role of extremely acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers in a wastewater treatment system is not well understood although the low ph had been observed in some engineered nitrification reactors fumasoli et al 2017 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b the goal of this study is to develop a bioleaching approach to remove toxic metals from ad sludge without addition of external chemicals the two specific objectives are i to enrich and characterize indigenous acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers from activated sludge and ii to evaluate leaching efficiencies for toxic metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn using ammonium based bioleaching the ammonia oxidizing enrichment was conducted in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor sbr with conventional activated sludge as inoculum and the supernatant of ad sludge as a source of ammonium the bioleaching experiment was conducted by inoculating the enriched ammonia oxidizing consortium into ad sludge to achieve sludge acidification and metal leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of a reactor to enrich an acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing consortium a laboratory sbr with a working volume of 2 l was set up to cultivate acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers the sbr was initially inoculated with 1 l conventional activated sludge from the aerobic tank of a local municipal wwtp the sbr was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm unless otherwise specified and the temperature was maintained at 22 1 c in an air conditioned laboratory the sbr was fed with ad sludge supernatant ad liquor which was collected weekly from the local wwtp transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c prior to use the ad liquor had an average ammonium concentration of 881 79 mg n l 1 63 0 5 6 mmol l 1 n 11 and alkalinity of 32 1 2 3 mmol caco3 l 1 n 11 with an alkalinity calculated as caco3 to ammonium molar ratio of 0 51 the ad liquor ph was 8 1 0 2 n 11 and the total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble cod scod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp

110 min and decanting 10 min in the aerobic period compressed air was diffused via an aeration stone with the flow rate controlled at 1 l min 1 using an airflow meter controller cole parmer ew 32460 40 u s the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the reactor was constantly above 5 mg o2 l 1 as monitored with an optical do sensor mettler toledo inpro6860i 12 120 ma hd switzerland in each 10 day aerobic period 1 l ad liquor was fed to the sbr with a peristaltic pump which was switched on for 10 min per day by a programmed timer once the total volume reached two litres in 10 days the sbr entered a settling period where the feeding pump aerator and stirrer were stopped subsequent to settling one litre of supernatant was discharged exchange ratio 50 after which the next 10 day cycle was initiated thereby the sbr had a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days corresponding to an average ammonium loading rate of 44 mg n l 1 d 1 the ph in the sbr was continuously monitored with a ph probe tps 121207 australia and a transmitter minichem p australia but not controlled at any time throughout the 110 day operation the influent tkn effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate volatile suspended solids vss and tss in the reactor were measured every 10 days sampling of sludge 10 ml for microbial community analysis were carried out every 20 days the sampled biomass was stored at 80 c prior to microbial community profiling no excess sludge was discharged during the reactor operation except for sampling accordingly sludge retention time srt was estimated to be more than 100 days 2 2 metal leaching experiments after ammonium removal was stably achieved at an acidic ph range of 2 0 3 0 in the enrichment sbr metal leaching experiments were carried out in four 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks three as experimental and one as control initially each of the four flasks was filled with 200 ml ad sludge with composition described below and was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm subsequently 200 ml mixed liquor collected from the sbr day 100 was added to each of the three experimental flasks in contrast the control flask was supplemented with sterilized 120 c for 30 min sbr culture in the following five days compressed air was constantly supplied via air diffusers giving a do level above 5 mg o2 l 1 in the flasks mettler toledo inpro6860i 12 120 ma hd switzerland mixed liquor samples were taken every 24 h after 0 45 µm membrane filtration of the mixed liquor supernatant ph ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved metal concentrations were determined as described in section 2 4 the solubilization efficiency of respective metals was then calculated as the dissolved metal concentration c s divided by initial total metal concentration c t the ad sludge was collected from the full scale anaerobic digester at the same wwtp and stored at 4 c prior to use the full scale anaerobic digester was operated at an srt of 25 days the stored ad sludge contained 26 3 0 7 g l 1 n 3 total solids ts 19 2 0 8 g l 1 n 3 volatile solids vs 1628 119 mg l 1 tkn n 3 and 1000 95 mg l 1 tp n 3 respectively the solids ratio of the sbr culture to ad sludge in leaching experiments was set at 1 20 2 3 batch assays to determine the effects of ph and ammonium concentration on ammonium oxidation activity the ph and ammonium concentration are two critical operational parameters for the ammonium based leaching approach as such a group of batch assays was designed to assess how different ph values and ammonium concentrations impact the ammonia oxidizing activity of the cultivated consortium during sbr operation from day 90 to day 110 the oxygen uptake rate our due to ammonium oxidation ournh4 was used as an indicator of ammonia oxidizing activity in this work the determination of ournh4 is detailed in supplementary materials to explore the effect of ammonium the ournh4 was determined at various ammonium levels from 0 to 500 mg n l 1 0 6 12 28 24 30 60 80 120 180 240 300 400 500 mg n l 1 at a fixed ph of 5 5 to investigate the ph effect the ournh4 was determined at ph levels of 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 with the initial ammonium concentration controlled at approximately 160 mg n l 1 dosing 2 5 ml nh4cl stock solution 62 5 g n l 1 to avoid ammonium limitation at low ph the specific our sour was calculated as the quotient of ournh4 and the vss concentration with the

supernatant 3 6 ml was mixed with 70 hno3 0 4 ml and digested at 160 c for 20 min 10 min for temperature increase to 160 c and 10 min at 160 c solubilized metal concentrations were determined from icp oes analysis of the digested supernatant the respective n2o and no emission factors were measured and calculated adopting the methodology of wang et al 2021b 2 5 microbial analyses the dna extraction from biomass and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were carried out as detailed in supplementary materials raw amplicon reads were processed using dada2 callahan et al 2016 to infer amplicon sequence variants asvs of 463 bp length the filtered merged denoised and chimera free reads were classified against the silva small subunit ssu database release 138 quast et al 2013 visualization of the amplicon sequencing data was performed using r package tidyverse in rstudio the raw sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra database with the accession numbers srr13341537 srr13341542 2 5 1 full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis full length 16s rrna gene sequences were recovered from the dna sample on day 100 following the procedures in supplementary materials three valid full length 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained and aligned by clustal x software version 1 81 thompson et al 1997 phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the neighbour joining method with kimura 2 parameter mode kimura 1980 implemented in the mega package version 7 kumar et al 2016 the statistical reliability was assessed with 1000 bootstrap replicates a full length 16s rrna gene sequence 1508 bp was submitted to genbank database with the accession number mw431319 2 5 2 scanning electron microscopy micro morphology of the biomass sample collection from the sbr on day 100 was examined with a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6610 u s prior to the analysis the samples were dried overnight at room temperature 25 c in a vacuum oven accutemp 26l australia then the dried samples were coated twice with a carbon coater quorum q150t uk following the three heavy burst model to obtain a carbon thickness of 30 40 nm 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance anova in this study the p values less than 0 001 0 01 0 05 were summarized with three two and one asterisks respectively 3 results 3 1 enrichment of an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium fig 1 shows the ph variation nitrification performance and microbial community shift during the continuous operation of the enrichment sbr the ph in the sbr gradually decreased from 7 2 to 5 0 in the first 10 days fig 1a ammonium was converted to nitrate with no nitrite accumulated in the reactor fig 1b suggesting the presence of both ammonium oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing activity during day 10 20 the ph further dropped from 5 0 to 3 5 fig 1a while 80 mg no2 n l 1 accumulated fig 1b the accumulation of nitrite indicated that nob was suppressed likely due to the low ph 3 5 the accumulated nitrite formed free nitrous acid fna hno2 h no2 in situ which further intensified the inhibition of nob leading to more nitrite accumulation and less nitrate li et al 2020 due to the higher nitrite fna accumulation ammonium oxidizing activity was also inhibited vadivelu et al 2006 zheng et al 2018 likely responsible for the temporary ph increase from 3 5 to 6 0 during day 20 30 fig 1a nevertheless ph decreased again from 6 0 to 4 0 during day 30 60 fig 1a even in the presence of 300 mg no2 n l 1 implying that an acid and fna tolerant ammonia oxidizer could emerge in the reactor during this period the no and n2o emission ratios were measured to be 1 1 0 2 and 0 3 0 1 of the influent ammonium load representing only a small proportion of nitrogen loss considering do was constantly higher than 5 mg l 1 denitrification should be negligible from day 60 the ph further decreased to below 4 0 and finally stabilized at 2 5 meanwhile nitrite accumulation ceased nitrate concentration gradually built up and 30 tn loss was observed this was likely due to chemical disproportion of nitrite into nitrate and multiple volatile nitrogenous compounds e g no n2o at ph 4 fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 the emission factors of no and n2o during day 80 110 were measured to be 26 5 2 3 and 0 2 0 1 of the influent ammonia load respectively which are roughly commensurate with the nitrogen loss fig 1c and d present the microbial community dynamics revealed by amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes nitrosomonas and nitrospira populations were detected in the inoculum day 0 with a relative abundance of 1 5 0 2 and 3 3 0 1 respectively these common nitrifiers gradually disappeared instead a single gamma proteobacterial genus of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob candidatus nitrosoglobus gradually became predominant in the microbial community with relative abundance increasing from 0 on day 0 to 0 5 0 02 on day 20 and finally to 72 5 2 3 on day 100 fig 1c a previous isolate from acidic soil ca nitrosoglobus terrae was reported to perform ammonium oxidation at acidic ph as low as 2 0 hayatsu et al 2017 together with the nitrification performance these results indicate the enrichment of an extremely acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium moreover another genus mycobacterium was also found to be abundant in the sbr on day 100 with a relative abundance of 15 2 0 4 however all reported species within the mycobacterium genus are heterotrophs with no capacity for ammonium oxidation emde et al 1992 song et al 2019 additionally the biodiversity significantly reduced in the extremely acidic conditions as indicated by the decreased shannon s and simpson s indices over time fig 1d amplicon sequencing can only generate 16s rrna gene fragments of relatively short lengths i e 463 bp in this study in order to perform phylogenetic identification of the enriched ca nitrosoglobus at a species level full length 16s rrna gene sequences 1456 bp were retrieved by cloning sequencing the three clone sequences obtained share 99 1 100 similarity with each other therefore only one clone sequence was chosen to infer a phylogenetic tree that encompasses 21 full length 16s rrna gene sequences from genera nitrosospira nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and ca nitrosoglobus fig 2 a it should be noted that ca nitrosoglobus was recently identified as a new gamma proteobacterial aob γ aob genus with only one representative ca nitrososglobus terrae isolated from an acidic soil sample hayatsu et al 2017 the sequence retrieved from the sbr biomass has 99 6 identity to ca nitrososglobus terrae these two ca nitrosoglobus populations are closely affiliated with another γ aob genus nitrosococcus these γ aob members altogether form a monophyletic lineage distinct from nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the sem analysis shows that the enriched consortium largely comprises coccoid cells of 1 2 μm diameter fig 2b which is similar to the morphology of other γ aob species such as nitrosococcus and ca nitrosoglobus terrae hayatsu et al 2017 koops et al 1990 these results indicate the successful cultivation and enrichment of ca nitrosoglobus sp from an activated sludge sample 3 2 effects of ph and ammonium concentration on ammonium oxidation activity batch activity assays were carried out to shed light on how ph and ammonium concentration would impact ammonium oxidation activity of the enriched microbial consortium fig 3 a shows that the maximum sour of the consortium 37 5 mg o2 g 1vss h 1 was achieved under slightly acidic conditions i e ph 5 5 between ph 5 5 to 8 5 the sour was maintained above 30 mg o2 g 1vss h 1 in the ph range of 2 5 5 5 the ammonium oxidation activity declined with decreased ph nevertheless ammonium oxidation did not cease to occur at ph 2 5 the sour at ph 2 5 was approximately 30 of its maximum at ph 5 5 suggesting that the ammonia oxidizing consortium can efficiently perform ammonium oxidation under extremely acidic conditions the effect of ammonium concentration on the activity was investigated at the optimal ph of 5 5 fig 3b this result was fitted well by the michaelis menten equation r 2 0 93 the substrate affinity constant of the enriched consortium was estimated to be 9 6 4 6 mg nh3 nh4 n l 1 3 3 bioleaching of metals from ad sludge by inoculation with enriched ammonia oxidizing consortium bioleaching experiments were conducted to evaluate removal efficiencies of various metals from ad sludge fig 4 a shows the nitrogen and ph profiles over a 5 day aeration period in the first 24 h when ph decreased from 7 24 to 5 10 the amount of ammonium oxidation 53 3 mg n l 1 was comparable to nitrite formation 52 2 mg n l 1 fig 4a no nitrate formed due to the absence of nob in the inoculum from time 24 h to 120 h as ammonium oxidation continued the ph further decreased to 2 03 meanwhile the nitrite decreased to zero and nitrate concentration rose instead this is consistent with reactor performance fig 1a and literature showing the chemical oxidation of nitrite to nitrate at ph 4 0 fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 nitrite oxidation to nitrate was accompanied by a tn loss of 50 mg n l 1 representing 10 of the initial ammonium concentration the tn loss in the batch system was lower than that in the reactor system 30 presumably due to the shorter time span in batch 5 days than in the reactor hrt 20 days in contrast since ad sludge does not contain active ammonia oxidizers the ph remained unchanged in the control group i e initially inoculated with a sterilized consortium data not shown these results demonstrate that the inoculated acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium is essential to the ph decrease in ad sludge low ph can facilitate metal solubilization fig 4 b d show the respective solubilization efficiencies of 16 metals over time as the ph decreased with time the solubilization of all metals increased concomitantly fig 4 e compares the metal distributions between solid and liquid phases at 0 h and 120 h at the beginning of the leaching experiment apart from na b ca k mg the metals predominantly reside in the solid phase 95 after 5 day aeration a removal efficiency of over 60 was achieved for the majority of the 16 metals the four remaining metals with limited solubilization were cr pb fe and mo these metals were previously reported to bind with complex organic substances which cannot be easily solubilized at acidic ph du et al 2015 overall the metal solubilization efficiencies were comparable to those achieved in sulfur iron based aerobic bioleaching jain and tyagi 1992 tyagi et al 1988 wong and henry 1983 xiang et al 2000 and anaerobic bioleaching meulepas et al 2015 demonstrating the effectiveness of ammonium based bioleaching 4 discussion 4 1 ammonium based bioleaching as an innovative approach for removal of toxic metals from ad sludge through the successful microbial enrichment and leaching experiments this study for the first time demonstrates a novel ammonium based bioleaching approach without external chemical addition the approach relies on an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium to generate protons h while oxidizing the ammonium inherent in ad sludge the consortium was enriched in a laboratory sbr which performed stable ammonium oxidation at ph 2 6 0 1 over a period of 120 days fig 1 the 16s rrna gene based pcr and sequence analysis revealed that a nitrosoglobus like population was the sole ammonia oxidizer in the consortium reaching a relative abundance of above 70 based on its capacity to create a strongly acidic environment via ammonium oxidation the consortium was inoculated into ad sludge successfully acidifying the sludge to ph 2 over a 5 day aeration period fig 4 a as expected the acidification of ad sludge led to efficient metal solubilization fig 4 b e among the 16 metals assessed 12 were solubilized with efficiencies higher than 60 while four cr pb fe and mo had efficiencies below 30 the acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium enriched from activated sludge is critical to the ammonium based bioleaching approach proposed in this study common ammonia oxidizers in activated sludge are acid sensitive for example nitrosomonas ceased to oxidize ammonia at ph below 6 fumasoli et al 2015 nitrosospira although detected in slightly acidic soils ph 4 6 showed no growth below ph 6 in a pure culture study jiang and bakken 1999 certain ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were shown to be obligate acidophiles but completely lost activity at ph 4 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 hence these previously known ammonia oxidizers cannot drive ph down to 2 as required for metal leaching to the best of our knowledge γ proteobacterial ca nitrosoglobus terrae is the only known aob that is able to survive at extremely acidic conditions ph 2 indeed in strongly acidic soils ca nitrosoglobus terrae was found to have higher transcript activity than aoa and β aob hayatsu et al 2017 unfortunately this soil borne γ aob species has a low affinity for total ammonium high half saturation constant of 2100 mg n l 1 at optimal ph 6 0 the low ammonium affinity makes it unsuitable for ammonium based metal leaching from ad sludge as the relatively low ammonium level i e 500 1500 mg n l 1 in the ad sludge would limit microbial activity in contrast the ca nitrosoglobus like population presented in this study has a substantially high affinity to ammonium with an affinity constant of 9 6 4 6 mg n l 1 at optimal ph of 5 5 fig 3 b therefore the ca nitrosoglobus from sludge represents the only known ammonia oxidizer to date which is appropriate for ammonium based bioleaching of ad sludge ammonium based bioleaching utilizes the ammonium inherent in ad sludge thereby avoiding the use of external chemicals previous studies of ad sludge leaching via chemical leaching or sulfur iron based bioleaching demand substantial external chemical dosing with inorganic acids sulfur and iron jain and tyagi 1992 xiang et al 2000 chemical addition not only incurs extra cost but also generates secondary pollution e g soil acidification when the treated ad sludge is applied to agricultural land for instance in the case of sulfur based bioleaching powdered elemental sulfur needs to be supplied in excess 5 10 g s l 1 to prevent sulfur limitation tyagi et al 1994 usually around 50 of the sulfur powder remains in the bioleached sludge leading to soil acidification when the sludge is applied to land blais et al 1992 in contrast ammonium based bioleaching utilizes the abundant ammonium in ad sludge thus avoiding the need for external chemicals after dewatering about 90 residual ammonium and its oxidative products nitrates remain in the liquid phase i e the ad supernatant ad supernatant can be separately treated or returned to the mainstream wastewater for nitrogen removal the remaining 10 ammonium nitrite in the solid phase could serve as nitrogen fertilizer for soil moreover the ammonium based bioleaching does not require pre acidification of ad sludge as required in the previously reported iron based bioleaching process conventional iron oxidizing bacteria such as thiobacillus ferrooxidans cannot grow at ph 4 5 tyagi et al 1988 as such in order to employ thiobacillus ferrooxidans for bioleaching the ph of ad sludge must be pre acidified to 4 5 using inorganic acids in contrast the ca nitrosoglobus enrichment culture maintains ammonium oxidizing activity within the broad range of ph 2 0 8 5 fig 3 a in the presented bioleaching experiment the ph effectively decreased from 7 5 to about 2 0 without external chemical acidification fig 4 a therefore ammonium based bioleaching represents a cost effective and environmentally friendly process for removing toxic metals prior to final disposal of ad sludge for comparison with ammonium based bioleaching the ph of ad sludge was directly adjusted to 2 0 with hcl the metal solubilization efficiencies were compared with bioleaching results fig s1 it can be seen that most metals including mn na ni al ba ca k and mg were solubilized at comparable efficiencies with no significant differences p 0 05 between chemical and ammonium based bioleaching however bioleaching achieved significantly higher cu 88 4 versus 19 2 and zn 96 3 versus 50 5 solubilization efficiencies than chemical leaching the reason could be that cu and zn are bound with organics which cannot be released solely with acidic ph molaey et al 2021 it is important to note that cu and zn concentrations failed to meet the grade a biosolids standard table 1 with chemical leaching the cu content remained grade c and zn grade b demonstrating that chemical leaching is not as efficient as ammonium based bioleaching a direct quantitative comparison of ammonium based bioleaching with previous leaching methods including fe s based bioleaching chemical leaching and anaerobic bioleaching is difficult at the current stage as the results are highly dependent on the characteristics of ad sludge in the future a comparison should be done using standardized ad sludge herein to estimate the economic potential of the proposed technology a desktop scale up study on a plant with 800 000 population equivalents was conducted details in supplementary materials the results show that ammonium based bioleaching can achieve annual savings of aud 657 750 the savings could be up to aud 1 860 000 if the improvement in quality from grade c to a is considered nevertheless the cost benefit analysis can only be regarded as indicative at the current stage a rigorous economic analysis and a quantitative comparison should be performed with a practical scale up study it is noted that the present study is proof of concept research demonstrating the technological feasibility of ammonium based bioleaching the process concept consists of two parts i enrichment of acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers and ii metal leaching from ad sludge by inoculating the enriched culture the two steps could potentially be integrated into a single process which receives and discharges ad sludge in a semi or continuous pattern as such key operational parameters such as srt and hrt require further optimization in addition at ph 4 multiple volatile nitrogenous compounds such as no no2 and n2o3 would be generated fumasoli et al 2017 udert et al 2005 which explains the nitrogen loss in the sbr these compounds pose potential risks to human health medinets et al 2015 therefore off gas treatment to remove these gaseous compounds may be required for instance via denitrification biofilters jiang et al 2008 lu et al 2011 4 2 implications for biosolids management ad sludge is an important biosolid generated in biological wastewater treatment the ad sludge in this study contained cu and zn concentrations of 676 12 and 930 34 mg kg 1 dry solids which merely meet the grade c biosolids standard new south wales environment protection authority sydney 2000 through the ammonium based bioleaching process the quality of ad sludge with respect to metals can be upgraded from c to a table 1 the improved quality could significantly reduce sludge disposal costs as the sludge can be disposed locally rather than be transported to remote sites batstone et al 2011 on a global scale the concentration of toxic metals in biosolids is stringently regulated both the u s environmental protection agency and european communities directive set a maximum annual metal loading rate for the land application of biosolids european council 1986 usepa 1993 therefore the decreased metal concentration in bioleached sludge means that more sludge can be applied to the same land annually without exceeding the allowable cumulative toxic metal loading rate hence ammonium based bioleaching of ad sludge would benefit the water industry by reducing operational costs as well as promoting biosolids reuse in a circular economy it should be noted that along with the toxic metal removal some nutritionally valuable metals e g ca k mo na were also solubilized from ad sludge the lack of these elements could exert negative impacts on plant growth when biosolids are applied to agricultural land thus requiring further investigation in future field studies in addition if directly returned to the wwtp the solubilized metals in the liquid phase would precipitate into the sludge again as such downstream recovery needs to be explored to extract valuable metals from the liquid phase the biosolids ph also needs to be adjusted to neutral before disposal however according to titration tests 30 kg lime is required per ton ts to adjust the ph from 2 0 to 7 0 which will only incur aud 1 5 per ton ts processed 5 conclusion this study proposes and demonstrates a novel ammonium based bioleaching approach to remove toxic metals from ad sludge the approach leverages an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing consortium to generate protons h while oxidizing the ammonium inherent in ad sludge the main conclusions are as follows an acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing consortium was enriched in a laboratory sbr over a 120 day period with stable ammonium oxidizing performance at ph 2 6 0 1 the consortium maintained ammonium oxidation even at ph 2 5 at approximately 30 of its maximum rate at ph 5 5 based on its capability to induce leaching through low ph the enriched consortium was inoculated into ad sludge which led to acidification ph 2 0 and efficient metal solubilization 88 4 of cu and 96 3 of zn through ammonium based bioleaching the toxic metal grade of ad sludge was improved from c to a enabling economical safe reuse of excess sewage sludge

16906,wide application leads to release of graphene oxide go in aquatic environment where it is subjected to photoaging and changes in physicochemical properties as important component of natural organic matters proteins may greatly affect the aggregation behaviors of photoaged go the effects of a typical model protein bovine serum albumin bsa on the colloidal stability of photoaged go were firstly investigated photoaging reduced the lateral size and oxygen containing groups of go while the graphene domains and hydrophobicity increased as a function of irradiation time 0 24 h consequently the photoaged go became less stable than the pristine one in electrolyte solutions adsorption of bsa on the surface of the photoaged go decreased as well leading to thinner bsa coating on the photoaged go in the solutions with low concentrations of electrolytes the aggregation rate constants k of all the photoaged go firstly increased to the maximum agglomeration rate constants k fast regime i maintained at k fast regime ⅱ and then decreased to zero regime ⅲ as the bsa concentration increased in both regime i and iii the photoaged go were less stable at the same bsa concentrations and the impacts of bsa on the colloidal stability of the photoaged go were less than the pristine one which was attributed to the weaker interactions between the photoaged go and bsa this study provided new insights into the colloidal stability and fate of go nanomaterials which are subjected to extensive light irradiation in wastewater and protein rich aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide go photoaging aggregation kinetics protein ohshima s soft particle theory 1 introduction emerging as a typical two dimensional nanomaterial graphene oxide go possesses unique mechanical electrical and thermal properties and is widely applied in a range of fields li and kaner 2008 rao et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 as a consequence of the large amounts of production and application of go and go based nanomaterials go has great potential to be present in natural aquatic environment thus triggering uncertain environmental effects and ecological risks ren et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 many studies demonstrated that go displayed dose and size dependent toxicities to organisms such as bacteria gao et al 2017b algae zhao et al 2018 and zebra fish yang et al 2019 and could be accumulated in human via food chain fadeel et al 2018 the colloidal stability and aggregation behaviors of go may significantly affect its transport environmental fate bioavailability and biological effects qi et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 due to the abundant oxygen containing groups go is usually considered to be quite stable in natural aquatic environment chowdhury et al 2013 the colloidal stability of go is not only determined by its own physicochemical properties such as the lateral size and abundance of oxygen containing groups which is related to the degree of reduction or oxidation but also dependent on the water chemistry conditions including ph salt type and ionic strength as well as other substances such as natural organic matter nom and minerals chowdhury et al 2013 2014 hong et al 2012 mustafa et al 2013 a previous study indicated that most of the go nanosheets would form large aggregates and finally settled in natural surface water within 24 h gao et al 2017a given the reactive nature go may be subjected to aging in aquatic environment as a result of multiple physical and chemical processes photoaging is one of the most typical processes because go may effectively adsorb sunlight due to its special sp2 domains gengler et al 2013 zhao and jafvert 2015 as a consequence the physicochemical properties of go could be altered and the colloidal stability and toxicity would be distinctly different from the pristine go materials an et al 2020 du et al 2019 gallegos pérez et al 2020 xia et al 2015 sunlight irradiation not only reduces the content of oxygen containing groups of go by generation of co2 and low molecular weight substances but also breaks it into smaller go nanosheets chowdhury et al 2015a hsieh and zepp 2019 shams et al 2019 besides ultraviolet uv light is frequently used in wastewater treatment plant for removal of environmental pollutants and toxicants zheng et al 2017 specifically the hydroxyl and epoxy groups of go are susceptible to photodegradation and go with fewer reactive functional groups exhibited lower degradation rate shams et al 2019 therefore sunlight and uv light irradiation might significantly affect the stability and environmental fate of go in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 up to now only a few studies have investigated the impacts of some common water chemistry conditions e g salt type ionic strength ph and humic substances on colloidal stability and long term transport of photoaged go in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 reported that the disorder degree was more important than the oxygen containing functional groups in colloidal stability of photoaged go chowdhury et al 2015a found that the photoaged go under anaerobic condition was less stable than that under aerobic condition moreover the omnipresent nom in aquatic environments may interact with the surface functional groups of the photoaged go thus significantly affecting the aggregation transport and toxicities of the photoaged go hu et al 2011 qiang et al 2016 the origins of nom in aquatic environments are complex and heterogeneous including humic substances proteins and root exudates philippe and schaumann 2014 sun et al 2016 humic substances usually enhance go stability through increased electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsive force between go nanosheets jiang et al 2017 su et al 2017 the aggregation rate constants k of the photoaged go irradiation for 187 h decreased at least one order of magnitude in the presence of 1 mg l humic acid suggesting that humic acid greatly improved its colloidal stability chowdhury et al 2015a as important components of nom proteins were observed to affect the go stability in a different way from humic substances because of the special physicochemical properties of proteins sun et al 2018 2020 there are hundreds of kinds of proteins in wastewater guo et al 2014 le et al 2016 many processing industries such as abattoir whey casein and fish produce protein rich wastewater in which the concentration of proteins is in the range of 1 20 mg l feng et al 2011 xia et al 2013 as an important component of nom and the major biomacromolecule in extracellular polymeric substances sheng et al 2016 protein is also found in natural aquatic environment xu et al 2016 bsa bovine serum albumin is commonly used as a model biomacromolecule due to its high structural stability low cost and high percentages of sequence identities with human serum albumin 76 kuchlyan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 previous studies reported that both bsa and ovalbumin affected go stability in a non linear relationship sun et al 2018 2020 the interactions between go and proteins were complicated by go lateral size protein properties and concentrations as well as water chemistry conditions sun et al 2018 2020 most of previous studies regarding colloidal stability of transformed go took humic substances as model nom jiang et al 2017 xia et al 2015 it is hypothesized that the impacts of proteins on photoaged go might be distinctly different from the pristine ones in spired by the abovementioned hypothesis the impacts of proteins on the colloidal stability of photoaged go were investigated systematically bsa was selected as a model and representative protein and go was irradiated with simulated solar light for different periods the properties of the photoaged go and bsa were comprehensively characterized the aggregation kinetics and stability of the photoaged go were obtained under different water chemistry conditions in the presence of bsa at different concentrations ohshima s soft particle theory was applied to calculate the thickness of the protein bsa layer adsorbed on the surface of the photoaged go these results would shed lights on the environmental fate of photoaged go in natural aquatic environment especially in protein rich wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents single layer go powders were supplied by nanjing xfnano materials technologies co ltd nanjing china lyophilized powder of bsa a2153 were purchased from sigma aldrich company usa nacl mgcl2 6h2o and cacl2 2h2o were got from sinopharm chemical reagent co tianjin china the solution ph was adjusted with naoh and hcl solutions at 0 001 1 mol l electrolyte solutions and bsa solutions were freshly prepared before use and stored in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube nest biotechnology china ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm hhitech china was used for all the experiments 2 2 preparation and characterization of photoaged go forty mg of go powder was put into the glass bottle with 400 ml ultrapure water and stirred at 300 rpm for one night to activate the go surface and break large particles sun et al 2018 then the suspension was ultrasonicated in ice bath for 4 h to get a uniform go stock solution sun et al 2018 the concentration of pristine go was set at 50 mg l and 40 ml of the go suspension was added into a 50 ml grinding mouth transparent quartz tube with 15 mm magneton 300 rpm min the quartz tube was set in a photochemical reaction apparatus xpa 7 xu jiang machine plant nanjing china with a cyclic water installation and irradiated 800 w xenon lamp for 0 3 6 12 and 24 h respectively the wavelength range of the xenon lamp provided by the manufacture is shown in figure s1 which was almost in the typical solar spectrum 290 nm zhao et al 2020 quartz tubes were covered with aluminum paper and set in the photochemical reaction apparatus for 24 h as the control the period of 24 h was chosen considering that the go finally settled in natural surface water within 24 h chowdhury et al 2013 gao et al 2017a all the photoaged experiments were conducted in triplicates the go photoaged for different periods 0 3 6 12 and 24 h were labelled as go 0 go 3 go 6 go 12 and go 24 respectively the ph of the go suspension before and after light irradiation was in the range of 4 3 4 5 for the colloidal stability experiments the ph of the suspension was set as 5 5 unless stated otherwise to obtain sufficient samples to characterize the physicochemical properties of the photoaged go the aging experiments were repeated for many times and the samples were pooled the photoaged go suspensions were directly freeze dried to get solid samples for the following characterization the morphologies and lateral sizes of the photoaged go were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol 2100f japan field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini 500 zeiss germany respectively the chemical compositions and functional groups of photoaged go were analyzed by the uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan raman spectra renishaw invia uk fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir bruker tensor 37 germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ulvac phi japan potentiometric acid base titration and contact angle respectively potentiometric acid base titration was performed to the photoaged go 50 mg l with a titration apparatus zdj 5b inesa china using 0 1 mol l naoh as a titrant szabo et al 2006 tombacz et al 2020 the actual consumption of total proton concentrations toth was calculated using the equation t o t h v m c i 0 c i e where v is the total solution volume m is the mass of go ci o and ci e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively the total organic matter toc of the go suspension was measured by high temperature oxidation multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany 2 3 stability of the photoaged go in the presence and absence of bsa the initial aggregation kinetics of go were conducted by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls on zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk in the process of measuring d h and zeta potential of 2d plate shaped go nanosheets go was considered as spherical nanoparticles tombacz et al 2020 and dls might underestimate the real size of go jiang et al 2016 the detailed information of the method to determine and quantify the initial aggregation kinetics of go was described in previous studies kovalchuk and starov 2012 sun et al 2018 2020 and shown in supporting information the concentrations of the photoaged go for dls and zeta potential measurements were fixed at 4 6 mg c l which were higher than the environmental relevant concentrations ng l or μg l to ensure strong light intensities and then accurate measurement goodwin et al 2018 qi et al 2016 tombacz et al 2020 2 4 characterization of the interactions between photoaged go and bsa zeta potential of photoaged go as functions of bsa concentrations and electrolyte concentrations were measured on a malvern zetasizer batch experiments were conducted to reveal the adsorption capacity of bsa on photoaged go 0 and 24 h in 40 ml screw cap vials in the presence of 50 mm nacl at ph 5 5 the detailed procedure and bsa measurement method were described in our previous study sun et al 2018 the ohshima s soft particle theory has been widely used to reveal the interactions between biomacromolecules and nanoparticles li et al 2021 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 which are relevant to the biomacromolecules stabilization effect in stability of nanoparticles ohshima s soft particle theory was applied to calculate the thickness of bsa adsorbed on the photoaged go the detailed calculation formula and corresponding parameter are shown in supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the photoaged go to investigate the effects of sunlight irradiation on the physicochemical properties of go the surface morphology and lateral size of pristine go and photoaged go were inspected by hr tem and fesem respectively figure s2 and figure s3 all the go samples displayed nanosheet like structure broad lateral size distribution and go nanosheets were broken into smaller fragments with the extending irradiation time compared with the pristine go go 0 the surface of the photoaged go became coarse with some wrinkles the lateral size distribution of the photoaged go obtained from 100 go nanosheets in at least five fesem images is shown in figure s4 the result further confirmed that the d h of the photoaged gos decreased from 240 7 nm to 203 7 nm with the photoaging time fig 1 a which was consistent with the hr tem and fesem results the uv vis spectra of go before and after irradiation are shown in fig 1b and the absorbance of the photoaged go was in the range of 250 700 nm which might be attributed to the restoration of sp2 π conjugated network increased as a result of irradiation implying the formation of light absorbing components gao et al 2020 this is in agreement with the color change of the photoaged go which became much darker after photoaging figure s5 in addition the maximum absorption wavelength shifted toward blue region as the irradiation time increased which might be due to the decreased size of the π conjugated domains luo et al 2010 sun et al 2020 previous study also reported that go nanomaterials blue shifted with the decrease of the lateral size sun et al 2020 which supported the formation of smaller go nanosheets after exposure to light as shown in table s1 the toc content of the go decreased by 15 after 24 h of light exposure previous study demonstrated that prolonged irradiation time resulted in the degradation of go accompanied by the formation of low molecular weight substances and co2 hou et al 2015 the zeta potentials of the photoaged go were similar table s1 suggesting that light irradiation did not significantly change the surface zeta potential of go the surface chemical properties and hydrophobicity of the photoaged go were further characterized by raman ftir xps elemental analysis potentiometric acid base titration and contact angle respectively the ratio of id intensity of the d band 1335 cm 1 ig intensity of the g band 1596 cm 1 of raman spectra fig 1c is usually used to quantify and compare the structural defects in graphitic materials gao et al 2020 xia et al 2015 the id ig value of go continuously increased from 0 863 to 0 943 after 24 h of light exposure suggesting that more defect sites were produced on the graphitic sheets the increased id ig value of the photoaged go might be attributed to the formation of defects within the go structure and significant degree of fragmentation gao et al 2020 hou et al 2015 the ftir spectra in fig 1d suggested that there were many chemically reactive functional groups on the surface and defects sites of the photoaged go such as oh ch c o c c coh co and co c the ftir spectra of the photoaged go were similar without distinct differences however significant changes were observed in the xps spectra figure s6 the epoxy and hydroxyl groups decreased from 51 31 for go 0 to 30 69 for go 24 but the graphitic carbon contents including cc and c c groups increased from 36 05 to 53 26 while the relative contents of c o and o c o did not change much table s2 consequently the c o ratio increased from 1 77 for go 0 to 2 41 for go 24 which was consistent with the result of elemental analysis c o increased from 0 979 to 1 19 after 24 h of sunlight exposure table s3 the oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane were the major initiators of photodegradation of graphene nanomaterials gallegos pérez et al 2020 figure s7 shows that the surface charging curves of go 0 and go 24 as a function of solution ph the results confirmed that go 24 had less acidic sites and lower buffer capacity compared with go 0 at the same ph which was in line with the aforementioned characterization results the contact angle increased from 64 8 for go 0 to 80 7 for go 24 implying that the hydrophobicity of go increased after photoaging figure s8 3 2 effects of photoaging on the stability of go the aggregation rate constants k and corresponding aggregation profiles of the photoaged go in the presence of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 at a fixed concentration are shown in table s4 and figure s9 respectively the concentrations of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 were chosen as 50 mm 1 67 mm and 1 0 mm because the electrolytes at these concentrations did not induce fast aggregation of the photoaged go but allow to discern the differences in the stability of the studied go as shown in figure s9 go 0 aggregated slowly at 50 mm nacl 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 and the corresponding k values were 0 09 nm s 0 217 nm s and 0 612 nm s respectively divalent cations were more effective in inducing go 0 aggregation than na and ca2 displayed much greater ability in destabilizing go nanosheets than mg2 gao et al 2017a wu et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the stability of the photoaged go decreased with increasing irradiated time in the presence of nacl and mgcl2 with larger k values and d h table s4 the k value of the go 24 in the presence of nacl and mgcl2 increased by an order of magnitude to 1 098 nm s and 1 978 nm s relative to that of go 0 respectively while in the presence of cacl2 the k increased initially from 0 612 nm s for go 0 to 1 931 nm s for go 12 then remained constant as the irradiation time further increased to further reveal stability of the photoaged go taking go 0 go 6 and go 24 as example their aggregation kinetics as functions of na mg2 and ca2 concentrations were obtained at ph 5 5 fig 2 illustrates that the go colloidal attachment efficiencies α changed as functions of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 concentrations and the corresponding aggregation profiles are shown in figure s10 s12 much higher electrolyte concentration was required for α of the go 0 to reach 1 than go 6 and go 24 specially their ccc values were 125 4 mm 78 0 mm and 61 5 mm for nacl and 4 8 mm 2 9 mm and 2 2 mm for mgcl2 respectively the go 24 displayed better aqueous stability in nacl solution than many other nanoparticles such as hematite sheng et al 2016 titanate nanowires szabó et al 2015 single walled carbon nanotube swnts saleh et al 2010 mno2 huangfu et al 2019 and other inorganic 2d nanomaterials e g mos2 ws2 h bn and ti3c2tx mohona et al 2019 xie et al 2020 these distinct differences among the ccc values of the photoaged go indicated that their stability decreased with lower ccc and larger α as a consequence of photoaging in the presence of cacl2 however the cccca values decreased from 1 5 mm for go 0 to 1 2 mm for go 6 but maintained at 1 2 mm for go 24 according to the schulze hardy rule the ccc of dispersed nanoparticles in salt solutions is inversely proportional to the corresponding ion valence ccc 1 z6 z was cation valence the calculation results in table s5 indicated that the aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go followed the schulze hardy rule ca2 displayed much better ability in destabilizing go nanosheets than that of mg2 due to its larger ionic radius 0 99 å verse 0 65 å and stronger cation bridging crosslinking effect with oxygen containing groups i e hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of go sun et al 2018 yang et al 2016 since the go 0 was relatively unstable in cacl2 solution the impact of photoaging on the go nanomaterials was not distinct in the presence of ca2 which was consistent with previous results chowdhury et al 2015b xia et al 2015 figure s13 shows the variation of zeta potentials of the photoaged go as functions of nacl and cacl2 concentrations it was reported that smaller sized go materials were more stable in aquatic environments due to stronger electrical double layer repulsion ali et al 2020 sun et al 2020 szabo et al 2020 thus the slightly decreased lateral size should not explain the reduced colloidal stability of the photoaged go since the photoaged go had lower contents of oxygen containing groups and larger contact angles hydrophobic interaction among the particles increased which might trigger increased destabilization of the photoaged go 3 3 impacts of bsa on the colloidal stability of the photoaged go stability of protein itself is important in aggregation of go protein complex liu et al 2019 but it is hard to distinguish the go aggregation protein coagulation or go protein complex aggregation the uv vis spectrum and fluorescence spectrum of bsa did not change much as a function of the electrolyte concentrations indicating bsa was very stable at the experimental conditions of this study figure s14 and figure s15 the bsa at 300 mg l exhibited very good long term stability 72 h after incubation with electrolytes nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 even at high concentrations figure s16 which was in line with the result of our previous study sun et al 2018 this suggested that salting out effect of bsa in the electrolyte solutions at experimental concentrations was negligible in pure water bsa at 0 60 mg l did not affect the d h of the photoaged go distinctly figure s17 and no aggregate was observed in the suspension even the photoaged go nanomaterials were incubated with bsa for 72 h figure s18 all these indicated that bsa itself was very stable and it alone did not induce aggregation of the photoaged go through unfolded unfolded protein interaction dominguez medina et al 2016 to quantify the effect of bsa on aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go go 0 go 6 and go 24 were taken as an example the effect of bsa at 0 5 mg l on the aggregation rate constants and corresponding aggregation profiles of the photoaged go in the presence of 50 mm nacl 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 are shown in figure s19 s20 bsa significantly inhibited the stability of the photoaged go in the presence of 50 mm nacl with higher k values than those without bsa in the electrolytes of mgcl2 and cacl2 the inhibition effect of bsa was weaker particularly for the longer time photoaged go such as go 24 as discussed above go 24 was less stable especially in the presence of 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 thus the inhibition impact induced by bsa was not distinct although it did destabilize go 24 to further reveal how bsa affected the go stability variations of α and aggregation profiles of the go as a function of nacl concentrations in the presence of bsa at 0 5 mg l are shown in fig 3 and figure s21 respectively bsa significantly inhibited the go 0 stability with its ccc decreasing from 125 5 mm to 94 1 mm nacl bsa displayed an inhibition effect on go 6 and go 24 stability at relatively low concentrations of nacl as nacl concentration increased the inhibition effect was marginal the ccc of go 6 slightly decreased from 78 0 mm to 72 2 mm nacl while that of go 24 was constant 62 0 mm nacl table s6 to unveil the inherent interactions between bsa and the photoaged go relatively higher concentration of bsa was used aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go nanomaterials in the presence of salts 50 mm nacl 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 respectively were conducted fig 4 and figure s22 show the aggregation rate constant and aggregation profiles of the photoaged go go 0 go 6 and go 24 in the presence of 50 mm nacl as a function of bsa concentrations in the presence of 50 mm nacl the stability of the go all displayed a non linear relationship with the bsa concentrations the k increased to k fast regime i and then maintained at k fast over a range of bsa concentration regime ⅱ and decreased until to zero with further increase of bsa concentration regime ⅲ go 24 quickly formed large aggregates in the presence of 5 mg l bsa and 50 mm nacl figure s23a confirming that bsa at relatively low concentration did depress the colloidal stability of go 24 in electrolyte solutions in regime i and iii at the same bsa concentration the more extensively photoaged go had higher k values table s7 to compare the impacts of bsa on stability of the photoaged go an impact factor i was calculated to indicate the change of k as a function of bsa concentration δk δc in regime i bsa concentration 0 05 5 mg l the impact factor i was 0 856 0 802 and 0 357 for go 0 go 6 and go 24 respectively this suggested that the impact of bsa on the colloidal stability of the go decreased as the photoaging duration increased the absolute zeta potential values of the photoaged go in the presence of bsa 5 mg l as a function of nacl concentration were all lower than those without bsa which might be due to adsorption of bsa on the surface of go sun et al 2018 fig 5 the positively charged regimes lysine and arginine amide groups of bsa could bind with the negatively charged surface of go through electrostatic interactions sun et al 2018 the absolute zeta potentials of both go 0 and go 24 decreased with increasing bsa concentration and that of go 0 was higher than go 24 which was attributed to the more hydroxyl and epoxy groups of go 0 than go 24 figure s24 thus much more bsa molecules were needed to reduce the electrostatic repulsion among go 0 particles and drive k to k fast which was supportive of the observed large i factor for go 0 in regime i in the regime ⅲ the strong steric repulsion due to the adsorption of a large amount of bsa molecules on the go surface could boost their colloidal stability sun et al 2018 the tem images figure s23b revealed that go 24 was well dispersed in the presence of 60 mg l bsa and 50 mm nacl in this regime the i values were 0 210 0 210 and 0 075 for go 0 go 6 and go 24 respectively further certified that bsa displayed less impacts on the colloidal stability of the photoaged gos due to the reduced adsorption of bsa the adsorption results in figure s25 revealed that adsorption capacity of bsa on go 0 surface was slightly higher than that of go 24 which magnified the stronger interaction between bsa and go 0 a recent report indicated that enhanced degree of reduction could inhibit the serum protein fetal bovine serum adsorption on chemically reduced go to some extent wei et al 2015 although the hydrophobicity interaction between bsa and go 24 was greater than that of go 0 the decreased adsorption capacity of go 24 implied that surface hydrophobicity was not the predominant factor affecting go protein binding capacities in regime ⅲ go 24 was more inclined to form larger aggregates than go 6 and go 0 due to its stronger hydrophobicity the adsorbed layer thickness d of bsa on the photoaged go calculated by ohshima s soft particle theory decreased from 3 43 to 2 01 after 24 h photoaging table s8 which also supported the weaker interaction between the photoaged go and bsa similarly in the presence of 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 the k values of go 0 and go 24 followed similar variation trends as in the presence of 50 mm nacl see figure s26 and figure s27 the absolute zeta potential of both go 0 and go 24 decreased with the increase of bsa concentration figure s28 with the absolute zeta potential of go 0 higher than that of go 24 thus much more bsa molecules were needed to drive k of go 0 to k fast than that of go 24 in regime i the i values of go 24 were lower than those of go 0 in both mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions revealing that bsa displayed less impacts on colloidal stability of the photoaged go in regime i however in regime ⅲ at the same bsa concentration go 24 had lower k values which were different from the result in the presence of 50 mm nacl the absolute zeta potential of go 0 was lower than that of go 24 while the i values of go 24 were higher than those of go 0 as discussed above steric repulsion contributed by bsa molecules stabilized go with increasing bsa concentration compared with go 24 go 0 had more oxygen containing groups the cation bridging effect between divalent cations and go 0 might be stronger than that of go 24 the difference between go 0 and go 24 was larger in the presence of cacl2 than that of mgcl2 which could be due to the stronger cation bridging effect by ca2 all these indicated that photoaged go stability not only relied on its inherent physicochemical properties but also the salt types and protein concentration 3 4 aggregation kinetics of photoaged go in natural river water and synthetic wastewater aggregation kinetics of go 0 go 6 and go 24 in the presence of bsa at different concentrations were explored in natural river water and synthetic wastewater and the results are presented in figure s29 and figure s30 the physicochemical properties of the river water and detailed constitutes of the synthetic wastewater are listed in table s9 without bsa or with bsa at 5 mg l all the go materials rapidly formed large aggregates about 2 μm in both types of water however they were all stable in the river water and synthetic wastewater containing high concentration of bsa 60 mg l these results confirmed that proteins played a key role in the colloidal stability of photoaged go materials in natural water environments 4 conclusions once released to the wastewater or natural water systems go is going to experience photoaging due to exposure to uv or and sunlight irradiation collective results of this study indicated that sunlight irradiation significantly reduced the oxygen containing groups and enhanced the hydrophobicity of the go these changes not only led to the reduced stability of photoaged go but also depressed adsorption of bsa on the surface of photoaged go consequently the impacts of bsa on the photoaged go were lower than the pristine one these results implied that the released go might become unstable due to light irradiation leading to the more accumulation of the photoaged go in sediments particularly in protein rich environment environmental fate and ecological effect of go are relevant to its colloidal stability so the toxicities of photoaged go materials with different irradiated time might be different in

16906,wide application leads to release of graphene oxide go in aquatic environment where it is subjected to photoaging and changes in physicochemical properties as important component of natural organic matters proteins may greatly affect the aggregation behaviors of photoaged go the effects of a typical model protein bovine serum albumin bsa on the colloidal stability of photoaged go were firstly investigated photoaging reduced the lateral size and oxygen containing groups of go while the graphene domains and hydrophobicity increased as a function of irradiation time 0 24 h consequently the photoaged go became less stable than the pristine one in electrolyte solutions adsorption of bsa on the surface of the photoaged go decreased as well leading to thinner bsa coating on the photoaged go in the solutions with low concentrations of electrolytes the aggregation rate constants k of all the photoaged go firstly increased to the maximum agglomeration rate constants k fast regime i maintained at k fast regime ⅱ and then decreased to zero regime ⅲ as the bsa concentration increased in both regime i and iii the photoaged go were less stable at the same bsa concentrations and the impacts of bsa on the colloidal stability of the photoaged go were less than the pristine one which was attributed to the weaker interactions between the photoaged go and bsa this study provided new insights into the colloidal stability and fate of go nanomaterials which are subjected to extensive light irradiation in wastewater and protein rich aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide go photoaging aggregation kinetics protein ohshima s soft particle theory 1 introduction emerging as a typical two dimensional nanomaterial graphene oxide go possesses unique mechanical electrical and thermal properties and is widely applied in a range of fields li and kaner 2008 rao et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 as a consequence of the large amounts of production and application of go and go based nanomaterials go has great potential to be present in natural aquatic environment thus triggering uncertain environmental effects and ecological risks ren et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 many studies demonstrated that go displayed dose and size dependent toxicities to organisms such as bacteria gao et al 2017b algae zhao et al 2018 and zebra fish yang et al 2019 and could be accumulated in human via food chain fadeel et al 2018 the colloidal stability and aggregation behaviors of go may significantly affect its transport environmental fate bioavailability and biological effects qi et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 due to the abundant oxygen containing groups go is usually considered to be quite stable in natural aquatic environment chowdhury et al 2013 the colloidal stability of go is not only determined by its own physicochemical properties such as the lateral size and abundance of oxygen containing groups which is related to the degree of reduction or oxidation but also dependent on the water chemistry conditions including ph salt type and ionic strength as well as other substances such as natural organic matter nom and minerals chowdhury et al 2013 2014 hong et al 2012 mustafa et al 2013 a previous study indicated that most of the go nanosheets would form large aggregates and finally settled in natural surface water within 24 h gao et al 2017a given the reactive nature go may be subjected to aging in aquatic environment as a result of multiple physical and chemical processes photoaging is one of the most typical processes because go may effectively adsorb sunlight due to its special sp2 domains gengler et al 2013 zhao and jafvert 2015 as a consequence the physicochemical properties of go could be altered and the colloidal stability and toxicity would be distinctly different from the pristine go materials an et al 2020 du et al 2019 gallegos pérez et al 2020 xia et al 2015 sunlight irradiation not only reduces the content of oxygen containing groups of go by generation of co2 and low molecular weight substances but also breaks it into smaller go nanosheets chowdhury et al 2015a hsieh and zepp 2019 shams et al 2019 besides ultraviolet uv light is frequently used in wastewater treatment plant for removal of environmental pollutants and toxicants zheng et al 2017 specifically the hydroxyl and epoxy groups of go are susceptible to photodegradation and go with fewer reactive functional groups exhibited lower degradation rate shams et al 2019 therefore sunlight and uv light irradiation might significantly affect the stability and environmental fate of go in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 up to now only a few studies have investigated the impacts of some common water chemistry conditions e g salt type ionic strength ph and humic substances on colloidal stability and long term transport of photoaged go in aquatic environments gao et al 2020 reported that the disorder degree was more important than the oxygen containing functional groups in colloidal stability of photoaged go chowdhury et al 2015a found that the photoaged go under anaerobic condition was less stable than that under aerobic condition moreover the omnipresent nom in aquatic environments may interact with the surface functional groups of the photoaged go thus significantly affecting the aggregation transport and toxicities of the photoaged go hu et al 2011 qiang et al 2016 the origins of nom in aquatic environments are complex and heterogeneous including humic substances proteins and root exudates philippe and schaumann 2014 sun et al 2016 humic substances usually enhance go stability through increased electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsive force between go nanosheets jiang et al 2017 su et al 2017 the aggregation rate constants k of the photoaged go irradiation for 187 h decreased at least one order of magnitude in the presence of 1 mg l humic acid suggesting that humic acid greatly improved its colloidal stability chowdhury et al 2015a as important components of nom proteins were observed to affect the go stability in a different way from humic substances because of the special physicochemical properties of proteins sun et al 2018 2020 there are hundreds of kinds of proteins in wastewater guo et al 2014 le et al 2016 many processing industries such as abattoir whey casein and fish produce protein rich wastewater in which the concentration of proteins is in the range of 1 20 mg l feng et al 2011 xia et al 2013 as an important component of nom and the major biomacromolecule in extracellular polymeric substances sheng et al 2016 protein is also found in natural aquatic environment xu et al 2016 bsa bovine serum albumin is commonly used as a model biomacromolecule due to its high structural stability low cost and high percentages of sequence identities with human serum albumin 76 kuchlyan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 previous studies reported that both bsa and ovalbumin affected go stability in a non linear relationship sun et al 2018 2020 the interactions between go and proteins were complicated by go lateral size protein properties and concentrations as well as water chemistry conditions sun et al 2018 2020 most of previous studies regarding colloidal stability of transformed go took humic substances as model nom jiang et al 2017 xia et al 2015 it is hypothesized that the impacts of proteins on photoaged go might be distinctly different from the pristine ones in spired by the abovementioned hypothesis the impacts of proteins on the colloidal stability of photoaged go were investigated systematically bsa was selected as a model and representative protein and go was irradiated with simulated solar light for different periods the properties of the photoaged go and bsa were comprehensively characterized the aggregation kinetics and stability of the photoaged go were obtained under different water chemistry conditions in the presence of bsa at different concentrations ohshima s soft particle theory was applied to calculate the thickness of the protein bsa layer adsorbed on the surface of the photoaged go these results would shed lights on the environmental fate of photoaged go in natural aquatic environment especially in protein rich wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents single layer go powders were supplied by nanjing xfnano materials technologies co ltd nanjing china lyophilized powder of bsa a2153 were purchased from sigma aldrich company usa nacl mgcl2 6h2o and cacl2 2h2o were got from sinopharm chemical reagent co tianjin china the solution ph was adjusted with naoh and hcl solutions at 0 001 1 mol l electrolyte solutions and bsa solutions were freshly prepared before use and stored in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube nest biotechnology china ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm hhitech china was used for all the experiments 2 2 preparation and characterization of photoaged go forty mg of go powder was put into the glass bottle with 400 ml ultrapure water and stirred at 300 rpm for one night to activate the go surface and break large particles sun et al 2018 then the suspension was ultrasonicated in ice bath for 4 h to get a uniform go stock solution sun et al 2018 the concentration of pristine go was set at 50 mg l and 40 ml of the go suspension was added into a 50 ml grinding mouth transparent quartz tube with 15 mm magneton 300 rpm min the quartz tube was set in a photochemical reaction apparatus xpa 7 xu jiang machine plant nanjing china with a cyclic water installation and irradiated 800 w xenon lamp for 0 3 6 12 and 24 h respectively the wavelength range of the xenon lamp provided by the manufacture is shown in figure s1 which was almost in the typical solar spectrum 290 nm zhao et al 2020 quartz tubes were covered with aluminum paper and set in the photochemical reaction apparatus for 24 h as the control the period of 24 h was chosen considering that the go finally settled in natural surface water within 24 h chowdhury et al 2013 gao et al 2017a all the photoaged experiments were conducted in triplicates the go photoaged for different periods 0 3 6 12 and 24 h were labelled as go 0 go 3 go 6 go 12 and go 24 respectively the ph of the go suspension before and after light irradiation was in the range of 4 3 4 5 for the colloidal stability experiments the ph of the suspension was set as 5 5 unless stated otherwise to obtain sufficient samples to characterize the physicochemical properties of the photoaged go the aging experiments were repeated for many times and the samples were pooled the photoaged go suspensions were directly freeze dried to get solid samples for the following characterization the morphologies and lateral sizes of the photoaged go were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol 2100f japan field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini 500 zeiss germany respectively the chemical compositions and functional groups of photoaged go were analyzed by the uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan raman spectra renishaw invia uk fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir bruker tensor 37 germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ulvac phi japan potentiometric acid base titration and contact angle respectively potentiometric acid base titration was performed to the photoaged go 50 mg l with a titration apparatus zdj 5b inesa china using 0 1 mol l naoh as a titrant szabo et al 2006 tombacz et al 2020 the actual consumption of total proton concentrations toth was calculated using the equation t o t h v m c i 0 c i e where v is the total solution volume m is the mass of go ci o and ci e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively the total organic matter toc of the go suspension was measured by high temperature oxidation multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany 2 3 stability of the photoaged go in the presence and absence of bsa the initial aggregation kinetics of go were conducted by time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls on zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk in the process of measuring d h and zeta potential of 2d plate shaped go nanosheets go was considered as spherical nanoparticles tombacz et al 2020 and dls might underestimate the real size of go jiang et al 2016 the detailed information of the method to determine and quantify the initial aggregation kinetics of go was described in previous studies kovalchuk and starov 2012 sun et al 2018 2020 and shown in supporting information the concentrations of the photoaged go for dls and zeta potential measurements were fixed at 4 6 mg c l which were higher than the environmental relevant concentrations ng l or μg l to ensure strong light intensities and then accurate measurement goodwin et al 2018 qi et al 2016 tombacz et al 2020 2 4 characterization of the interactions between photoaged go and bsa zeta potential of photoaged go as functions of bsa concentrations and electrolyte concentrations were measured on a malvern zetasizer batch experiments were conducted to reveal the adsorption capacity of bsa on photoaged go 0 and 24 h in 40 ml screw cap vials in the presence of 50 mm nacl at ph 5 5 the detailed procedure and bsa measurement method were described in our previous study sun et al 2018 the ohshima s soft particle theory has been widely used to reveal the interactions between biomacromolecules and nanoparticles li et al 2021 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 which are relevant to the biomacromolecules stabilization effect in stability of nanoparticles ohshima s soft particle theory was applied to calculate the thickness of bsa adsorbed on the photoaged go the detailed calculation formula and corresponding parameter are shown in supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the photoaged go to investigate the effects of sunlight irradiation on the physicochemical properties of go the surface morphology and lateral size of pristine go and photoaged go were inspected by hr tem and fesem respectively figure s2 and figure s3 all the go samples displayed nanosheet like structure broad lateral size distribution and go nanosheets were broken into smaller fragments with the extending irradiation time compared with the pristine go go 0 the surface of the photoaged go became coarse with some wrinkles the lateral size distribution of the photoaged go obtained from 100 go nanosheets in at least five fesem images is shown in figure s4 the result further confirmed that the d h of the photoaged gos decreased from 240 7 nm to 203 7 nm with the photoaging time fig 1 a which was consistent with the hr tem and fesem results the uv vis spectra of go before and after irradiation are shown in fig 1b and the absorbance of the photoaged go was in the range of 250 700 nm which might be attributed to the restoration of sp2 π conjugated network increased as a result of irradiation implying the formation of light absorbing components gao et al 2020 this is in agreement with the color change of the photoaged go which became much darker after photoaging figure s5 in addition the maximum absorption wavelength shifted toward blue region as the irradiation time increased which might be due to the decreased size of the π conjugated domains luo et al 2010 sun et al 2020 previous study also reported that go nanomaterials blue shifted with the decrease of the lateral size sun et al 2020 which supported the formation of smaller go nanosheets after exposure to light as shown in table s1 the toc content of the go decreased by 15 after 24 h of light exposure previous study demonstrated that prolonged irradiation time resulted in the degradation of go accompanied by the formation of low molecular weight substances and co2 hou et al 2015 the zeta potentials of the photoaged go were similar table s1 suggesting that light irradiation did not significantly change the surface zeta potential of go the surface chemical properties and hydrophobicity of the photoaged go were further characterized by raman ftir xps elemental analysis potentiometric acid base titration and contact angle respectively the ratio of id intensity of the d band 1335 cm 1 ig intensity of the g band 1596 cm 1 of raman spectra fig 1c is usually used to quantify and compare the structural defects in graphitic materials gao et al 2020 xia et al 2015 the id ig value of go continuously increased from 0 863 to 0 943 after 24 h of light exposure suggesting that more defect sites were produced on the graphitic sheets the increased id ig value of the photoaged go might be attributed to the formation of defects within the go structure and significant degree of fragmentation gao et al 2020 hou et al 2015 the ftir spectra in fig 1d suggested that there were many chemically reactive functional groups on the surface and defects sites of the photoaged go such as oh ch c o c c coh co and co c the ftir spectra of the photoaged go were similar without distinct differences however significant changes were observed in the xps spectra figure s6 the epoxy and hydroxyl groups decreased from 51 31 for go 0 to 30 69 for go 24 but the graphitic carbon contents including cc and c c groups increased from 36 05 to 53 26 while the relative contents of c o and o c o did not change much table s2 consequently the c o ratio increased from 1 77 for go 0 to 2 41 for go 24 which was consistent with the result of elemental analysis c o increased from 0 979 to 1 19 after 24 h of sunlight exposure table s3 the oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane were the major initiators of photodegradation of graphene nanomaterials gallegos pérez et al 2020 figure s7 shows that the surface charging curves of go 0 and go 24 as a function of solution ph the results confirmed that go 24 had less acidic sites and lower buffer capacity compared with go 0 at the same ph which was in line with the aforementioned characterization results the contact angle increased from 64 8 for go 0 to 80 7 for go 24 implying that the hydrophobicity of go increased after photoaging figure s8 3 2 effects of photoaging on the stability of go the aggregation rate constants k and corresponding aggregation profiles of the photoaged go in the presence of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 at a fixed concentration are shown in table s4 and figure s9 respectively the concentrations of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 were chosen as 50 mm 1 67 mm and 1 0 mm because the electrolytes at these concentrations did not induce fast aggregation of the photoaged go but allow to discern the differences in the stability of the studied go as shown in figure s9 go 0 aggregated slowly at 50 mm nacl 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 and the corresponding k values were 0 09 nm s 0 217 nm s and 0 612 nm s respectively divalent cations were more effective in inducing go 0 aggregation than na and ca2 displayed much greater ability in destabilizing go nanosheets than mg2 gao et al 2017a wu et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the stability of the photoaged go decreased with increasing irradiated time in the presence of nacl and mgcl2 with larger k values and d h table s4 the k value of the go 24 in the presence of nacl and mgcl2 increased by an order of magnitude to 1 098 nm s and 1 978 nm s relative to that of go 0 respectively while in the presence of cacl2 the k increased initially from 0 612 nm s for go 0 to 1 931 nm s for go 12 then remained constant as the irradiation time further increased to further reveal stability of the photoaged go taking go 0 go 6 and go 24 as example their aggregation kinetics as functions of na mg2 and ca2 concentrations were obtained at ph 5 5 fig 2 illustrates that the go colloidal attachment efficiencies α changed as functions of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 concentrations and the corresponding aggregation profiles are shown in figure s10 s12 much higher electrolyte concentration was required for α of the go 0 to reach 1 than go 6 and go 24 specially their ccc values were 125 4 mm 78 0 mm and 61 5 mm for nacl and 4 8 mm 2 9 mm and 2 2 mm for mgcl2 respectively the go 24 displayed better aqueous stability in nacl solution than many other nanoparticles such as hematite sheng et al 2016 titanate nanowires szabó et al 2015 single walled carbon nanotube swnts saleh et al 2010 mno2 huangfu et al 2019 and other inorganic 2d nanomaterials e g mos2 ws2 h bn and ti3c2tx mohona et al 2019 xie et al 2020 these distinct differences among the ccc values of the photoaged go indicated that their stability decreased with lower ccc and larger α as a consequence of photoaging in the presence of cacl2 however the cccca values decreased from 1 5 mm for go 0 to 1 2 mm for go 6 but maintained at 1 2 mm for go 24 according to the schulze hardy rule the ccc of dispersed nanoparticles in salt solutions is inversely proportional to the corresponding ion valence ccc 1 z6 z was cation valence the calculation results in table s5 indicated that the aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go followed the schulze hardy rule ca2 displayed much better ability in destabilizing go nanosheets than that of mg2 due to its larger ionic radius 0 99 å verse 0 65 å and stronger cation bridging crosslinking effect with oxygen containing groups i e hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of go sun et al 2018 yang et al 2016 since the go 0 was relatively unstable in cacl2 solution the impact of photoaging on the go nanomaterials was not distinct in the presence of ca2 which was consistent with previous results chowdhury et al 2015b xia et al 2015 figure s13 shows the variation of zeta potentials of the photoaged go as functions of nacl and cacl2 concentrations it was reported that smaller sized go materials were more stable in aquatic environments due to stronger electrical double layer repulsion ali et al 2020 sun et al 2020 szabo et al 2020 thus the slightly decreased lateral size should not explain the reduced colloidal stability of the photoaged go since the photoaged go had lower contents of oxygen containing groups and larger contact angles hydrophobic interaction among the particles increased which might trigger increased destabilization of the photoaged go 3 3 impacts of bsa on the colloidal stability of the photoaged go stability of protein itself is important in aggregation of go protein complex liu et al 2019 but it is hard to distinguish the go aggregation protein coagulation or go protein complex aggregation the uv vis spectrum and fluorescence spectrum of bsa did not change much as a function of the electrolyte concentrations indicating bsa was very stable at the experimental conditions of this study figure s14 and figure s15 the bsa at 300 mg l exhibited very good long term stability 72 h after incubation with electrolytes nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 even at high concentrations figure s16 which was in line with the result of our previous study sun et al 2018 this suggested that salting out effect of bsa in the electrolyte solutions at experimental concentrations was negligible in pure water bsa at 0 60 mg l did not affect the d h of the photoaged go distinctly figure s17 and no aggregate was observed in the suspension even the photoaged go nanomaterials were incubated with bsa for 72 h figure s18 all these indicated that bsa itself was very stable and it alone did not induce aggregation of the photoaged go through unfolded unfolded protein interaction dominguez medina et al 2016 to quantify the effect of bsa on aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go go 0 go 6 and go 24 were taken as an example the effect of bsa at 0 5 mg l on the aggregation rate constants and corresponding aggregation profiles of the photoaged go in the presence of 50 mm nacl 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 are shown in figure s19 s20 bsa significantly inhibited the stability of the photoaged go in the presence of 50 mm nacl with higher k values than those without bsa in the electrolytes of mgcl2 and cacl2 the inhibition effect of bsa was weaker particularly for the longer time photoaged go such as go 24 as discussed above go 24 was less stable especially in the presence of 1 67 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 thus the inhibition impact induced by bsa was not distinct although it did destabilize go 24 to further reveal how bsa affected the go stability variations of α and aggregation profiles of the go as a function of nacl concentrations in the presence of bsa at 0 5 mg l are shown in fig 3 and figure s21 respectively bsa significantly inhibited the go 0 stability with its ccc decreasing from 125 5 mm to 94 1 mm nacl bsa displayed an inhibition effect on go 6 and go 24 stability at relatively low concentrations of nacl as nacl concentration increased the inhibition effect was marginal the ccc of go 6 slightly decreased from 78 0 mm to 72 2 mm nacl while that of go 24 was constant 62 0 mm nacl table s6 to unveil the inherent interactions between bsa and the photoaged go relatively higher concentration of bsa was used aggregation kinetics of the photoaged go nanomaterials in the presence of salts 50 mm nacl 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 respectively were conducted fig 4 and figure s22 show the aggregation rate constant and aggregation profiles of the photoaged go go 0 go 6 and go 24 in the presence of 50 mm nacl as a function of bsa concentrations in the presence of 50 mm nacl the stability of the go all displayed a non linear relationship with the bsa concentrations the k increased to k fast regime i and then maintained at k fast over a range of bsa concentration regime ⅱ and decreased until to zero with further increase of bsa concentration regime ⅲ go 24 quickly formed large aggregates in the presence of 5 mg l bsa and 50 mm nacl figure s23a confirming that bsa at relatively low concentration did depress the colloidal stability of go 24 in electrolyte solutions in regime i and iii at the same bsa concentration the more extensively photoaged go had higher k values table s7 to compare the impacts of bsa on stability of the photoaged go an impact factor i was calculated to indicate the change of k as a function of bsa concentration δk δc in regime i bsa concentration 0 05 5 mg l the impact factor i was 0 856 0 802 and 0 357 for go 0 go 6 and go 24 respectively this suggested that the impact of bsa on the colloidal stability of the go decreased as the photoaging duration increased the absolute zeta potential values of the photoaged go in the presence of bsa 5 mg l as a function of nacl concentration were all lower than those without bsa which might be due to adsorption of bsa on the surface of go sun et al 2018 fig 5 the positively charged regimes lysine and arginine amide groups of bsa could bind with the negatively charged surface of go through electrostatic interactions sun et al 2018 the absolute zeta potentials of both go 0 and go 24 decreased with increasing bsa concentration and that of go 0 was higher than go 24 which was attributed to the more hydroxyl and epoxy groups of go 0 than go 24 figure s24 thus much more bsa molecules were needed to reduce the electrostatic repulsion among go 0 particles and drive k to k fast which was supportive of the observed large i factor for go 0 in regime i in the regime ⅲ the strong steric repulsion due to the adsorption of a large amount of bsa molecules on the go surface could boost their colloidal stability sun et al 2018 the tem images figure s23b revealed that go 24 was well dispersed in the presence of 60 mg l bsa and 50 mm nacl in this regime the i values were 0 210 0 210 and 0 075 for go 0 go 6 and go 24 respectively further certified that bsa displayed less impacts on the colloidal stability of the photoaged gos due to the reduced adsorption of bsa the adsorption results in figure s25 revealed that adsorption capacity of bsa on go 0 surface was slightly higher than that of go 24 which magnified the stronger interaction between bsa and go 0 a recent report indicated that enhanced degree of reduction could inhibit the serum protein fetal bovine serum adsorption on chemically reduced go to some extent wei et al 2015 although the hydrophobicity interaction between bsa and go 24 was greater than that of go 0 the decreased adsorption capacity of go 24 implied that surface hydrophobicity was not the predominant factor affecting go protein binding capacities in regime ⅲ go 24 was more inclined to form larger aggregates than go 6 and go 0 due to its stronger hydrophobicity the adsorbed layer thickness d of bsa on the photoaged go calculated by ohshima s soft particle theory decreased from 3 43 to 2 01 after 24 h photoaging table s8 which also supported the weaker interaction between the photoaged go and bsa similarly in the presence of 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 0 mm cacl2 the k values of go 0 and go 24 followed similar variation trends as in the presence of 50 mm nacl see figure s26 and figure s27 the absolute zeta potential of both go 0 and go 24 decreased with the increase of bsa concentration figure s28 with the absolute zeta potential of go 0 higher than that of go 24 thus much more bsa molecules were needed to drive k of go 0 to k fast than that of go 24 in regime i the i values of go 24 were lower than those of go 0 in both mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions revealing that bsa displayed less impacts on colloidal stability of the photoaged go in regime i however in regime ⅲ at the same bsa concentration go 24 had lower k values which were different from the result in the presence of 50 mm nacl the absolute zeta potential of go 0 was lower than that of go 24 while the i values of go 24 were higher than those of go 0 as discussed above steric repulsion contributed by bsa molecules stabilized go with increasing bsa concentration compared with go 24 go 0 had more oxygen containing groups the cation bridging effect between divalent cations and go 0 might be stronger than that of go 24 the difference between go 0 and go 24 was larger in the presence of cacl2 than that of mgcl2 which could be due to the stronger cation bridging effect by ca2 all these indicated that photoaged go stability not only relied on its inherent physicochemical properties but also the salt types and protein concentration 3 4 aggregation kinetics of photoaged go in natural river water and synthetic wastewater aggregation kinetics of go 0 go 6 and go 24 in the presence of bsa at different concentrations were explored in natural river water and synthetic wastewater and the results are presented in figure s29 and figure s30 the physicochemical properties of the river water and detailed constitutes of the synthetic wastewater are listed in table s9 without bsa or with bsa at 5 mg l all the go materials rapidly formed large aggregates about 2 μm in both types of water however they were all stable in the river water and synthetic wastewater containing high concentration of bsa 60 mg l these results confirmed that proteins played a key role in the colloidal stability of photoaged go materials in natural water environments 4 conclusions once released to the wastewater or natural water systems go is going to experience photoaging due to exposure to uv or and sunlight irradiation collective results of this study indicated that sunlight irradiation significantly reduced the oxygen containing groups and enhanced the hydrophobicity of the go these changes not only led to the reduced stability of photoaged go but also depressed adsorption of bsa on the surface of photoaged go consequently the impacts of bsa on the photoaged go were lower than the pristine one these results implied that the released go might become unstable due to light irradiation leading to the more accumulation of the photoaged go in sediments particularly in protein rich environment environmental fate and ecological effect of go are relevant to its colloidal stability so the toxicities of photoaged go materials with different irradiated time might be different in protein rich aquatic environment which should be further conducted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

16907,organic pollutants that are introduced into the aquatic ecosystem can transform by various mechanisms biotransformation is an important process for predicting the remaining structures of pollutants in the ecosystem and their toxicity this study focused on triphenyl phosphate tphp which is a commonly used organophosphate flame retardant and plasticizer since tphp is particularly toxic to aquatic organisms it is essential to understand its biotransformation in the aquatic environment in the aquatic ecosystem based on consideration of the producer consumer decomposer relationship the biotransformation products of tphp were identified and their toxicity was predicted liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry was used for target suspect and non target analysis the obtained biotransformation products were estimated for toxicity based on the prediction model as a result 29 kinds of tphp biotransformation products were identified in the aquatic ecosystem diphenyl phosphate was detected as a common biotransformation product through a hydrolysis reaction in addition products were identified by the biotransformation mechanisms of green algae daphnid fish and microorganism most of the biotransformation products were observed to be less toxic than the parent compound due to detoxification except some products hydroquinone beta lyase products palmitoyl stearyl conjugated products since various species exist in a close relationship with each other in an ecosystem an integrated approach for not only single species but also various connected species is essential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword biotransformation triphenyl phosphate aquatic ecosystem target suspect non target analysis toxicity prediction 1 introduction flame retardants are additives used in products by the manufacturing industry to inhibit combustion brominated flame retardants bfrs have been widely applied in manufacturing since the 1960s as they are flame retardant in small amounts birnbaum and staskal 2004 however bfrs have negative effects in the environment they are persistent chemicals in water and are subject to bioaccumulation kemmlein et al 2009 alternative flame retardants including organophosphate esters opes have been produced to address this issue and made up 14 of total flame retardant production in 2004 brandsma et al 2013 among the opes triphenyl phosphate tphp is specified by the epa as an alternative substance for which the total national production was 1 10 million pounds in 2015 epa 2019 in addition tphp is widely used when manufacturing electronic products to the extent that it was investigated 2 3 times more than other opes in smartphones zhang et al 2019 tphp has been detected in various surface water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps 11 and 165 ng l from the river tiber in italy bacaloni et al 2007 76 290 ng l in the influent and up to 130 ng l in the effluent of swedish wwtps marklund et al 2005 and an average concentration of 130 ng l in the influent and 70 ng l in the effluent of german wwtps meyer and bester 2004 since tphp is mixed into the product without chemical bonding it can easily flow into the water system li et al 2014 therefore research on the effects of tphp on the aquatic ecosystem is urgently needed the concentration of tphp in organisms has been observed to be an average of 17 1 ng g lipid in fish from the great lakes and 76 ng g lipid 21 180 ng g lipid in fish from the swedish lakes guo et al 2017 sundkvist et al 2010 a previous study introduced that tphp is more toxic than other halogen free flame retardants waaijers et al 2013a tphp is particularly toxic to the aquatic ecosystem microalgae exposed to tphp show inhibited cell growth and various altered metabolites not only membrane integrity but also ros reactive oxygen species can be reduced wang et al 2019 chronic exposure to tphp in water fleas has been shown to cause growth inhibition decreased reproduction and genetic modification yuan et al 2018 the toxicity of tphp inhibited the expression of zebrafish heart morphogenetic nuclear receptors isales et al 2015 tphp which exists in the aquatic environment and has a toxic effect on organisms can be transformed in the body biotransformation mechanisms include phase i of oxidation reduction hydrolysis and the phase ii reaction which is an enzymatic reaction lopardo et al 2018 when organic pollutants are introduced into an organism the phase i reaction occurs generally and phase ii appears in different patterns depending on the chemicals or species the substances generated at this time are called biotransformation products btps in general the enzyme that induces oxidation in phase i is cytochrome p450 monooxygenase cyp cyp transforms hydrophobic organic pollutants into water soluble compounds for detoxification and excretion from the body schlenk et al 2008 cyp was present in living organisms even before oxygen in the atmosphere existed and now almost all organisms have it through evolution lamb et al 2009 however enzyme reactions like sulfation and glucuronide conjugation have been identified as occurring specifically in each species peng et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to study the biotransformation of opes in various aqueous species research has progressed to often evaluating the effect of tphp on a single aquatic species but comparative studies of biotransformation between species by food chain remain insufficient organisms increase the size by ingesting sub trophic species in the aquatic ecosystem and these processes could affect final predators steele 2001 hydrophobic chemicals with high kow values bioaccumulate in the lipid tissues of an organism and move along the food chain kim et al 2011 the log kow of tphp is 4 6 sids 2002 so it is possible for it to move from a lower species to an upper species in the food chain metabolism is associated with similar biotransformation pathways in different species this is because maintaining the early evolved biotransformation pathways is the optimal result from an evolutionary biology point of view ebenhöh and heinrich 2001 on the other hand organisms have specific biotransformation mechanisms the metabolite profile of a particular species results from species specific combinations of functional properties gargallo garriga et al 2020 exposure to tphp by aquatic species could lead to organism specific reactions as well as general biotransformations therefore an integrated approach centered on the producer consumer decomposer relationship is needed in this study microalgae producer invertebrates primary consumer and fish secondary consumer were used to confirm the biotransformation of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem water from a wwtp was also obtained to identify the degradation products from microorganisms btps analysis improved the accuracy precision and reliability using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms the purpose of this study was to identify the btps of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem considering the producer consumer decomposer relationship and to compare biotransformation mechanisms according to species the prediction of toxic effects when organic pollutants are introduced into the aquatic environment is the ultimate goal of this research the btps of tphp not only lack screening data but we also have an insufficient understanding of their toxicity therefore this study estimated the effect of tphp in the aquatic environment by predicting the toxicity of btps in aquatic species 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents for analysis of organisms triphenyl phosphate tphp 99 diphenyl phosphate dphp 99 and triphenyl phosphate d15 as

screening target screening could be confirmed using existing reference standards without the standards btps are verified by the suspect or non target screening method suspect screening is a prediction of the structures for suspected btps through the mechanism of the organisms non target screening is an analytical method applied to unexpected products schymanski et al 2015 orbitrap was analyzed using data dependent ms ms fragmentation for the five most intensive ions for the parent and its btp mass list in the full scan the database of the mass list was constructed by target and suspect screening for target screening the purchased standards were used or the mass spectral database m zcloud highchem llc slovakia was cited https www mzcloud org specifically the mass spectrum of btps

flame retardant in the aquatic ecosystem in a producer r subcapitata consumer d magna o latipes and decomposer microorganism table 1 shows the btps of representative aquatic species exposed to tphp two ion modes of analysis positive and negative modes were used for the analysis of btps compared to the control group only chemicals with an intensity of 104 or more were selected for the btps identified in the experimental group we also checked whether all of them were present in triplicate samples biotransformation studies specify confidence levels to ensure the reliability of the predicted structure level 1 indicates accurately identified btps due to the presence of reference standards level 2 suggests they could be cited from the literature or their structure explained following biotransformation reactions level 3 is classified when isotope patterns and fragment information can be defined a prediction program lacking information to explain the precise structure is confidence level 4 schymanski et al 2014 through target suspect and non target screening analytical approaches a total of 29 btps were identified from the aquatic ecosystem the structures and pathways of btps produced from the parent compound tphp in each aquatic species microalgae daphnids fish and microorganisms were represented in fig 1 six species from microalgae nine species from daphnids 18 species from fish and six species from microorganisms were identified in hrms ms fig 2 shows the major btps of tphp in aquatic species dphp tp 250 was commonly detected among the products and given confidence level 1 fig 2a in this study tp implies an abbreviation for the biotransformation product of tphp the number of tp indicates a neutral mass value tp 250 was the same compound as diphenyl phosphate and was assigned to level 1 because of a reference standard tp 250 a hydrolysis product of tphp is less cytotoxicity than the parent compound but affects transcriptional expressions of more genes according to previous studies lipid regulated genes in cells exposed to tp 250 dphp are downregulated therefore tp 250 might affect gene expression in the body su et al 2014 algae algae r subcapitata the lowest level of the aquatic food chain was used to analyze the biotransformation processes of btps in the study after considering the suitability of the biotransformation and the possibility of the structure two btps were identified in the positive mode and four in the negative mode of hrms btps of r subcapitata exposed to tphp were not confirmed by suspected screening for btps without chemical information a non target screening could be employed meng et al 2020 developed a functional group dependent screening method through a chemical database fragment ion pattern and nmr analysis to discover new opes in indoor dust samples in this study the mass fragment was interpreted by applying prediction software compounddiscoverer for non target screening tp 594 was identified in r subcapitata fig 2b it was formed by hydroxylation palmitoyl conjugation and desaturation from tphp palmitic acid c16h30o2 in microalgae produces btps through conjugation bonds with hydroxylated tphp the conjugation structure of palmitic acid was predicted as palmitoleate by a reference nih 2020 m z 277 21698 confirmed that palmitoleate in the form of a saturated fatty acid was combined with the phenyl group of tphp the information of other mass fragments especially m z 223 00113 also proved that tp 594 was generated by palmitoyl conjugation of tphp invertebrate tp 422 was a specific product identified in invertebrates d magna among btps level 1 2 and 3 the substances produced by sulfate conjugation in the daphnid body were tp 422 and tp 438 fig 2 c shows the information of mass fragments analyzed by orbitrap for tp 422 based on the precursor ion c18h14o8ps m z 421 01514 sulfo groups so3 and hso4 were identified it is expected that sulfate conjugation occurred after hydroxylation because hydroxylated tphp was detected at m z 341 05838 since sulfate conjugated tphp was commonly found in fish tp 422 tp 438 tp 452 tp 454 sulfate conjugation can be considered an important mechanism for consumer level species in the aquatic ecosystem sulfate conjugation plays an essential role in regulating and eliminating the biological activity of various chemicals or xenobiotics kauffman 2004 sulfotransferase as an enzyme which catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of xenobiotics in the body shows particularly high activity in the phenol group martin skilton et al 2006 fish in fish o latipes 18 kinds of biotransformation products of tphp were detected in positive nine btps and negative mode nine btps fig 2 d shows the ms ms fragment patterns for tp 518 as the major product tp 518 was generated by glucuronide conjugation same as glucuronidation from hydroxylated tphp the btps of fish produced through glucuronide conjugation were tp 518 tp 534 tp 536 tp 548 and tp 578 in the ms ms fragment of tp 518 c5h5o3 m z 113 02331 and c5h7o4 m z 131 03401 were expected to be derived from glucuronic acid c6h10o7 as the same structure as tp 342 was observed at m z 343 07266 glucuronic acid was bonded to hydroxylated tphp to form tp 518 tp 518 was o glucuronide conjugated from the hydroxyl group previous studies reported the detection of glucuronide tphp and glucuronide hydroxyl tphp by exposing zebrafish to tphp su et al 2015 su et al 2016b wang et al 2016 this study confirmed two btps tp 518 and tp 534 in o latipes which were the same as the reference tp 372 was a product formed by methylation from hydroxylated tphp figure s1 e in ms ms fragments m z 123 0440 and 279 0412 were predicted to indicate a methoxy group r o ch3 attached to the phenyl group methylation is one of the essential phase ii mechanisms in biotransformation and is slightly different from other phase ii reactions generally products from phase ii reactions are water soluble but methylation products have low solubility in water because methylation products are more hydrophobic than their parent compounds methylated btps are not excreted differently from other btps august et al 1994 tp 372 was generated by o methylation in which the methyl group was bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl functional group many of the methylations identified in the study were from o methylations of hydroxyl groups tp 402 tp 452 tp 548 s adenosylmethionine reacts as a cofactor for methylation in organisms parkinson 2001 and the main enzyme for synthesizing o methylation is catechol o methyltransferase testa 2007 van den dungen et al 2017 researched gene transcription from persistent organic pollutant exposure in adipocytes pollutants have been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation and gene expression and interfere with dna methylation these results suggest that the methylated btps tp 372 as well as others identified in this study might be a potential product of disruption of gene expression microorganisms water collected from a wwtp was analyzed to identify the btps of tphp related to microorganisms btps were detected only in samples from the effluent and biological reactors which were compared with the sample of influent this study considered that the btps of tphp generated by microorganisms remained in the water the btps in the wastewater could eventually flow into the river thus the data could contribute to identifying the btps of tphp in the aquatic environment for the study of microorganisms the existence of btps analyzed mainly in microbial degradation products and aquatic species microalgae daphnids and fish was investigated as a result a total of six btps were identified three types were detected each in positive and negative mode table 1 among them the btps common in aquatic organisms were tp 250 and tp 342 suspect screening using the eawag bbd database in the present study revealed four types of btps tp 110 tp 138 tp 140 tp 188 as decomposition products of tphp the mass fragment information of the significant btp tp 110 is shown in fig 2 e tp 110 was catechol or hydroquinone which appeared to have been produced by microbial degradation of tphp significant results were obtained by comparing the analysis data with catechol information of m zcloud https www mzcloud org highchem 2020b as a result tp 110 was ranked as confidence level 1 tp 138 was a decomposition product of tphp 4 hydroxybenzoic acid figure s2a since the m zcloud database was compared with the ms ms fragments it was described as level 1 due to the presence of a reference standard highchem 2020a 3 3 comparison of biotransformation products by aquatic organisms in the study representative species of the food chain were selected to investigate the effects of opes on the aquatic ecosystem the concentration in the body was calculated by exposing the organisms to tphp for the same time period 24 h the organisms were the producer r subcapitata the primary consumer d magna and the secondary consumer o latipes the data were not the result of the state of equilibrium concentration so we used the expected bioconcentration factor bcf the predicted bcf values were as follows microalgae 57 l kg daphnid 86 l kg and fish 89 l kg in previous studies the bcf of o latipes was 144 l kg lemma minor was 43 l kg and typha sp was 1 l kg sids 2002 bcf generally increases at higher nutritional levels due to the increase in the lipid ratio hemond and fechner 2014 in the case of r subcapitata the bcf value was lower than that of other animal species and similar to the bcf lemma minor 43 l kg of plants o latipes showed similar bcf values to d magna and these were lower than the reference it was judged that the exposure time 24 h was inadequate until the body concentration reached equilibrium btps were compared between the biological community based on the producer consumer degrader relationship to predict the biotransformation reaction when tphp was introduced in the aquatic system fig 3 the contribution ratio was calculated in consideration of the biotransformation steps formed products and intensity of btps biotransformation mechanisms showing low rates of 1 or less were expressed with etc the biotransformations commonly seen in living organisms are hydrolysis and hydroxylation which are representative mechanisms of phase i among the biotransformation of tphp hydrolysis is mainly used to generate tp 250 dphp in this study hydrolysis contributed to form this product at the following rates 12 in microalgae 2 in daphnids 34 in fish and 59 in microorganisms fig 3 the hydrolysis reaction tends to be the general biotransformation that occurs in organisms upon the introduction of chemicals into the water hydrolysis is the basic process that describes the biotransformation and transport of nutrients as well as organic pollutants in the environment especially biological systems boethling and mackay 2000 each of the aquatic species used in this study has hydrolytic enzymes in microalgae viscozyme l and celluclast act as hydrolases hammed et al 2013 carboxylic ester hydrolase and alpha beta hydrolase which are responsible for hydrolysis were identified in d magna uniprot 2019 the major hydrolases of mammals are carboxylesterase cholinesterase and paraoxonase enzymes also found in o latipes klaassen and amdur 2013 previous studies have shown that some of the opes in water undergo abiotic hydrolysis to generate degradation products su et al 2016a dphp induced toxicity in developing zebrafish embryos leads to heart defects it also causes embryonic mitochondrial dysfunction hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity mitchell et al 2019 the microbial reaction identified in this study focused on the decomposition and biotransformation of tphp in a wwtp among the aquatic organisms hydrolysis accounted for the most significant proportion of microorganisms in addition to tp 250 hydrolysis products were generated in microorganisms by decomposition from the parent compounds to low molecular weight states the enzyme mainly used to degrade tphp in microorganisms is arldiakylphosphatase kegg 2019a hydroxylation identified in all organisms was a reaction that contributed to the formation of several btps hydroxylation rates of 20 in microalgae 26 in daphnids 45 in fish and 24 in microorganisms were observed fig 3 the hydroxylation in this study mainly reacted with the phenyl functional group of tphp to form oh groups the resulting hydroxylated tphp was transformed into new btps through various phase ii reactions a previous study showed that hydroxylated tphp promotes the transcription of nuclear receptors leading to gene modification kojima et al 2016 therefore it was predicted that cyp would also be present in the experimental species r subcapitata d magna o latipes and microorganisms choi et al 2020 kelly and kelly 2013 schlenk et al 2008 suzuki et al 2018 because cyp plays a role in converting benzene to phenol parkinson 2001 it seems that cyp in living organisms adds hydroxyl groups to the benzene of the organic pollutant tphp microalgae positioned in the producer level of the aquatic ecosystem exhibited different types of biotransformation reactions than other species desaturation 16 palmitoyl conjugation 11 and stearyl conjugation 5 were identified fig 3a desaturation is closely linked to the reactions of fatty acids in the body in microalgae various desaturase enzymes are targeted to different genes to increase lipid production vingiani et al 2019 it is estimated that the desaturase of the experimental species r subcapitata in this study contributed to the biotransformation of palmitic acid and stearic acid the major fatty acids constituting r subcapitata were confirmed as palmitic acid stearic acid and oleic acid pugliese et al 2020 these fatty acids reacted with the tphp penetrating the microalgae to generate new types of btps the biotransformation ratios of d magna and o latipes the consumers of the aquatic ecosystem are shown in fig 3 b and c some general biotransformation reactions sulfate glutathione cysteine conjugation were observed in daphnids and fish the representative animals of the aquatic environment when organic pollutants enter the body glutathione gsh and cysteine conjugated enzymes work together in pairs gsh and cysteine conjugation is an essential reaction in the xenobiotic detoxification pathway cysteine which is a precursor of gsh is involved in gsh synthesis and regulation gsh and cysteine contribute to antioxidant activity inhibition of cell damage and neuroprotection jeon et al 2013 sulfate conjugation is a phase ii biotransformation mechanism in aquatic system consumers since most of the sulfate ions on earth exist in water it is believed that sulfate ions contributed to the evolution of aquatic species ikenaka et al 2006 the biotransformation reaction characteristically observed in o latipes is glucuronide conjugation this reaction has been found in fish exposed to organic pollutants in a previous study wang et al 2016 uridine glucuronosyltransferases present in tissue vesicles are catalysts for glucuronide conjugation this conjugation reacts electron rich nucleophiles o n s klaassen and amdur 2013 glucuronide conjugation occurred in the oh functional group after tphp hydroxylation in the organism although glucuronidation generally detoxifies xenobiotics it might have toxic effects in some instances exposure to a phenolic drug in rats caused high cholestasis by glucuronide compounds and finally blocked the bile ducts krijgsheld et al 1982 mulder 1990 in order to confirm the biotransformation of tphp by microorganisms in the wwtp water samples were collected to analyze btps as a result it was confirmed that the decomposition process and biotransformation occurred by various microorganisms in the biological reaction tank microbial mechanisms showed a simpler pattern compared to the biotransformation of other aquatic organisms fig 3d the microbial community in wastewater includes a variety of taxonomic biochemical and physiological groups of organisms many microorganisms provide the functional benefits of improving water quality and removing nutrients numberger et al 2019 the characteristic biotransformation mechanism in microorganisms is carboxylation which was involved in producing tp 138 tp 140 and tp 188 the reaction occurred by 4 hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase when the carboxyl group was bound to phenols derived from tphp kegg 2019b this enzyme is known to be involved in the biotransformation of microorganisms in various environments ncbi 2020 carboxylation catalyzes the fixation of co2 on organic molecules and affects the carbon cycle on earth it is also a critical reaction that contributes to several biological functions erb 2011 3 4 ecotoxicological information of biotransformation products in the aquatic ecosystem organophosphorus compounds form metabolites through biological biotransformation and their toxicity is altered jokanović 2001 the ecosar model was applied to predict the toxicity of identified btps in each species using a high resolution mass spectrometer lc50 and chv prediction values were obtained from the chemical structures of the btps of tphp in the ecosar model the chronic toxicity value is calculated as the geometric mean value of noec and loec de roode et al 2006 confirmed that the toxicity of more than 70 of the substances in the database was accurate or overestimated by ecosar in addition the lc50 correlation between the experimental value and predicted value through the ecosar model showed more appropriate results for toxic chemicals than nontoxic chemicals in previous studies the ecosar program was used to predict the toxicity of degradation products and btps of various polar chemicals kang et al 2020 kim et al 2018 the experimental lc50 of the parent compound tphp was found to be 2 0 1 3 and 1 2 mg l in algae invertebrates and fish respectively brooke et al 2009 mayer et al 1981 who 1991 the ecosar model predicted values were calculated as 1 5 0 7 and 1 1 mg l since the lc50 as well as noec experimental and predicted values were similar the ecosar model was considered suitable for predicting btp toxicity values of tphp based on the value of the parent compound the fold change in the toxicity value was converted into a log and expressed as a box plot for each chemical substance fig 4 most of the toxicity values of btps predicted by ecosar were decreased compared to the parent compound log10 fold change 0 in particular the toxicity of btps produced by the phase ii enzyme reaction of aquatic organisms seemed to decrease dramatically tp 422 438 445 452 454 463 518 534 536 548 578 617 628 and 669 the lc50 of these btps was predicted to be more than 100 and the chv to be more than 10 table s3 detoxification refers to a biological transformation that eliminates toxicants or prevents their production in the body detoxification competes with toxification and varies depending on the nature of the chemical klaassen and amdur 2013 the detoxification of organophosphorus compounds is achieved by cleavage of the phosphorus bonds or conjugation in vivo metabolites produced by these reactions are rapidly removed into the urine jokanović 2001 it is estimated that detoxification mechanisms reduced the toxicity of most btps generated after exposure to the organic pollutant tphp by aquatic organisms on the other hand btps with increased log lc50 and chv predicted values compared to the parent compound tphp included tp 110 358b 594 and 600 fig 4 tp 110 was detected in microorganisms tp 358b in invertebrates and fish and tp 596 600 in green algae tp 110 is hydroquinone produced from tphp through microbial hydrolysis and is a major benzene metabolite the lc50 of hydroquinone in aquatic organisms according to this experiment was found to be 0 1 0 6 mg l and the noec was found to be 0 1 5 mg l echa 2020a phenol compounds in ppm concentrations are highly toxic to aquatic organisms and most of them cause changes in organisms at the ppb levels guerra 2001 hydroquinone is a substance that has carcinogenic effects as well as causing blood toxicity enguita and leitão 2013 long term exposure to hydroquinone by aquatic organisms could cause severe toxicity and it therefore requires continuous observation echa 2020b tp 358b is a tp in which thiol group is generated from the cysteine conjugated compound and has been identified in invertebrates and fish this product was predicted to have higher toxicity than tphp in algae daphnids and fish thiol induces the formation of free radicals in organisms causing chemical toxicity in particular apoptosis occurs due to the biotransformation of red blood cells through oxidative damage to the cell membrane munday 1989 the thiol functional group in tp 358b produced from the biotransformation process of tphp is also changed into free radicals and may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms tp 594 and tp 600 were generated from tphp by palmitoyl stearyl conjugation hydroxylation and desaturation the main functional groups were transformed palmitic acid and stearic acid respectively the toxicity was higher than the parent compound according to the prediction of the ecosar model especially in green algae the toxicity values of tp 594 and tp 600 were predicted as follows 0 7 3 6 and 0 4 3 3 lc50 0 6 3 4 and 0 3 3 1 chv by negative log scale table s3 fatty acids are a major component of cell membranes and are involved in cell signaling de carvalho and caramujo 2018 however they may cause a cytotoxic reaction if they accumulate in large amounts resulting in hepatic disorders cardiac disorders and diabetes park et al 2014 palmitic acid identified in tp 594 induces apoptosis and stress of the endoplasmic reticulum in hepatoma cells zhang et al 2012 stearic acid present in tp 600 could cause cardiac toxicity by affecting heart cell death and lipid accumulation in the body rabkin and lodha 2009 4 conclusion this study predicted biotransformation of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem using a producer r subcapitata a primary consumer d magna a secondary consumer o latipes and a decomposer microorganisms as a result 29 kinds of btps were identified and generated by specific mechanisms in each organism except for hydroxylation and hydrolysis in common to all species the form of decreasing toxicity showed a pattern of decreasing regardless of species and the same was true when toxicity was increased most of the detected btps were less toxic than the parent compound tphp but some were predicted to be highly toxic tp 594 tp 600 therefore continuous observation of btps as well as tphp itself should be conducted to protect the aquatic environment since various species exist in a close relationship with each other in an ecosystem an integrated approach for not only single species but also various connected species is essential the integrated perspective of btps conducted in this study revealed how organic pollutants transform and accumulate in the aquatic ecosystem furthermore the total toxicity effect on the aquatic ecosystem could be estimated through the toxicity values of btps as well as the parent compound the representative significance of this study lies in the fact that when btps of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment are detected the path of origin organisms such as algae invertebrate fish and so forth or wwtp could be predicted based on the results of this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16907,organic pollutants that are introduced into the aquatic ecosystem can transform by various mechanisms biotransformation is an important process for predicting the remaining structures of pollutants in the ecosystem and their toxicity this study focused on triphenyl phosphate tphp which is a commonly used organophosphate flame retardant and plasticizer since tphp is particularly toxic to aquatic organisms it is essential to understand its biotransformation in the aquatic environment in the aquatic ecosystem based on consideration of the producer consumer decomposer relationship the biotransformation products of tphp were identified and their toxicity was predicted liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry was used for target suspect and non target analysis the obtained biotransformation products were estimated for toxicity based on the prediction model as a result 29 kinds of tphp biotransformation products were identified in the aquatic ecosystem diphenyl phosphate was detected as a common biotransformation product through a hydrolysis reaction in addition products were identified by the biotransformation mechanisms of green algae daphnid fish and microorganism most of the biotransformation products were observed to be less toxic than the parent compound due to detoxification except some products hydroquinone beta lyase products palmitoyl stearyl conjugated products since various species exist in a close relationship with each other in an ecosystem an integrated approach for not only single species but also various connected species is essential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword biotransformation triphenyl phosphate aquatic ecosystem target suspect non target analysis toxicity prediction 1 introduction flame retardants are additives used in products by the manufacturing industry to inhibit combustion brominated flame retardants bfrs have been widely applied in manufacturing since the 1960s as they are flame retardant in small amounts birnbaum and staskal 2004 however bfrs have negative effects in the environment they are persistent chemicals in water and are subject to bioaccumulation kemmlein et al 2009 alternative flame retardants including organophosphate esters opes have been produced to address this issue and made up 14 of total flame retardant production in 2004 brandsma et al 2013 among the opes triphenyl phosphate tphp is specified by the epa as an alternative substance for which the total national production was 1 10 million pounds in 2015 epa 2019 in addition tphp is widely used when manufacturing electronic products to the extent that it was investigated 2 3 times more than other opes in smartphones zhang et al 2019 tphp has been detected in various surface water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps 11 and 165 ng l from the river tiber in italy bacaloni et al 2007 76 290 ng l in the influent and up to 130 ng l in the effluent of swedish wwtps marklund et al 2005 and an average concentration of 130 ng l in the influent and 70 ng l in the effluent of german wwtps meyer and bester 2004 since tphp is mixed into the product without chemical bonding it can easily flow into the water system li et al 2014 therefore research on the effects of tphp on the aquatic ecosystem is urgently needed the concentration of tphp in organisms has been observed to be an average of 17 1 ng g lipid in fish from the great lakes and 76 ng g lipid 21 180 ng g lipid in fish from the swedish lakes guo et al 2017 sundkvist et al 2010 a previous study introduced that tphp is more toxic than other halogen free flame retardants waaijers et al 2013a tphp is particularly toxic to the aquatic ecosystem microalgae exposed to tphp show inhibited cell growth and various altered metabolites not only membrane integrity but also ros reactive oxygen species can be reduced wang et al 2019 chronic exposure to tphp in water fleas has been shown to cause growth inhibition decreased reproduction and genetic modification yuan et al 2018 the toxicity of tphp inhibited the expression of zebrafish heart morphogenetic nuclear receptors isales et al 2015 tphp which exists in the aquatic environment and has a toxic effect on organisms can be transformed in the body biotransformation mechanisms include phase i of oxidation reduction hydrolysis and the phase ii reaction which is an enzymatic reaction lopardo et al 2018 when organic pollutants are introduced into an organism the phase i reaction occurs generally and phase ii appears in different patterns depending on the chemicals or species the substances generated at this time are called biotransformation products btps in general the enzyme that induces oxidation in phase i is cytochrome p450 monooxygenase cyp cyp transforms hydrophobic organic pollutants into water soluble compounds for detoxification and excretion from the body schlenk et al 2008 cyp was present in living organisms even before oxygen in the atmosphere existed and now almost all organisms have it through evolution lamb et al 2009 however enzyme reactions like sulfation and glucuronide conjugation have been identified as occurring specifically in each species peng et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to study the biotransformation of opes in various aqueous species research has progressed to often evaluating the effect of tphp on a single aquatic species but comparative studies of biotransformation between species by food chain remain insufficient organisms increase the size by ingesting sub trophic species in the aquatic ecosystem and these processes could affect final predators steele 2001 hydrophobic chemicals with high kow values bioaccumulate in the lipid tissues of an organism and move along the food chain kim et al 2011 the log kow of tphp is 4 6 sids 2002 so it is possible for it to move from a lower species to an upper species in the food chain metabolism is associated with similar biotransformation pathways in different species this is because maintaining the early evolved biotransformation pathways is the optimal result from an evolutionary biology point of view ebenhöh and heinrich 2001 on the other hand organisms have specific biotransformation mechanisms the metabolite profile of a particular species results from species specific combinations of functional properties gargallo garriga et al 2020 exposure to tphp by aquatic species could lead to organism specific reactions as well as general biotransformations therefore an integrated approach centered on the producer consumer decomposer relationship is needed in this study microalgae producer invertebrates primary consumer and fish secondary consumer were used to confirm the biotransformation of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem water from a wwtp was also obtained to identify the degradation products from microorganisms btps analysis improved the accuracy precision and reliability using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms the purpose of this study was to identify the btps of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem considering the producer consumer decomposer relationship and to compare biotransformation mechanisms according to species the prediction of toxic effects when organic pollutants are introduced into the aquatic environment is the ultimate goal of this research the btps of tphp not only lack screening data but we also have an insufficient understanding of their toxicity therefore this study estimated the effect of tphp in the aquatic environment by predicting the toxicity of btps in aquatic species 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents for analysis of organisms triphenyl phosphate tphp 99 diphenyl phosphate dphp 99 and triphenyl phosphate d15 as

phosphate and was assigned to level 1 because of a reference standard tp 250 a hydrolysis product of tphp is less cytotoxicity than the parent compound but affects transcriptional expressions of more genes according to previous studies lipid regulated genes in cells exposed to tp 250 dphp are downregulated therefore tp 250 might affect gene expression in the body su et al 2014 algae algae r subcapitata the lowest level of the aquatic food chain was used to analyze the biotransformation processes of btps in the study after considering the suitability of the biotransformation and the possibility of the structure two btps were identified in the positive mode and four in the negative mode of hrms btps of r subcapitata exposed to tphp were not confirmed by suspected screening for btps without chemical information a non target screening could be employed meng et al 2020 developed a functional group dependent screening method through a chemical database fragment ion pattern and nmr analysis to discover new opes in indoor dust samples in this study the mass fragment was interpreted by applying prediction software compounddiscoverer for non target screening tp 594 was identified in r subcapitata fig 2b it was formed by hydroxylation palmitoyl conjugation and desaturation from tphp palmitic acid c16h30o2 in microalgae produces btps through conjugation bonds with

combined with the phenyl group of tphp the information of other mass fragments especially m z 223 00113 also proved that tp 594 was generated by palmitoyl conjugation of tphp invertebrate tp 422 was a specific product identified in invertebrates d magna among btps level 1 2 and 3 the substances produced by sulfate conjugation in the daphnid body were tp 422 and tp 438 fig 2 c shows the information of mass fragments analyzed by orbitrap for tp 422 based on the precursor ion c18h14o8ps m z 421 01514 sulfo groups so3 and hso4 were identified it is expected that sulfate conjugation occurred after hydroxylation because hydroxylated tphp was detected at m z 341 05838 since sulfate conjugated tphp was commonly found in fish tp 422 tp 438 tp 452 tp 454 sulfate conjugation can be considered an important mechanism for consumer level species in the aquatic ecosystem sulfate conjugation plays an essential role in regulating and eliminating the biological activity of various chemicals or

2006 fish in fish o latipes 18 kinds of biotransformation products of tphp were detected in positive nine btps and negative mode nine btps fig 2 d shows the ms ms fragment patterns for tp 518 as the major product tp 518 was generated by glucuronide conjugation same as glucuronidation from hydroxylated tphp the btps of fish produced through glucuronide conjugation were tp 518 tp 534 tp 536 tp 548 and tp 578 in the ms ms fragment of tp 518 c5h5o3 m z 113 02331 and c5h7o4 m z 131 03401 were expected to be derived from glucuronic acid c6h10o7 as the same structure as tp 342 was observed at m z 343 07266 glucuronic acid was bonded to hydroxylated tphp to form tp 518 tp 518 was o glucuronide conjugated from the hydroxyl group previous studies reported the detection of glucuronide tphp and glucuronide hydroxyl tphp by exposing zebrafish to tphp su et al 2015 su et al 2016b wang et al 2016 this study confirmed two btps tp 518 and tp 534 in o latipes which were the same as the reference tp 372 was a product formed by methylation from hydroxylated tphp figure s1 e in ms ms fragments m z 123 0440 and 279 0412 were predicted to indicate a methoxy group r o ch3 attached to the phenyl group methylation is one of the essential phase ii mechanisms in biotransformation and is slightly different from other phase ii reactions generally products from phase ii reactions are water soluble but methylation products have low solubility in water because methylation products are more hydrophobic than their parent compounds methylated btps are not excreted differently from other btps august et al 1994 tp 372 was generated by o methylation in which the methyl group was bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl functional group many of the methylations identified in the study were from o methylations of hydroxyl groups tp 402 tp 452 tp 548 s adenosylmethionine reacts as a cofactor for methylation in organisms parkinson 2001 and the main enzyme for synthesizing o methylation is catechol o methyltransferase testa 2007 van den dungen et al 2017 researched gene transcription from persistent organic pollutant exposure in adipocytes pollutants have been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation and gene expression and interfere with dna methylation these results suggest that the methylated btps tp 372 as well as others identified in this study might be a potential product of disruption of gene expression microorganisms water collected from a wwtp was analyzed to identify the btps of tphp related to microorganisms btps were detected only in samples from the effluent and biological reactors which were compared with the sample of influent this study considered that the btps of tphp generated by microorganisms remained in the water the btps in the wastewater could eventually flow into the river thus the data could contribute to identifying the btps of tphp in the aquatic environment for the study of microorganisms the existence of btps analyzed mainly in microbial degradation products and aquatic species microalgae daphnids and fish was investigated as a result a total of six btps were identified three types were detected each in positive and negative mode table 1 among them the btps common in aquatic organisms were tp 250 and tp 342 suspect screening using the eawag bbd database in the present study revealed four types of btps tp 110 tp 138 tp 140 tp 188 as decomposition products of tphp the mass fragment information of the significant btp tp 110 is shown in fig 2 e tp 110 was catechol or hydroquinone which appeared to have been produced by microbial degradation of tphp significant results were obtained by comparing the analysis data with catechol information of m zcloud https www mzcloud org highchem 2020b as a result tp 110 was ranked as confidence level 1 tp 138 was a decomposition product of tphp 4 hydroxybenzoic acid figure s2a since the m zcloud database was compared with the ms ms fragments it was described as level 1 due to the presence of a reference standard highchem 2020a 3 3 comparison of biotransformation products by aquatic organisms in the study representative species of the food chain were selected to investigate the effects of opes on the aquatic ecosystem the concentration in the body was calculated by exposing the organisms to tphp for the same time period 24 h the organisms were the producer r subcapitata the primary consumer d magna and the secondary consumer o latipes the data were not the result of the state of equilibrium concentration so we used the expected bioconcentration factor bcf the predicted bcf values were as follows microalgae 57 l kg daphnid 86 l kg and fish 89 l kg in previous studies the bcf of o latipes was 144 l kg lemma minor was 43 l kg and typha sp was 1 l kg sids 2002 bcf generally increases at higher nutritional levels due to the increase in the lipid ratio hemond and fechner 2014 in the case of r subcapitata the bcf value was lower than that of other animal species and similar to the bcf lemma minor 43 l kg of plants o latipes showed similar bcf values to d magna and these were lower than the reference it was judged that the exposure time 24 h was inadequate until the body concentration reached equilibrium btps were compared between the biological community based on the producer consumer degrader relationship to predict the biotransformation reaction when tphp was introduced in the aquatic system fig 3 the contribution ratio was calculated in consideration of the biotransformation steps formed products and intensity of btps biotransformation mechanisms showing low rates of 1 or less were expressed with etc the biotransformations commonly seen in living organisms are hydrolysis and hydroxylation which are representative mechanisms of phase i among the biotransformation of tphp hydrolysis is mainly used to generate tp 250 dphp in this study hydrolysis contributed to form this product at the following rates 12 in microalgae 2 in daphnids 34 in fish and 59 in microorganisms fig 3 the hydrolysis reaction tends to be the general biotransformation that occurs in organisms upon the introduction of chemicals into the water hydrolysis is the basic process that describes the biotransformation and transport of nutrients as well as organic pollutants in the environment especially biological systems boethling and mackay 2000 each of the aquatic species used in this study has hydrolytic enzymes in microalgae viscozyme l and celluclast act as hydrolases hammed et al 2013 carboxylic ester hydrolase and alpha beta hydrolase which are responsible for hydrolysis were identified in d magna uniprot 2019 the major hydrolases of mammals are carboxylesterase cholinesterase and paraoxonase enzymes also found in o latipes klaassen and amdur 2013 previous studies have shown that some of the opes in water undergo abiotic hydrolysis to generate degradation products su et al 2016a dphp induced toxicity in developing zebrafish embryos leads to heart defects it also causes embryonic mitochondrial dysfunction hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity mitchell et al 2019 the microbial reaction identified in this study focused on the decomposition and biotransformation of tphp in a wwtp among the aquatic organisms hydrolysis accounted for the most significant proportion of microorganisms in addition to tp 250 hydrolysis products were generated in microorganisms by decomposition from the parent compounds to low molecular weight states the enzyme mainly used to degrade tphp in microorganisms is arldiakylphosphatase kegg 2019a hydroxylation identified in all organisms was a reaction that contributed to the formation of several btps hydroxylation rates of 20 in microalgae 26 in daphnids 45 in fish and 24 in microorganisms were observed fig 3 the hydroxylation in this study mainly reacted with the phenyl functional group of tphp to form oh groups the resulting hydroxylated tphp was transformed into new btps through various phase ii reactions a previous study showed that hydroxylated tphp promotes the transcription of nuclear receptors leading to gene modification kojima et al 2016 therefore it was predicted that cyp would also be present in the experimental species r subcapitata d magna o latipes and microorganisms choi et al 2020 kelly and kelly 2013 schlenk et al 2008 suzuki et al 2018 because cyp plays a role in converting benzene to phenol parkinson 2001 it seems that cyp in living organisms adds hydroxyl groups to the benzene of the organic pollutant tphp microalgae positioned in the producer level of the aquatic ecosystem exhibited different types of biotransformation reactions than other species desaturation 16 palmitoyl conjugation 11 and stearyl conjugation 5 were identified fig 3a desaturation is closely linked to the reactions of fatty acids in the body in microalgae various desaturase enzymes are targeted to different genes to increase lipid production vingiani et al 2019 it is estimated that the desaturase of the experimental species r subcapitata in this study contributed to the biotransformation of palmitic acid and stearic acid the major fatty acids constituting r subcapitata were confirmed as palmitic acid stearic acid and oleic acid pugliese et al 2020 these fatty acids reacted with the tphp penetrating the microalgae to generate new types of btps the biotransformation ratios of d magna and o latipes the consumers of the aquatic ecosystem are shown in fig 3 b and c some general biotransformation reactions sulfate glutathione cysteine conjugation were observed in daphnids and fish the representative animals of the aquatic environment when organic pollutants enter the body glutathione gsh and cysteine conjugated enzymes work together in pairs gsh and cysteine conjugation is an essential reaction in the xenobiotic detoxification pathway cysteine which is a precursor of gsh is involved in gsh synthesis and regulation gsh and cysteine contribute to antioxidant activity inhibition of cell damage and neuroprotection jeon et al 2013 sulfate conjugation is a phase ii biotransformation mechanism in aquatic system consumers since most of the sulfate ions on earth exist in water it is believed that sulfate ions contributed to the evolution of aquatic species ikenaka et al 2006 the biotransformation reaction characteristically observed in o latipes is glucuronide conjugation this reaction has been found in fish exposed to organic pollutants in a previous study wang et al 2016 uridine glucuronosyltransferases present in tissue vesicles are catalysts for glucuronide conjugation this conjugation reacts electron rich nucleophiles o n s klaassen and amdur 2013 glucuronide conjugation occurred in the oh functional group after tphp hydroxylation in the organism although glucuronidation generally detoxifies xenobiotics it might have toxic effects in some instances exposure to a phenolic drug in rats caused high cholestasis by glucuronide compounds and finally blocked the bile ducts krijgsheld et al 1982 mulder 1990 in order to confirm the biotransformation of tphp by microorganisms in the wwtp water samples were collected to analyze btps as a result it was confirmed that the decomposition process and biotransformation occurred by various microorganisms in the biological reaction tank microbial mechanisms showed a simpler pattern compared to the biotransformation of other aquatic organisms fig 3d the microbial community in wastewater includes a variety of taxonomic biochemical and physiological groups of organisms many microorganisms provide the functional benefits of improving water quality and removing nutrients numberger et al 2019 the characteristic biotransformation mechanism in microorganisms is carboxylation which was involved in producing tp 138 tp 140 and tp 188 the reaction occurred by 4 hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase when the carboxyl group was bound to phenols derived from tphp kegg 2019b this enzyme is known to be involved in the biotransformation of microorganisms in various environments ncbi 2020 carboxylation catalyzes the fixation of co2 on organic molecules and affects the carbon cycle on earth it is also a critical reaction that contributes to several biological functions erb 2011 3 4 ecotoxicological information of biotransformation products in the aquatic ecosystem organophosphorus compounds form metabolites through biological biotransformation and their toxicity is altered jokanović 2001 the ecosar model was applied to predict the toxicity of identified btps in each species using a high resolution mass spectrometer lc50 and chv prediction values were obtained from the chemical structures of the btps of tphp in the ecosar model the chronic toxicity value is calculated as the geometric mean value of noec and loec de roode et al 2006 confirmed that the toxicity of more than 70 of the substances in the database was accurate or overestimated by ecosar in addition the lc50 correlation between the experimental value and predicted value through the ecosar model showed more appropriate results for toxic chemicals than nontoxic chemicals in previous studies the ecosar program was used to predict the toxicity of degradation products and btps of various polar chemicals kang et al 2020 kim et al 2018 the experimental lc50 of the parent compound tphp was found to be 2 0 1 3 and 1 2 mg l in algae invertebrates and fish respectively brooke et al 2009 mayer et al 1981 who 1991 the ecosar model predicted values were calculated as 1 5 0 7 and 1 1 mg l since the lc50 as well as noec experimental and predicted values were similar the ecosar model was considered suitable for predicting btp toxicity values of tphp based on the value of the parent compound the fold change in the toxicity value was converted into a log and expressed as a box plot for each chemical substance fig 4 most of the toxicity values of btps predicted by ecosar were decreased compared to the parent compound log10 fold change 0 in particular the toxicity of btps produced by the phase ii enzyme reaction of aquatic organisms seemed to decrease dramatically tp 422 438 445 452 454 463 518 534 536 548 578 617 628 and 669 the lc50 of these btps was predicted to be more than 100 and the chv to be more than 10 table s3 detoxification refers to a biological transformation that eliminates toxicants or prevents their production in the body detoxification competes with toxification and varies depending on the nature of the chemical klaassen and amdur 2013 the detoxification of organophosphorus compounds is achieved by cleavage of the phosphorus bonds or conjugation in vivo metabolites produced by these reactions are rapidly removed into the urine jokanović 2001 it is estimated that detoxification mechanisms reduced the toxicity of most btps generated after exposure to the organic pollutant tphp by aquatic organisms on the other hand btps with increased log lc50 and chv predicted values compared to the parent compound tphp included tp 110 358b 594 and 600 fig 4 tp 110 was detected in microorganisms tp 358b in invertebrates and fish and tp 596 600 in green algae tp 110 is hydroquinone produced from tphp through microbial hydrolysis and is a major benzene metabolite the lc50 of hydroquinone in aquatic organisms according to this experiment was found to be 0 1 0 6 mg l and the noec was found to be 0 1 5 mg l echa 2020a phenol compounds in ppm concentrations are highly toxic to aquatic organisms and most of them cause changes in organisms at the ppb levels guerra 2001 hydroquinone is a substance that has carcinogenic effects as well as causing blood toxicity enguita and leitão 2013 long term exposure to hydroquinone by aquatic organisms could cause severe toxicity and it therefore requires continuous observation echa 2020b tp 358b is a tp in which thiol group is generated from the cysteine conjugated compound and has been identified in invertebrates and fish this product was predicted to have higher toxicity than tphp in algae daphnids and fish thiol induces the formation of free radicals in organisms causing chemical toxicity in particular apoptosis occurs due to the biotransformation of red blood cells through oxidative damage to the cell membrane munday 1989 the thiol functional group in tp 358b produced from the biotransformation process of tphp is also changed into free radicals and may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms tp 594 and tp 600 were generated from tphp by palmitoyl stearyl conjugation hydroxylation and desaturation the main functional groups were transformed palmitic acid and stearic acid respectively the toxicity was higher than the parent compound according to the prediction of the ecosar model especially in green algae the toxicity values of tp 594 and tp 600 were predicted as follows 0 7 3 6 and 0 4 3 3 lc50 0 6 3 4 and 0 3 3 1 chv by negative log scale table s3 fatty acids are a major component of cell membranes and are involved in cell signaling de carvalho and caramujo 2018 however they may cause a cytotoxic reaction if they accumulate in large amounts resulting in hepatic disorders cardiac disorders and diabetes park et al 2014 palmitic acid identified in tp 594 induces apoptosis and stress of the endoplasmic reticulum in hepatoma cells zhang et al 2012 stearic acid present in tp 600 could cause cardiac toxicity by affecting heart cell death and lipid accumulation in the body rabkin and lodha 2009 4 conclusion this study predicted biotransformation of tphp in the aquatic ecosystem using a producer r subcapitata a primary consumer d magna a secondary consumer o latipes and a decomposer microorganisms as a result 29 kinds of btps were identified and generated by specific mechanisms in each organism except for hydroxylation and hydrolysis in common to all species the form of decreasing toxicity showed a pattern of decreasing regardless of species and the same was true when toxicity was increased most of the detected btps were less toxic than the parent compound tphp but some were predicted to be highly toxic tp 594 tp 600 therefore continuous observation of btps as well as tphp itself should be conducted to protect the aquatic environment since various species exist in a close relationship with each other in an ecosystem an integrated approach for not only single species but also various connected species is essential the integrated perspective of btps conducted in this study revealed how organic pollutants transform and accumulate in the aquatic ecosystem furthermore the total toxicity effect on the aquatic ecosystem could be estimated through the toxicity values of btps as well as the parent compound the representative significance of this study lies in the fact that when btps of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment are detected the path of origin organisms such as algae invertebrate fish and so forth or wwtp could be predicted based on the results of this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

ash mgo coagulant and flocculant we report a systematic study on the impact of solution chemistry on the epichlorohydrin dimethylamine coagulant demand for the treatment of synthetic sagd produced water concentrations of magnesium calcium sodium bicarbonate clay mimicking suspended solids sodium metasilicate representing silica and humic acid mimicking dissolved organic matter were varied to study their impact on coagulant demand the impact of the concentration of lime soda ash and mgo on coagulant demand was also studied within the studied concentration range the coagulant dose increased linearly with increasing concentration of humic acid ycoagulant 29 0 703xha and silica ycoagulant 52 0 537xsilica and increased slightly with increasing concentration of lime and soda ash but remained almost unchanged with increasing concentration of dissolved hardness clay or mgo the observations were correlated to the understanding of the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in lime softening the findings provide insights for evaluating onsite coagulant dose and optimizing the process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zeta potential warm lime softening steam assisted gravity drainage coagulation 1 introduction steam assisted gravity drainage sagd operation in the oil sands industry utilizes high temperature and pressure steam to extract bitumen that is too deep to be mined butler 1994 the oily water released after bitumen separation known as produced water is further treated to reduce the bitumen content to no more than 0 5 ppm fatema et al 2015 produced water is typically blended with make up water and the combined feed is then introduced to the warm lime softening wls unit for hardness and silica removal which involves the addition of hydrated lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 magnesium oxide mgo coagulant and flocculant behrman and gustafson 1940 bridle 2005 heins 2010 a schematic of a typical wls unit is shown in fig s1 supporting information si the influent produced water stream is at ph of 7 8 with silica of 150 350 ppm total organic carbon of 150 800 ppm total dissolved solids of 1 000 2 500 ppm and hardness values that can vary significantly based on make up water composition the process typically operates at around 85 c during the operation ca oh 2 and na2co3 as needed are added to precipitate calcium and magnesium hardness mainly as caco3 and mg oh 2 mgo is added to remove silica through a combined mechanism including silica precipitation as magnesium silicates and silica adsorption on mg oh 2 zhang et al 2021 coagulant and flocculant are then used to destabilize the suspended particles to promote their aggregation and settling the doses of ca oh 2 and mgo are driven by the dissolved hardness and silica content of the produced water respectively silica in the softener overflow should be reduced to less than 50 ppm to maintain the integrity of the downstream steam boilers pedenaud et al 2006 although some debate on the maximum allowable silica concentration in the wls exists bridle 2005 total inorganic carbon tic in the wls overflow also needs to be controlled at a desired range e g 15 to 30 ppm as carbon to ensure optimum performance and wls overflow tic values can be monitored as an additional key performance indicator total dissolved hardness in the overflow is typically controlled under 20 ppm as caco3 wls overflow hardness values that are too low indicate an overdose of soda ash which is expensive and also potentially damages downstream steam generation assets wls overflow hardness values that are too high will place a higher demand on downstream ion exchange units alkalinity should not be used as a key performance indicator in sagd wls due to the significant impacts of dissolved organics silica and sulfides on the alkalinity of the water which interfere with traditional m and p alkalinity measurements nearly all colloidal impurities in sagd operations are negatively charged and remain suspended due to the strong repulsive forces which prevent them from coalescing coagulants can be used to interact with suspended particles and neutralize the surface charge on the particles to facilitate their aggregation and settling coagulants can be either inorganic e g alum aluminum chloride polyaluminum chloride ferric chloride or organic e g poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac epichlorohydrin dimethylamine epi dma polydadmac and epi dma as quaternary ammonium cationic polymers are widely used in many water utilities and industrial wastewater treatment plants to enhance coagulation and flocculation of particles bolto and gregory 2007 zeng et al 2016 epi dma polymers have high charge density and can function as both coagulants and flocculants szyguła et al 2008 yin 2010 the coagulation flocculation of colloids by polyelectrolytes is governed by two mechanisms the electrostatic patch mechanism where polyelectrolytes bearing charge opposite to the suspended particles adsorb and reduce the potential energy of repulsion between adjacent colloids and the bridging model where polyelectrolytes bound on the colloid surfaces bind together two adjacent colloids bratby 2006 ji et al 2013 it is known that coagulant and flocculant doses are impacted by ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom typically measured as total organic carbon toc solution salinity particle concentration and particle surface charge bratby 2006 parsons and jefferson 2006 ji et al 2013 however the effect of these multiple physicochemical parameters in a complex environment such as an industrial wls unit remains relatively unexplored in our recent work we showed that the surface charges of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to lime softening were affected by solution chemistry such as inorganic carbon co3 2 hco3 divalent cations ca2 mg2 humic acid silicate and clay in the system zhang et al 2020 the ability of various solution components to influence the zeta potentials of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles varied from one component to another humic acid ha and silica in particular can easily shift the zeta potentials of the softener particles to large negative values even at low concentrations due to their high negative charge density while this provides the understanding of the binary interactions the interactions among various particles in a multi component system such as a wls unit are far more complicated and not easily determined therefore a quantitative understanding of the impact of solution chemistry deviations on the coagulant and flocculant demand is of great significance for industrial water treatment processes of particular interest is assessing how dominant on coagulant demand the properties of the inlet water e g toc total suspended solids content are in comparison to the dry chemicals used in the process e g lime soda ash mgo in this study we reported a systematic study of the influence of various constituents in synthetic sagd produced water on the dose of an epi dma coagulant required to achieve charge neutralization for particle settling the concentrations of dissolved calcium dissolved magnesium na2sio3 representing silica ha mimicking natural organic matter clay mimicking suspended solids and bicarbonate nahco3 were varied and zeta potential measurement was employed to determine the optimum coagulant dose for each water sample the impact of the addition of na2co3 ca oh 2 and mgo on coagulant dose was also studied optimization of wls softener continues to be an area of active research both in industry and in academia zhang et al 2021 in particular determining the appropriate coagulant dose is essential to make wls of sagd produced water work effectively but is challenging pernitsky et al 2018 the results of this study will demonstrate how each constituent in a very complex system sagd produced water influences the coagulant dose such study is helpful in guiding onsite chemical

coagulant is not disclosed milli q water millipore deionized with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used for the preparation of synthetic water samples 2 2 instruments a pb 900 series programmable jar tester was used to perform jar tests a vwr general purpose water bath with built in temperature control was used to heat up the water samples and maintain the temperature at 65 c after the jar test was complete during the jar test an inkbird temperature controller itc 608t working temperature range from 40 to 100 c was used to control a portable heater heatiac 1500 watt 110 v black travel immersion heater to maintain the temperature of water samples on the jar tester at 65 c the zeta potential of the suspended particles in water samples was analyzed by a malvern zetasizer nano zs with a high concentration zeta potential cell zen1010 samples of the raw and treated water suspensions were collected from the center of the test jar and transferred to the zeta potential cell using a 1 ml syringe the temperature of the water sample in the cell was controlled by the instrument an electric field is applied across the electrodes of the cell and the resulting electrophoretic mobility is measured by dynamic light scattering then the zeta potential of the particles is calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation bhattacharjee 2016 1 ζ η ε where ζ η and ε are the zeta potential electrophoretic mobility viscosity of water and dielectric constant of water respectively a thermo scientific icap 7200 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes was used to determine the concentration of silica in the water samples the ph was measured by a fisher scientifictm accumet ae150 ph benchtop meter an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 was used to analyze the concentration of ha in the water samples maan et al 2019 2 3 ca oh 2 and mgo dose estimation during industrial operation hydrated lime is added into the rapid mixing zone of a wls to react with ca2 to form caco3 precipitate the increased ph also leads to increased oh alkalinity which reacts with mg2 to form mg oh 2 precipitate if there is no sufficient co3 2 present in the produced water na2co3 is added to promote the ca2 precipitation the ideal ph at 25 c to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitation in a typical wls operating condition

1 54 following the typical industrial practice was used to reduce silica concentration as sio2 to 50 ppm aligning with the target in the wls overflow 2 4 water sample preparation and testing procedure fresh stock solutions of cacl2 2h2o 10 000 ppm as ca nacl 181 600 ppm mgcl2 6h2o 6 000 ppm as mg and nahco3 56 000 ppm as hco3 were prepared a typical sagd wls feed composition was used for the preparation of the synthetic water sample benchmark water sample as shown in table 1 based on the benchmark water sample a dose of 154 ppm of mgo mgo sio2 molar ratio of 1 54 was used to reduce sio2 concentration to 50 ppm aligning with the target in the wls overflow and 259 ppm of ca oh 2 was used to increase the ph of the solution to the target value of approximately 10 2 to study the factors driving coagulant dose the concentrations of mg2 ca2 hco3 ha silica and clay were systematically varied in the water samples while the concentrations of all the other components were kept the same as those of the benchmark water sample the water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the synthetic water samples at 65 c then the water samples were dosed with 259 ppm of ca oh 2 and 154 ppm of mgo while being agitated at 200 rpm in the jar tester to simulate the lime softening process after lime softening the coagulant was added and the sample was mixed for 2 min at 200 rpm to simulate the rapid mixing zone of the wls the zeta potential was measured both before and after coagulant addition and was used to determine coagulant dose due to the temperature limit of the zeta potential instrument 70 c the temperature of the experiment was controlled at 65 c zeta potential is related to the magnitude of the charge and is a direct indicator of the stability of colloidal dispersion colloids with high zeta potential are electrically stabilized whereas colloids with low zeta potential tend to coagulate thus the optimum coagulant dose was deemed to be obtained when the zeta potential of water samples ranged from 5 to 5 mv astm 2019 a similar procedure was followed to study the impact of ca oh 2 na2co3 and mgo addition to the benchmark water sample the sample for icp measurement was prepared as follows 10 ml of water sample taken after lime softening and coagulation was transferred to a centrifuge tube and any aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 4 000 rpm for 5 min then 2 ml of the supernatant was diluted with 2 hno3 solution to a final volume of 10 ml and passed through a 0 45 μm syringe filter prior to icp measurement for all the measurements each experiment was repeated at least 3 times and mean values with standard deviations were reported 3 results and discussion the study of coagulation and flocculation process in industrial wastewater is challenging because there are numerous components including soluble and insoluble inorganic compounds and organic matter to understand the phenomenon it is necessary to study the impact of each component and their interdependence influent into a sagd wls commonly contains mg2 ca2 hco3 silica and organic matter and its treatment typically involves the formation of caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates through lime and soda ash treatment silica removal with the addition of mgo and enhanced settling of particles with the addition of coagulants flocculants the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to sagd wls have been reported in our previous study zhang et al 2020 in the sections below we systematically describe the role of the solution chemistry on the dose of a high charge density epi dma coagulant in coagulation process using synthetic sagd produced water benchmark water sample in table 1 with varied concentrations of individual inlet components ha silica clay mgcl2 cacl2 hco3 and dry chemicals lime soda ash mgo the observations were correlated to the understanding of the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in lime softening reported in our previous study zhang et al 2020 3 1 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of ha dissolved organic matter is far more significant in determining the coagulant dose than suspended solids in industrial wastewater it has been reported that the charge density of dissolved organic matter is 10 to 100 times greater than inorganic particles such as clay pernitsky et al 2018 the typical carboxyl content of ha has been reported to be approximately 1 μeq mg of organic carbon oliver et al 1983 sagd produced water contains dissolved organic matter that has similar chemical characteristics to ha most importantly in the presence of a large number of negatively charged functional groups pillai et al 2017 maan et al 2018 therefore ha was chosen as a model compound to represent dissolved organic matter in sagd produced water to study its impact on coagulant dose fig 1 a shows the change of the zeta potential of water samples with ha concentration ranging from 0 to 300 ppm while the concentrations of the other constituents were kept the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant the initial zeta potential for all samples before the addition of coagulant was around 30 mv ha itself carries significant negative charge in the alkaline system oliver et al 1983 zhang et al 2020 angelico et al 2014 reported that the zeta potential of ha in 0 015 m nacl varied from 16 mv at ph 2 to 36 mv at ph 10 dissolved natural organic substances similar to has have been reported as colloidal stabilizing agents in aquatic systems stumm 1992 indicating an aquatic system with ha would present stable colloidal behavior with a zeta potential of around 30 mv pate and safier 2016 due to the presence of a large number of carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh groups at high ph the surface carboxylic groups will dissociate and the surface acquires strong negative charge with the addition of coagulant the negative charge was neutralized and the zeta potential of all samples gradually became less negative once the optimum dose of coagulant was added the zeta potential was between 5 to 5 mv indicating that the surface charge became nearly neutral fig 1b summarizes the optimum coagulant dose vs ha concentration the optimum coagulant dose increased linearly with increasing ha concentration slope 0 70 r2 0 998 the ph of the water samples at different concentrations of ha was also measured before the addition of coagulant which ranged between 10 and 10 2 at all tested ha concentrations as shown in fig 1b in our previous study zhang et al 2020 the ph and zeta potential of ha caco3 and ha mg oh 2 systems at different molar ratios were examined because caco3 and mg oh 2 surfaces are sensitive to changes in the ionic composition of the solution the addition of ha in small quantities molar ratio of ha to caco3 and ha to mg oh 2 0 01 to 0 1 can significantly influence the zeta potential of the system strong interactions were observed between the binary particles caco3 ha and mg oh 2 ha zhang et al 2020 ha can alter the properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in various possible ways 1 high negative charge density of ha easily dominating the net charge of the colloidal suspension 2 dissolved ca and mg forming monodentate and bidentate complexes with ha and 3 increased dissolution zhang et al 2020 it is expected that the addition of highly negatively charged ha to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces and is supported by the data shown in fig 1a and 1b 3 2 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of silica to study the impact of silica concentration on the coagulant demand water samples were prepared with silica ranging from 0 to 300 ppm while all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the coagulant addition under the experimental conditions ph 10 65 c silica carries negative charge milne et al 2014 as shown in fig 1c the zeta potential of all samples before the coagulant addition ranged from 30 to 35 mv and coagulant was added stepwise until the zeta potential increased to a value ranging from 5 to 5 mv similar to the case of ha a linear relationship was observed between the optimum coagulant dose and silica concentration slope 0 54 r2 0 984 fig 1d the slope was smaller than that for ha 0 54 vs 0 70 which indicated that silica exerted a smaller coagulant demand than ha fig 1d also shows that the ph increased slightly with the increasing concentration of silica which can be ascribed to the hydrolysis of metasilicate generating hydroxyl ions we previously studied the effect of silica on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles during wls zhang et al 2020 the zeta potential of silica caco3 and silica mg oh 2 binary systems molar ratio between 0 1 to 2 was negative and strong interactions of binary particles were observed zhang et al 2020 in addition silica removal by mgo takes place through adsorption on formed mg oh 2 and silica precipitation as magnesium silicate precipitates zhang et al 2021 which leads to negatively charged particles it is reasonable that the addition of highly negatively charged silica to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces and is supported by the data shown in fig 1c and 1d 3 3 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of clay to study the effect of clay on the coagulant bentonite clay al2o3 sio2 h2o was added to the water samples at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 ppm bentonite has been reported to be negatively charged zhang et al 2020 with a zeta potential between 30 to 35 mv from ph 2 to 12 au and leong 2013 fig 1e shows that the initial zeta potential of the solution was approximately 35 mv and a slight increase in the coagulant demand with increasing clay concentration from 5 to 20 ppm was observed fig 1f the ph decreased with increasing concentration of clay which is due to the amphoteric nature of al2o3 found in clay the zeta potential of clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 binary systems was negative and strong interactions of binary particles were observed zhang et al 2020 it is reasonable that the addition of negatively charged clay to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces however the sagd produced water was dominated by high concentrations of ha and silica it is known that the charge demand of dom could be 10 to 100 times greater than that of clay due to the higher charge demand of dom i e ha and low concentration of clay in the system relative to ha no obvious impact on coagulant dose was observed with such a low concentration of clay 3 4 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of mgcl2 magnesium and calcium metal ions are categorized as dissolved hardness in the wls process the influence of each metal ion was systematically studied first the impact of mgcl2 on the coagulant dose was studied by changing the concentration of mg2 from 0 to 30 ppm while all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant as shown in fig 2 a the zeta potential was approximately 35 mv when no mgcl2 was added and gradually became less negative with increasing mgcl2 concentration 30 mv at 30 ppm mg2 which agrees well with what we previously reported zhang et al 2020 it was found that with the increasing concentration of mg2 ions the negative charge of the caco3 suspension becomes less negative and eventually becomes positive once the concentration exceeds the overall negative charge of the caco3 particles the proposed rationale is that divalent metal cations can adsorb onto the negatively charged particle surfaces to make the surfaces less negatively charged and finally reverse their charge zhang et al 2020 for the studied mgcl2 concentration range the coagulant dose was not strongly influenced by the concentration of dissolved mg ions fig 2a which suggested that the total negative charge of the system still dominates even after the addition of mgcl2 fig 2b shows that at 0 and 7 5 ppm of mg2 the coagulant dose was marginally greater than that at 15 and 30 ppm of mg2 there was no significant difference t test analysis t 3 46 df 2 p 0 05 tcritical 4 3 between the optimum coagulant dose as a function of mgcl2 concentration the ph of the system remained near 10 at 0 7 5 and 15 ppm of mg2 but dropped to 9 5 at 30 ppm of mg2 which is due to the weak acidic nature of mgcl2 3 5 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of cacl2 the effect of dissolved calcium hardness on coagulant dose was studied at different concentrations of cacl2 0 to 50 ppm while the concentrations of all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant as in the case of mgcl2 the initial zeta potential of the water sample was dependent on the concentration of cacl2 added to the solution in the absence of calcium ions the zeta potential was approximately 35 mv and it became less negative as the calcium ions concentration was increased fig 2c which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2020 several studies have reported the effect of ca2 on the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 black and christman 1961 foxall et al 1979 russell et al 2009 mahrouqi et al 2017 derkani et al 2019 an excess of ca2 on caco3 particles shifts the zeta potential of the negatively charged particles to positive zhang et al 2020 excess ca2 can also bind to ha surface to form molecular complexes as well as exchange with other metal cations in the precipitated salts through ionic reactions gustafson 2001 the optimum coagulant dose did not show any significant difference at 0 25 and 50 ppm except a small decrease was observed at 12 5 ppm of cacl2 fig 2d based on the t test analysis the measured coagulant doses are not statistically different within the studied calcium ions concentration range t 1 df 2 p 0 05 tcritical 4 3 the plot of optimum coagulant dose at different calcium ions concentration is shown in fig 2d the ph of the system was close to 10 for all the tested ca2 concentrations slightly greater than 10 at 0 12 5 and 25 ppm and slightly lower than 10 at 50 ppm 3 6 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of nahco3 coagulant dose was determined after different concentration of hco3 ranging from 0 to 1 400 ppm was added into the benchmark water sample in the previous study zhang et al 2020 where the effect of hco3 on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles was studied we found that the dissolved hco3 ions would introduce negative charges on particles and zeta potential became more negative here a similar effect of hco3 on the initial zeta potentials of the system was observed the initial zeta potential values were approximately 20 30 35 and 30 mv at 0 350 700 and 1 400 ppm of hco3 respectively fig 3 a the coagulant dose was also influenced by the initial zeta potential of the system as shown in fig 3b the coagulant dose was the lowest in the absence of hco3 however once hco3 was added further ranging from 350 to 1 400 ppm the optimum coagulant dose was more or less independent of the hco3 concentration the t test analysis also indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the coagulant doses at these concentrations t 3 df 1 p 0 05 tcritical 12 71 the ph decreased from 10 75 to 9 7 when the concentration of hco3 increased from 0 to 1 400 ppm fig 3b 3 7 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of na2co3 the effect of co3 2 addition 0 350 700 and 1 400 ppm on the coagulant dose was studied it is known that the presence of co3 2 can add negative charges on the particle surfaces our prior study on the effect of co3 2 on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles showed that co3 2 ions adsorbed on the particle surfaces can impart negative charges to the particles zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 3c the initial zeta potential of the solution was dependent on the concentration of co3 2 ions in the absence of co3 2 ions the initial zeta potential was less negative 20 mv and became more negative with the increasing concentration of co3 2 ions the ph of the solution did not change significantly with the addition of co3 2 but the ph was higher compared to the ph of the solution prepared using hco3 alkalinity fig 3d the coagulant dose required to neutralize the particles was plotted against the initial co3 2 concentration which is shown in fig 3d at 0 ppm of co3 2 the required coagulant dose was 80 ppm as co3 2 concentration increased the coagulant dose also increased the dose was higher than that in the case of hco3 ions shown in fig 3d the increase in coagulant demand in the case of co3 2 can be attributed to the increase in the ph with increasing co3 2 concentration the higher negative charge of co3 2 ions compared to hco3 ions 2 vs 1 introduces more negative charges on the particles suspended in solution and additional carbonate precipitation with increasing concentration for industrial applications these results suggest that make up water with high carbonate values may require higher dose of coagulant 3 8 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of ca oh 2 lime is added to increase the ph in a wls to result in the precipitation of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles the zeta potential of the benchmark water samples with ca oh 2 concentration from 0 to 516 ppm was measured as a function of coagulant dose before coagulant addition the zeta potential ranged between 30 and 40 mv fig 4 a the initial zeta potential with 0 ppm of ca oh 2 was close to 30 mv and became more negative with the increasing ca oh 2 concentration as shown in fig 4a at 516 ppm of ca oh 2 the zeta potential was close to 40 mv the increased negative charge of the water sample with the dose of ca oh 2 is a result of increasing ph at higher doses of ca oh 2 which is demonstrated in fig 4b the increased ph resulted in the formation of more precipitated particles also increased the negative charge of the dissolved organic and inorganic particles thus the required dose of coagulant to achieve charge neutralization increased clearly a steady increase in coagulant dose was observed with the continuous addition of ca oh 2 as shown in fig 4b the r2 value also indicated a fairly linear relationship between the coagulant demand and ca oh 2 added for industrial applications these results suggest that wls operating at high ph or lime feed rates may require higher coagulant demand 3 9 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of mgo mgo is used in the wls process to remove silica using the benchmark water sample the effect of mgo on the coagulant dose was studied at four concentrations of mgo 0 75 150 and 300 ppm the initial zeta potential of the water sample was approximately 43 mv in the absence of mgo after mgo addition the zeta potential of the system became less negative approaching 30 mv at 150 and 300 ppm of mgo fig 4c the shift in zeta potential toward less negative with the addition of mgo is due to the positively charged surface of mgo in the water at high temperature and interactions of mgo with silica zhang et al 2021 the coagulant dose did not show significant deviation as the mgo amount was increased in the system as shown in fig 4d the ph of the system was approximately 9 8 at 0 ppm of mgo and increased to around 10 1 at 75 ppm of mgo at 150 and 300 ppm of mgo the ph was close to 10 3 10 insights on the factors impacting coagulant dose overall dissolved organic matter represented by ha and silica strongly influenced the coagulant dose therefore wls performance in terms of silica and ha removal was further evaluated using the benchmark water samples in table 1 with varied concentration of silica and ha and treated with the optimum coagulant dose determined by the zeta potential measurements fig 5 a shows the remaining concentration of silica after the wls treatment as a function of the initial concentration of silica the mgo concentration was fixed 150 ppm in all the cases and thus the mgo silica ratio decreased with increasing silica concentration for the tested initial silica concentrations i e 75 150 300 ppm a similar silica removal about 60 was achieved ha removal at different initial ha concentration is shown in fig 5b it can be seen that 95 ha removal was achieved for all the tested initial ha concentrations this confirms that there is a strong relationship between silica and cationic polymer coagulant and between ha and cationic polymer coagulant note that the water soluble organic fraction in sagd waters is complex and the ha respresentation used in this study is acknowledged to be a simplification of the organic fraction seen in real sagd waters for example organics removal in industry across a lime softening process is typically no more than 10 of influent levels the schematic in fig 5c shows the dominant particles present in sagd produced water and potential interactions among dissolved and non dissolved particles in the wls those interactions can be due to van der waals attraction electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions and or chemical reactions depending on the chemical structures israelachvili 1992 caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitate through lime and soda ash treatment in the wls the sign and magnitude of their surface charges depend on the concentration of dissolved ions in the solution ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 oh caco3 and mg oh 2 particles interact with each other and they also interact with other particles carrying negative charges such as ha silica and clay in the system zhang et al 2020 the surface charge densities and particle structures of ha silica and clay are impacted by each other and other particles in the system as discussed above in detail mgo mainly interacts with silica zhang et al 2021 but may interact with ha as well considering their opposite change the high molecular weight cationic coagulant epi dma can interact with particles in the system through the electrostatic patch mechanism bolto and gregory 2007 the coagulant dose increases strongly and linearly with the concentration of organic matter represented by ha and silica in the influent consistent with our previous observations zhang et al 2020 where ha and silica easily shift the charges of the system to negative the impact of clay is not significant at the concentrations that would be expected to occur in a sagd wls the impact of ca2 mg2 hco3 is marginal consistent with the previous observation in a simplified system zhang et al 2020 especially in complex sagd produced water which is dominated by negative charges due to high concentration of ha and silica there is a slow but steady increase in the coagulant dose with the addition of dry chemicals soda ash and lime the addition of mgo does not impact the coagulant dose overall the variations of influent organic matter and silica will drive coagulant dose significantly while the variations of dry chemical addition except lime will not these results will be highly relevant to water treatment facilities where solution conditions change need to be optimized for effective removal of suspended organic and inorganic particles these results indicate the influence of organic matter and silica for optimizing the wls process and saving operating cost it is worthing noting that the findings have some limitations and may not be directly applicable in fieldwork at all locations in this study the conventional bench scale jar tester was used to study the interactions between the coagulant and each component in wls throughout the experiments temperature control was achieved by a separated water bath and portable heater and caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were freshly generated however in full scale operating sagd wls units sludge is recycled back into the precipitation system and the particles present in the softener are a mixture of freshly precipitated and preformed which differs from the experimental set up used in this study this should be taken into consideration because different electrokinetic properties of freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were observed in our previous study zhang et al 2020 in addition the complex fluidic dynamics in full scale units may impact the process efficiency as well future experimental designs that mimic the wls sludge recycling process are now being explored future experiments are also planned to assess the influence of lime particles that may precipitate at higher ph values and also using extracted water soluble organic fractions from industrial waters versus commercially available ha enabling sludge recycle in an experimental setting will also allow for the study of flocculants in addition to coagulants a useful deliverable from additional experimental work that builds on the work presented here would be a model that allows for an estimate of the overall charge balance in the rapid mixing zone to help guide coagulant optimization 4 conclusions for wls treatment of synthetic sagd produced water the dose of polymeric quaternary ammonium coagulant epi dma was influenced more by the variations of organic matter represented by ha and silica in the feed water and less by the variations of dry chemical addition lime soda ash and mgo ha and silica in the inlet water strongly and linearly influenced the dose of coagulant within the tested concentration range of 0 300 ppm following the linear equation of ycoagulant 29 0 703xha and ycoagulant 52 0 537xsilica respectively this is related to their high negative charge density bentonite clay did not show a significant effect on coagulant dose up to 5 ppm but caused a slight coagulant dose increase at 10 ppm clay particles are negatively charged and thus an increase in coagulant dose with increasing concentration of clay is expected declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16908,warm lime softening is commonly used to reduce hardness silica and a small fraction of organic matter from steam assisted gravity drainage sagd produced water through the addition of lime soda ash mgo coagulant and flocculant we report a systematic study on the impact of solution chemistry on the epichlorohydrin dimethylamine coagulant demand for the treatment of synthetic sagd produced water concentrations of magnesium calcium sodium bicarbonate clay mimicking suspended solids sodium metasilicate representing silica and humic acid mimicking dissolved organic matter were varied to study their impact on coagulant demand the impact of the concentration of lime soda ash and mgo on coagulant demand was also studied within the studied concentration range the coagulant dose increased linearly with increasing concentration of humic acid ycoagulant 29 0 703xha and silica ycoagulant 52 0 537xsilica and increased slightly with increasing concentration of lime and soda ash but remained almost unchanged with increasing concentration of dissolved hardness clay or mgo the observations were correlated to the understanding of the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in lime softening the findings provide insights for evaluating onsite coagulant dose and optimizing the process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zeta potential warm lime softening steam assisted gravity drainage coagulation 1 introduction steam assisted gravity drainage sagd operation in the oil sands industry utilizes high temperature and pressure steam to extract bitumen that is too deep to be mined butler 1994 the oily water released after bitumen separation known as produced water is further treated to reduce the bitumen content to no more than 0 5 ppm fatema et al 2015 produced water is typically blended with make up water and the combined feed is then introduced to the warm lime softening wls unit for hardness and silica removal which involves the addition of hydrated lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 magnesium oxide mgo coagulant and flocculant behrman and gustafson 1940 bridle 2005 heins 2010 a schematic of a typical wls unit is shown in fig s1 supporting information si the influent produced water stream is at ph of 7 8 with silica of 150 350 ppm total organic carbon of 150 800 ppm total dissolved solids of 1 000 2 500 ppm and hardness values that can vary significantly based on make up water composition the process typically operates at around 85 c during the operation ca oh 2 and na2co3 as needed are added to precipitate calcium and magnesium hardness mainly as caco3 and mg oh 2 mgo is added to remove silica through a combined mechanism including silica precipitation as magnesium silicates and silica adsorption on mg oh 2 zhang et al 2021 coagulant and flocculant are then used to destabilize the suspended particles to promote their aggregation and settling the doses of ca oh 2 and mgo are driven by the dissolved hardness and silica content of the produced water respectively silica in the softener overflow should be reduced to less than 50 ppm to maintain the integrity of the downstream steam boilers pedenaud et al 2006 although some debate on the maximum allowable silica concentration in the wls exists bridle 2005 total inorganic carbon tic in the wls overflow also needs to be controlled at a desired range e g 15 to 30 ppm as carbon to ensure optimum performance and wls overflow tic values can be monitored as an additional key performance indicator total dissolved hardness in the overflow is typically controlled under 20 ppm as caco3 wls overflow hardness values that are too low indicate an overdose of soda ash which is expensive and also potentially damages downstream steam generation assets wls overflow hardness values that are too high will place a higher demand on downstream ion exchange units alkalinity should not be used as a key performance indicator in sagd wls due to the significant impacts of dissolved organics silica and sulfides on the alkalinity of the water which interfere with traditional m and p alkalinity measurements nearly all colloidal impurities in sagd operations are negatively charged and remain suspended due to the strong repulsive forces which prevent them from coalescing coagulants can be used to interact with suspended particles and neutralize the surface charge on the particles to facilitate their aggregation and settling coagulants can be either inorganic e g alum aluminum chloride polyaluminum chloride ferric chloride or organic e g poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac epichlorohydrin dimethylamine epi dma polydadmac and epi dma as quaternary ammonium cationic polymers are widely used in many water utilities and industrial wastewater treatment plants to enhance coagulation and flocculation of particles bolto and gregory 2007 zeng et al 2016 epi dma polymers have high charge density and can function as both coagulants and flocculants szyguła et al 2008 yin 2010 the coagulation flocculation of colloids by polyelectrolytes is governed by two mechanisms the electrostatic patch mechanism where polyelectrolytes bearing charge opposite to the suspended particles adsorb and reduce the potential energy of repulsion between adjacent colloids and the bridging model where polyelectrolytes bound on the colloid surfaces bind together two adjacent colloids bratby 2006 ji et al 2013 it is known that coagulant and flocculant doses are impacted by ph temperature dissolved organic matter dom typically measured as total organic carbon toc solution salinity particle concentration and particle surface charge bratby 2006 parsons and jefferson 2006 ji et al 2013 however the effect of these multiple physicochemical parameters in a complex environment such as an industrial wls unit remains relatively unexplored in our recent work we showed that the surface charges of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to lime softening were affected by solution chemistry such as inorganic carbon co3 2 hco3 divalent cations ca2 mg2 humic acid silicate and clay in the system zhang et al 2020 the ability of various solution components to influence the zeta potentials of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles varied from one component to another humic acid ha and silica in particular can easily shift the zeta potentials of the softener particles to large negative values even at low concentrations due to their high negative charge density while this provides the understanding of the binary interactions the interactions among various particles in a multi component system such as a wls unit are far more complicated and not easily determined therefore a quantitative understanding of the impact of solution chemistry deviations on the coagulant and flocculant demand is of great significance for industrial water treatment processes of particular interest is assessing how dominant on coagulant demand the properties of the inlet water e g toc total suspended solids content are in comparison to the dry chemicals used in the process e g lime soda ash mgo in this study we reported a systematic study of the influence of various constituents in synthetic sagd produced water on the dose of an epi dma coagulant required to achieve charge neutralization for particle settling the concentrations of dissolved calcium dissolved magnesium na2sio3 representing silica ha mimicking natural organic matter clay mimicking suspended solids and bicarbonate nahco3 were varied and zeta potential measurement was employed to determine the optimum coagulant dose for each water sample the impact of the addition of na2co3 ca oh 2 and mgo on coagulant dose was also studied optimization of wls softener continues to be an area of active research both in industry and in academia zhang et al 2021 in particular determining the appropriate coagulant dose is essential to make wls of sagd produced water work effectively but is challenging pernitsky et al 2018 the results of this study will demonstrate how each constituent in a very complex system sagd produced water influences the coagulant dose such study is helpful in guiding onsite chemical

tester was used to perform jar tests a vwr general purpose water bath with built in temperature control was used to heat up the water samples and maintain the temperature at 65 c after the jar test was complete during the jar test an inkbird temperature controller itc 608t working temperature range from 40 to 100 c was used to control a portable heater heatiac 1500 watt 110 v black travel immersion heater to maintain the temperature of water samples on the jar tester at 65 c the zeta potential of the suspended particles in water samples was analyzed by a malvern zetasizer nano zs with a high concentration zeta potential cell zen1010 samples of the raw and treated water suspensions were collected from the center of the test jar and transferred to the zeta potential cell using a 1 ml syringe the temperature of the water sample in the cell was controlled by the instrument an electric field is applied across the electrodes of the cell and the resulting electrophoretic mobility is measured by dynamic light scattering then the zeta potential of the particles is calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation bhattacharjee 2016 1 ζ η ε where ζ η and ε are the zeta potential electrophoretic mobility viscosity of water and dielectric constant of water respectively a thermo scientific icap 7200 inductively coupled plasma optical emission

added into the rapid mixing zone of a wls to react with ca2 to form caco3 precipitate the increased ph also leads to increased oh alkalinity which reacts with mg2 to form mg oh 2 precipitate if there is no sufficient co3 2 present in the produced water na2co3 is added to promote the ca2 precipitation the ideal ph at 25 c to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitation in a typical wls operating condition

1 54 following the typical industrial practice was used to reduce silica concentration as sio2 to 50 ppm aligning with the target in the wls overflow 2 4 water sample preparation and testing procedure fresh stock solutions of cacl2 2h2o 10 000 ppm as ca nacl 181 600 ppm mgcl2 6h2o 6 000 ppm as mg and nahco3 56 000 ppm as hco3 were prepared a typical sagd wls feed composition was used for the preparation of the synthetic water sample benchmark water sample as shown in table 1 based on the benchmark water sample a dose of 154 ppm of mgo mgo sio2 molar ratio of 1 54 was used to reduce sio2 concentration to 50 ppm aligning with the target in the wls overflow and 259 ppm of ca oh 2 was used to increase the ph of the solution to the target value of approximately 10 2 to study the factors driving coagulant dose the concentrations of mg2 ca2 hco3 ha silica and clay were systematically varied in the water samples while the concentrations of all the other components were kept the same as those of the benchmark water sample the water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the synthetic water samples at 65 c then the water samples were dosed with 259 ppm of ca oh 2 and 154 ppm of mgo while being agitated at 200 rpm in the jar tester to simulate the lime softening process after lime softening the coagulant was added and the sample was mixed for 2 min at 200 rpm to simulate the rapid mixing zone of the wls the zeta potential was measured both before and after coagulant addition and was used to determine coagulant dose due to the temperature limit of the zeta potential instrument 70 c the temperature of the experiment was controlled at 65 c zeta potential is related to the magnitude of the charge and is a direct indicator of the stability of colloidal dispersion colloids with high zeta potential are electrically stabilized whereas colloids with low zeta potential tend to coagulate thus the optimum coagulant dose was deemed to be obtained when the zeta potential of water samples ranged from 5 to 5 mv astm 2019 a similar procedure was followed to study the impact of ca oh 2 na2co3 and mgo addition to the benchmark water sample the sample for icp measurement was prepared as follows 10 ml of water sample taken after lime softening and coagulation was transferred to a centrifuge tube and any aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 4 000 rpm for 5 min then 2 ml of the supernatant was diluted with 2 hno3 solution to a final volume of 10 ml and passed through a 0 45 μm syringe filter prior to icp measurement for all the measurements each experiment was repeated at least 3 times and mean values with standard deviations were reported 3 results and discussion the study of coagulation and flocculation process in industrial wastewater is challenging because there are numerous components including soluble and insoluble inorganic compounds and organic matter to understand the phenomenon it is necessary to study the impact of each component and their interdependence influent into a sagd wls commonly contains mg2 ca2 hco3 silica and organic matter and its treatment typically involves the formation of caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates through lime and soda ash treatment silica removal with the addition of mgo and enhanced settling of particles with the addition of coagulants flocculants the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to sagd wls have been reported in our previous study zhang et al 2020 in the sections below we systematically describe the role of the solution chemistry on the dose of a high charge density epi dma coagulant in coagulation process using synthetic sagd produced water benchmark water sample in table 1 with varied concentrations of individual inlet components ha silica clay mgcl2 cacl2 hco3 and dry chemicals lime soda ash mgo the observations were correlated to the understanding of the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in lime softening reported in our previous study zhang et al 2020 3 1 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of ha dissolved organic matter is far more significant in determining the coagulant dose than suspended solids in industrial wastewater it has been reported that the charge density of dissolved organic matter is 10 to 100 times greater than inorganic particles such as clay pernitsky et al 2018 the typical carboxyl content of ha has been reported to be approximately 1 μeq mg of organic carbon oliver et al 1983 sagd produced water contains dissolved organic matter that has similar chemical characteristics to ha most importantly in the presence of a large number of negatively charged functional groups pillai et al 2017 maan et al 2018 therefore ha was chosen as a model compound to represent dissolved organic matter in sagd produced water to study its impact on coagulant dose fig 1 a shows the change of the zeta potential of water samples with ha concentration ranging from 0 to 300 ppm while the concentrations of the other constituents were kept the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant the initial zeta potential for all samples before the addition of coagulant was around 30 mv ha itself carries significant negative charge in the alkaline system oliver et al 1983 zhang et al 2020 angelico et al 2014 reported that the zeta potential of ha in 0 015 m nacl varied from 16 mv at ph 2 to 36 mv at ph 10 dissolved natural organic substances similar to has have been reported as colloidal stabilizing agents in aquatic systems stumm 1992 indicating an aquatic system with ha would present stable colloidal behavior with a zeta potential of around 30 mv pate and safier 2016 due to the presence of a large number of carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh groups at high ph the surface carboxylic groups will dissociate and the surface acquires strong negative charge with the addition of coagulant the negative charge was neutralized and the zeta potential of all samples gradually became less negative once the optimum dose of coagulant was added the zeta potential was between 5 to 5 mv indicating that the surface charge became nearly neutral fig 1b summarizes the optimum coagulant dose vs ha concentration the optimum coagulant dose increased linearly with increasing ha concentration slope 0 70 r2 0 998 the ph of the water samples at different concentrations of ha was also measured before the addition of coagulant which ranged between 10 and 10 2 at all tested ha concentrations as shown in fig 1b in our previous study zhang et al 2020 the ph and zeta potential of ha caco3 and ha mg oh 2 systems at different molar ratios were examined because caco3 and mg oh 2 surfaces are sensitive to changes in the ionic composition of the solution the addition of ha in small quantities molar ratio of ha to caco3 and ha to mg oh 2 0 01 to 0 1 can significantly influence the zeta potential of the system strong interactions were observed between the binary particles caco3 ha and mg oh 2 ha zhang et al 2020 ha can alter the properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in various possible ways 1 high negative charge density of ha easily dominating the net charge of the colloidal suspension 2 dissolved ca and mg forming monodentate and bidentate complexes with ha and 3 increased dissolution zhang et al 2020 it is expected that the addition of highly negatively charged ha to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces and is supported by the data shown in fig 1a and 1b 3 2 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of silica to study the impact of silica concentration on the coagulant demand water samples were prepared with silica ranging from 0 to 300 ppm while all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the coagulant addition under the experimental conditions ph 10 65 c silica carries negative charge milne et al 2014 as shown in fig 1c the zeta potential of all samples before the coagulant addition ranged from 30 to 35 mv and coagulant was added stepwise until the zeta potential increased to a value ranging from 5 to 5 mv similar to the case of ha a linear relationship was observed between the optimum coagulant dose and silica concentration slope 0 54 r2 0 984 fig 1d the slope was smaller than that for ha 0 54 vs 0 70 which indicated that silica exerted a smaller coagulant demand than ha fig 1d also shows that the ph increased slightly with the increasing concentration of silica which can be ascribed to the hydrolysis of metasilicate generating hydroxyl ions we previously studied the effect of silica on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles during wls zhang et al 2020 the zeta potential of silica caco3 and silica mg oh 2 binary systems molar ratio between 0 1 to 2 was negative and strong interactions of binary particles were observed zhang et al 2020 in addition silica removal by mgo takes place through adsorption on formed mg oh 2 and silica precipitation as magnesium silicate precipitates zhang et al 2021 which leads to negatively charged particles it is reasonable that the addition of highly negatively charged silica to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces and is supported by the data shown in fig 1c and 1d 3 3 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of clay to study the effect of clay on the coagulant bentonite clay al2o3 sio2 h2o was added to the water samples at concentrations of 5 10 and 20 ppm bentonite has been reported to be negatively charged zhang et al 2020 with a zeta potential between 30 to 35 mv from ph 2 to 12 au and leong 2013 fig 1e shows that the initial zeta potential of the solution was approximately 35 mv and a slight increase in the coagulant demand with increasing clay concentration from 5 to 20 ppm was observed fig 1f the ph decreased with increasing concentration of clay which is due to the amphoteric nature of al2o3 found in clay the zeta potential of clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 binary systems was negative and strong interactions of binary particles were observed zhang et al 2020 it is reasonable that the addition of negatively charged clay to the suspension will require more coagulant to neutralize particle surfaces however the sagd produced water was dominated by high concentrations of ha and silica it is known that the charge demand of dom could be 10 to 100 times greater than that of clay due to the higher charge demand of dom i e ha and low concentration of clay in the system relative to ha no obvious impact on coagulant dose was observed with such a low concentration of clay 3 4 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of mgcl2 magnesium and calcium metal ions are categorized as dissolved hardness in the wls process the influence of each metal ion was systematically studied first the impact of mgcl2 on the coagulant dose was studied by changing the concentration of mg2 from 0 to 30 ppm while all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant as shown in fig 2 a the zeta potential was approximately 35 mv when no mgcl2 was added and gradually became less negative with increasing mgcl2 concentration 30 mv at 30 ppm mg2 which agrees well with what we previously reported zhang et al 2020 it was found that with the increasing concentration of mg2 ions the negative charge of the caco3 suspension becomes less negative and eventually becomes positive once the concentration exceeds the overall negative charge of the caco3 particles the proposed rationale is that divalent metal cations can adsorb onto the negatively charged particle surfaces to make the surfaces less negatively charged and finally reverse their charge zhang et al 2020 for the studied mgcl2 concentration range the coagulant dose was not strongly influenced by the concentration of dissolved mg ions fig 2a which suggested that the total negative charge of the system still dominates even after the addition of mgcl2 fig 2b shows that at 0 and 7 5 ppm of mg2 the coagulant dose was marginally greater than that at 15 and 30 ppm of mg2 there was no significant difference t test analysis t 3 46 df 2 p 0 05 tcritical 4 3 between the optimum coagulant dose as a function of mgcl2 concentration the ph of the system remained near 10 at 0 7 5 and 15 ppm of mg2 but dropped to 9 5 at 30 ppm of mg2 which is due to the weak acidic nature of mgcl2 3 5 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of cacl2 the effect of dissolved calcium hardness on coagulant dose was studied at different concentrations of cacl2 0 to 50 ppm while the concentrations of all the other constituents stayed the same as those of the benchmark water sample in table 1 and lime 259 ppm and mgo 154 ppm were added before the addition of coagulant as in the case of mgcl2 the initial zeta potential of the water sample was dependent on the concentration of cacl2 added to the solution in the absence of calcium ions the zeta potential was approximately 35 mv and it became less negative as the calcium ions concentration was increased fig 2c which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2020 several studies have reported the effect of ca2 on the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 black and christman 1961 foxall et al 1979 russell et al 2009 mahrouqi et al 2017 derkani et al 2019 an excess of ca2 on caco3 particles shifts the zeta potential of the negatively charged particles to positive zhang et al 2020 excess ca2 can also bind to ha surface to form molecular complexes as well as exchange with other metal cations in the precipitated salts through ionic reactions gustafson 2001 the optimum coagulant dose did not show any significant difference at 0 25 and 50 ppm except a small decrease was observed at 12 5 ppm of cacl2 fig 2d based on the t test analysis the measured coagulant doses are not statistically different within the studied calcium ions concentration range t 1 df 2 p 0 05 tcritical 4 3 the plot of optimum coagulant dose at different calcium ions concentration is shown in fig 2d the ph of the system was close to 10 for all the tested ca2 concentrations slightly greater than 10 at 0 12 5 and 25 ppm and slightly lower than 10 at 50 ppm 3 6 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of nahco3 coagulant dose was determined after different concentration of hco3 ranging from 0 to 1 400 ppm was added into the benchmark water sample in the previous study zhang et al 2020 where the effect of hco3 on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles was studied we found that the dissolved hco3 ions would introduce negative charges on particles and zeta potential became more negative here a similar effect of hco3 on the initial zeta potentials of the system was observed the initial zeta potential values were approximately 20 30 35 and 30 mv at 0 350 700 and 1 400 ppm of hco3 respectively fig 3 a the coagulant dose was also influenced by the initial zeta potential of the system as shown in fig 3b the coagulant dose was the lowest in the absence of hco3 however once hco3 was added further ranging from 350 to 1 400 ppm the optimum coagulant dose was more or less independent of the hco3 concentration the t test analysis also indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the coagulant doses at these concentrations t 3 df 1 p 0 05 tcritical 12 71 the ph decreased from 10 75 to 9 7 when the concentration of hco3 increased from 0 to 1 400 ppm fig 3b 3 7 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of na2co3 the effect of co3 2 addition 0 350 700 and 1 400 ppm on the coagulant dose was studied it is known that the presence of co3 2 can add negative charges on the particle surfaces our prior study on the effect of co3 2 on caco3 and mg oh 2 particles showed that co3 2 ions adsorbed on the particle surfaces can impart negative charges to the particles zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 3c the initial zeta potential of the solution was dependent on the concentration of co3 2 ions in the absence of co3 2 ions the initial zeta potential was less negative 20 mv and became more negative with the increasing concentration of co3 2 ions the ph of the solution did not change significantly with the addition of co3 2 but the ph was higher compared to the ph of the solution prepared using hco3 alkalinity fig 3d the coagulant dose required to neutralize the particles was plotted against the initial co3 2 concentration which is shown in fig 3d at 0 ppm of co3 2 the required coagulant dose was 80 ppm as co3 2 concentration increased the coagulant dose also increased the dose was higher than that in the case of hco3 ions shown in fig 3d the increase in coagulant demand in the case of co3 2 can be attributed to the increase in the ph with increasing co3 2 concentration the higher negative charge of co3 2 ions compared to hco3 ions 2 vs 1 introduces more negative charges on the particles suspended in solution and additional carbonate precipitation with increasing concentration for industrial applications these results suggest that make up water with high carbonate values may require higher dose of coagulant 3 8 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of ca oh 2 lime is added to increase the ph in a wls to result in the precipitation of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles the zeta potential of the benchmark water samples with ca oh 2 concentration from 0 to 516 ppm was measured as a function of coagulant dose before coagulant addition the zeta potential ranged between 30 and 40 mv fig 4 a the initial zeta potential with 0 ppm of ca oh 2 was close to 30 mv and became more negative with the increasing ca oh 2 concentration as shown in fig 4a at 516 ppm of ca oh 2 the zeta potential was close to 40 mv the increased negative charge of the water sample with the dose of ca oh 2 is a result of increasing ph at higher doses of ca oh 2 which is demonstrated in fig 4b the increased ph resulted in the formation of more precipitated particles also increased the negative charge of the dissolved organic and inorganic particles thus the required dose of coagulant to achieve charge neutralization increased clearly a steady increase in coagulant dose was observed with the continuous addition of ca oh 2 as shown in fig 4b the r2 value also indicated a fairly linear relationship between the coagulant demand and ca oh 2 added for industrial applications these results suggest that wls operating at high ph or lime feed rates may require higher coagulant demand 3 9 coagulant dose as a function of the concentration of mgo mgo is used in the wls process to remove silica using the benchmark water sample the effect of mgo on the coagulant dose was studied at four concentrations of mgo 0 75 150 and 300 ppm the initial zeta potential of the water sample was approximately 43 mv in the absence of mgo after mgo addition the zeta potential of the system became less negative approaching 30 mv at 150 and 300 ppm of mgo fig 4c the shift in zeta potential toward less negative with the addition of mgo is due to the positively charged surface of mgo in the water at high temperature and interactions of mgo with silica zhang et al 2021 the coagulant dose did not show significant deviation as the mgo amount was increased in the system as shown in fig 4d the ph of the system was approximately 9 8 at 0 ppm of mgo and increased to around 10 1 at 75 ppm of mgo at 150 and 300 ppm of mgo the ph was close to 10 3 10 insights on the factors impacting coagulant dose overall dissolved organic matter represented by ha and silica strongly influenced the coagulant dose therefore wls performance in terms of silica and ha removal was further evaluated using the benchmark water samples in table 1 with varied concentration of silica and ha and treated with the optimum coagulant dose determined by the zeta potential measurements fig 5 a shows the remaining concentration of silica after the wls treatment as a function of the initial concentration of silica the mgo concentration was fixed 150 ppm in all the cases and thus the mgo silica ratio decreased with increasing silica concentration for the tested initial silica concentrations i e 75 150 300 ppm a similar silica removal about 60 was achieved ha removal at different initial ha concentration is shown in fig 5b it can be seen that 95 ha removal was achieved for all the tested initial ha concentrations this confirms that there is a strong relationship between silica and cationic polymer coagulant and between ha and cationic polymer coagulant note that the water soluble organic fraction in sagd waters is complex and the ha respresentation used in this study is acknowledged to be a simplification of the organic fraction seen in real sagd waters for example organics removal in industry across a lime softening process is typically no more than 10 of influent levels the schematic in fig 5c shows the dominant particles present in sagd produced water and potential interactions among dissolved and non dissolved particles in the wls those interactions can be due to van der waals attraction electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions and or chemical reactions depending on the chemical structures israelachvili 1992 caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitate through lime and soda ash treatment in the wls the sign and magnitude of their surface charges depend on the concentration of dissolved ions in the solution ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 oh caco3 and mg oh 2 particles interact with each other and they also interact with other particles carrying negative charges such as ha silica and clay in the system zhang et al 2020 the surface charge densities and particle structures of ha silica and clay are impacted by each other and other particles in the system as discussed above in detail mgo mainly interacts with silica zhang et al 2021 but may interact with ha as well considering their opposite change the high molecular weight cationic coagulant epi dma can interact with particles in the system through the electrostatic patch mechanism bolto and gregory 2007 the coagulant dose increases strongly and linearly with the concentration of organic matter represented by ha and silica in the influent consistent with our previous observations zhang et al 2020 where ha and silica easily shift the charges of the system to negative the impact of clay is not significant at the concentrations that would be expected to occur in a sagd wls the impact of ca2 mg2 hco3 is marginal consistent with the previous observation in a simplified system zhang et al 2020 especially in complex sagd produced water which is dominated by negative charges due to high concentration of ha and silica there is a slow but steady increase in the coagulant dose with the addition of dry chemicals soda ash and lime the addition of mgo does not impact the coagulant dose overall the variations of influent organic matter and silica will drive coagulant dose significantly while the variations of dry chemical addition except lime will not these results will be highly relevant to water treatment facilities where solution conditions change need to be optimized for effective removal of suspended organic and inorganic particles these results indicate the influence of organic matter and silica for optimizing the wls process and saving operating cost it is worthing noting that the findings have some limitations and may not be directly applicable in fieldwork at all locations in this study the conventional bench scale jar tester was used to study the interactions between the coagulant and each component in wls throughout the experiments temperature control was achieved by a separated water bath and portable heater and caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were freshly generated however in full scale operating sagd wls units sludge is recycled back into the precipitation system and the particles present in the softener are a mixture of freshly precipitated and preformed which differs from the experimental set up used in this study this should be taken into consideration because different electrokinetic properties of freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were observed in our previous study zhang et al 2020 in addition the complex fluidic dynamics in full scale units may impact the process efficiency as well future experimental designs that mimic the wls sludge recycling process are now being explored future experiments are also planned to assess the influence of lime particles that may precipitate at higher ph values and also using extracted water soluble organic fractions from industrial waters versus commercially available ha enabling sludge recycle in an experimental setting will also allow for the study of flocculants in addition to coagulants a useful deliverable from additional experimental work that builds on the work presented here would be a model that allows for an estimate of the overall charge balance in the rapid mixing zone to help guide coagulant optimization 4 conclusions for wls treatment of synthetic sagd produced water the dose of polymeric quaternary ammonium coagulant epi dma was influenced more by the variations of organic matter represented by ha and silica in the feed water and less by the variations of dry chemical addition lime soda ash and mgo ha and silica in the inlet water strongly and linearly influenced the dose of coagulant within the tested concentration range of 0 300 ppm following the linear equation of ycoagulant 29 0 703xha and ycoagulant 52 0 537xsilica respectively this is related to their high negative charge density bentonite clay did not show a significant effect on coagulant dose up to 5 ppm but caused a slight coagulant dose increase at 10 ppm clay particles are negatively charged and thus an increase in coagulant dose with increasing concentration of clay is expected declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16909,short chain gaseous alkanes scgas mainly consist of methane ch4 ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 and butane c4h10 the first three scgas have been shown to remove perchlorate clo4 and selenate seo4 2 yet it is unknown whether c4h10 is available to reduce these contaminants this study demonstrated that c4h10 fed biofilms were capable of reducing clo4 and seo4 2 to chloride cl and elemental selenium se0 respectively by employing two independent membrane biofilms reactors mbfrs batch tests showed that c4h10 and oxygen fed biofilms had much higher clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rates and enhanced expression levels of bmox and pcra than that without c4h10 or o2 polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulated in the biofilms when c4h10 was supplied and they decomposed for driving clo4 and seo4 2 reduction when c4h10 was absent moreover we revisited the literature and found that a cross feeding pathway seems to be universal in microaerobic scga driven perchlorate and selenate reduction processes in the clo4 reducing mbfrs mycobacterium primarily conducts c2h6 and c3h8 oxidation in synergy with dechloromonas who performs perchlorate reduction while both mycobacterium and rhodococcus carried out c4h10 oxidation with perchlorate respiring azospira as the partner in the seo4 2 reducing mbfrs mycobacterium oxidized c2h6 solely or oxidized c3h8 jointly with rhodococcus while burkholderiaceae likely acted as the selenate reducing bacterium when c4h10 was supplied as the electron donor both mycobacterium and rhodococcus conducted c4h10 oxidation in synergy with unknow selenate reducing bacterium collectively we confirm that from ch4 to c4h10 all scgas could be utilized as electron donors for bio reduction process these findings offer insights into scga driven bio reduction processes and are helpful in establishing scga based technologies for groundwater remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords short chain gaseous alkanes membrane biofilm reactor perchlorate selenate groundwater remediation 1 introduction groundwater has been widely used as the main source of drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation for many cities and countries for example groundwater supports more than half of the population in the united states as primary source of drinking water alley et al 2002 and supplies 38 of area equipped for irrigation siebert et al 2010 unfortunately anthropogenic activities have brought in multiple oxidized contaminants imposing a serious threat to both ecological systems and human health for example perchlorate clo4 and selenate seo4 2 are two emerging contaminants in groundwater clo4 is associated with various industries including pharmacy aerospace industry and manufactures of fireworks and fertilizers cao et al 2019 while seo4 2 sources from agricultural irrigation oil refineries mining coal fired power plants and manufactures of pesticides and photoelectric cells ike et al 2000 due to their chemical stability and high solubility both clo4 and seo4 2 could readily enter into groundwater from contaminated areas however intaking clo4 may disrupt thyroidal iodide uptake and cause mental retardation cao et al 2019 while exposure to seo4 2 could trigger neurodegenerative effect chronic degenerative diseases and tumorigenesis to human body sun et al 2014 the public health goal for clo4 set by california department of public health is 1 μg l dtsc 2020 while the maximum contaminant level for seo4 2 in drinking water established by us environmental protection agency is 50 μg l usepa 2015 although physicochemical technologies e g membrane filtration electro dialysis anion exchange and adsorption have been applied for removing clo4 or seo4 2 in aquatic environments they have limitations in unsustainability and high costs for maintenance and operation howarth et al 2015 son et al 2006 xia et al 2013 bio reduction of clo4 and seo4 2 has attracted increasing attention due to its relatively low cost and

hydrogen gas h2 and short chain gaseous alkanes scgas including methane ch4 ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 and butane c4h10 are promising electron donors for bio reduction process due to their advantages in

ch4 being the dominant component 1 of total amount of c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 was detected in biogas from anaerobic digestion of oil cake gollakota and jayalakshmi 1983 h2 and ch4 has been demonstrated to be able to serve as an electron donor for driving both clo4 and seo4 2 reduction lai et al 2016 luo et al 2015 lv et al 2020 2019 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 moreover lai et al 2020 2021 found non methane scgas c2h6 and c3h8 could also be utilized by microorganisms for supporting clo4 and seo4 2 reduction under oxygen limiting conditions compare to other scgas like ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 c4h10 is easier to be liquefied for storage due to their relatively high boiling point mota 1999 although the price of c4h10 1 2 m3 is comparable to that of other gaseous alkanes e g 1 2 m3 for ch4 electrons contained by per unit volume of c4h10 26 mol e mol gas are much more than other gasses e g 8 mol e mol gas for ch4 thus making c4h10 more economically viable than other gaseous alkanes if serving as electron donor to the best of our knowledge no study has been dedicated to investigating oxidized contaminant bio reduction driven by c4h10 therefore the first objective of this study is to explore whether c4h10 could be utilized as the electron donor for driving clo4 or seo4 2 reduction this objective was achieved via exploring clo4 and seo4 2 reduction in two c4h10 based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs during long term operation in addition three batch tests were carried out to identify the role of c4h10 oxygen and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas in clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction and track the expression level of genes associated with c4h10 oxidation and perchlorate reduction in our previous research we had studied microbial communities of ch4 c2h6 or c3h8 fed biofilms reducing clo4 and seo4 2 luo et al 2015 lai et al 2016 2020 2021 however microbial compositions in clo4 or seo4 2 reducing biofilms supplied with c4h10 as the sole electron donor have not been explored yet furthermore the similarities and specificities of microbial communities in various scgas fed biofilms are not clear specifically whether will the same scga oxidizing bacterium contribute to scga oxidation with different scgas or not which microorganisms are potential perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria whether are scga oxidizing bacteria able to independently couple scgas oxidation with clo4 seo4 2 reduction or the scga oxidizing bacteria work in synergy with perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria in order to address these questions the second objective of this study is to compare microbial community structure among various scgas fed biofilms we applied illumina sequencing targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional genes to analyze microbial compositions in the c4h10 fed biofilms and used multiple analytical methods e g linear discriminant analysis effect size lda lefse principal coordinates analysis pcoa and phylogenetic tree construction to identify the identical and divergent microorganisms in biofilms fed with different scgas 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup two independent mbfrs were set up in this study with a similar configuration used in lai et al 2020 briefly each mbfr had two glass tubes total working volume of 100 ml that were inserted with 48 hollow fibers 0 28 mm outer diameter and 0 18 mm inner diameter 20m1500a mitsubishi japan for each tube total membrane surface area of 141 cm2 the mbfrs were covered with foil papers for preventing algal growth and the surrounding temperature was kept at 22 2 c the mbfrs were connected to a butane gas cylinder 100 butane and controlled at a fixed pressure of 10 psi via a gas pressure regulator coregas australia the maximum c4h10 delivery rate from the hollow fibers was estimated to be 90 4 mmol l d table s1 the bulk liquids were mixed by using a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer precision pump co ltd china at the rate of 80 ml min an oxygen permeable tubing silicone tubing longer precision pump co ltd china was installed into the recirculation loop to deliver oxygen at a rate of 150 mg l day which was measured as described by chen et al 2018 2 2 long term operation the long term operation of the mbfrs lasted for 114 and 105 days for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively each mbfr was inoculated with 20 ml of activated sludge with a mixed liquor suspended solid concentration at 4 g l and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solid concentration at 3 g l acquired from a full scale wastewater treatment plant lai et al 2020 2021 and was then introduced with synthetic mineral salt medium without any organics containing 10 mg l of clo4 or seo4 2 the medium composition and preparation procedure were same as described in lai et al 2020 and the medium was degassed with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min before use in order to attach biofilms to the membranes the medium was recirculated in the mbfrs for 48 h after inoculation the medium containing 1 8 mg cl l of clo4 or 1 mg se l of seo4 2 was continuously fed into the mbfrs at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h the liquid samples from influent and effluent were taken from the reactor every 3 days to measure the concentration of clo4 for clo4 reducing mbfr as well as the concentrations of seo4 2 and total se for seo4 2 reducing mbfr 2 3 batch tests in order to demonstrate the role of c4h10 oxygen and phas in clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction three batch tests were conducted at the end of long term operation batch tests a and b were operated in duplicate while batch test c was performed in triplicate batch test a was conducted to track clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction in the presence of c4h10 c4h10 was delivered through hollow fibers identical to the long term operation while stock solutions of clo4 or seo4 2 was intermittently introduced into the mbfrs with final concentration of 30 mg cl l or 30 mg se l at the beginning of the test batch test b was performed to observe whether clo4 and seo4 2 could be bio reduced in the absence of c4h10 the operation condition of this batch test was similar to that of batch test a except that the c4h10 delivery from gas cylinder to the mbfrs systems was cut off batch test c was operated to study clo4 and seo4 2 reduction profiles without the supply of oxygen this batch was conducted in serum bottles rather than the mbfr system for guaranteeing anaerobic condition biomass was detached from the membranes and transferred into medium containing 30 mg cl l of clo4 or 30 mg se l of seo4 2 in serum bottles the bottles were degassed with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min and tightly capped with black rubber plugs and aluminum caps and then injected with pure c4h10 the liquid samples were taken regularly for analyzing the chlorine and selenium species the removal profile of clo4 and seo4 2 in these batch experiments was modelled by pseudo half order kinetics which has been extensively used for describing dynamic change of substrate in biofilms qambrani et al 2015 the kinetics was expressed according to eqs 1 and 2 1 d c se d t k se c se 2 d c cl d t k cl c cl where t is the time k cl and k se are the half order rate constants for clo4 removal and seo4 2 removal respectively c cl and c se is the remaining concentration of clo4 and seo4 2 respectively at time t the data of clo4 and seo4 2 concentration were fitted to the half order kinetics model by using the aquasim software 2 4 chemical analysis and se0 characterization clo4 clo3 cl and seo4 2 were determined using a dionex ics 2100 ion chromatography equipped with an ionpac as19 column total soluble se seo4 2 seo3 2 concentration was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300dv seo3 2 in the effluent was calculated by subtracting seo4 2 from total soluble se and generated se0 including se0 retained in the biofilm and that washed out with effluent was calculated based on the difference between seo4 2 in influent and total soluble se in effluent the ph in the mbfr solution was monitored using a ph meter oakton australia and it was 7 1 0 3 throughout the experiments the dissolved oxygen do was measured with a do meter oakton eutech instruments singapore phas were analyzed as described by lai et al 2020 in order to identify precipitates associated with biofilms in the selenate reducing mbfr biofilm samples were scrapped off from the fibers at the end of long term operation and washed with deionized water and 100 acetone for three times as described by lai et al 2018b the precipitates were observed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 7001f usa at 10 000 times magnification and the elemental composition of the precipitates were identified through energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis eds 2 5 biofilm sampling dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and data analysis biofilm samples for dna extraction were collected from 10 cm long sections of fibers on day 55 and day 100 in both mbfrs as described by lai et al 2016 dna extraction from the biofilms was carried out by using fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa and the dna concentration was quantified by a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the v6 v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 and the agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter usa were employed to purify the amplicons the amplicons were then sent to australian centre for ecogenomics ace for sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the data processing was carried out as described by lai et al 2020 trimmomatic version 0 38 was used for removing reads with poor quality and qiime2 ver 2018 8 0 was applied for feature selection abundance calculation and taxonomy assignment bolyen et al 2019 operational taxonomic units otus were picked using non redundant silva databases release 132 based on the classify consensus blast function quast et al 2012 investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was carried out for predicting metagenomic information lai et al 2016 2018a 2 6 functional gene sequencing for bmox and pcra in addition the amplicons were then sent to majorbio technology shanghai china for the bmox gene encoding alpha hydroxylase subunit of alkanes monooxygenase and the pcra gene encoding catalytic subunit of perchlorate reductase based illumina sequencing using primer sets bmox f 5 tggttcgagcacaactayccnggntgg 3 bmox r 5 tgcggctgcgcgatcagcgtyttnccrtc 3 deng et al 2018 and pcra320f 5 gcgcccaccactacatgtayggncc 3 pcra598r 5 ggtggtcgccgtaccartcraa 3 nozawa inoue et al 2008 respectively the data was processed via qiime and the phylogenetic affiliation was analyzed against the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database 2 7 comparisons of microbial communities in various scga based mbfrs microbial communities fed with different scgas were compared the dna samples from the different studies were sequenced together with same bioinformatics processing lai et al 2020 2021 the raw sequencing data have been deposited to the ncbi sra database prjna705271 principal coordinate analysis pcoa and hierarchical clustering were implemented by qiime and r programming language based on unweighted unifrac distance matrices to evaluate the overall microbial communities in biofilms fed with c2h6 c3h8 or c4h10 the lda lefse method was employed to present statistically abundant taxa among different scga fed biofilms significantly different taxa were identified based on kruskal wallis kw sum rank test and the effect of taxa group size was evaluated by lda the parameters were set under the lda threshold score of 3 5 and a significant α of 0 05 in addition the sequences with top 20 dominant abundance were aligned using clustal w and a phylogenetic tree was constructed via fasttree version 2 1 3 based on maximum likelihood method 2 8 quantification of total bacteria using qpcr and expressions of bmox pcra and narg genes by reverse transcription rt qpcr the universal primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat targeting bacterial 16s rrna gene was employed to quantify total bacteria in biofilms on day 55 and day 100 during long term operation in order to quantify expression levels of bmox gene pcra gene and narg gene encoding alpha subunit of membrane bound nitrate reductase potentially involved in perchlorate and selenate reduction under different batch tests total rna of the biofilms was extracted from different batch tests using rneasy mini kit qiagen germany then the extracted rna was immediately converted to cdna via reverse transcription using quantitect rev transcription kit qiagen germany each amplification mixture included 10 µm 2x chamq sybr color qpcr master mix vazyme biotech co ltd china 0 4 µl of 5 µm forward and reverse primers 2 µl of diluted cdna and 7 2 µl of ddh2o the primer sets used in the amplification and the reaction conditions were summarized in table s1 3 results 3 1 performance of clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction during long term operation in order to evaluate the performance of clo4 and seo4 2 reduction using c4h10 as electron donor two independent mbfrs were operated for more than 100 days to treat synthetic wastewater containing 5 mg l of clo4 i e 1 8 mg cl l or 1 8 mg l of seo4 2 i e 1 mg se l respectively fig 1 during the first 14 days there was no significant clo4 removal p 0 05 fig 1a b since day 15 clo4 was observed to be reduced with a layer of biofilm attaching to the membranes afterwards the clo4 removal rate gradually increased until almost 100 of clo4 removal was achieved clo4 removal flux 35 mg cl m2 day on day 39 leading to the effluent clo4 concentration 15 µg l neither clo3 nor clo2 was detected indicating clo4 was completely reduced to cl similarly the seo4 2 feeding mbfr had no obvious seo4 2 reduction during the initial 11 days fig 1c d until day 12 seo4 2 reduction started with the presence of seo3 2 and se0 in effluent and the attachment of biofilms to the membrane surface the effluent seo4 2 concentration was then gradually decreased during days 12 33 accompanied by accumulation of seo3 2 up to 0 48 mg se l and se0 in effluent afterwards day 36 54 more than 94 of seo4 2 in influent was removed together with the continuous drop of effluent seo3 2 concentration indicating the produced seo3 2 was concurrently reduced finally a seo4 2 removal flux of 23 mg se m2 day was achieved with a very minor accumulation of seo3 2 mostly 0 05 mg se l at the steady state stage days 57 105 the appearance of reddish precipitates in the biofilm and the strong signal targeting se by eds analysis further suggest the formation of se from seo4 2 bio reduction fig s1 it should be noted that although 150 mg l day of o2 was continuously supplied into the two mbfrs no oxygen was detected in the system after day 20 indicating that oxygen was completely consumed by the biofilms 3 2 clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction and expression of bmox and pcra in batch experiments three batch tests were conducted after the long term operation to determine whether clo4 and seo4 2 reductions were driven by c4h10 fig 2 when c4h10 was available in batch test a both clo4 and seo4 2 were removed following the half order kinetics with a half order rate constant of 0 21 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 24 mg se1 2 l1 2 h respectively fig 2a b and fig 3 a cl or se0 was the dominant final product formed from clo4 or seo4 2 reduction respectively no clo3 or clo2 was detected in the clo4 reducing mbfr while very minor seo3 2 2 mg se l was found in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr in addition the expression level of bmox and pcra genes reached 7 7 109 and 2 3 108 copies m2 in the clo4 reducing biofilms respectively while the bmox gene was expressed at 1 8 109 copies m2 in the selenate reducing biofilms there was no expression of narg gene in both perchlorate and selenate reducing biofilms suggesting nitrate reductases might not be involved in perchlorate and selenate reduction which is consistent with previous studies watts et al 2003 xu et al 2004 when c4h10 was absent in batch test b clo4 and seo4 2 could still be reduced but the half order rate constant decreased to 0 07 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 11 mg se1 2 l1 2 h for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively which were significantly smaller p 0 01 than that in batch test a fig 2c d fig 3 seo3 2 appeared in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr and its maximum concentration 4 mg se l was higher compared to batch test a phas phb 90 were not detected in the inoculum but they could be found in the biofilm at the beginning of batch test b with 10 2 1 5 and 9 2 0 7 of biomass dry weight in clo4 and seo4 2 reducing biofilm respectively however after 178 272 h operation without the electron donor c4h10 in this batch the content of phas decreased to 2 4 0 2 and 5 5 0 2 of biomass dry weight in clo4 or seo4 2 reducing biofilms respectively indicating phas might play an important role in reducing clo4 and seo4 2 in absence of c4h10 accordingly the expression level of bmox gene significantly p 0 01 decreased to 3 1 109 and 5 9 108 copies m2 in clo4 and seo4 2 reducing biofilms respectively in addition the abundance of pcra mrna in clo4 reducing biofilms dropped to 6 107 copies m2 for batch test c fed with c4h10 under anaerobic condition clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction still proceeded whereas with a very low half order rate constant 0 05 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 07 mg se1 2 l1 2 h for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively compared to batch a the abundances of both bmox mrna significantly dropped to 1 5 109 copies m2 in clo4 reducing biofilms and 3 5 108 copies m2 in selenate reducing biofilms p 0 01 the expression level of pcra gene 5 107 copies m2 in batch test c was only 20 of that in batch a 3 3 microbial communities in c4h10 fed biofilms the significantly higher p 0 01 bacterial 16s rrna gene copies in biofilms than that in the inoculum and the significant increase in the gene numbers from day 55 to day 100 p 0 05 and p 0 01 for perchlorate and selenate reducing biofilms respectively indicate the biofilms were growing in the c4h10 fed mbfrs during long term operation fig s2 microbial compositions in c4h10 fed biofilms were first investigated by illumina sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene fig 4 it is found that all dominant microorganisms in the inoculum including genera affiliated to rhodocyclaceae cytophagaceae and sphingobacteriales lai et al 2020 disappeared in the c4h10 fed biofilms in contrast rhodococcus became the first dominating microbe in the c4h10 fed biofilms reaching up to 25 30 and 28 43 in seo4 2 and clo4 reducing biofilms respectively although this genus was undetected in the inoculum mycobacterium became the second dominant genus in the clo4 reducing biofilms accounting for 11 of the total microorganisms but its abundance was very low 1 2 in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms in addition xanthobacter was enriched in the clo4 reducing biofilms 8 17 and lysobacter was enriched in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms 5 7 in order to identify potential c4h10 oxidizing bacteria and clo4 reducing bacteria in the c4h10 fed biofilms functional gene based illumina sequencing targeting bmox and pcra genes was carried out based on bmox gene sequencing mycobacterium was the dominant genus in both seo4 2 and clo4 reducing biofilms with its abundance at 45 83 and 21 33 respectively in addition azospira was predominant 56 86 in the clo4 reducing biofilms identified by pcra based sequencing due to the limitation of suitable primers targeting specific selenate reductase it was not available to identify seo4 2 reducing bacteria in the biofilms nitrate reductase might play a role in selenate reduction yet the negative rt qpcr results targeting narg gene for all biofilm samples indicates nitrate reductases in the mbfr system might not be responsible for selenate reduction to further track the variations of key metabolisms in biofilms functional genes were predicted using picrust pipeline based on kegg database fig 5 the abundances of predictive functional genes responsible for alkanes oxidation e g alkane monooxygenases alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases in the biofilms were much higher than that in the inoculum moreover several forecasted genes responsible for pha generation e g acetoacetyl coa synthetase and pha decomposition e g 3 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase were enriched in the biofilms 4 discussion 4 1 perchlorate and selenate bio reduction driven by butane in this study we for the first time verified microbial clo4 and seo4 2 reduction driven by c4h10 during long term operation and batch test a the c4h10 supply rate in the mbfr was over 1 48 mmol l d which is higher than the required c4h10 rate 0 86 mmol l d for reducing both clo4 seo4 2 and oxygen indicating the electron donor was not limited table s1 the good mass balance between clo4 and cl error 10 and the undetectable other chlorine species e g clo3 and clo2 in the clo4 reducing mbfr in batch experiment a suggest cl was the predominant final product formed from clo4 reduction although small amount of seo3 2 2 mg l accumulated in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr in certain time in batch test a seo4 2 could be completely transformed to se0 the significantly higher p 0 01 clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rates and expression levels of bmox and pcra in batch experiment a k cl 0 21 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 24 mg se1 2 l1 2h than that in batch experiments b k cl 0 07 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 11 mg se1 2 l1 2h further strengthen the key role of c4h10 in bio reducing the two oxyanions in addition the much slower clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rate under anaerobic conditions in batch test c k cl 0 05 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 07 mg se1 2 l1 2h versus that in batch test a suggests oxygen is an important factor affecting clo4 and seo4 2 reduction driven by c4h10 this is further supported by the low expression level of bmox and pcra genes in batch test c although perchlorate reductase has been reported to be inhibited by oxygen chaudhuri et al 2002 o connor and coates 2002 a higher expression of pcra was observed in batch test a in which a limited oxygen was supplied it is assumed that the supplied oxygen might have been quickly consumed by butane oxidizing bacteria in terms of undetectable dissolved oxygen in batch test a thus avoiding the inhibitory effect of oxygen on perchlorate reductase moreover with the limited oxygen supply more electrons could be released from butane oxidation which might be beneficial for the expression of perchlorate reductase for respiring perchlorate the similar phenomenon was also observed in our previous studies in which oxygen was required for activating c2h6 or c3h8 to support clo4 and seo4 2 reduction lai et al 2020 2021 in addition the supplementation of oxygen is beneficial for providing sufficient energy to support the growth of the biofilms however it is worth noting that the oxygen supply rate should be just adequate to maintain the balance between butane oxidation and clo4 seo4 2 reduction an insufficient oxygen supply rate might restrict to oxidize butane which would indirectly affect clo4 seo4 2 reduction by contrast an excessive oxygen supply rate would directly inhibit clo4 and seo4 2 reduction since the presence of dissolved oxygen could negatively affect microbial activities for respiration of clo4 and seo4 2 further studies are required to optimize the oxygen supply rate to promote clo4 seo4 2 reduction it is worth noting that phas were generated in the c4h10 fed biofilms and their contents decreased when clo4 or seo4 2 reduction proceeded in the absence of c4h10 batch test b this is consistent with our previous studies in which phas were synthesized when biofilms were supplied with ch4 c2h6 or c3h8 and degraded when extra electron donors were absent or limiting lai et al 2018b 2020 interestingly the percentages of generated phas in c4h10 fed biofilms 10 2 1 5 and 9 2 0 7 of biomass dry weight in reducing clo4 and seo4 2 respectively were significantly higher p 0 01 than that in c2h6 5 9 0 8 and 3 4 0 1 respectively and c3h8 fed biofilms 6 5 0 3 and 5 8 0 3 respectively this might be caused by more carbon atoms and electrons in each c4h10 molecular compared to c2h6 and c3h8 in terms of microbial communities in the c4h10 fed biofilms many strains belonging to rhodococcus alvarez et al 2000 and mycobacterium sacco et al 2007 are reported pha producers moreover the enrichment of forecasted genes encoding the key enzymes in the pha generation and biodegradation processes fig s3 further supports that the biofilms harboured the metabolic capabilities in the pha cycle during microbial c4h10 oxidation butyrate is commonly generated shennan 2006 which is readily to be bio degraded to acetate acetate can be transformed to acetyl coa via the catalysis of acetyl coa synthase finally phas could be generated from acetyl coa by the pha synthesis pathway verlinden et al 2007 when extra electron donors were absent phas could be enzymatically hydrolysed to 3 hydroxybutyric acid and further converted to butyrate by hydrogenation butyrate would be converted to hydrogen gas and acetate which were typical electron donors for supporting clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction lai et al 2016 logan 1998 oremland et al 1989 the first dominance of rhodococcus in the c4h10 fed biofilms based on 16s rrna sequencing along with the fact that many strains affiliated to rhodococcus e g r aetherovorans bcp1 and r ruber iegm 231 are c4h10 oxidizing bacteria frascari et al 2006 ivshina et al 2014 suggest this genus has played a major role in c4h10 oxidation in the mbfr biofilms during microbial c4h10 oxidation c4h10 is firstly oxidized to butanol through incorporation of an oxygen atom into the carbon hydrogen bond catalyzed by butane monooxygenase shennan 2006 butanol alcohol dehydrogenase then catalyzes the oxidation of butanol to butyraldehyde which is further converted to butyrate catalyzed by butyraldehyde dehydrogenase the enrichment of forecasted genes associated with alkanes oxidation in the biofilms fig s2 further supports that microbial communities in the c4h10 fed biofilms harboured the metabolic potential for alkanes oxidation however rhodococcus was not detected via bmox gene based sequencing which was potentially caused by the limitation of the primer set selected for scgas monooxygenase amplicon sequencing the primers bias has also been reported by bourne et al 2001 in which the results of clone library analysis were divergent when employing different primers targeting pmoa encoding particulate methane monooxygenase to identify methanotrophs bourne et al 2001 more advanced molecular methods e g metagenomics metatranscriptomics ad metaproteomics are needed to further confirm the role of rhodococcus in c4h10 oxidation in future study compared to rhodococcus the abundance of mycobacterium was much lower 11 in the clo4 reducing biofilms and 1 2 in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms mycobacterium is phylogenetically close to rhodococcus figure s4 and has been reported to be able to oxidize c4h10 shennan 2006 moreover mycobacterium was dominant in bmox gene harbouring group fig 4 these results support that this genus was also involved in c4h10 oxidation azospira was identified as the first dominant genus according to pcra gene sequencing in addition azospira comprises many typical perchlorate reducing bacteria e g a suillum byrne bailey and coates 2012 and azospira sp pmj nam et al 2016 therefore azospira likely made the major contribution in perchlorate reduction in the c4h10 fed biofilms due to the lack of suitable primers targeting conserved region of selenate reductase it is too difficult to identify potential selenate reducing bacteria by functional gene based sequencing in this study this present study did not detect any known selenate reducing bacteria either however some species affiliated to rhizobiaceae e g rhizobium selenireducens sp nov and rhizobium sp are reported selenite reducers hunter et al 2007 hunter and kuykendall 2007 although the abundance of this genus in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms was low 2 3 4 2 microbial interactions in scga fed biofilm in our previous research we demonstrated clo4 and seo4 2 reduction in mbfrs which were separately supplied with c2h6 or c3h8 as sole electron donor lai et al 2020 2021 in order to acquire deeper insights into microbial mechanisms involved in scga driven reduction process we further compared microbial communities in the biofilms fed with different scgas pcoa analysis indicates that the inoculum was greatly distant from biofilm samples on both pc1 and pc2 vector biofilms fed with the same scga could be grouped together while microbial compositions in c2h6 fed biofilms were distinct from that in c3h8 and c4h10 fed biofilms figure s5 therefore compared to electron acceptors electron donors scgas contributed more to shaping microbial compositions in biofilms according to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing microbial compositions in the biofilms were divergent for different mbfrs in terms of the most dominant genus or the abundance of each genus figure s6 it is notable that mycobacterium had highest abundance in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms accounting for 20 35 of total microorganisms however the abundance of this genus became much lower in the c4h10 fed biofilms 1 11 in contrast rhodococcus became the first dominating microbe in the c4h10 fed biofilms 25 43 biomarker analysis by lda lefse further indicates this genus was prominent p 0 05 lda 3 5 in c4h10 fed biofilms fig s7 s8 its abundance was much less in c3h8 fed biofilms for reducing selenate 20 and very minor in c3h8 fed biofilms for reducing perchlorate and c2h6 fed biofilms for reducing both perchlorate and selenate 0 0 3 both mycobacterium and rhodococcus are well known scga oxidizing bacteria mycobacterium e g m vaccae has been documented to oxidize a broad of alkanes including c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 shennan 2006 while rhodococcus e g r rhodochrous and r aetherovorans has been found capable of oxidizing both c3h8 and c4h10 frascari et al 2006 shennan 2006 based on bmox gene sequencing targeting scga oxidizing bacteria mycobacterium was the predominant genus in all biofilm samples regardless which scga was supplied figure s9 based on pcra gene sequencing it is notable that dechloromonas was the major genus 43 67 in c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms but it became very minor 2 in the c4h10 fed biofilms figure s9 dechloromonas comprises many perchlorate reducing species coates et al 2004 while this genus was also enriched in h2 fed biofilms reducing perchlorate zhao et al 2013 by contrast azospira was prominent 56 86 in the c4h10 fed biofilms while it was not detected in the c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms although this study failed to identify selenate reducing bacteria using functional gene based sequencing burkholderiaceae which has been reported be able to reduce both seo4 2 and seo3 2 templeton et al 2003 was enriched in c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms reducing selenate 4 7 in c2h6 fed biofilms and 6 13 in c3h8 fed biofilms fig s6 further studies are required to confirm the role of burkholderiaceae in microbial selenate reduction based on these results it is proposed that cross feeding interaction is the microbial mechanism for microaerobic scga driven clo4 reduction process fig 5 previous research suggests that microaerobic ch4 driven clo4 and seo4 2 reduction is accomplished by synergetic relationship between methanotrophs e g methylocystis and potential perchlorate reducing bacteria e g pelomonas or selenate reducing bacteria e g ignavibacterium chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 in terms of non methane scgas when c2h6 or c3h8 is supplied as the electron donor in the clo4 reducing mbfr mycobacterium oxidizes c2h6 c3h8 to provide intermediates or electrons that are used by dechloromonas for converting clo4 to cl when c4h10 is provided as the electron donor both mycobacterium and rhodococcus play roles in oxidizing c4h10 and transferring electrons to azospira to carry out clo4 reduction the microbial interactions also seem to be synergetic in microaerobic scga driven seo4 2 bio reduction process microbial selenate reduction driven by c2h6 is supposed to be achieved by c2h6 oxidation mycobacterium and its synergistic selenate reducing bacteria potentially burkholderiaceae differently when c3h8 is fed into the system it seems that mycobacterium and rhodococcus jointly oxidize c3h8 and deliver electrons to burkholderiaceae for conducting seo4 2 reduction with regard to c4h10 fed biofilms it appears that both mycobacterium and rhodococcus perform c4h10 oxidation while unknown selenate reducing bacteria execute seo4 2 reduction picrust analysis supports that the enriched microbial communities possessed key metabolic functions e g alkanes oxidation and pha cycle in the synergetic interactions however it is notable that picrust has limitations in predicting functional profiles of microbial communities since picrust relies on 16s rrna gene sequencing the bias in pcr amplification caused by biased primers or pcr program may lead to inaccurate gene annotations parada et al 2015 in addition picrust is based on kegg database which isn t very comprehensive stanford et al 2020 thus functional genes that are not included in keeg will not be predicted for example genes encoding perchlorate selenate reduction were not identified using picrust more advanced technologies such as metagenomics or metatranscriptomics should be employed to provide complementary evidence to reveal pathways in the future 4 3 implications of this study clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction driven by ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 has been investigated previously luo et al 2015 and lai et al 2016 achieved clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction by employing mbfrs supplied with ch4 as the electron donor under oxygen limiting conditions moreover luo et al 2018 and wu et al 2019 reported anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction respectively very recently lai et al 2020 2021 found non methane scgas including c2h6 and c3h8 could also be employed for driving microbial clo4 and seo4 2 reduction together with these findings we can confirm that from ch4 to c4h10 all scgas can be utilized for bio reducing clo4 and seo4 2 as a gas electron donor c4h10 has several advantages such as relatively lower price less electron residues compared to common organics or long chain alkanes easier to be liquefied for storage compared to other scgas thus making it promising for wastewater treatment clo4 removal rate of 0 7 mg cl l h and seo4 2 removal rate of 0 8 mg se l h were achieved in this study based on batch test a which are comparable to the removal rate driven by c2h6 0 8 mg cl l h and 0 7 mg se l h for clo4 and seo4 2 removal respectively and c3h8 1 1 mg cl l h and 0 9 mg se l h for clo4 and seo4 2 removal respectively using similar mbfr systems lai et al 2020 2021 these findings could help to develop butane or natural gas based technologies for clo4 and seo4 2 removal from aquatic systems contaminated by the two oxyanions it is also worth noting that other electron acceptors e g nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 may also exist in groundwater and their concentrations can be several orders of magnitude higher than clo4 and seo4 2 bailey et al 2012 lai et al 2014 gu et al 2007 tan et al 2016 additionally groundwater may contain high concentration of ferrous iron that would be oxidized to ferric iron in the presence of oxygen sheng et al 2017 these electron acceptors may shape more diverse microbial communities in biofilms as well as compete with clo4 seo4 2 for electrons from c4h10 thereby affecting removal efficiency of clo4 and seo4 2 further studies are required to understand the interactions among different electron acceptors in the c4h10 based mbfr in the future 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction using c4h10 as sole electron donor in two separated mbfrs phas were produced in the biofilms with continuous supply of c4h10 and they degraded for sustaining clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction when c4h10 was absent multiple batch tests confirmed the crucial roles of both c4h10 and oxygen in c4h10 driven clo4 and seo4 2 reduction high throughput sequencing approaches based on 16s rrna gene and functional genes jointly suggest that cross feeding interaction between scga oxidizing bacteria and perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria are the major microbial mechanism in these

16909,short chain gaseous alkanes scgas mainly consist of methane ch4 ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 and butane c4h10 the first three scgas have been shown to remove perchlorate clo4 and selenate seo4 2 yet it is unknown whether c4h10 is available to reduce these contaminants this study demonstrated that c4h10 fed biofilms were capable of reducing clo4 and seo4 2 to chloride cl and elemental selenium se0 respectively by employing two independent membrane biofilms reactors mbfrs batch tests showed that c4h10 and oxygen fed biofilms had much higher clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rates and enhanced expression levels of bmox and pcra than that without c4h10 or o2 polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulated in the biofilms when c4h10 was supplied and they decomposed for driving clo4 and seo4 2 reduction when c4h10 was absent moreover we revisited the literature and found that a cross feeding pathway seems to be universal in microaerobic scga driven perchlorate and selenate reduction processes in the clo4 reducing mbfrs mycobacterium primarily conducts c2h6 and c3h8 oxidation in synergy with dechloromonas who performs perchlorate reduction while both mycobacterium and rhodococcus carried out c4h10 oxidation with perchlorate respiring azospira as the partner in the seo4 2 reducing mbfrs mycobacterium oxidized c2h6 solely or oxidized c3h8 jointly with rhodococcus while burkholderiaceae likely acted as the selenate reducing bacterium when c4h10 was supplied as the electron donor both mycobacterium and rhodococcus conducted c4h10 oxidation in synergy with unknow selenate reducing bacterium collectively we confirm that from ch4 to c4h10 all scgas could be utilized as electron donors for bio reduction process these findings offer insights into scga driven bio reduction processes and are helpful in establishing scga based technologies for groundwater remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords short chain gaseous alkanes membrane biofilm reactor perchlorate selenate groundwater remediation 1 introduction groundwater has been widely used as the main source of drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation for many cities and countries for example groundwater supports more than half of the population in the united states as primary source of drinking water alley et al 2002 and supplies 38 of area equipped for irrigation siebert et al 2010 unfortunately anthropogenic activities have brought in multiple oxidized contaminants imposing a serious threat to both ecological systems and human health for example perchlorate clo4 and selenate seo4 2 are two emerging contaminants in groundwater clo4 is associated with various industries including pharmacy aerospace industry and manufactures of fireworks and fertilizers cao et al 2019 while seo4 2 sources from agricultural irrigation oil refineries mining coal fired power plants and manufactures of pesticides and photoelectric cells ike et al 2000 due to their chemical stability and high solubility both clo4 and seo4 2 could readily enter into groundwater from contaminated areas however intaking clo4 may disrupt thyroidal iodide uptake and cause mental retardation cao et al 2019 while exposure to seo4 2 could trigger neurodegenerative effect chronic degenerative diseases and tumorigenesis to human body sun et al 2014 the public health goal for clo4 set by california department of public health is 1 μg l dtsc 2020 while the maximum contaminant level for seo4 2 in drinking water established by us environmental protection agency is 50 μg l usepa 2015 although physicochemical technologies e g membrane filtration electro dialysis anion exchange and adsorption have been applied for removing clo4 or seo4 2 in aquatic environments they have limitations in unsustainability and high costs for maintenance and operation howarth et al 2015 son et al 2006 xia et al 2013 bio reduction of clo4 and seo4 2 has attracted increasing attention due to its relatively low cost and sustainability lai et al 2016 luo et al 2015 microorganisms can utilize either clo4 or seo4 2 as terminal electron acceptor for dissimilatory respiration transforming these two oxyanions to nontoxic reduced forms chloride cl and elemental selenium se0 respectively and simultaneously gain energy for growth bardiya and bae 2011 lovley 1993 in the pathway of perchlorate bio reduction clo4 is reduced to clo3 through the catalysis of perchlorate reductase and chlorite is further converted to chloride and oxygen gas catalyzed by chlorite dismutase bardiya and bae 2011 in the selenate bio reduction process selenate reductase schröder et al 1997 or nitrate reductase sabaty et al 2001 convert seo4 2 to selenite seo3 2 which can be further reduced to se0 by nitrite reductase demoll decker and macy 1993 hydrogenase i yanke et al 1995 or fumarate reductase li et al 2014 a variety of soluble organics e g acetate methanol and lactate are commonly utilized as electron donors for driving clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction eregowda et al 2019 gingras and batista 2002 hageman et al 2013 however these organics are readily to leave residues to the aquatic environment causing a secondary pollution hydrogen gas h2 and short chain gaseous alkanes scgas including methane ch4 ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 and butane c4h10 are promising electron donors for bio reduction process due to their advantages in cheap price minor electron residues and extensive availability scgas are highly abundant in natural gas with their contents reaching up to 95 20 10 and 5 for ch4 c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 respectively umukoro ismail 2017 in addition not only ch4 but also c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 have been found in biogas davis and squires 1954 gollakota and jayalakshmi 1983 malik and tauro 1986 for example in spite of ch4 being the dominant component 1 of total amount of c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 was detected in biogas from anaerobic digestion of oil cake gollakota and jayalakshmi 1983 h2 and ch4 has been demonstrated to be able to serve as an electron donor for driving both clo4 and seo4 2 reduction lai et al 2016 luo et al 2015 lv et al 2020 2019 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 moreover lai et al 2020 2021 found non methane scgas c2h6 and c3h8 could also be utilized by microorganisms for supporting clo4 and seo4 2 reduction under oxygen limiting conditions compare to other scgas like ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 c4h10 is easier to be liquefied for storage due to their relatively high boiling point mota 1999 although the price of c4h10 1 2 m3 is comparable to that of other gaseous alkanes e g 1 2 m3 for ch4 electrons contained by per unit volume of c4h10 26 mol e mol gas are much more than other gasses e g 8 mol e mol gas for ch4 thus making c4h10 more economically viable than other gaseous alkanes if serving as electron donor to the best of our knowledge no study has been dedicated to investigating oxidized contaminant bio reduction driven by c4h10 therefore the first objective of this study is to explore whether c4h10 could be utilized as the electron donor for driving clo4 or seo4 2 reduction this objective was achieved via exploring clo4 and seo4 2 reduction in two c4h10 based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs during long term operation in addition three batch tests were carried out to identify the role of c4h10 oxygen and polyhydroxyalkanoates phas in clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction and track the expression level of genes associated with c4h10 oxidation and perchlorate reduction in our previous research we had studied microbial communities of ch4 c2h6 or c3h8 fed biofilms reducing clo4 and seo4 2 luo et al 2015 lai et al 2016 2020 2021 however microbial compositions in clo4 or seo4 2 reducing biofilms supplied with c4h10 as the sole electron donor have not been explored yet furthermore the similarities and specificities of microbial communities in various scgas fed biofilms are not clear specifically whether will the same scga oxidizing bacterium contribute to scga oxidation with different scgas or not which microorganisms are potential perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria whether are scga oxidizing bacteria able to independently couple scgas oxidation with clo4 seo4 2 reduction or the scga oxidizing bacteria work in synergy with perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria in order to address these questions the second objective of this study is to compare microbial community structure among various scgas fed biofilms we applied illumina sequencing targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional genes to analyze microbial compositions in the c4h10 fed biofilms and used multiple analytical methods e g linear discriminant analysis effect size lda lefse principal coordinates analysis pcoa and phylogenetic tree construction to identify the identical and divergent microorganisms in biofilms fed with different scgas 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup two independent mbfrs were set up in this study with a similar configuration used in lai et al 2020 briefly each mbfr had two glass tubes total working volume of 100 ml that were inserted with 48 hollow fibers 0 28 mm outer diameter and 0 18 mm inner diameter 20m1500a mitsubishi japan for each tube total membrane surface area of 141 cm2 the mbfrs were covered with foil papers for preventing algal growth and the surrounding temperature was kept at 22 2 c the mbfrs were connected to a butane gas cylinder 100 butane and controlled at a fixed pressure of 10 psi via a gas pressure regulator coregas australia the maximum c4h10 delivery rate from the hollow fibers was estimated to be 90 4 mmol l d table s1 the bulk liquids were mixed by using a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer precision pump co ltd china at the rate of 80 ml min an oxygen permeable tubing silicone tubing longer precision pump co ltd china was installed into the recirculation loop to deliver oxygen at a rate of 150 mg l day which was measured as described by chen et al 2018 2 2 long term operation the long term operation of the mbfrs lasted for 114 and 105 days for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively each mbfr was inoculated with 20 ml of activated sludge with a mixed liquor suspended solid concentration at 4 g l and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solid concentration at 3 g l acquired from a full scale wastewater treatment plant lai et al 2020 2021 and was then introduced with synthetic mineral salt medium without any organics containing 10 mg l of clo4 or seo4 2 the medium composition and preparation procedure were same as described in lai et al 2020 and the medium was degassed with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min before use in order to attach biofilms to the membranes the medium was recirculated in the mbfrs for 48 h after inoculation the medium containing 1 8 mg cl l of clo4 or 1 mg se l of seo4 2 was continuously fed into the mbfrs at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h the liquid samples from influent and effluent were taken from the reactor every 3 days to measure the concentration of clo4 for clo4 reducing mbfr as well as the concentrations of seo4 2 and total se for seo4 2 reducing mbfr 2 3 batch tests in order to demonstrate the role of c4h10 oxygen and phas in clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction three batch tests were conducted at the end of long term operation batch tests a and b were operated in duplicate while batch test c was performed in triplicate batch test a was conducted to track clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction in the presence of c4h10 c4h10 was delivered through hollow fibers identical to the long term operation while stock solutions of clo4 or seo4 2 was intermittently introduced into the mbfrs with final concentration of 30 mg cl l or 30 mg se l at the beginning of the test batch test b was performed to observe whether clo4 and seo4 2 could be bio reduced in the absence of c4h10 the operation condition of this batch test was similar to that of batch test a except that the c4h10 delivery from gas cylinder to the mbfrs systems was cut off batch test c was operated to study clo4 and seo4 2 reduction profiles without the supply of oxygen this batch was conducted in serum bottles rather than the mbfr system for guaranteeing anaerobic condition biomass was detached from the membranes and transferred into medium containing 30 mg cl l of clo4 or 30 mg se l of seo4 2 in serum bottles the bottles were degassed with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min and tightly capped with black rubber plugs and aluminum caps and then injected with pure c4h10 the liquid samples were taken regularly for analyzing the chlorine and selenium species the removal profile of clo4 and seo4 2 in these batch experiments was modelled by pseudo half order kinetics which has been extensively used for describing dynamic change of substrate in biofilms qambrani et al 2015 the kinetics was expressed according to eqs 1 and 2 1 d c se d t k se c se 2 d c cl d t k cl c cl where t is the time k cl and k se are the half order rate constants for clo4 removal and seo4 2 removal respectively c cl and c se is the remaining concentration of clo4 and seo4 2 respectively at time t the data of clo4 and seo4 2 concentration were fitted to the half order kinetics model by using the aquasim software 2 4 chemical analysis and se0 characterization clo4 clo3 cl and seo4 2 were determined using a dionex ics 2100 ion chromatography equipped with an ionpac as19 column total soluble se seo4 2 seo3 2 concentration was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300dv seo3 2 in the effluent was calculated by subtracting seo4 2 from total soluble se and generated se0 including se0 retained in the biofilm and that washed out with effluent was calculated based on the difference between seo4 2 in influent and total soluble se in effluent the ph in the mbfr solution was monitored using a ph meter oakton australia and it was 7 1 0 3 throughout the experiments the dissolved oxygen do was measured with a do meter oakton eutech instruments singapore phas were analyzed as described by lai et al 2020 in order to identify precipitates associated with biofilms in the selenate reducing mbfr biofilm samples were scrapped off from the fibers at the end of long term operation and washed with deionized water and 100 acetone for three times as described by lai et al 2018b the precipitates were observed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 7001f usa at 10 000 times magnification and the elemental composition of the precipitates were identified through energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis eds 2 5 biofilm sampling dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and data analysis biofilm samples for dna extraction were collected from 10 cm long sections of fibers on day 55 and day 100 in both mbfrs as described by lai et al 2016 dna extraction from the biofilms was carried out by using fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa and the dna concentration was quantified by a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the v6 v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 and the agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter usa were employed to purify the amplicons the amplicons were then sent to australian centre for ecogenomics ace for sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the data processing was carried out as described by lai et al 2020 trimmomatic version 0 38 was used for removing reads with poor quality and qiime2 ver 2018 8 0 was applied for feature selection abundance calculation and taxonomy assignment bolyen et al 2019 operational taxonomic units otus

et al 2008 respectively the data was processed via qiime and the phylogenetic affiliation was analyzed against the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database 2 7 comparisons of microbial communities in various scga based mbfrs microbial communities fed with different scgas were compared the dna samples from the different studies were sequenced together with same bioinformatics processing lai et al 2020 2021 the raw sequencing data have been deposited to the ncbi sra database prjna705271 principal coordinate analysis pcoa and hierarchical clustering were implemented by qiime and r programming language based on unweighted unifrac distance matrices to evaluate the overall microbial communities in biofilms fed with c2h6 c3h8 or c4h10 the lda lefse method was employed to present statistically abundant taxa among different scga fed biofilms significantly different taxa were identified based on kruskal wallis kw sum rank test and the effect of taxa group size was evaluated by lda the parameters were set under the lda threshold score of 3 5 and a significant α of 0 05 in addition the sequences with top 20 dominant abundance were aligned using clustal w and a phylogenetic tree was constructed via fasttree version 2 1 3 based on maximum likelihood method 2 8 quantification of total bacteria using qpcr and expressions of bmox pcra and narg genes by reverse transcription rt qpcr the universal primer set 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat targeting bacterial 16s rrna gene was employed to quantify total bacteria in biofilms on day 55 and day 100 during long term operation in order to quantify expression levels of bmox gene pcra gene and narg gene encoding alpha subunit of membrane bound nitrate reductase potentially involved in perchlorate and selenate reduction under different batch tests total rna of the biofilms was extracted from different batch tests using rneasy mini kit qiagen germany then the extracted rna was immediately converted to cdna via reverse transcription using quantitect rev transcription kit qiagen germany each amplification mixture included 10 µm 2x chamq sybr color qpcr master mix vazyme biotech co ltd china 0 4 µl of 5 µm forward and reverse primers 2 µl of diluted cdna and 7 2 µl of ddh2o the primer sets used in the amplification and the reaction conditions were summarized in table s1 3 results 3 1 performance of clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction during long term operation in order to evaluate the performance of clo4 and seo4 2 reduction using c4h10 as electron donor two independent mbfrs were operated for more than 100 days to treat synthetic wastewater containing 5 mg l of clo4 i e 1 8 mg cl l or 1 8 mg l of seo4 2 i e 1 mg se l respectively fig 1 during the first 14 days there was no significant clo4 removal p 0 05 fig 1a b since day 15 clo4 was observed to be reduced with a layer of biofilm attaching to the membranes afterwards the clo4 removal rate gradually increased until almost 100 of clo4 removal was achieved clo4 removal flux 35 mg cl m2 day on day 39 leading to the effluent clo4 concentration 15 µg l neither clo3 nor clo2 was detected indicating clo4 was completely reduced to cl similarly the seo4 2 feeding mbfr had no obvious seo4 2 reduction during the initial 11 days fig 1c d until day 12 seo4 2 reduction started with the presence of seo3 2 and se0 in effluent and the attachment of biofilms to the membrane surface the effluent seo4 2 concentration was then gradually decreased during days 12 33 accompanied by accumulation of seo3 2 up to 0 48 mg se l and se0 in effluent afterwards day 36 54 more than 94 of seo4 2 in influent was removed together with the continuous drop of effluent seo3 2 concentration indicating the produced seo3 2 was concurrently reduced finally a seo4 2 removal flux of 23 mg se m2 day was achieved with a very minor accumulation of seo3 2 mostly 0 05 mg se l at the steady state stage days 57 105 the appearance of reddish precipitates in the biofilm and the strong signal targeting se by eds analysis further suggest the formation of se from seo4 2 bio reduction fig s1 it should be noted that although 150 mg l day of o2 was continuously supplied into the two mbfrs no oxygen was detected in the system after day 20 indicating that oxygen was completely consumed by the biofilms 3 2 clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction and expression of bmox and pcra in batch experiments three batch tests were conducted after the long term operation to determine whether clo4 and seo4 2 reductions were driven by c4h10 fig 2 when c4h10 was available in batch test a both clo4 and seo4 2 were removed following the half order kinetics with a half order rate constant of 0 21 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 24 mg se1 2 l1 2 h respectively fig 2a b and fig 3 a cl or se0 was the dominant final product formed from clo4 or seo4 2 reduction respectively no clo3 or clo2 was detected in the clo4 reducing mbfr while very minor seo3 2 2 mg se l was found in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr in addition the expression level of bmox and pcra genes reached 7 7 109 and 2 3 108 copies m2 in the clo4 reducing biofilms respectively while the bmox gene was expressed at 1 8 109 copies m2 in the selenate reducing biofilms there was no expression of narg gene in both perchlorate and selenate reducing biofilms suggesting nitrate reductases might not be involved in perchlorate and selenate reduction which is consistent with previous studies watts et al 2003 xu et al 2004 when c4h10 was absent in batch test b clo4 and seo4 2 could still be reduced but the half order rate constant decreased to 0 07 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 11 mg se1 2 l1 2 h for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively which were significantly smaller p 0 01 than that in batch test a fig 2c d fig 3 seo3 2 appeared in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr and its maximum concentration 4 mg se l was higher compared to batch test a phas phb 90 were not detected in the inoculum but they could be found in the biofilm at the beginning of batch test b with 10 2 1 5 and 9 2 0 7 of biomass dry weight in clo4 and seo4 2 reducing biofilm respectively however after 178 272 h operation without the electron donor c4h10 in this batch the content of phas decreased to 2 4 0 2 and 5 5 0 2 of biomass dry weight in clo4 or seo4 2 reducing biofilms respectively indicating phas might play an important role in reducing clo4 and seo4 2 in absence of c4h10 accordingly the expression level of bmox gene significantly p 0 01 decreased to 3 1 109 and 5 9 108 copies m2 in clo4 and seo4 2 reducing biofilms respectively in addition the abundance of pcra mrna in clo4 reducing biofilms dropped to 6 107 copies m2 for batch test c fed with c4h10 under anaerobic condition clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction still proceeded whereas with a very low half order rate constant 0 05 mg cl1 2 l1 2 h and 0 07 mg se1 2 l1 2 h for clo4 and seo4 2 reducing mbfrs respectively compared to batch a the abundances of both bmox mrna significantly dropped to 1 5 109 copies m2 in clo4 reducing biofilms and 3 5 108 copies m2 in selenate reducing biofilms p 0 01 the expression level of pcra gene 5 107 copies m2 in batch test c was only 20 of that in batch a 3 3 microbial communities in c4h10 fed biofilms the significantly higher p 0 01 bacterial 16s rrna gene copies in biofilms than that in the inoculum and the significant increase in the gene numbers from day 55 to day 100 p 0 05 and p 0 01 for perchlorate and selenate reducing biofilms respectively indicate the biofilms were growing in the c4h10 fed mbfrs during long term operation fig s2 microbial compositions in c4h10 fed biofilms were first investigated by illumina sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene fig 4 it is found that all dominant microorganisms in the inoculum including genera affiliated to rhodocyclaceae cytophagaceae and sphingobacteriales lai et al 2020 disappeared in the c4h10 fed biofilms in contrast rhodococcus became the first dominating microbe in the c4h10 fed biofilms reaching up to 25 30 and 28 43 in seo4 2 and clo4 reducing biofilms respectively although this genus was undetected in the inoculum mycobacterium became the second dominant genus in the clo4 reducing biofilms accounting for 11 of the total microorganisms but its abundance was very low 1 2 in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms in addition xanthobacter was enriched in the clo4 reducing biofilms 8 17 and lysobacter was enriched in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms 5 7 in order to identify potential c4h10 oxidizing bacteria and clo4 reducing bacteria in the c4h10 fed biofilms functional gene based illumina sequencing targeting bmox and pcra genes was carried out based on bmox gene sequencing mycobacterium was the dominant genus in both seo4 2 and clo4 reducing biofilms with its abundance at 45 83 and 21 33 respectively in addition azospira was predominant 56 86 in the clo4 reducing biofilms identified by pcra based sequencing due to the limitation of suitable primers targeting specific selenate reductase it was not available to identify seo4 2 reducing bacteria in the biofilms nitrate reductase might play a role in selenate reduction yet the negative rt qpcr results targeting narg gene for all biofilm samples indicates nitrate reductases in the mbfr system might not be responsible for selenate reduction to further track the variations of key metabolisms in biofilms functional genes were predicted using picrust pipeline based on kegg database fig 5 the abundances of predictive functional genes responsible for alkanes oxidation e g alkane monooxygenases alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases in the biofilms were much higher than that in the inoculum moreover several forecasted genes responsible for pha generation e g acetoacetyl coa synthetase and pha decomposition e g 3 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase were enriched in the biofilms 4 discussion 4 1 perchlorate and selenate bio reduction driven by butane in this study we for the first time verified microbial clo4 and seo4 2 reduction driven by c4h10 during long term operation and batch test a the c4h10 supply rate in the mbfr was over 1 48 mmol l d which is higher than the required c4h10 rate 0 86 mmol l d for reducing both clo4 seo4 2 and oxygen indicating the electron donor was not limited table s1 the good mass balance between clo4 and cl error 10 and the undetectable other chlorine species e g clo3 and clo2 in the clo4 reducing mbfr in batch experiment a suggest cl was the predominant final product formed from clo4 reduction although small amount of seo3 2 2 mg l accumulated in the seo4 2 reducing mbfr in certain time in batch test a seo4 2 could be completely transformed to se0 the significantly higher p 0 01 clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rates and expression levels of bmox and pcra in batch experiment a k cl 0 21 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 24 mg se1 2 l1 2h than that in batch experiments b k cl 0 07 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 11 mg se1 2 l1 2h further strengthen the key role of c4h10 in bio reducing the two oxyanions in addition the much slower clo4 and seo4 2 reduction rate under anaerobic conditions in batch test c k cl 0 05 mg cl1 2 l1 2h k se 0 07 mg se1 2 l1 2h versus that in batch test a suggests oxygen is an important factor affecting clo4 and seo4 2 reduction driven by c4h10 this is further supported by the low expression level of bmox and pcra genes in batch test c although perchlorate reductase has been reported to be inhibited by oxygen chaudhuri et al 2002 o connor and coates 2002 a higher expression of pcra was observed in batch test a in which a limited oxygen was supplied it is assumed that the supplied oxygen might have been quickly consumed by butane oxidizing bacteria in terms of undetectable dissolved oxygen in batch test a thus avoiding the inhibitory effect of oxygen on perchlorate reductase moreover with the limited oxygen supply more electrons could be released from butane oxidation which might be beneficial for the expression of perchlorate reductase for respiring perchlorate the similar phenomenon was also observed in our previous studies in which oxygen was required for activating c2h6 or c3h8 to support clo4 and seo4 2 reduction lai et al 2020 2021 in addition the supplementation of oxygen is beneficial for providing sufficient energy to support the growth of the biofilms however it is worth noting that the oxygen supply rate should be just adequate to maintain the balance between butane oxidation and clo4 seo4 2 reduction an insufficient oxygen supply rate might restrict to oxidize butane which would indirectly affect clo4 seo4 2 reduction by contrast an excessive oxygen supply rate would directly inhibit clo4 and seo4 2 reduction since the presence of dissolved oxygen could negatively affect microbial activities for respiration of clo4 and seo4 2 further studies are required to optimize the oxygen supply rate to promote clo4 seo4 2 reduction it is worth noting that phas were generated in the c4h10 fed biofilms and their contents decreased when clo4 or seo4 2 reduction proceeded in the absence of c4h10 batch test b this is consistent with our previous studies in which phas were synthesized when biofilms were supplied with ch4 c2h6 or c3h8 and degraded when extra electron donors were absent or limiting lai et al 2018b 2020 interestingly the percentages of generated phas in c4h10 fed biofilms 10 2 1 5 and 9 2 0 7 of biomass dry weight in reducing clo4 and seo4 2 respectively were significantly higher p 0 01 than that in c2h6 5 9 0 8 and 3 4 0 1 respectively and c3h8 fed biofilms 6 5 0 3 and 5 8 0 3 respectively this might be caused by more carbon atoms and electrons in each c4h10 molecular compared to c2h6 and c3h8 in terms of microbial communities in the c4h10 fed biofilms many strains belonging to rhodococcus alvarez et al 2000 and mycobacterium sacco et al 2007 are reported pha producers moreover the enrichment of forecasted genes encoding the key enzymes in the pha generation and biodegradation processes fig s3 further supports that the biofilms harboured the metabolic capabilities in the pha cycle during microbial c4h10 oxidation butyrate is commonly generated shennan 2006 which is readily to be bio degraded to acetate acetate can be transformed to acetyl coa via the catalysis of acetyl coa synthase finally phas could be generated from acetyl coa by the pha synthesis pathway verlinden et al 2007 when extra electron donors were absent phas could be enzymatically hydrolysed to 3 hydroxybutyric acid and further converted to butyrate by hydrogenation butyrate would be converted to hydrogen gas and acetate which were typical electron donors for supporting clo4 or seo4 2 bio reduction lai et al 2016 logan 1998 oremland et al 1989 the first dominance of rhodococcus in the c4h10 fed biofilms based on 16s rrna sequencing along with the fact that many strains affiliated to rhodococcus e g r aetherovorans bcp1 and r ruber iegm 231 are c4h10 oxidizing bacteria frascari et al 2006 ivshina et al 2014 suggest this genus has played a major role in c4h10 oxidation in the mbfr biofilms during microbial c4h10 oxidation c4h10 is firstly oxidized to butanol through incorporation of an oxygen atom into the carbon hydrogen bond catalyzed by butane monooxygenase shennan 2006 butanol alcohol dehydrogenase then catalyzes the oxidation of butanol to butyraldehyde which is further converted to butyrate catalyzed by butyraldehyde dehydrogenase the enrichment of forecasted genes associated with alkanes oxidation in the biofilms fig s2 further supports that microbial communities in the c4h10 fed biofilms harboured the metabolic potential for alkanes oxidation however rhodococcus was not detected via bmox gene based sequencing which was potentially caused by the limitation of the primer set selected for scgas monooxygenase amplicon sequencing the primers bias has also been reported by bourne et al 2001 in which the results of clone library analysis were divergent when employing different primers targeting pmoa encoding particulate methane monooxygenase to identify methanotrophs bourne et al 2001 more advanced molecular methods e g metagenomics metatranscriptomics ad metaproteomics are needed to further confirm the role of rhodococcus in c4h10 oxidation in future study compared to rhodococcus the abundance of mycobacterium was much lower 11 in the clo4 reducing biofilms and 1 2 in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms mycobacterium is phylogenetically close to rhodococcus figure s4 and has been reported to be able to oxidize c4h10 shennan 2006 moreover mycobacterium was dominant in bmox gene harbouring group fig 4 these results support that this genus was also involved in c4h10 oxidation azospira was identified as the first dominant genus according to pcra gene sequencing in addition azospira comprises many typical perchlorate reducing bacteria e g a suillum byrne bailey and coates 2012 and azospira sp pmj nam et al 2016 therefore azospira likely made the major contribution in perchlorate reduction in the c4h10 fed biofilms due to the lack of suitable primers targeting conserved region of selenate reductase it is too difficult to identify potential selenate reducing bacteria by functional gene based sequencing in this study this present study did not detect any known selenate reducing bacteria either however some species affiliated to rhizobiaceae e g rhizobium selenireducens sp nov and rhizobium sp are reported selenite reducers hunter et al 2007 hunter and kuykendall 2007 although the abundance of this genus in the seo4 2 reducing biofilms was low 2 3 4 2 microbial interactions in scga fed biofilm in our previous research we demonstrated clo4 and seo4 2 reduction in mbfrs which were separately supplied with c2h6 or c3h8 as sole electron donor lai et al 2020 2021 in order to acquire deeper insights into microbial mechanisms involved in scga driven reduction process we further compared microbial communities in the biofilms fed with different scgas pcoa analysis indicates that the inoculum was greatly distant from biofilm samples on both pc1 and pc2 vector biofilms fed with the same scga could be grouped together while microbial compositions in c2h6 fed biofilms were distinct from that in c3h8 and c4h10 fed biofilms figure s5 therefore compared to electron acceptors electron donors scgas contributed more to shaping microbial compositions in biofilms according to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing microbial compositions in the biofilms were divergent for different mbfrs in terms of the most dominant genus or the abundance of each genus figure s6 it is notable that mycobacterium had highest abundance in both c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms accounting for 20 35 of total microorganisms however the abundance of this genus became much lower in the c4h10 fed biofilms 1 11 in contrast rhodococcus became the first dominating microbe in the c4h10 fed biofilms 25 43 biomarker analysis by lda lefse further indicates this genus was prominent p 0 05 lda 3 5 in c4h10 fed biofilms fig s7 s8 its abundance was much less in c3h8 fed biofilms for reducing selenate 20 and very minor in c3h8 fed biofilms for reducing perchlorate and c2h6 fed biofilms for reducing both perchlorate and selenate 0 0 3 both mycobacterium and rhodococcus are well known scga oxidizing bacteria mycobacterium e g m vaccae has been documented to oxidize a broad of alkanes including c2h6 c3h8 and c4h10 shennan 2006 while rhodococcus e g r rhodochrous and r aetherovorans has been found capable of oxidizing both c3h8 and c4h10 frascari et al 2006 shennan 2006 based on bmox gene sequencing targeting scga oxidizing bacteria mycobacterium was the predominant genus in all biofilm samples regardless which scga was supplied figure s9 based on pcra gene sequencing it is notable that dechloromonas was the major genus 43 67 in c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms but it became very minor 2 in the c4h10 fed biofilms figure s9 dechloromonas comprises many perchlorate reducing species coates et al 2004 while this genus was also enriched in h2 fed biofilms reducing perchlorate zhao et al 2013 by contrast azospira was prominent 56 86 in the c4h10 fed biofilms while it was not detected in the c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms although this study failed to identify selenate reducing bacteria using functional gene based sequencing burkholderiaceae which has been reported be able to reduce both seo4 2 and seo3 2 templeton et al 2003 was enriched in c2h6 and c3h8 fed biofilms reducing selenate 4 7 in c2h6 fed biofilms and 6 13 in c3h8 fed biofilms fig s6 further studies are required to confirm the role of burkholderiaceae in microbial selenate reduction based on these results it is proposed that cross feeding interaction is the microbial mechanism for microaerobic scga driven clo4 reduction process fig 5 previous research suggests that microaerobic ch4 driven clo4 and seo4 2 reduction is accomplished by synergetic relationship between methanotrophs e g methylocystis and potential perchlorate reducing bacteria e g pelomonas or selenate reducing bacteria e g ignavibacterium chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 in terms of non methane scgas when c2h6 or c3h8 is supplied as the electron donor in the clo4 reducing mbfr mycobacterium oxidizes c2h6 c3h8 to provide intermediates or electrons that are used by dechloromonas for converting clo4 to cl when c4h10 is provided as the electron donor both mycobacterium and rhodococcus play roles in oxidizing c4h10 and transferring electrons to azospira to carry out clo4 reduction the microbial interactions also seem to be synergetic in microaerobic scga driven seo4 2 bio reduction process microbial selenate reduction driven by c2h6 is supposed to be achieved by c2h6 oxidation mycobacterium and its synergistic selenate reducing bacteria potentially burkholderiaceae differently when c3h8 is fed into the system it seems that mycobacterium and rhodococcus jointly oxidize c3h8 and deliver electrons to burkholderiaceae for conducting seo4 2 reduction with regard to c4h10 fed biofilms it appears that both mycobacterium and rhodococcus perform c4h10 oxidation while unknown selenate reducing bacteria execute seo4 2 reduction picrust analysis supports that the enriched microbial communities possessed key metabolic functions e g alkanes oxidation and pha cycle in the synergetic interactions however it is notable that picrust has limitations in predicting functional profiles of microbial communities since picrust relies on 16s rrna gene sequencing the bias in pcr amplification caused by biased primers or pcr program may lead to inaccurate gene annotations parada et al 2015 in addition picrust is based on kegg database which isn t very comprehensive stanford et al 2020 thus functional genes that are not included in keeg will not be predicted for example genes encoding perchlorate selenate reduction were not identified using picrust more advanced technologies such as metagenomics or metatranscriptomics should be employed to provide complementary evidence to reveal pathways in the future 4 3 implications of this study clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction driven by ch4 c2h6 and c3h8 has been investigated previously luo et al 2015 and lai et al 2016 achieved clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction by employing mbfrs supplied with ch4 as the electron donor under oxygen limiting conditions moreover luo et al 2018 and wu et al 2019 reported anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction respectively very recently lai et al 2020 2021 found non methane scgas including c2h6 and c3h8 could also be employed for driving microbial clo4 and seo4 2 reduction together with these findings we can confirm that from ch4 to c4h10 all scgas can be utilized for bio reducing clo4 and seo4 2 as a gas electron donor c4h10 has several advantages such as relatively lower price less electron residues compared to common organics or long chain alkanes easier to be liquefied for storage compared to other scgas thus making it promising for wastewater treatment clo4 removal rate of 0 7 mg cl l h and seo4 2 removal rate of 0 8 mg se l h were achieved in this study based on batch test a which are comparable to the removal rate driven by c2h6 0 8 mg cl l h and 0 7 mg se l h for clo4 and seo4 2 removal respectively and c3h8 1 1 mg cl l h and 0 9 mg se l h for clo4 and seo4 2 removal respectively using similar mbfr systems lai et al 2020 2021 these findings could help to develop butane or natural gas based technologies for clo4 and seo4 2 removal from aquatic systems contaminated by the two oxyanions it is also worth noting that other electron acceptors e g nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 may also exist in groundwater and their concentrations can be several orders of magnitude higher than clo4 and seo4 2 bailey et al 2012 lai et al 2014 gu et al 2007 tan et al 2016 additionally groundwater may contain high concentration of ferrous iron that would be oxidized to ferric iron in the presence of oxygen sheng et al 2017 these electron acceptors may shape more diverse microbial communities in biofilms as well as compete with clo4 seo4 2 for electrons from c4h10 thereby affecting removal efficiency of clo4 and seo4 2 further studies are required to understand the interactions among different electron acceptors in the c4h10 based mbfr in the future 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction using c4h10 as sole electron donor in two separated mbfrs phas were produced in the biofilms with continuous supply of c4h10 and they degraded for sustaining clo4 and seo4 2 bio reduction when c4h10 was absent multiple batch tests confirmed the crucial roles of both c4h10 and oxygen in c4h10 driven clo4 and seo4 2 reduction high throughput sequencing approaches based on 16s rrna gene and functional genes jointly suggest that cross feeding interaction between scga oxidizing bacteria and perchlorate selenate reducing bacteria are the major microbial mechanism in these
