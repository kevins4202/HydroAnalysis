10940,aquaculture effluent can supply certain plant nutrients in adequate amounts however the nutrients present in the fish waste solution are not balanced mixing this effluent in an independent unit with a hydroponic nutrient solution can help to optimize conditions for the plants and minimize such drawbacks the objective of this work was to assess the crop production and the nutritional responses of pelargonium zonale fertigated with different percentages of fish wastewater five treatments were performed 100ns 75ns 25as 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as where as is the fish wastewater and ns a hydroponic nutrient solution the species used to provide the fish waste solution was tilapia nilotica oreochromis niloticus the results of this assay show that i fish wastewater can be utilized for the fertigation of pelargonium zonale a short cycle crop as there are no differences in the leaf stem petiole and flower dry matter leaf water content leaf area plant height and leaf color compared to pelargonium zonale fertigated with a chemical fertilizer ii the application of 75ns 25as accelerated flowers shoots and leaves production a higher percentage of fish waste solution mixed with the applied nutrient solution significantly reduces the k concentration in the nutrient solution and in the leaf however tilapia waste solution supplies adequate n p and ca nutrients to the pelargonium plants therefore the reuse of fish waste solution can reduce the application rate of some inorganic fertilizers which in turn can reduce the cost of fertilizers while preventing environmental pollution keywords potassium fertilizer use efficiency double recirculation aquaponic system tilapia ornamental plants 1 introduction traditional agricultural systems are being confronted with globally declining resources resulting from climate change and a growing population saha et al 2016 the european water framework directive demands the good chemical and ecological status of water and ground water resources in the eu member states nowadays treated wastewater is discharged into the sea soil or river which induces negative environmental effects the reuse of reclaimed wastewater by farmers has several advantages such as utilizing low cost water resources and a reduced need for nutrient supplementation which minimizes the application rate of commercial fertilizers prazeres et al 2016 aquaponics consist of the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics a soilless system for crop production love et al 2015 aquaponic systems have many advantages and are targeted at solving some of the problems the world is facing including a population surge soil degradation water scarcity and food safety addy et al 2017 additionally chemical and bacterial analyses have indicated that there is no evidence of any public health hazard associated with treated wastewater reuse in aquaculture khalil and hussein 1997 the aquaponic recirculation system has proven itself not only a successful method for biomass production such as food crops but also a useful system for recycling aquaculture wastewater endut et al 2016 however since aquaponics needs to balance the growth condition for both the fish and the vegetable produce the overlap of the two sets of conditions often leaves only a thin margin for the system to succeed addy et al 2017 one of the most critical points for this system is the different optimum ph levels for fish plants and nitrates in the aquaponic system suhl et al 2016 the efficiency of nitrification a crucial process in aquaculture as it reduces the ammonium level which is a major cause of toxicity for farmed fish is higher in alkaline solutions at a ph of 7 5 8 0 this is the reason for the relatively high ph in most aquaculture facilities plant growth can be affected by a high ph 7 while a ph of 5 8 is considered optimal for nutrient availability in hydroponics roosta and mohsenian 2012 another critical issue is the nutrient supply it has been reported that aquaponic systems that rely solely on fish waste to supply nutrients for plants have low levels of p k fe mn and s roosta and hamidpour 2011 therefore to be effective at nutrient removal aquaponic systems should be sized correctly to balance fish output and nutrient uptake by plants endut et al 2016 in order to overcome the disadvantages mentioned above kloas et al 2015 developed a new concept for aquaponic systems to improve sustainability increase productivity and reduce environmental emissions the aquaponic system for nearly emission free tomato and fish production in greenhouses consists of 2 independent recirculating units an aquaculture system for the fish and a hydroponic unit for plants kloas et al 2015 both systems are connected by a 1 way valve to deliver fish water containing nutrients into the hydroponic reservoir where the fish water can be optimized as fertilizer in order to meet the specific demands of the plant species kloas et al 2015 the water and nutrients can be used twice firstly for fish rearing and secondly for plant irrigation enabling sustainable crop production suhl et al 2018 the separation of the units allows the adjustment of optimal conditions such as ph and nutrient composition for both the production systems independently suhl et al 2018 in order to increase productivity and prevent adverse interactions between the plant and fish units kloas et al 2015 however using fish wastewater in double recirculating aquaponic systems draps increases the risk that the oxygen concentration drops to zero during the daytime in summer a factor that can affect plant growth suhl et al 2019 this is probably due to greater microorganism activity and a higher content of solids within the fish wastewater compared to fresh water suhl et al 2019 using fish wastewater on its own or mixed with a standard nutrient solution for the fertigation of pot plants while controlling ph and ec is standard practice for growers and is a good solution for avoiding this problem in this context we hypothesized that different proportions of fish wastewater used in the fertigation would influence the nutritional responses of pelargonium x zonale the objective of this work was to study crop production and the nutritional responses of pelargonium zonale fertigated with four different percentages of fish wastewater 25 50 75 and 100 compared to conventional fertigation 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions the trial was conducted in a tunnel greenhouse at the university of almería pelargonium zonale plants were cultivated with peat moss and perlite 80 20 v v in 3 5 l black plastic square containers this substrate provides an ideal medium for ornamental production because of its suitable physical properties such as its high air and water holding capacity this substrate also has a low nutrient content low level of decomposition and high cation exchange capacity which helps to reduce the leaching of nutrients temperature and relative humidity were recorded every 15 min with a hobo u12 013 data logger onset computer corporation bourne ma usa placed at canopy height in the central part of the cultivation table where the plants were grown the vapour pressure deficit was estimated using the equation proposed by rosenberg et al 1983 external radiation was

production farm located in cordoba granjas piscícolas del sur the fish species cultivated were tilapia nilotica oreochromis niloticus the farm uses an intensive closed recirculating system with a density of 20 adults m 3 the renewal rate was 0 5 daily after collecting the fish wastewater was cleaned by a mechanical filter mixed with the nutrient solution in different proportions in a tank and then used to fertigate the plants fig 1 the standard nutrient solutions dickson and fisher 2017 were prepared with water and mineral fertilizer there were 5 stock treatments in which the percentage of fish wastewater varied 100ns 75ns 25as 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as ns is the nutrient solution and as the fish waste solution an independent 50 l tank was used for each treatment the solution was refreshed weekly the ph in all the treatments was maintained at around 6 5 nitric acid was added in order to balance the ph of the nutrient solutions the composition of the nutrient solution was analyzed weekly during the trial the nutrient solutions used are listed in table 1 fertigation was applied manually until the leachate fraction reached 20 the average dose was 100 ml per plant per day the water use efficiency was estimated as the ratio between the dry matter production of a plant kg divided by the total water use l 2 3 plant parameters the number of leaves shoots and flowers per plant was counted each week during the crop cycle also each week the flowers were separated from the plants and weighed on a scale plant height was measured from the top edge of the pot to the tip of the last open leaf of the plant using a graduated rule at the end of the assay the plant material was washed and separated into different organs absorption organs roots conductive organs stems and petioles photosynthetic organs leaves and reproductive organs flowers were weighed on a mettler toledo pb 303 s to obtain the fresh weight afterwards they were dried in a forced air oven at 60 c for 48 h and weighed to obtain the dry weight dw the leaf water content was calculated as the ratio between leaf fw dw and the leaf dw the root shoot dw ratio is the relationship between the root dw and the sum of the conductive organs flowers and leaf dw the leaf area was estimated by a non destructive method using the formula s a blw proposed by giuffrida et al 2011 where s is the foliar surface area l is the leaf length cm a is the leaf width and the coefficients a and b are specific to each species the leaf length and width were measured using a ruler leaf color was identified according to the munsell chart for leaves using three parameters chroma shine and intensity 2 4 nutrient solution analysis the parameters determined in the nutrient solutions tested were ph ec no3 so4 2 h2po4 nh4

atomic absorption spectrometer 3300 p was analyzed using the method proposed by hogue et al 1970 and n using the method proposed by krom 1980 2 6 experimental design and statistical analysis the experimental design was a completely randomized block with 5 treatments 4 replicates per treatment and 3 plants pots per replicate the treatments effect significance was examined using the standard analysis of variance one way anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd test performed using statgraphics centurion xvi ii statpoint technologies inc warrenton virginia usa differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 nutrient solution and water use efficiency table 1 shows the means of the ph ec and nutrient concentration for the nutrient solution the ph for all the treatments was 6 5 6 6 the ec decreased with the increase in fish wastewater percentage due to the reduced nutrient inputs in this water n p and ca which had means of 6 57 0 46 and 2 08 mmol l 1 respectively in the treatment with 100 fish waste solution had e optimal values for bedding plant growth the phosphorous concentration in the nutrient solution was similar in all the treatments however increasing the fish wastewater percentage led to an increase in the amount of sulphate while decreasing k and mg concentrations the values for k and mg in the nutrient solution for 100 as were 0 80 and 0 34 mmol l 1 respectively which were above optimum levels rouphael et al 2008 the water use efficiency improved as the as proportion increased the values being 4 0 4 2 4 1 4 3 and 4 5 kg m3 for treatments 100ns 75ns 25as 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as respectively 3 2 biometric parameters no differences between treatments with respect to the leaf and stem petiole dry matter were found fig 2 nevertheless applying the fish wastewater solution increased root dry weight by up to 24 treatment with 25 as improved plant development in terms of greater flower dry weight and the number of flowers shoot and leaves figs 2 and 3 and tables 2 4 however we observed no differences between the 100 ns 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100 as treatments in flower dry weight and leaf and shoot numbers treatment with 25 as increased the number of flowers by 28 compared to the control no differences were found between treatments in terms of water content leaf area and plant height fig 4 table 5 and 6 in the domain of efficient agriculture the root shoot of plants has become an important issue delaide et al 2016 regarding the plant root shoot dry ratio we observed an increase in this parameter when the fish wastewater percentage increased fig 5 a this being higher 26 when 100 as was applied compared to the control treatment related to this the root shoot dry weight ratio and the fish wastewater percentage showed a good correlation r2 0 88 fig 5b in foliage plants one of the fundamental quality parameters is leaf color the munsell chart was used to define color for all the treatments at the end of the assay the leaves were identified as 5gy 4 4 for color value and chroma respectively table 7 3 3 nutritional status the n and ca concentrations in the leaves were within the range described by marschner 2012 however the k mg and p concentrations in the leaves were slightly lower than the levels described by marschner 2012 no visual nutrient deficiency symptom was seen since we observed no differences in leaf color between treatments nonetheless the macronutrients in the leaves differed between treatments the n concentration in the leaves showed no significant differences in the treatments with 0 25 50 and 75 as however the 100 as treatment decreased the nitrogen concentration in the leaves by 14 the k concentration in the leaves decreased significantly when plants were irrigated with the wastewater solution with 100 as the potassium concentration in leaf reduced by 36 compared to the control this decrease in k in the leaves is associated with a reduction of these elements in the nutrient solution nevertheless despite there being a decrease in ca in the nutrient solution no differences in the calcium concentration were found between treatments the p concentration differed between treatments but no clear effect on the treatments from this parameter was found this was higher in the 100ns 25ns 75as and 100as treatments in the leaves the mg concentration was significantly higher in the 25 as treatment after this we observed a decrease in this parameter no differences between the control and the 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as were observed fig 6 4 discussion previous works have reported on the productivity of aquaponics systems rakocy et al 2006 however scant research has been carried out on double recirculating aquaponic systems one that has a study on tomato in double recirculating aquaponic systems stands out in which similar yields to those from conventional hydroponics were obtained suhl et al 2016 kloas et al 2015 in this study the result confirmed that fish wastewater can be employed for fertigation because there was no effect on the leaves stems petiole dry matter water content plant height or leaf area the application of 25 fish wastewater improved plant development in terms of a greater number of flowers shoots and leaves additionally root growth was positively influenced by fish wastewater despite the relatively low mg and k supply in these treatments low mg and k supply can significantly reduce root growth marschner 2012 this positive effect in both aquaponic and complemented aquaponic treatments compared to hydroponic treatment indicates that this water must contain factors that stimulate plant growth we can assume that two factors having a plant growth promoting effect are present in recirculating aquaculture system water 1 dissolved organic matter and 2 plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and or fungi delaide et al 2016 humic acid like fulvic acid and certain phenolics that tend to accumulate in recirculating aquaculture system water can increase shoot and root growth as well as root atpase activity delaide et al 2016 directly absorbed and assimilated by plants these compounds stimulate growth enhance yields as well as increase vitamin and mineral content rakocy et al 2006 additionally aquaponic solutions include algae of which chlorella sp is the most abundant species addy et al 2017 but also other species such as navicula sp scenedesmus sp and aphanizomenon sp the growth promoting effects of seaweed are related to the direct or indirect effect of the phytohormones present in the algae battacharyya et al 2015 in addition plant growth promoting rhizobacteria have also been identified as being able to promote plant growth and improve root development plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can release phytohormones or induce hormonal changes within plants which stimulate plant cell elongation and division schmautz et al 2017 examined the microbial communities within an experimental aquaponic system the majority in the plant roots were assigned to the predominate phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and cyanobacteria schmautz et al 2017 the rhizosphere microbiome affects plant growth by excreting plant hormones qiao et al 2017 in particular cyanobacteria produce a wide array of compounds such as amino acids auxins gibberellins and cytokines singh et al 2014 which are known to play crucial roles in plant development ph is a key factor for plant growth because it can limit nutrient availability in aquaponic solution ph is maintained at an average value of 7 4 and this is considered to be high for a hydroponic system rakocy et al 2004 the optimal ph for geraniums is 6 0 6 6 in this case the irrigation solution was prepared in an independent tank by adding nitrate acid we could control this parameter and avoid any possible ph effects on plant growth fish effluent can complement or even substitute the use of fertilizers for vegetable production endut et al 2016 in closed recirculating systems with very little daily water exchange less than 2 dissolved nutrients accumulate in concentrations similar to those in hydroponic nutrient solutions rakocy et al 2006 aquacultural effluent typically supplies 10 of the 13 required plant nutrients in adequate amounts with only ca k and fe needing supplementation rakocy et al 2004 in the present study high concentrations of p n and ca in the nutrient solution were observed in all the treatments fish wastewater contains these essential nutrients through fish excretion the feed supplied n p and the ca content in the fresh water used for fish production aquatic species such as fish consume only 20 50 of the n and 15 65 of the p from the feed supplied and about 50 80 of the n and 35 85 of the p are released into the wastewater schneider et al 2005 as with previous studies the ammonium concentration in the fish wastewater solution in this study was very low the total ammonia ammonium level should be controlled at less than 3 ppm addy et al 2017 nitrification is a biological process that maintains water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems and has been shown to transform 93 to 96 of nitrogenous fish waste ammonia nitrogen nh3 n into nitrate no3 n tyson et al 2017 however despite the fish waste solution being mixed with a hydroponic nutrient solution the mean k concentration in the nutrient solution 0 80 0 91 and 2 23 mmol l 1 for 100as 25ns 75as and 50ns 50as respectively was above the optimum level required by this crop and was reflected in a low k leaf concentration nevertheless no detrimental effects on plant growth or development were observed compared to the standard nutrient solution treatment aquaponic systems that rely solely on fish waste to supply nutrients for plants have reported low potassium levels tyson et al 2017 this is because potassium is not added to fish feed as it is not needed by the fish hence it doesn t enter the system graber and junge 2009 even though the mg concentration in the nutrient solution decreased from 1 00 to 0 34 mmol l 1due to the low concentration of this ion in the as we observed no differences in mg concentration in the leaves between 100 sn and 100 as the reasons for this high nutrient uptake are the significant increases in root volume shaaban 2001 and because aquaculture system water must contain factors that stimulate this uptake delaide et al 2016 the initial k and mg content in the irrigation solution of the 100 as treatment was sufficient for plant growth pelargonium has a short growing cycle to provide complete plant nutrition in long growing cycles plants external nutrients probably need to be supplied the 25 fish wastewater provided the best results in terms of plant development given that most of the growth parameters improved when compared to the control inorganic fertilizers the positive effect of fish wastewater in promoting plant growth and the similar concentration of nutrients in the nutrient solution compared to the control explains the good results from this treatment therefore using 25 fish wastewater is the best proportion for promoting pelargonium growth however as no detrimental effects on plant growth or development were observed in the other treatments compared to the sn treatment other proportion can also be used from the point of view of reducing the potable water and fertilizer consumption 100 of as is the best proportion for plant growth the data from this assay will allow growers to choose the best proportion to apply during crop development based on the price and availability of the sources fish waste solution and inorganic fertilizer 5 conclusions the results obtained confirm that fish wastewater can be utilized for the fertigation of pelargonium zonale in a short cycle crop as it has no detrimental effect on plant growth or development root growth was positively influenced by the fish waste solution using 25 fish wastewater enhanced yields and improved most of the ornamental quality parameters of pelargonium zonale compared to inorganic fertilizers the fish waste solution can supply adequate levels of n p and ca nutrients to pelargonium plants thus reducing the cost of fertilizers even though no visual deficiencies appeared when a high concentration of fish waste solution was used there was a depletion in the k leaf concentration future research should be conducted to study the influence of the presence of hormones and micronutrients in this wastewater on plant growth acknowledgements the authors are grateful to alberto cremades granjas piscícolas del sur for supplying the wastewater and for his invaluable comments

analysis of variance one way anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd test performed using statgraphics centurion xvi ii statpoint technologies inc warrenton virginia usa differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 nutrient solution and water use efficiency table 1 shows the means of the ph ec and nutrient concentration for the nutrient solution the ph for all the treatments was 6 5 6 6 the ec decreased with the increase in fish wastewater percentage due to the reduced nutrient inputs in this water n p and ca which had means of 6 57 0 46 and 2 08 mmol l 1 respectively in the treatment with 100 fish waste solution had e optimal values for bedding plant growth the phosphorous concentration in the nutrient solution was similar in all the treatments however increasing the fish wastewater percentage led to an increase in the amount of sulphate while decreasing k and mg concentrations the values for k and mg in the nutrient solution for 100 as were 0 80 and 0 34 mmol l 1 respectively which were above optimum levels rouphael et al 2008 the water use efficiency improved as the as proportion increased the values being 4 0 4 2 4 1 4 3 and 4 5 kg m3 for treatments 100ns 75ns 25as 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as respectively 3 2 biometric parameters no differences between treatments with respect to the leaf and stem petiole dry matter were found fig 2 nevertheless applying the fish wastewater solution increased root dry weight by up to 24 treatment with 25 as improved plant development in terms of greater flower dry weight and the number of flowers shoot and leaves figs 2 and 3 and tables 2 4 however we observed no differences between the 100 ns 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100 as treatments in flower dry weight and leaf and shoot numbers treatment with 25 as increased the number of flowers by 28 compared to the control no differences were found between treatments in terms of water content leaf area and plant height fig 4 table 5 and 6 in the domain of efficient agriculture the root shoot of plants has become an important issue delaide et al 2016 regarding the plant root shoot dry ratio we observed an increase in this parameter when the fish wastewater percentage increased fig 5 a this being higher 26 when 100 as was applied compared to the control treatment related to this the root shoot dry weight ratio and the fish wastewater percentage showed a good correlation r2 0 88 fig 5b in foliage plants one of the fundamental quality parameters is leaf color the munsell chart was used to define color for all the treatments at the end of the assay the leaves were identified as 5gy 4 4 for color value and chroma respectively table 7 3 3 nutritional status the n and ca concentrations in the leaves were within the range described by marschner 2012 however the k mg and p concentrations in the leaves were slightly lower than the levels described by marschner 2012 no visual nutrient deficiency symptom was seen since we observed no differences in leaf color between treatments nonetheless the macronutrients in the leaves differed between treatments the n concentration in the leaves showed no significant differences in the treatments with 0 25 50 and 75 as however the 100 as treatment decreased the nitrogen concentration in the leaves by 14 the k concentration in the leaves decreased significantly when plants were irrigated with the wastewater solution with 100 as the potassium concentration in leaf reduced by 36 compared to the control this decrease in k in the leaves is associated with a reduction of these elements in the nutrient solution nevertheless despite there being a decrease in ca in the nutrient solution no differences in the calcium concentration were found between treatments the p concentration differed between treatments but no clear effect on the treatments from this parameter was found this was higher in the 100ns 25ns 75as and 100as treatments in the leaves the mg concentration was significantly higher in the 25 as treatment after this we observed a decrease in this parameter no differences between the control and the 50ns 50as 25ns 75as and 100as were observed fig 6 4 discussion previous works have reported on the productivity of aquaponics systems rakocy et al 2006 however scant research has been carried out on double recirculating aquaponic systems one that has a study on tomato in double recirculating aquaponic systems stands out in which similar yields to those from conventional hydroponics were obtained suhl et al 2016 kloas et al 2015 in this study the result confirmed that fish wastewater can be employed for fertigation because there was no effect on the leaves stems petiole dry matter water content plant height or leaf area the application of 25 fish wastewater improved plant development in terms of a greater number of flowers shoots and leaves additionally root growth was positively influenced by fish wastewater despite the relatively low mg and k supply in these treatments low mg and k supply can significantly reduce root growth marschner 2012 this positive effect in both aquaponic and complemented aquaponic treatments compared to hydroponic treatment indicates that this water must contain factors that stimulate plant growth we can assume that two factors having a plant growth promoting effect are present in recirculating aquaculture system water 1 dissolved organic matter and 2 plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and or fungi delaide et al 2016 humic acid like fulvic acid and certain phenolics that tend to accumulate in recirculating aquaculture system water can increase shoot and root growth as well as root atpase activity delaide et al 2016 directly absorbed and assimilated by plants these compounds stimulate growth enhance yields as well as increase vitamin and mineral content rakocy et al 2006 additionally aquaponic solutions include algae of which chlorella sp is the most abundant species addy et al 2017 but also other species such as navicula sp scenedesmus sp and aphanizomenon sp the growth promoting effects of seaweed are related to the direct or indirect effect of the phytohormones present in the algae battacharyya et al 2015 in addition plant growth promoting rhizobacteria have also been identified as being able to promote plant growth and improve root development plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can release phytohormones or induce hormonal changes within plants which stimulate plant cell elongation and division schmautz et al 2017 examined the microbial communities within an experimental aquaponic system the majority in the plant roots were assigned to the predominate phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and cyanobacteria schmautz et al 2017 the rhizosphere microbiome affects plant growth by excreting plant hormones qiao et al 2017 in particular cyanobacteria produce a wide array of compounds such as amino acids auxins gibberellins and cytokines singh et al 2014 which are known to play crucial roles in plant development ph is a key factor for plant growth because it can limit nutrient availability in aquaponic solution ph is maintained at an average value of 7 4 and this is considered to be high for a hydroponic system rakocy et al 2004 the optimal ph for geraniums is 6 0 6 6 in this case the irrigation solution was prepared in an independent tank by adding nitrate acid we could control this parameter and avoid any possible ph effects on plant growth fish effluent can complement or even substitute the use of fertilizers for vegetable production endut et al 2016 in closed recirculating systems with very little daily water exchange less than 2 dissolved nutrients accumulate in concentrations similar to those in hydroponic nutrient solutions rakocy et al 2006 aquacultural effluent typically supplies 10 of the 13 required plant nutrients in adequate amounts with only ca k and fe needing supplementation rakocy et al 2004 in the present study high concentrations of p n and ca in the nutrient solution were observed in all the treatments fish wastewater contains these essential nutrients through fish excretion the feed supplied n p and the ca content in the fresh water used for fish production aquatic species such as fish consume only 20 50 of the n and 15 65 of the p from the feed supplied and about 50 80 of the n and 35 85 of the p are released into the wastewater schneider et al 2005 as with previous studies the ammonium concentration in the fish wastewater solution in this study was very low the total ammonia ammonium level should be controlled at less than 3 ppm addy et al 2017 nitrification is a biological process that maintains water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems and has been shown to transform 93 to 96 of nitrogenous fish waste ammonia nitrogen nh3 n into nitrate no3 n tyson et al 2017 however despite the fish waste solution being mixed with a hydroponic nutrient solution the mean k concentration in the nutrient solution 0 80 0 91 and 2 23 mmol l 1 for 100as 25ns 75as and 50ns 50as respectively was above the optimum level required by this crop and was reflected in a low k leaf concentration nevertheless no detrimental effects on plant growth or development were observed compared to the standard nutrient solution treatment aquaponic systems that rely solely on fish waste to supply nutrients for plants have reported low potassium levels tyson et al 2017 this is because potassium is not added to fish feed as it is not needed by the fish hence it doesn t enter the system graber and junge 2009 even though the mg concentration in the nutrient solution decreased from 1 00 to 0 34 mmol l 1due to the low concentration of this ion in the as we observed no differences in mg concentration in the leaves between 100 sn and 100 as the reasons for this high nutrient uptake are the significant increases in root volume shaaban 2001 and because aquaculture system water must contain factors that stimulate this uptake delaide et al 2016 the initial k and mg content in the irrigation solution of the 100 as treatment was sufficient for plant growth pelargonium has a short growing cycle to provide complete plant nutrition in long growing cycles plants external nutrients probably need to be supplied the 25 fish wastewater provided the best results in terms of plant development given that most of the growth parameters improved when compared to the control inorganic fertilizers the positive effect of fish wastewater in promoting plant growth and the similar concentration of nutrients in the nutrient solution compared to the control explains the good results from this treatment therefore using 25 fish wastewater is the best proportion for promoting pelargonium growth however as no detrimental effects on plant growth or development were observed in the other treatments compared to the sn treatment other proportion can also be used from the point of view of reducing the potable water and fertilizer consumption 100 of as is the best proportion for plant growth the data from this assay will allow growers to choose the best proportion to apply during crop development based on the price and availability of the sources fish waste solution and inorganic fertilizer 5 conclusions the results obtained confirm that fish wastewater can be utilized for the fertigation of pelargonium zonale in a short cycle crop as it has no detrimental effect on plant growth or development root growth was positively influenced by the fish waste solution using 25 fish wastewater enhanced yields and improved most of the ornamental quality parameters of pelargonium zonale compared to inorganic fertilizers the fish waste solution can supply adequate levels of n p and ca nutrients to pelargonium plants thus reducing the cost of fertilizers even though no visual deficiencies appeared when a high concentration of fish waste solution was used there was a depletion in the k leaf concentration future research should be conducted to study the influence of the presence of hormones and micronutrients in this wastewater on plant growth acknowledgements the authors are grateful to alberto cremades granjas piscícolas del sur for supplying the wastewater and for his invaluable comments

dedicated to produce tools taking into account the management of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in this section characteristics and pros and cons of some of the most popular conjunctive use modeling tools are presented we then discuss the criteria used to integrate a proper tool into the freewat platform for joint management of conjunctive use and crop growth such criteria took into account the approach used to represent the spatial and temporal dimension of the groundwater component including the unsaturated zone but also the availability of detailed documentation and the free and open source characteristics of the code this is a cornerstone for making available to the scientific and professional community a robust well tested and relatively easy to use tool to plan and to manage the water resource and for raising awareness on the importance of rural water management to the authors knowledge among the most recent and widely used codes for water resource management in rural environments the best known is swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 it is a public domain physically based lumped code developed to simulate a number of different physical processes hydrology erosion and sediment yield crop growth nutrient cycling in order to predict the impact of land management practices even in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods of time using swat the whole catchment is divided into several sub basins connected through the surface water network each sub basin in turn is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus according to land use soil type and the occurrence of specific agricultural practices based on meteorological data and information related to soil and crop properties the model computes water budget components separately for each hru these components include rain infiltration through the unsaturated zone surface runoff and evapotranspiration along with crop water storage based on the leaf area index lai of a specific crop type hrus are discrete entities introduced to approximate the system s behavior where all the budget terms are computed at the outlet of a hru the results cannot provide information on water abstraction and use within the spatial domain of the hru water budgets evaluated for each hru are then simply summed to get a water balance at the scale of the whole catchment the swat model has been extensively used worldwide al soufi et al 2006 huang et al 2009 hunink et al 2013 jacobs et al 2007 pikounis et al 2003 romanowicz et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 and it has a large community of users as testified by the swat web site dedicated sections swat 2018 gis integrated interfaces for swat are also available e g arcswat winchell et al 2013 and qswat dile et al 2015 2016 swat conceives groundwater sources and sinks by means of a shallow and a deep aquifer the shallow aquifer is unconfined and it contributes to flow in the main channels of the hru while the deep aquifer is confined and water entering the deep aquifer is assumed to contribute to streamflow somewhere outside the watershed neitsch et al 2002 as a consequence the deep aquifer does not contribute to the streamflow within the watershed for this reason non linearities related to groundwater processes cannot be adequately reproduced as only one active groundwater storage i e the shallow aquifer is considered pfannerstill et al 2014 this may result in a very high recharge of the shallow aquifer so that overestimation of discharge may occur causing improper representation of low flow periods see e g guse et al 2013 koch et al 2013 groundwater recharge to both shallow and deep aquifers is calculated using an exponential decay function representing the delay time of recharge due to geologic formations groundwater discharge from the shallow aquifer to surface streams is estimated depending on an empirical parameter the base flow recession constant which measures groundwater flow response to changes in recharge however use of this empirical parameter is made without consideration of the governing physical processes hydraulic conductivity parameter and hydraulic gradient finally as all the calculations are performed at the outlet of each hru analysis on potential impacts of groundwater abstractions on groundwater head due to large withdrawal and then groundwater availability are not feasible in order to better account for the groundwater component a further extension of swat resulted in multiple attempts to couple the swat and modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 harbaugh 2005 models for a more comprehensive watershed simulation galbiati et al 2006 kim et al 2008 menking et al 2003 perkins and sophocleus 1999 modflow is a public domain code widely used for dealing with groundwater management issues at different scales see e g davison and lerner 2000 ebraheem et al 2004 it is a physically based spatially distributed code which allows simulating three dimensional groundwater flow through a saturated porous medium by using a finite difference method these swat modflow coupling efforts not usually available to the general public are typically monthly based with spatial restrictions for the two models wible 2014 as further example of coupling bailey 2015 presented the swat modflow model where the link between swat and modflow is guaranteed through an approach consisting of downscaling hrus in modflow cells in the swat modflow code each swat hru is intersected with the modflow grid and modflow is called as a subroutine thus replacing the original swat groundwater subroutines to compute cumulative cell by cell evapotranspiration from shallow aquifers etgw however even for cell by cell downscaled hrus a scale incompatibility issue remains that uniform root zone or crop type parameters used over an hru to calculate distributed etgw while uniform percolation is applied to a distributed groundwater table examples of applications of the newly developed swat modflow model can be found in bailey et al 2016 2017 chunn et al 2019 sith et al 2019 wei and bailey 2017 2018 research in this area is however ongoing as shown in bieger et al 2017 another program resulting from the combination of existing physically based spatially distributed models is simgro simulation of groundwater van walsum et al 2010 an arcgis based model integrating metaswap van walsum and groenendijk 2008 for the unsaturated zone and modflow for the regional groundwater flow simgro links these different compartments by means of flux and storativity exchanges its model input needs various hydrological data such as meteorological data land use soil types watercourse trajectories and weirs similarly to swat in simgro a catchment is divided in sub catchments according to land use and soil units such schematization is then combined with modflow discretization grid cells and each sub catchment is connected with surface water through a network of watercourse trajectories soil atmosphere interactions are the drivers of the regional water system and are guaranteed through estimation of infiltration and evapotranspiration simulation of soil water dynamics is assumed to occur in the vertical direction only and it is estimated by discretizing the unsaturated zone in three control boxes the root zone the shallow subsoil and the deep subsoil whose boundary with groundwater is represented by the phreatic level simgro further includes several flexible options for simulating the impact of water management also in areas other than rural ones but it is especially suited for modeling contexts with shallow groundwater levels in relatively flat areas like in delta regions van walsum et al 2010 the gis integrated weap water evaluation and planning yates et al 2005 node based code allows to calculate crop demand and water supply under different hydrogeological and political scenarios dynamically integrating infiltration and runoff components a graphical user interface gui allows for import export of gis layers in the weap code upper and lower irrigation thresholds are assigned to irrigated land cover fractions in a sub catchment such thresholds are used to dictate both the timing and quantity of water for irrigation as crop evapotranspiration and percolation deplete the available water from the upper zone storage surface and ground water are dynamically linked through a stream aquifer interaction module a program mainly resulting from the combination of existing simulation codes is the gis integrated sid grid platform rossetto et al 2010 2013 developed within the gis gvsig anguix and díaz 2008 the sid grid is a fully distributed and physically based hydrological model coupling 3d existing and newly developed codes for simulating surface and ground water and flow through the unsaturated zone it allows the calculation of hydrological variables such as surface runoff hydraulic head soil moisture evapotranspiration rate interception rate in space and time in sid grid the modflow local grid refinement capability lgr mehl and hill 2005 was extended to the modflow variably saturated flow vsf process thoms et al 2006 which solves the 3d richards equation in order to allow detailed analysis of the unsaturated zone in irrigation areas borsi et al 2013 within these areas the vsf package can be applied to precisely describe the boundaries so that also specific processes like roots uptake ponding events and seepage flows can be successfully considered it must be however noticed that in applying vsf a large number of parameters not always available has to be input a further tool for analyzing conjunctive water use in rural areas is the farm process fmp schmid et al 2006 schmid and hanson 2009b embedded in modflow one water hydrologic flow model modflow owhm hanson et al 2014 the latter is a fully coupled hydrologic model to dynamically estimate the integrated supply and demand components of irrigated agriculture as part of the simulation of surface and ground water flow including head dependent inflows and outflows such as canal losses and gains surface runoff surface water return flows evaporation transpiration and deep percolation of excess water landscape water balances calculated by fmp involve basic units of water consumption i e model sub regions initially called farms schmid 2004 schmid et al 2006 schmid and hanson 2009a 2009b while maintaining the grid spatial discretization for which irrigation water demand surface and ground water supply runoff and deep percolation are dynamically integrated after integration of fmp into owhm this definition advanced to water budget sub regions wbs that include regions other than irrigated agricultural farms hanson et al 2014 which can include non irrigated farms natural vegetation urban areas or managed aquifer recharge mar systems in fmp root uptake is simulated for groundwater levels above the bottom of the root zone under unsaturated or variably saturated conditions demand and supply components of water use are analysed under demand driven and supply constrained conditions this means that for irrigated conditions the irrigation delivery requirements crop irrigation demand increased sufficiently to compensate for inefficient losses and for non irrigated conditions urban water demands or mar percolation requirements drive the supply from various components non routed deliveries surface water deliveries and supplemental groundwater abstraction which in turn can be constrained by natural engineering or water policy constraints similarly to swat and swat modflow fmp includes the possibility to route water supplies towards water accounting units through surface irrigation channels fmp also takes into account optimal allocations of water from an economic point of view when demand exceeds supply and possible limits to groundwater supply due to groundwater rights fmp has been successfully applied to a series of case studies a small scale hydrological model of the southern rincon valley new mexico usa illustrated for the first time how fmp can simulate un metered historic pumpage for real world family farms driven crop consumptive use impacts of surface and ground water abstraction on the lower rio grande lrg stream and return flow and scenarios of changing allotments influence deliveries and downstream stream gains losses schmid et al 2009 a regional integrated hydrologic model using fmp was developed for the lrg as part of the us mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program of the usgs using modflow fmp hanson et al 2013 and further developed to include non agricultural land use to extend into mexico and the model s boundary conditions to be informed by a transboundary rio grande watershed model rio grande transboundary integrated hydrologic model using owhm rgtihm hanson et al 2018 modflow owhm and fmp have been also applied for a detailed assessment of groundwater availability of the central valley aquifer system developing a hydrological model coupled with forecasts from global climate models and including efficient updates using remotely sensed data and gis tools faunt et al 2009 a regional hydrological flow model was also developed for the cuyama valley to quantify groundwater availability under varying cropping systems and climatic scenarios to inform regional stakeholders about potential constraints on water supply availability hanson et al 2015 for these models the water demand and use of each wbs was driven by the potential crop evapotranspiration of virtual crop types i e groups of similar crops from land use maps calculated internally as products of associated virtual composite crop coefficients and reference evapotranspiration in conclusion among the various conjunctive use software package modflow owhm and fmp were chosen to be integrated within the freewat platform modflow owhm and fmp were found most suitable to simulate and manage conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater for irrigation purposes in combination with a fully explicit spatially distributed representation of the groundwater and unsaturated zone components after the successful integration of modflow owhm and fmp into freewat the remaining component for the management of water in agriculture is a crop growth module cgm that is linked to the water cycle among the above mentioned codes only swat and simgro integrate a crop module in order to estimate crop water uptake the swat code and its derivations use a crop module based on the epic plant growth model williams et al 1989 a generic model which simulates radiation interception and conversion into biomass above ground biomass accumulation and economic yield root growth water use and nutrient uptake simgro uses instead the wofost crop growth model van diepen et al 1989 which has similar features than epic although some plant processes are described in more detail on one hand this latter approach represents an increase in model robustness but on the other the number of parameters required to simulate a crop is much higher this can constitute a limit along with increased computational cost to simulate a high number of parameters to its use in the context of water basin or regional simulations with many different crops the weap does not incorporate any crop growth model and fmp prior to cgm linkage was very limited fmp calculates actual crop consumptive use based on a reduction of potential crop evapotranspiration by conditions of wilting and anoxia and evaporative losses but makes assumptions such as a steady state soil moisture over each modflow time step depths of the effective root zone to be constant over a modflow time step and does not calculate biomass fmp can indeed calculate yield based on water production functions but does not relate yield to biomass accumulation time variable root depths can be calculated in fmp from time series of climate data tmin tmax and crop specific coefficients coefficients for growing degree day calculation polynomial coefficients and coefficients for root depth calculation schmid et al 2006 however the issue with this approach is that this option only allows to read time variable but spatially lumped climate data and crop specific coefficients that is this approach can only be used for small scale models where spatial variability can be ignored a comparison of the discussed conjunctive use models is given in table 1 which is in part based on a water resources software review of the world bank wb borden et al 2016 however as the objective was to include such code into the open source freewat platform we only included open source codes into our comparison table alongside with two proprietary software packages gssha wms aquaveo 2019 mike she dhi 2019 modflow owhm was ranked by the wb as the only open source code as among the three most suitable for integrated surface and ground water simulations required for conjunctive management modflow owhm was found to be most suitable for integration into freewat for the simulation and management of conjunctive use however a specific module for crop growth modeling had yet be coupled to fmp in freewat with the goal of connecting the simulation of processes related to water availability to those related to crop water demand and yield the purpose is to perform predictions about crop yield at farm and basin scale under different climatic and water supply constraints a review of existing codes for crop growth modeling was performed according to criteria such as availability of detailed software documentation general usability characteristics technical capabilities and simulation features the cgm based on the epic family models gassman et al 2005 2007 2009 williams and singh 1995 williams et al 1989 was considered to be the most suitable choice among free and open available models to simulate crop growth code availability and model documentation were considered as fundamental requirements while carrying out this review since both requirements were not fully fulfilled for aquacrop fao 2012 stics brisson et al 1998 and apsim mccown et al 1996 at the time of code integration these models were not taken into account wofost boogaard et al 2014 and swap kroes et al 2008 showed to have three important drawbacks a they need a high number of crop specific parameters b they require hourly radiation data and c crop water uptake refers to the whole root zone thus differences in soil moisture at different depths are ignored leading to potential overestimation or underestimation of readily available soil water for crop growth based on the above the epic model and specifically the cgm seemed to be the most preferable choice to simulate crop growth this coupling approach is also detailed in this paper 3 materials and methods 3 1 coupling of fmp with cgm and integration in freewat the qgis integrated freewat platform constitutes an effort to support and improve watershed research and decision making in water resource management it allows the simulation of the whole hydrological cycle using open source numerical codes mainly belonging to the usgs modflow family such as modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and owhm hanson et al 2014 as such the freewat platform is conceived as a canvas where many simulation codes based on the hydrological cycle might be virtually integrated as shown in fig 1 the freewat platform is implemented as a composite plugin in qgis qgis development team 2009 and it takes advantage of spatialite spatialite development team 2011 as a geodatabase management system pre processing tools and flopy flopy 2016 as reference python library to connect the gui to native modflow based hydrological codes and to post process models results data processing and simulation capabilities are described in details in criollo et al 2019 and rossetto et al 2018 among the simulation codes fmp is integrated in the freewat platform in order to deal with conjunctive use of surface and ground water in the rural environment as fmp along with other owhm specific packages are not considered in flopy a specific python object has been developed for the flopy library compliant with format and standard of the existing library furthermore in coupling cgm to fmp and integrating them in freewat emphasis was placed on the development of simple but robust tools to be used in regional scale studies thus keeping low the number of parameters needed the coupling of cgm to fmp within freewat was coded in python independently on the flopy library the gui window to set up an fmp scenario is shown in fig 2 and the available sub menus are organized so the user can easily follow the workflow reported in fig 3 such workflow is briefly explained in the following a detailed description of fmp conceptualization can be found in hanson et al 2014 the basic concept in fmp is the farm or more in general what the freewat gui calls the water demand unit wdu namely a model sub region made by a cluster of grid cells of the top model layer requiring water for cropping systems rural areas natural vegetation areas etc thus the entire finite difference grid is classified in one or more wdus by assigning to each cell a farm id such classification can be made by means of polygon shapefiles previously created taking advantage of gis selection tools the user then defines parameters for each wdu e g soil characteristics crop parameters and a total water demand is input or computed according to the terms listed below crop water demand is computed as evapotranspiration representing the target crop consumptive use to meet in fmp crop is also used to represent any non irrigated water consumptive land use types urban environment natural vegetation riparian areas water bodies etc then defined as virtual crops hanson et al 2014 municipal and industrial urban water demand can be specified as negative supplies specified as negative non routed deliveries see later on with reference to fig 3 at first crop water demand is attempted to be met by precipitation and natural uptake from groundwater any unfulfilled residual crop water demand is calculated as crop irrigation requirement cir and increased by the on farm inefficiency losses ofe specific to the irrigation method or the farm operation which results in a total farm delivery requirement tfdr for each wdu at each stress period fmp attempts to satisfy the tfdr with one or more supply components according to the following ranking 1st priority by water transfer to a wdu from known types of water sources e g canal pipeline transfers trucked shipped in water e g for islands aquifer storage and recovery wellfields recycled waste water without simulating the process of conveyance i e non routed deliveries 2nd priority by water transfer to a wdu directly from an irrigation canal or lateral directly to an automatically detected farm head gate fully routed deliveries mainly for small scale applications with simulation of routing to the farm or through a surface water network specifying diversion points from the main channel semi routed deliveries mainly for regional scale models that do not simulate routing to farms the streamflow routing network i e the main irrigation canal and the surface water network is simulated through the streamflow routing package sfr of modflow niswonger and prudic 2005 diversion points from a channel belonging to the streamflow routing network to a specific wdu need to be defined as part of fmp data input 3rd priority groundwater pumping farm wells the user also has the possibility to specify constraints on surface water and groundwater withdrawals e g surface water or groundwater allotments or maximum well capacities once the model is run water demand and supply components are computed for each time step and the code compares the two terms a deficit scenario can occur if the demand is greater than supply fig 3 in this case the code allows estimating optimal distributions of supply components either from surface or ground water bodies to cope with this deficit at the end of the simulation a specific budget for each wdu is produced in addition to the global budget for the entire model cgm is a radiation based model meaning that the growth process is driven by intercepted radiation converted into above ground biomass using a radiation use efficiency rue coefficient other processes involved in simulating biomass accumulation are crop phenology and canopy development these processes are affected by weather variables i e air temperature solar radiation and crop specific characteristics water uptake is not estimated by cgm as it is computed by fmp thus cgm estimates potential plant growth based on solar radiation only the following section illustrates how cgm and fmp are coupled in order to estimate the actual crop growth as affected by water availability in the unsaturated zone 3 2 coupling rural water management fmp and crop growth modeling cgm fig 4 shows the conceptual coupling between fmp and cgm cgm requires few input data crop specific parameters time series of air temperature and solar radiation right side of fig 4 in order to get potential crop yield at harvest potential crop yield in fig 4 on the other hand input data needed to run fmp left side of fig 4 are crop dependent parameters basically related to assess the water uptake soil related hydrologic parameters depth of the capillary fringe climate data precipitation and reference evapotranspiration starting from time series of reference evapotranspiration et0 in fig 4 such data are used to compute time series of potential crop evapotranspiration etc in fig 4 using crop coefficients as proportionality constants allen et al 1998 fractions of transpiration and evaporation split the etc into time series of potential crop transpiration tc pot and evaporation ec pot the actual transpiration would equal the potential transpiration if the entire root zone was active but it is reduced if the active root zone is restricted by wilting or anoxia water stress data in fig 4 wilting is caused by conditions of intolerably dry conditions for certain crops water deficit in fig 4 anoxia is caused by conditions of near saturation resulting in the lack of oxygen water excess in fig 4 note that this is related to deficit or to excess in relation to water in the root zone and not to deficit irrigation scenarios or excess non routed deliveries in fmp not discussed here which address the supply components insufficient to satisfy or in excess of the irrigation delivery requirement respectively the maximum possible actual transpiration tc act max in fig 4 in fmp is defined as the transpiration from the entire root zone only reduced by the anoxia fringe on top of the groundwater level when coinciding with the bottom of the root zone soil column experiments conducted with hydrus schmid et al 2006 indicate that indeed the entire root zone is never 100 active and full tc pot can never be reached this tc act max can then be further reduced to the actual transpiration tc act in fig 4 by conditions of wilting in the top soil or when the groundwater level rises into the root zone eventually eliminating the entire active root zone the coupling between cgm and fmp is guaranteed through variables tc act and tc act max schmid et al 2006 needed as input data to cgm to adjust potential crop yield and to get the actual crop yield at harvest actual crop yield in fig 4 cgm is run sequentially after fmp and all over the growing season of the crop from seeding to harvest this is done for one or more crops defined in fmp scenario previously set and run for each crop the user has to input the seeding and harvesting dates and parameters related to crop phenology climate data air temperature and solar radiation are further needed on a daily basis in order to properly represent all the growing stages for each crop type table 2 as such the requirement to run cgm is that the length of the modflow simulation must cover at least the growing periods of each crop type and that daily stress periods must be defined also cgm is not grid based as all the needed input data table 2 except from crop id and crop name are time dependent only as such values for tc act and tc act max which are calculated by fmp at each grid cell and at the end of each stress period are averaged over the area where each crop is cultivated in order to get a time series for each crop type the complete set of algebraic equations solved by cgm is reported in de filippis et al 2019 such equations are divided in two sets the first set of equations is related to estimate potential crop yield at harvest i e provided that optimal conditions of water sufficiency occur to this aim the role of temperature on crop growth rate is assessed through evaluating the daily accumulation of heat based on temperature data this is then used to calculate the potential leaf area index the potential leaf area index is needed along with solar radiation to get a daily amount of crop intercepted photosynthetically active radiation which is finally converted into a potential above ground biomass agbpot under optimal water conditions agbpot is a time dependent variable whose value at the end of the simulation i e at harvest is needed to get the crop yield at harvest yh in a second set of algebraic equations variables tc act the actual crop transpiration requirement and tc act max the maximum actual crop transpiration are used to get the actual above ground biomass agbact and the actual crop yield at harvest yact which are nothing but agbpot and yh limited by the amount of water uptake by introducing a daily water stress factor 3 3 example application the coupling approach shown in fig 4 and so far described is demonstrated through a simple synthetic application the example reported in schmid et al 2006 was adapted to set up a real world case study using climatic data from central italy from january 1st to december 31st 2017 the cgm was then coupled to this fmp scenario to get sunflower yield at harvest under the specific water availability conditions the study area 115 km2 wide is discretized through 460 square cells with 500 m side length the simulated domain includes three wdus fig 5 an irrigation district with sunflower crops 925 ha wdu1 an urban area with irrigated green spaces amenity grasses 775 ha wdu2 a rainfed grassland wdu is defined at the remaining cells wdu3 groundwater is hosted in a sandy aquifer represented through a single homogeneous convertible model layer with thickness ranging from 277 m to 300 m groundwater flow occurs from west to east fig 6 a boundary conditions and source sink terms are represented in fig 6a where the hydraulic head simulated at the beginning of the sunflower cropping season april 1st 2017 is reported as well a main canal crosses the area from west to east water is diverted at two points by means of two secondary irrigation channels running around the irrigation district and the urban area at wdu1 the irrigation district a semi routed surface water delivery is set from the secondary channel drain channels potentially drain high standing groundwater water needs in the domain are related to crop water demand in wdu1 to the urban water demand 4000 m3 day and irrigation of green spaces in the urban area wdu2 through fmp we simulated the different components of freshwater supply to meet the water needs of the wdus that is in our case in the order of priority 1 supply by precipitation and natural root uptake 2 surface water supply and 3 groundwater supply irrigation of sunflower is simulated between april 1st and august 31st 2017 irrigation water is provided by means of surface water six wells pumping groundwater provide supplementary irrigation total licensed groundwater abstraction for wdu1 is represented in fig 6b over the sunflower cropping season for the supply of the water needs of wdu2 only groundwater use by means of four wells is foreseen three soil types silt silty clay and sandy loam are assigned fig 6a in the following time plots over the whole simulation period the starting and ending dates for the sunflower cropping season have been highlighted sunflower seeding and harvesting dates were set at april 1st and august 31st 2017 respectively climate data i e precipitation required by fmp and minimum and maximum air temperature required by cgm are shown in fig 7 a while fig 7b reports reference evapotranspiration calculated using the hargreaves equation allen et al 1998 fig 7c shows crop coefficients for each crop type values for sunflower and grassland from allen et al 1998 values for urban vegetation from meyer et al 1985 in the simulated period the rainfall depth during the growing season april through august 2017 was 99 8 mm distributed in four main events representing the rainfall amount of a very dry year ofe coefficients in irrigation water distribution were set at 0 75 for sunflower and at 0 6 for the green urban spaces root depth for sunflower was input on daily basis considering a depth at emergence of 0 04 m from soil surface and a maximum root depth of 1 5 m as linear function of cumulative growing degree days rd rgc cgdd schmid et al 2006 where rd root depth m rcg root growth coefficient 7 9 x 10 4 m c cgdd cumulative growing degree days c growing degree days are accumulated beginning with the day after planting maximum root depth for amenity grasses was set at 0 6 m and 1 6 m for native grasses respectively these two values were constant through all the simulation fraction of evapotranspiration kt transpiratory fraction of consumptive use ke i evaporative fraction of evapotranspiration related to irrigation ke p evaporative fraction of evapotranspiration related to precipitation were defined for sunflower they vary monthly table 3 ke p is set to zero as we assume that all the 925 ha are covered with crops this is of course an assumption as in real sense a small percentage of the area will be exposed to soil evaporation the cumulated sunflower crop potential evapotraspiration etc amounts to 396 mm consistent with what reported in sezen et al 2011 for the urban green area we set kt 0 8 ke i 0 2 and ke p 0 4 while ke p 0 4 kt 0 6 and ke p 0 4 for wdu3 these values are constant through all the simulation a cgm model was then run to simulate the yield of sunflower at harvest parameters values input for sunflower in the cgm scenario are listed in table 4 4 results and discussion the simulations run on the analysed case study provide several outputs fig 8 shows groundwater head simulated on june 28th 2017 using this information the impact of groundwater withdrawal may be tested against local regulations with specific regards to regulated drawdown in case of agricultural areas affected by aquifer overexploitation in this case presentation of spatially distributed results fully benefits from the gis tools to produce maps for the simulated domain we can then analyse the whole water budget or the budget for each wdu in this paper we present the budget for the sunflower crop irrigated district wdu1 fig 9 a shows the demand and supply components of the fmp simulation for the sunflower irrigation district over the cropping season in the graph we may notice how the tfdr is satisfied by natural uptake and surface water resource up to the end of may then in june when the surface water availability is less than tfdr with raising of evapotranspiration demand a supplementary source of water provided by the six farm groundwater wells is needed the demand decreases in july and then falls down abruptly in august due to a change in sunflower kc the simulated input components for wdu1 a total of 4 87 mm3 fig 9b are rainfall 0 92 mm3 irrigation provided via surface 2 07 mm3 and ground water as supplementary source 0 11 mm3 providing 19 and 44 of the irrigation needs respectively and direct uptake from the saturated and the capillary zone 1 63 mm3 fig 9c presents the outflow components for the wdu1 while runoff accounts only for 3 0 13 mm3 27 of the budget is water percolating to the aquifer 1 29 mm3 the other outflow terms are related to evaporation from irrigation ei 7 0 36 mm3 and from groundwater egw which in this case is a minor component 3 0 14 mm3 the model allows to get also data on partitioning of transpiration in this case transpiration from irrigation ti was 1 28 mm3 26 while transpiration from groundwater tgw was 1 63 mm3 33 transpiration from precipitation tp is a small amount 1 0 05 mm3 due to the very dry year simulated from fig 9c we may derive the value of simulated crop consumptive use etc act as etc act tgw tp ti egw ep ei this value accounts for a total of 373 mm during the whole growing season compared to the simulated value of etc 396 mm the observed value was lower by 23 mm this lower simulated value is related to the proportional reduction of maximum possible transpiration due to the reduction of the active root zone from where transpiration is at maximum when the groundwater table elevation is at the bottom of the root zone to where it is zero when the groundwater table elevation is near the surface then the assumption that etc is equal to etc act is only true for conditions when the groundwater table is below the transpiration extinction depth with all transpiration and evaporation components supplied by irrigation and precipitation this data shed a light on the role of shallow water table in providing direct natural groundwater supply for crops as also found in other works such as miao et al 2016 in fact in the simulated case while transpiration from irrigation provides 37 of etc act transpiration from groundwater accounts for 47 fig 9d shows the variation in transpiration from irrigation and transpiration from groundwater with time over the cropping season finally given the simulated water availability conditions the cgm model simulation provides a yield of about 4 85 mg ha this value is referred to the dry matter and it is in accordance with the experimental tests reported in triana jimeno 2011 for sunflower in central italy and it is consistent also with data reported in similar works such as todorovic et al 2009 and ion et al 2015 5 conclusions the development of freewat an open source public domain gis integrated fully distributed and numerically based suite specifically dedicated to the management of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in rural areas may constitute an advancement for proper agricultural water management at watershed or collective irrigation system scale given also the present computational capability of computing systems in this paper we described the approach followed in coupling the fmp embedded in modflow owhm to the cgm and then their integration in the freewat platform with respect to other available codes fmp is considered the most appropriate as it deals in a more rigorous way with the groundwater component in a fully explicit spatially distributed approach the novelty of this approach is based on the fact that all calculations are done in a spatially distributed way by this means real geographical data may be used in the input phase then boosting the values of gathered real data in monitoring efforts for each cell of the finite difference scheme data on geology well presence and pumping rate at a specific depth crop and soil parameters maybe assigned along with source of water for irrigation by this authorities large farms may build dynamic tools to be improved when new data information are gathered on the area calculated results are geographically distributed and zonal budget may be calculated making fmp available in a free gis environment such as qgis may allow analysis of dynamically integrated infiltration surface runoff and deep percolation components to effectively balance crop water demand and supply from different sources of water by this means simulations may be run to gather results in space and time and evaluating the reliability of different supply sources and the environmental impact such as large drawdown caused by groundwater overexploitation caused by their use moreover evaluations may be done on the different components of etc act the coupling of fmp with cgm to estimate crop yield at harvest provides further management tools for assessing on yearly basis the potential impact of climate change when dealing with crop productivity the proposed approach was demonstrated by a simple synthetic application aimed at providing insight on the role of different water sources in irrigation and based on plant transpiration simulated via fmp the yield of sunflower at harvest the analysis of the water balance terms in the simulated case study allowed identification of the groundwater contribution to etc act representing 47 of etc act in order to reduce irrigation water use valuing natural groundwater uptake by roots soil moisture low cost sensors gathering high frequency data connected to and commanding the irrigation schemes and to the software management platform may contribute in reducing water abstraction further development of the code will include among the other the integration of crop rotation routines in the spatial and temporal domain nitrate cycle integration in the cgm and its coupling with solute transport code in the saturated and unsaturated zone the latter may also be helpful along with the implementation of farming practices in producing tools for assessing nitrate leaching to groundwater the proposed framework is thought to be used by water authorities e g river basin authorities and public private companies i e irrigation consortium managing irrigation areas in order to achieve data based agricultural water management in this sense the presented effort aims at supporting collective irrigation schemes operation with tools for managing conjunctive use then trying to reduce the often unplanned and unmanaged use of private farm wells although the open source and free characteristics of the software may favor widespread use it is clear that capacity building to boost digitalization in the agricultural water sector will be at the core of improved water

mediterranean area results provide an insight on the potential exploitation of the developed solution including but not limited to quantitative temporal analysis of irrigation water sources detailed analysis of evaporation and transpiration terms from irrigation groundwater or rainfall the coupling of fmp with cgm to estimate crop yield at harvest provides further management tools when dealing with crop productivity in the simulated case study the analysis of the water balance terms allowed identifying the relevance of the groundwater contribution to etc act highlighting the role of natural root uptake the proposed solution is thought to be deployed by water authorities large farms and public private companies managing irrigation areas the use of these tools calls for dedicated capacity

dedicated to produce tools taking into account the management of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in this section characteristics and pros and cons of some of the most popular conjunctive use modeling tools are presented we then discuss the criteria used to integrate a proper tool into the freewat platform for joint management of conjunctive use and crop growth such criteria took into account the approach used to represent the spatial and temporal dimension of the groundwater component including the unsaturated zone but also the availability of detailed documentation and the free and open source characteristics of the code this is a cornerstone for making available to the scientific and professional community a robust well tested and relatively easy to use tool to plan and to manage the water resource and for raising awareness on the importance of rural water management to the authors knowledge among the most recent and widely used codes for water resource management in rural environments the best known is swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 it is a public domain physically based lumped code developed to simulate a number of different physical processes hydrology erosion and sediment yield crop growth nutrient cycling in order to predict the impact of land management practices even in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods of time using swat the whole catchment is divided into several sub basins connected through the surface water network each sub basin in turn is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus according to land use soil type and the occurrence of specific agricultural practices based on meteorological data and information related to soil and crop properties the model computes water budget components separately for each hru these components include rain infiltration through the unsaturated zone surface runoff and evapotranspiration along with crop water storage based on the leaf area index lai of a specific crop type hrus are discrete entities introduced to approximate the system s behavior where all the budget terms are computed at the outlet of a hru the results cannot provide information on water abstraction and use within the spatial domain of the hru water budgets evaluated for each hru are then simply summed to get a water balance at the scale of the whole catchment the swat model has been extensively used worldwide al soufi et al 2006 huang et al 2009 hunink et al 2013 jacobs et al 2007 pikounis et al 2003 romanowicz et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 and it has a large community of users as testified by the swat web site dedicated sections swat 2018 gis integrated interfaces for swat are also available e g arcswat winchell et al 2013 and qswat dile et al 2015 2016 swat conceives groundwater sources and sinks by means of a shallow and a deep aquifer the shallow aquifer is unconfined and it contributes to flow in the main channels of the hru while the deep aquifer is confined and water entering the deep aquifer is assumed to contribute to streamflow somewhere outside the watershed neitsch et al 2002 as a consequence the deep aquifer does not contribute to the streamflow within the watershed for this reason non linearities related to groundwater processes cannot be adequately reproduced as only one active groundwater storage i e the shallow aquifer is considered pfannerstill et al 2014 this may result in a very high recharge of the shallow aquifer so that overestimation of discharge may occur causing improper representation of low flow periods see e g guse et al 2013 koch et al 2013 groundwater recharge to both shallow and deep aquifers is calculated using an exponential decay function representing the delay time of recharge due to geologic formations groundwater discharge from the shallow aquifer to surface streams is estimated depending on an empirical parameter the base flow recession constant which measures groundwater flow response to changes in recharge however use of this empirical parameter is made without consideration of the governing physical processes hydraulic conductivity parameter and hydraulic gradient finally as all the calculations are performed at the outlet of each hru analysis on potential impacts of groundwater abstractions on groundwater head due to large withdrawal and then groundwater availability are not feasible in order to better account for the groundwater component a further extension of swat resulted in multiple attempts to couple the swat and modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 harbaugh 2005 models for a more comprehensive watershed simulation galbiati et al 2006 kim et al 2008 menking et al 2003 perkins and sophocleus 1999 modflow is a public domain code widely used for dealing with groundwater management issues at different scales see e g davison and lerner 2000 ebraheem et al 2004 it is a physically based spatially distributed code which allows simulating three dimensional groundwater flow through a saturated porous medium by using a finite difference method these swat modflow coupling efforts not usually available to the general public are typically monthly based with spatial restrictions for the two models wible 2014 as further example of coupling bailey 2015 presented the swat modflow model where the link between swat and modflow is guaranteed through an approach consisting of downscaling hrus in modflow cells in the swat modflow code each swat hru is intersected with the modflow grid and modflow is called as a subroutine thus replacing the original swat groundwater subroutines to compute cumulative cell by cell evapotranspiration from shallow aquifers etgw however even for cell by cell downscaled hrus a scale incompatibility issue remains that uniform root zone or crop type parameters used over an hru to calculate distributed etgw while uniform percolation is applied to a distributed groundwater table examples of applications of the newly developed swat modflow model can be found in bailey et al 2016 2017 chunn et al 2019 sith et al 2019 wei and bailey 2017 2018 research in this area is however ongoing as shown in bieger et al 2017 another program resulting from the combination of existing physically based spatially distributed models is simgro simulation of groundwater van walsum et al 2010 an arcgis based model integrating metaswap van walsum and groenendijk 2008 for the unsaturated zone and modflow for the regional groundwater flow simgro links these different compartments by means of flux and storativity exchanges its model input needs various hydrological data such as meteorological data land use soil types watercourse trajectories and weirs similarly to swat in simgro a catchment is divided in sub catchments according to land use and soil units such schematization is then combined with modflow discretization grid cells and each sub catchment is connected with surface water through a network of watercourse trajectories soil atmosphere interactions are the drivers of the regional water system and are guaranteed through estimation of infiltration and evapotranspiration simulation of soil water dynamics is assumed to occur in the vertical direction only and it is estimated by discretizing the unsaturated zone in three control boxes the root zone the shallow subsoil and the deep subsoil whose boundary with groundwater is represented by the phreatic level simgro further includes several flexible options for simulating the impact of water management also in areas other than rural ones but it is especially suited for modeling contexts with shallow groundwater levels in relatively flat areas like in delta regions van walsum et al 2010 the gis integrated weap water evaluation and planning yates et al 2005 node based code allows to calculate crop demand and water supply under different hydrogeological and political scenarios dynamically integrating infiltration and runoff components a graphical user interface gui allows for import export of gis layers in the weap code upper and lower irrigation thresholds are assigned to irrigated land cover fractions in a sub catchment such thresholds are used to dictate both the timing and quantity of water for irrigation as crop evapotranspiration and percolation deplete the available water from the upper zone storage surface and ground water are dynamically linked through a stream aquifer interaction module a program mainly resulting from the combination of existing simulation codes is the gis integrated sid grid platform rossetto et al 2010 2013 developed within the gis gvsig anguix and díaz 2008 the sid grid is a fully distributed and physically based hydrological model coupling 3d existing and newly developed codes for simulating surface and ground water and flow through the unsaturated zone it allows the calculation of hydrological variables such as surface runoff hydraulic head soil moisture evapotranspiration rate interception rate in space and time in sid grid the modflow local grid refinement capability lgr mehl and hill 2005 was extended to the modflow variably saturated flow vsf process thoms et al 2006 which solves the 3d richards equation in order to allow detailed analysis of the unsaturated zone in irrigation areas borsi et al 2013 within these areas the vsf package can be applied to precisely describe the boundaries so that also specific processes like roots uptake ponding events and seepage flows can be successfully considered it must be however noticed that in applying vsf a large number of parameters not always available has to be input a further tool for analyzing conjunctive water use in rural areas is the farm process fmp schmid et al 2006 schmid and hanson 2009b embedded in modflow one water hydrologic flow model modflow owhm hanson et al 2014 the latter is a fully coupled hydrologic model to dynamically estimate the integrated supply and demand components of irrigated agriculture as part of the simulation of surface and ground water flow including head dependent inflows and outflows such as canal losses and gains surface runoff surface water return flows evaporation transpiration and deep percolation of excess water landscape water balances calculated by fmp involve basic units of water consumption i e model sub regions initially called farms schmid 2004 schmid et al 2006 schmid and hanson 2009a 2009b while maintaining the grid spatial discretization for which irrigation water demand surface and ground water supply runoff and deep percolation are dynamically integrated after integration of fmp into owhm this definition advanced to water budget sub regions wbs that include regions other than irrigated agricultural farms hanson et al 2014 which can include non irrigated farms natural vegetation urban areas or managed aquifer recharge mar systems in fmp root uptake is simulated for groundwater levels above the bottom of the root zone under unsaturated or variably saturated conditions demand and supply components of water use are analysed under demand driven and supply constrained conditions this means that for irrigated conditions the irrigation delivery requirements crop irrigation demand increased sufficiently to compensate for inefficient losses and for non irrigated conditions urban water demands or mar percolation requirements drive the supply from various components non routed deliveries surface water deliveries and supplemental groundwater abstraction which in turn can be constrained by natural engineering or water policy constraints similarly to swat and swat modflow fmp includes the possibility to route water supplies towards water accounting units through surface irrigation channels fmp also takes into account optimal allocations of water from an economic point of view when demand exceeds supply and possible limits to groundwater supply due to groundwater rights fmp has been successfully applied to a series of case studies a small scale hydrological model of the southern rincon valley new mexico usa illustrated for the first time how fmp can simulate un metered historic pumpage for real world family farms driven crop consumptive use impacts of surface and ground water abstraction on the lower rio grande lrg stream and return flow and scenarios of changing allotments influence deliveries and downstream stream gains losses schmid et al 2009 a regional integrated hydrologic model using fmp was developed for the lrg as part of the us mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program of the usgs using modflow fmp hanson et al 2013 and further developed to include non agricultural land use to extend into mexico and the model s boundary conditions to be informed by a transboundary rio grande watershed model rio grande transboundary integrated hydrologic model using owhm rgtihm hanson et al 2018 modflow owhm and fmp have been also applied for a detailed assessment of groundwater availability of the central valley aquifer system developing a hydrological model coupled with forecasts from global climate models and including efficient updates using remotely sensed data and gis tools faunt et al 2009 a regional hydrological flow model was also developed for the cuyama valley to quantify groundwater availability under varying cropping systems and climatic scenarios to inform regional stakeholders about potential constraints on water supply availability hanson et al 2015 for these models the water demand and use of each wbs was driven by the potential crop evapotranspiration of virtual crop types i e groups of similar crops from land use maps calculated internally as products of associated virtual composite crop coefficients and reference evapotranspiration in conclusion among the various conjunctive use software package modflow owhm and fmp were chosen to be integrated within the freewat platform modflow owhm and fmp were found most suitable to simulate and manage conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater for irrigation purposes in combination with a fully explicit spatially distributed representation of the groundwater and unsaturated zone components after the successful integration of modflow owhm and fmp into freewat the remaining component for the management of water in agriculture is a crop growth module cgm that is linked to the water cycle among the above mentioned codes only swat and simgro integrate a crop module in order to estimate crop water uptake the swat code and its derivations use a crop module based on the epic plant growth model williams et al 1989 a generic model which simulates radiation interception and conversion into biomass above ground biomass accumulation and economic yield root growth water use and nutrient uptake simgro uses instead the wofost crop growth model van diepen et al 1989 which has similar features than epic although some plant processes are described in more detail on one hand this latter approach represents an increase in model robustness but on the other the number of parameters required to simulate a crop is much higher this can constitute a limit along with increased computational cost to simulate a high number of parameters to its use in the context of water basin or regional simulations with many different crops the weap does not incorporate any crop growth model and fmp prior to cgm linkage was very limited fmp calculates actual crop consumptive use based on a reduction of potential crop evapotranspiration by conditions of wilting and anoxia and evaporative losses but makes assumptions such as a steady state soil moisture over each modflow time step depths of the effective root zone to be constant over a modflow time step and does not calculate biomass fmp can indeed calculate yield based on water production functions but does not relate yield to biomass accumulation time variable root depths can be calculated in fmp from time series of climate data tmin tmax and crop specific coefficients coefficients for growing degree day calculation polynomial coefficients and coefficients for root depth calculation schmid et al 2006 however the issue with this approach is that this option only allows to read time variable but spatially lumped climate data and crop specific coefficients that is this approach can only be used for small scale models where spatial variability can be ignored a comparison of the discussed conjunctive use models is given in table 1 which is in part based on a water resources software review of the world bank wb borden et al 2016 however as the objective was to include such code into the open source freewat platform we only included open source codes into our comparison table alongside with two proprietary software packages gssha wms aquaveo 2019 mike she dhi 2019 modflow owhm was ranked by the wb as the only open source code as among the three most suitable for integrated surface and ground water simulations required for conjunctive management modflow owhm was found to be most suitable for integration into freewat for the simulation and management of conjunctive use however a specific module for crop growth modeling had yet be coupled to fmp in freewat with the goal of connecting the simulation of processes related to water availability to those related to crop water demand and yield the purpose is to perform predictions about crop yield at farm and basin scale under different climatic and water supply constraints a review of existing codes for crop growth modeling was performed according to criteria such as availability of detailed software documentation general usability characteristics technical capabilities and simulation features the cgm based on the epic family models gassman et al 2005 2007 2009 williams and singh 1995 williams et al 1989 was considered to be the most suitable choice among free and open available models to simulate crop growth code availability and model documentation were considered as fundamental requirements while carrying out this review since both requirements were not fully fulfilled for aquacrop fao 2012 stics brisson et al 1998 and apsim mccown et al 1996 at the time of code integration these models were not taken into account wofost boogaard et al 2014 and swap kroes et al 2008 showed to have three important drawbacks a they need a high number of crop specific parameters b they require hourly radiation data and c crop water uptake refers to the whole root zone thus differences in soil moisture at different depths are ignored leading to potential overestimation or underestimation of readily available soil water for crop growth based on the above the epic model and specifically the cgm seemed to be the most preferable choice to simulate crop growth this coupling approach is also detailed in this paper 3 materials and methods 3 1 coupling of fmp with cgm and integration in freewat the qgis integrated freewat platform constitutes an effort to support and improve watershed research and decision making in water resource management it allows the simulation of the whole hydrological cycle using open source numerical codes mainly belonging to the usgs modflow family such as modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and owhm hanson et al 2014 as such the freewat platform is conceived as a canvas where many simulation codes based on the hydrological cycle might be virtually integrated as shown in fig 1 the freewat platform is implemented as a composite plugin in qgis qgis development team 2009 and it takes advantage of spatialite spatialite development team 2011 as a geodatabase management system pre processing tools and flopy flopy 2016 as reference python library to connect the gui to native modflow based hydrological codes and to post process models results data processing and simulation capabilities are described in details in criollo et al 2019 and rossetto et al 2018 among the simulation codes fmp is integrated in the freewat platform in order to deal with conjunctive use of surface and ground water in the rural environment as fmp along with other owhm specific packages are not considered in flopy a specific python object has been developed for the flopy library compliant with format and standard of the existing library furthermore in coupling cgm to fmp and integrating them in freewat emphasis was placed on the development of simple but robust tools to be used in regional scale studies thus keeping low the number of parameters needed the coupling of cgm to fmp within freewat was coded in python independently on the flopy library the gui window to set up an fmp scenario is shown in fig 2 and the available sub menus are organized so the user can easily follow the workflow reported in fig 3 such workflow is briefly explained in the following a detailed description of fmp conceptualization can be found in hanson et al 2014 the basic concept in fmp is the farm or more in general what the freewat gui calls the water demand unit wdu namely a model sub region made by a cluster of grid cells of the top model layer requiring water for cropping systems rural areas natural vegetation areas etc thus the entire finite difference grid is classified in one or more wdus by assigning to each cell a farm id such classification can be made by means of polygon shapefiles previously created taking advantage of gis selection tools the user then defines parameters for each wdu e g soil characteristics crop parameters and a total water demand is input or computed according to the terms listed below crop water demand is computed as evapotranspiration representing the target crop consumptive use to meet in fmp crop is also used to represent any non irrigated water consumptive land use types urban environment natural vegetation riparian areas water bodies etc then defined as virtual crops hanson et al 2014 municipal and industrial urban water demand can be specified as negative supplies specified as negative non routed deliveries see later on with reference to fig 3 at first crop water demand is attempted to be met by precipitation and natural uptake from groundwater any unfulfilled residual crop water demand is calculated as crop irrigation requirement cir and increased by the on farm inefficiency losses ofe specific to the irrigation method or the farm operation which results in a total farm delivery requirement tfdr for each wdu at each stress period fmp attempts to satisfy the tfdr with one or more supply components according to the following ranking 1st priority by water transfer to a wdu from known types of water sources e g canal pipeline transfers trucked shipped in water e g for islands aquifer storage and recovery wellfields recycled waste water without simulating the process of conveyance i e non routed deliveries 2nd priority by water transfer to a wdu directly from an irrigation canal or lateral directly to an automatically detected farm head gate fully routed deliveries mainly for small scale applications with simulation of routing to the farm or through a surface water network specifying diversion points from the main channel semi routed deliveries mainly for regional scale models that do not simulate routing to farms the streamflow routing network i e the main irrigation canal and the surface water network is simulated through the streamflow routing package sfr of modflow niswonger and prudic 2005 diversion points from a channel belonging to the streamflow routing network to a specific wdu need to be defined as part of fmp data input 3rd priority groundwater pumping farm wells the user also has the possibility to specify constraints on surface water and groundwater withdrawals e g surface water or groundwater allotments or maximum well capacities once the model is run water demand and supply components are computed for each time step and the code compares the two terms a deficit scenario can occur if the demand is greater than supply fig 3 in this case the code allows estimating optimal distributions of supply components either from surface or ground water bodies to cope with this deficit at the end of the simulation a specific budget for each wdu is produced in addition to the global budget for the entire model cgm is a radiation based model meaning that the growth process is driven by intercepted radiation converted into above ground biomass using a radiation use efficiency rue coefficient other processes involved in simulating biomass accumulation are crop phenology and canopy development these processes are affected by weather variables i e air temperature solar radiation and crop specific characteristics water uptake is not estimated by cgm as it is computed by fmp thus cgm estimates potential plant growth based on solar radiation only the following section illustrates how cgm and fmp are coupled in order to estimate the actual crop growth as affected by water availability in the unsaturated zone 3 2 coupling rural water management fmp and crop growth modeling cgm fig 4 shows the conceptual coupling between fmp and cgm cgm requires few input data crop specific parameters time series of air temperature and solar radiation right side of fig 4 in order to get potential crop yield at harvest potential crop yield in fig 4 on the other hand input data needed to run fmp left side of fig 4 are crop dependent parameters basically related to assess the water uptake soil related hydrologic parameters depth of the capillary fringe climate data precipitation and reference evapotranspiration starting from time series of reference evapotranspiration et0 in fig 4 such data are used to compute time series of potential crop evapotranspiration etc in fig 4 using crop coefficients as proportionality constants allen et al 1998 fractions of transpiration and evaporation split the etc into time series of potential crop transpiration tc pot and evaporation ec pot the actual transpiration would equal the potential transpiration if the entire root zone was active but it is reduced if the active root zone is restricted by wilting or anoxia water stress data in fig 4 wilting is caused by conditions of intolerably dry conditions for certain crops water deficit in fig 4 anoxia is caused by conditions of near saturation resulting in the lack of oxygen water excess in fig 4 note that this is related to deficit or to excess in relation to water in the root zone and not to deficit irrigation scenarios or excess non routed deliveries in fmp not discussed here which address the supply components insufficient to satisfy or in excess of the irrigation delivery requirement respectively the maximum possible actual transpiration tc act max in fig 4 in fmp is defined as the transpiration from the entire root zone only reduced by the anoxia fringe on top of the groundwater level when coinciding with the bottom of the root zone soil column experiments conducted with hydrus schmid et al 2006 indicate that indeed the entire root zone is never 100 active and full tc pot can never be reached this tc act max can then be further reduced to the actual transpiration tc act in fig 4 by conditions of wilting in the top soil or when the groundwater level rises into the root zone eventually eliminating the entire active root zone the coupling between cgm and fmp is guaranteed through variables tc act and tc act max schmid et al 2006 needed as input data to cgm to adjust potential crop yield and to get the actual crop yield at harvest actual crop yield in fig 4 cgm is run sequentially after fmp and all over the growing season of the crop from seeding to harvest this is done for one or more crops defined in fmp scenario previously set and run for each crop the user has to input the seeding and harvesting dates and parameters related to crop phenology climate data air temperature and solar radiation are further needed on a daily basis in order to properly represent all the growing stages for each crop type table 2 as such the requirement to run cgm is that the length of the modflow simulation must cover at least the growing periods of each crop type and that daily stress periods must be defined also cgm is not grid based as all the needed input data table 2 except from crop id and crop name are time dependent only as such values for tc act and tc act max which are calculated by fmp at each grid cell and at the end of each stress period are averaged over the area where each crop is cultivated in order to get a time series for each crop type the complete set of algebraic equations solved by cgm is reported in de filippis et al 2019 such equations are divided in two sets the first set of equations is related to estimate potential crop yield at harvest i e provided that optimal conditions of water sufficiency occur to this aim the role of temperature on crop growth rate is assessed through evaluating the daily accumulation of heat based on temperature data this is then used to calculate the potential leaf area index the potential leaf area index is needed along with solar radiation to get a daily amount of crop intercepted photosynthetically active radiation which is finally converted into a potential above ground biomass agbpot under optimal water conditions agbpot is a time dependent variable whose value at the end of the simulation i e at harvest is needed to get the crop yield at harvest yh in a second set of algebraic equations variables tc act the actual crop transpiration requirement and tc act max the maximum actual crop transpiration are used to get the actual above ground biomass agbact and the actual crop yield at harvest yact which are nothing but agbpot and yh limited by the amount of water uptake by introducing a daily water stress factor 3 3 example application the coupling approach shown in fig 4 and so far described is demonstrated through a simple synthetic application the example reported in schmid et al 2006 was adapted to set up a real world case study using climatic data from central italy from january 1st to december 31st 2017 the cgm was then coupled to this fmp scenario to get sunflower yield at harvest under the specific water availability conditions the study area 115 km2 wide is discretized through 460 square cells with 500 m side length the simulated domain includes three wdus fig 5 an irrigation district with sunflower crops 925 ha wdu1 an urban area with irrigated green spaces amenity grasses 775 ha wdu2 a rainfed grassland wdu is defined at the remaining cells wdu3 groundwater is hosted in a sandy aquifer represented through a single homogeneous convertible model layer with thickness ranging from 277 m to 300 m groundwater flow occurs from west to east fig 6 a boundary conditions and source sink terms are represented in fig 6a where the hydraulic head simulated at the beginning of the sunflower cropping season april 1st 2017 is reported as well a main canal crosses the area from west to east water is diverted at two points by means of two secondary irrigation channels running around the irrigation district and the urban area at wdu1 the irrigation district a semi routed surface water delivery is set from the secondary channel drain channels potentially drain high standing groundwater water needs in the domain are related to crop water demand in wdu1 to the urban water demand 4000 m3 day and irrigation of green spaces in the urban area wdu2 through fmp we simulated the different components of freshwater supply to meet the water needs of the wdus that is in our case in the order of priority 1 supply by precipitation and natural root uptake 2 surface water supply and 3 groundwater supply irrigation of sunflower is simulated between april 1st and august 31st 2017 irrigation water is provided by means of surface water six wells pumping groundwater provide supplementary irrigation total licensed groundwater abstraction for wdu1 is represented in fig 6b over the sunflower cropping season for the supply of the water needs of wdu2 only groundwater use by means of four wells is foreseen three soil types silt silty clay and sandy loam are assigned fig 6a in the following time plots over the whole simulation period the starting and ending dates for the sunflower cropping season have been highlighted sunflower seeding and harvesting dates were set at april 1st and august 31st 2017 respectively climate data i e precipitation required by fmp and minimum and maximum air temperature required by cgm are shown in fig 7 a while fig 7b reports reference evapotranspiration calculated using the hargreaves equation allen et al 1998 fig 7c shows crop coefficients for each crop type values for sunflower and grassland from allen et al 1998 values for urban vegetation from meyer et al 1985 in the simulated period the rainfall depth during the growing season april through august 2017 was 99 8 mm distributed in four main events representing the rainfall amount of a very dry year ofe coefficients in irrigation water distribution were set at 0 75 for sunflower and at 0 6 for the green urban spaces root depth for sunflower was input on daily basis considering a depth at emergence of 0 04 m from soil surface and a maximum root depth of 1 5 m as linear function of cumulative growing degree days rd rgc cgdd schmid et al 2006 where rd root depth m rcg root growth coefficient 7 9 x 10 4 m c cgdd cumulative growing degree days c growing degree days are accumulated beginning with the day after planting maximum root depth for amenity grasses was set at 0 6 m and 1 6 m for native grasses respectively these two values were constant through all the simulation fraction of evapotranspiration kt transpiratory fraction of consumptive use ke i evaporative fraction of evapotranspiration related to irrigation ke p evaporative fraction of evapotranspiration related to precipitation were defined for sunflower they vary monthly table 3 ke p is set to zero as we assume that all the 925 ha are covered with crops this is of course an assumption as in real sense a small percentage of the area will be exposed to soil evaporation the cumulated sunflower crop potential evapotraspiration etc amounts to 396 mm consistent with what reported in sezen et al 2011 for the urban green area we set kt 0 8 ke i 0 2 and ke p 0 4 while ke p 0 4 kt 0 6 and ke p 0 4 for wdu3 these values are constant through all the simulation a cgm model was then run to simulate the yield of sunflower at harvest parameters values input for sunflower in the cgm scenario are listed in table 4 4 results and discussion the simulations run on the analysed case study provide several outputs fig 8 shows groundwater head simulated on june 28th 2017 using this information the impact of groundwater withdrawal may be tested against local regulations with specific regards to regulated drawdown in case of agricultural areas affected by aquifer overexploitation in this case presentation of spatially distributed results fully benefits from the gis tools to produce maps for the simulated domain we can then analyse the whole water budget or the budget for each wdu in this paper we present the budget for the sunflower crop irrigated district wdu1 fig 9 a shows the demand and supply components of the fmp simulation for the sunflower irrigation district over the cropping season in the graph we may notice how the tfdr is satisfied by natural uptake and surface water resource up to the end of may then in june when the surface water availability is less than tfdr with raising of evapotranspiration demand a supplementary source of water provided by the six farm groundwater wells is needed the demand decreases in july and then falls down abruptly in august due to a change in sunflower kc the simulated input components for wdu1 a total of 4 87 mm3 fig 9b are rainfall 0 92 mm3 irrigation provided via surface 2 07 mm3 and ground water as supplementary source 0 11 mm3 providing 19 and 44 of the irrigation needs respectively and direct uptake from the saturated and the capillary zone 1 63 mm3 fig 9c presents the outflow components for the wdu1 while runoff accounts only for 3 0 13 mm3 27 of the budget is water percolating to the aquifer 1 29 mm3 the other outflow terms are related to evaporation from irrigation ei 7 0 36 mm3 and from groundwater egw which in this case is a minor component 3 0 14 mm3 the model allows to get also data on partitioning of transpiration in this case transpiration from irrigation ti was 1 28 mm3 26 while transpiration from groundwater tgw was 1 63 mm3 33 transpiration from precipitation tp is a small amount 1 0 05 mm3 due to the very dry year simulated from fig 9c we may derive the value of simulated crop consumptive use etc act as etc act tgw tp ti egw ep ei this value accounts for a total of 373 mm during the whole growing season compared to the simulated value of etc 396 mm the observed value was lower by 23 mm this lower simulated value is related to the proportional reduction of maximum possible transpiration due to the reduction of the active root zone from where transpiration is at maximum when the groundwater table elevation is at the bottom of the root zone to where it is zero when the groundwater table elevation is near the surface then the assumption that etc is equal to etc act is only true for conditions when the groundwater table is below the transpiration extinction depth with all transpiration and evaporation components supplied by irrigation and precipitation this data shed a light on the role of shallow water table in providing direct natural groundwater supply for crops as also found in other works such as miao et al 2016 in fact in the simulated case while transpiration from irrigation provides 37 of etc act transpiration from groundwater accounts for 47 fig 9d shows the variation in transpiration from irrigation and transpiration from groundwater with time over the cropping season finally given the simulated water availability conditions the cgm model simulation provides a yield of about 4 85 mg ha this value is referred to the dry matter and it is in accordance with the experimental tests reported in triana jimeno 2011 for sunflower in central italy and it is consistent also with data reported in similar works such as todorovic et al 2009 and ion et al 2015 5 conclusions the development of freewat an open source public domain gis integrated fully distributed and numerically based suite specifically dedicated to the management of conjunctive use of surface and ground water in rural areas may constitute an advancement for proper agricultural water management at watershed or collective irrigation system scale given also the present computational capability of computing systems in this paper we described the approach followed in coupling the fmp embedded in modflow owhm to the cgm and then their integration in the freewat platform with respect to other available codes fmp is considered the most appropriate as it deals in a more rigorous way with the groundwater component in a fully explicit spatially distributed approach the novelty of this approach is based on the fact that all calculations are done in a spatially distributed way by this means real geographical data may be used in the input phase then boosting the values of gathered real data in monitoring efforts for each cell of the finite difference scheme data on geology well presence and pumping rate at a specific depth crop and soil parameters maybe assigned along with source of water for irrigation by this authorities large farms may build dynamic tools to be improved when new data information are gathered on the area calculated results are geographically distributed and zonal budget may be calculated making fmp available in a free gis environment such as qgis may allow analysis of dynamically integrated infiltration surface runoff and deep percolation components to effectively balance crop water demand and supply from different sources of water by this means simulations may be run to gather results in space and time and evaluating the reliability of different supply sources and the environmental impact such as large drawdown caused by groundwater overexploitation caused by their use moreover evaluations may be done on the different components of etc act the coupling of fmp with cgm to estimate crop yield at harvest provides further management tools for assessing on yearly basis the potential impact of climate change when dealing with crop productivity the proposed approach was demonstrated by a simple synthetic application aimed at providing insight on the role of different water sources in irrigation and based on plant transpiration simulated via fmp the yield of sunflower at harvest the analysis of the water balance terms in the simulated case study allowed identification of the groundwater contribution to etc act representing 47 of etc act in order to reduce irrigation water use valuing natural groundwater uptake by roots soil moisture low cost sensors gathering high frequency data connected to and commanding the irrigation schemes and to the software management platform may contribute in reducing water abstraction further development of the code will include among the other the integration of crop rotation routines in the spatial and temporal domain nitrate cycle integration in the cgm and its coupling with solute transport code in the saturated and unsaturated zone the latter may also be helpful along with the implementation of farming practices in producing tools for assessing nitrate leaching to groundwater the proposed framework is thought to be used by water authorities e g river basin authorities and public private companies i e irrigation consortium managing irrigation areas in order to achieve data based agricultural water management in this sense the presented effort aims at supporting collective irrigation schemes operation with tools for managing conjunctive use then trying to reduce the often unplanned and unmanaged use of private farm wells although the open source and free characteristics of the software may favor widespread use it is clear that capacity building to boost digitalization in the agricultural water sector will be at the core of improved water

10942,the aim of the research is to shed light on the irrigation water management in güzelyurt region in north cyprus and to assess the groundwater quality a screenshot is taken for the water management system whereas private wells and state owned artificial lakes and water wells are utilized on cost basis for irrigation purposes as well as the water arriving from turkey through pipelines crossing the mediterranean the management methodology was studied and representative groundwater samples collected from different villages were analysed for physicochemical parameters and contamination main cations indicated na mg2 ca2 k while anions showed cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 in conformance with irrigation water standards on the other hand concentration of heavy metals were all below the threshold limits with the order fe cr as pb hg cd seawater intrusion was determined by revelle index and ca2 mg2 cl was the predominant hydrochemical facies while us salinity laboratory diagram was utilized for salinity and sodium hazard various ratios and indices were also utilized in detail to uncover the quality conformance of the irrigation water in use only sodium adsorption ratio sar values indicated excellent groundwater quality while others indicated good quality with the exception of magnesium adsorption ratio mar which was unsuitable in conclusion the study revealed the safe use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes keywords groundwater heavy metal contamination irrigation water quality irrigation techniques physicochemical parameter water management 1 introduction water resource management includes planning developing distributing and optimized managing of water resources not only quantity but the quality of groundwater is also decreasing nowadays due to increasing population and industrial activities overuse of fertilizers in agricultural products and intensive farming therefore management of water resources takes its top priority position on the agenda of countries especially those with significant agricultural activities that is why it is also very important to identify both physical and chemical composition of groundwater for the assessment of quality for various uses such as human consumption agricultural and industrial activities poor quality of irrigation water may also concentrate salts and other toxic elements in soils and change their physical and chemical conditions leading to some negative effects on crop yield and food safety in north cyprus agriculture is one of the main economic activities this is why not only in north cyprus as a whole but specifically in güzelyurt area water management is of utmost importance also because the region hosts the most extensive aquifer of cyprus exploited since 1957 for municipal and irrigation water supply however sea water intrusion has severely affected the aquifer quality due to extensive withdrawal and resulted in physical chemical and microbiological changes in the water quality irrigation associations were founded and policies were set to manage and schedule the convenient distribution of the water to the producers for continuity and sustainability the mega project of bringing water from turkey to northern cyprus through the mediterranean has been completed in 2015 this international water diversion project as the first of its kind in the world is supplying 75 million cubic meters of water annually for a time span of 50 years municipality water reached the main inhabited areas of lefkoşa 67 km girne 161 km mağusa 154 km and dipkarpaz 95 km although the municipal water for the consumption of inhabitants is completed it has not reach the irrigation areas yet until this is realized current water resources will continue to be used and this is why the current study collected samples from these resources and quality tests were performed a similar study was also carried in the same area in 1987 81 groundwater samples were collected from different municipal irrigation and observation wells to evaluate both domestic and agricultural quality of güzelyurt basin gökçekuş and doyuran 1997 like our current study the irrigation waters were found to be hard to very hard and slightly alkaline to alkaline within the scope of the ussl diagram the majority of the samples just like the current study fell into the groups c3s1 and c3s2 groups indicating high salinity low to medium alkali hazard even though the hydrochemical facies is na so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl the study put forth the finding as ca2 mg2 cl resembling the current study the sar values were found to be below 10 and classified as excellent na values were found to be higher than the current study values heavy metal contamination was not studied current water resources in north cyprus are administratively twofold state owned artificial dams and water wells and private owned water wells state owned artificial dams and water wells are administered by irrigation associations a president and elected five members administer and manage the distribution of the water to the producers on a voluntary base at specified dates and time periods these village based associations provide the necessary amount of water at a specified price on pre designated dates and hours in this way when associations are on duty water resources can be better managed as to the amount and time of consumption per producer however under the circumstances when the water wells are private owned control and inspection is absent and is thus against the general rule that underground resources belong to everyone the associations collect and prepare a pond and render it full to be ready for pumping water to the agricultural fields through pvc pipes generally water is supplied once per week to each of the fields and around 25 30 tons is suggested per decare although the cost of water changes from village to village it changes between 0 14 0 29 euros ton the cost is dependent on different parameters varying for different villages in general the high cost of electricity is the principal factor negatively affecting the affordability of the irrigation water however this is also dependent on the depth of the water wells and for shallow wells cost of electricity is reduced as one of the foremost management issues the amount of water and the method of irrigation adopted should be optimized in accordance with the agricultural requirements of the specific plants for instance springer irrigation system is adopted for citrus fruits and horticultural crops while for potatoes on the other hand drip irrigation system is adopted some incidents also negatively affect management procedures some of which are below 1 leakage is present to a certain extent at both previously constructed and current water transportation pipe systems 2 licenses for drilling new water wells are granted without any scientific consideration 3 certain water well owners are producing water at extra high amounts and sell the water without any administrative permission 4 the nicosia bi communal wastewater treatment plant funded by undp pff united nations development programme partnership for the future and commissioned in april 2014 serves nicosia s two divided communities it has a capacity to produce ten million cubic metres of treated water annually though only partially utilized 5 the installation of pipelines to supply the water from turkey has not yet been completed and in addition management and pricing policies are not yet set in the study current water resources were evaluated in terms of irrigation water quality collecting representative water samples from groundwater wells which are currently used to water agricultural fields in the area in general quality of water is judged by four important parameters salinity hazard ec sodium hazard sar residual sodium carbonate hazard rsc and toxicity hazard michael 1978 the physiochemical characteristics of the groundwater have been assessed and irrigation water quality was evaluated by some determining factors such as sar rsc sodium percentage na magnesium adsorption ratio mar kelly s index ki total hardness th permeability index pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and ec with reference to their suitability for irrigation in addition to all these parameters ri was also calculated to see if the groundwater is mixed with seawater toxicity hazard of the groundwater has been investigated by determining as cd cr hg pb and fe concentrations thus one of the mentioned aims of the study was fulfilled which are essential for crop yield and food safety 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is located within the güzelyurt basin at the north western part of cyprus bounded by utm coordinates 475 000 507 000 e longitude and 3 887 000 3 896 000 n latitude with an average elevation of 65 m fig 1 the figure also shows the sampling locations and covers more than 85 of the total agricultural activities part of the study area was an old copper mine where intensive ore processing activities took place the estimated population of the selected area is 30 037 and has a semi arid mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters the precipitation ranges between 276 355 mm year temperature between 18 3 19 2 c and relative humidity between 68 71 güzelyurt plain is characterised as a slightly sloping coastal plain and central parts where agriculture is mainly carried out is characterised as flat terrain there are some elevated hills rising from north east to south west and except these hills the gradient of the area is about 1 ergil 2000 the major occupation of the people is agriculture in güzelyurt while some livestock farming also exist citrus which meets all needs of the island is the symbol of the area it is very vital in the economy of country covering 40 percent of currency input into the export of island some other vegetables and fruits like melon water melon strawberry carrot potatoes molehiya pepper eggplant etc are also cultivated in these fertile agricultural lands in the güzelyurt plain the groundwater occurs under unfractured unconfined aquifer conditions within the semi consolidated and weakly cemented fanglomerates and younger alluvial surficial deposits in general the geological map of the basin comprises permeable deposits consisting of various proportions of gravel sand clay coastal sand and fluvial sediments fig 2 in the western part of the area around lefke and yeşilırmak upper part of the troodos ophiolite which contains impervious basaltic pillow lavas and diabase are present this pillowed and sheet lava flows include olivine and pyroxene phyric with abundant dikes and sills and altered to zeolite facies from place to place some reef limestones and marls are outcropping besides these lithological units permeable semi permeable deposits of calcarenite marly gravel chalks and marls are also seen in the southern part of the studying area the maximum thickness of the aquifer is 100 m at the far western part and it gradually thins out eastward away from the coastline reducing to 40 m ergil 2000 the coastline is almost 12 km long and it consists of alluvium and sand with different ratios of gravels and pebbles 2 2 sample collection and preservation a total of 18 groundwater samples from the water wells ranging from 18 to 91 m deep were collected in the dry season in september 2016 from different inhabited areas which were used in the irrigation of various agricultural fields under study aydınköy taşpınar doğancı yeşilyurt yedidalga yeşilırmak güneşköy lefke cengizköy bostancı zümrütköy güzelyurt geographical locations were recorded at each sampling site using a hand held garmin etrex 30x gps shown in fig 2 two sets of water samples were collected from each sampling site one set for physicochemical parameters and the other one for trace metal analysis sampling was carried out after operating the pumps for five minutes for homogenizing and temperature stabilisation to measure reliable ec redox potential eh and ph values the water samples for trace metal analysis were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles pre soaked in 20 diluted hno3 for overnight and subsequently rinsed with distilled water the sampling bottles were rinsed with the sample water itself 2 3 times to mitigate the chance of any contamination 2 ml of concentrated hno3 was added into each sample to decrease the ph below 2 for the stabilisation of metal ions in the solution the water samples were kept in an ice box at 4 c transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until further analyses in addition to the above an extra 500 ml water sample for each location was also collected for physicochemical analysis some aliquots of these samples were filtered acidified with h2so4 and stored in glass containers at 4 c in the dark for dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn analysis the other part was kept at 4 c for the following parameters to be tested sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 carbonate co3 2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 during all these processes standard sampling and preservation procedures apha 2005 were followed 2 3 measurements and analysis measurements of temperature ph ec eh and dissolved oxygen were carried out three times at each sampling site inolab ph 7110 was used to measure ph and oxi 3210 was used for the temperature and do for the ph electrode standardization was performed daily with ph 4 ph 7 and ph 10 buffers in some wells do values seemed to be high probably due to contamination with atmosphere eh was measured with a platinum combination sentix orp reference electrode prior to the measurement accuracy of the equipment was checked by orp calibrating solution rh 28 220 mv at 25 c ec μs cm 1 values of the samples was measured using a conductivity meter cond600 eutech instruments doc was analysed using a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn shimadzu and tn was measured using a total nitrogen measuring unit tnm 1 shimadzu the concentrations of na and k were determined using a flame photometer jenway pfp 7 edta titrimetric method was used to determine ca² and mg² concentrations the presence of so4² was determined with turbidimetric method using uv visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm wavelength providing a light path of 10 cm alkalinity primarily hco3 and co3² was measured by titration using phenolphthalein and bromocresol green indicators cl was determined using potassium chromate indicator and titrating the samples with standard silver nitrate titrant to a pinkish yellow end point the procedures used were specified in apha 2005 to ensure quality all the samples were analysed in triplicates using analytical grade reagents the concentrations of the total heavy metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for as cd cr hg pb and fe epa 6020a 2007 method was used for the determination of the element contents the limit of detections of as cd cr hg pb and fe were 0 002 0 002 0 01 0 002 0 002 and 0 2 μg l respectively on the other hand the quantification limits of as cd cr hg pb and fe were determined as 0 01 0 01 0 05 0 01 0 01 and 1 μg l respectively the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were not less than 0 999 quality assurance was achieved by triplicate determination of the samples and the data were presented as mean standard error of mean sem all calculations were conducted using microsoft excel version 2013 statistical analyses were carried out using statistical package for social science spss version 20 usa physicochemical parameters were presented as means all heavy metal concentrations were presented as means and standard error of mean the location map and geological map of the study are were prepared by using arc gis version 9 3 chemical characteristic of the groundwater was determined by piper diagram using aquachem version 2014 1 which is useful in the classification of the groundwater types according to different hydro geochemical facies ussl diagram sar vs ec which helps to access the suitability of water for irrigation purpose was also prepared using aquachem 3 results 3 1 chemical properties of groundwater the measured physicochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 which are statistically analysed to include mean minimum maximum standard deviation cv and skewness values table 2 water ph is a very important parameter on which chemical reactions are dependent since the mobility and solubility of minerals are affected adversely by the water ph samantara et al 2017 in the study the ph of the groundwater samples are convenient for irrigation purposes fao 1985 the ec values in the studied samples were also within the acceptable range below 3000 μs cm while eh values in the groundwater samples ranged from 177 10 to 284 mv mean 233 98 mv indicated oxidation conditions except sample 1 and sample 18 doc values were below 4 mg l which is frequently encountered in unpolluted aquifers regan et al 2017 in the studied samples the concentrations of na mg2 ca2 and k varied largely as well as the cl hco3 so4² and co3² probably due to the proximity of the coast and thus seawater the presence of high cl content in well 1 and well 18 is derived from seawater intrusion as it was verified by ri pearson correlation coefficient matrix of physicochemical parameters are presented in table 3 the table indicates certain positive correlation between the parameters for instance ec showed a strong correlation with ca 2 mg 2 na and cl at the significance level of p 0 01 a good linear correlation of ec with na and cl implies that the increase in ec is directly related to salinity the concentrations of major ions of 18 groundwater samples were plotted on the piper diagram to classify and compare hydrochemical facies water types based on their ionic compositions fig 3 on the cationic triangle the samples fall within the no dominant type na k dominant type and mg2 dominant type on the anionic triangle the samples can be classified as no dominant type cl dominant type and hco3 co3 2 dominant type in this figure i stands for nacl ii for cahco3 iii for canahco3 iv for camgcl v for cacl and vi for nahco3 type five groundwater facies can be identified on the diamond of the piper plot based on the major ion chemistry of the groundwater of this area with a decreasing order of na mg2 ca2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 for cations and anions respectively the type of the facies are ca2 hco3 type na cl type mixed ca2 na hco3 type mixed ca2 mg2 cl type and ca2 cl type however based on hydrochemical facies the type of water that predominates in the study area is ca2 mg2 cl ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 water types represent fresh groundwater or freshwater which has recently infiltrated or temporary hard water obviously na cl type represents water that is enriched by salinity occurrence of ca2 mg2 cl type clearly hints that na cl mix with fresh groundwater ca2 mg2 hco3 causing salinization of the groundwater the hydrochemical facies indicate alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 exceeded alkali metals na k and strong acid cl so4 2 exceeded weak acid hco3 co3 2 heavy metals are the most important pollutants that can cause serious problems to human health although less dangerous than drinking water due to direct consumption irrigation water pollutants are also dangerous as they enter the human body indirectly through the food chain arslan et al 2016 concentrations of as cd cr hg pb and fe in groundwater samples are presented in table 4 all the results for as cd cr hg pb and fe are below the fao guideline limits setting for irrigation water the order of heavy metals in groundwater samples are fe cr as pb hg cd 3 2 evaluation of irrigation water quality physicochemical parameters were intensively utilized to assess the irrigation water quality table 5 after designating the detailed findings additional parameters were also calculated such as sar rsc na mar ki th pi and residual mg2 ca2 ratio table 6 these parameters along with ec are of utmost importance for evaluating the suitability of the studied water samples for irrigation the water quality was assessed by the following physicochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl and so4 2 it was observed that 8 of the samples indicated values exceeding the permissible limits for mg2 the findings also showed that one of the samples provided a value that exceeded the permissible limit for cl the sodium hazard is expressed as the sodium adsorption ratio it effects infiltration rate of water nag and lahiri 2012 water is drawn by the plants through enhanced cation exchange reactions in soil sar governs this action and is defined as sodium hazard in agriculture under limiting conditions the limiting condition in turn occurs when na replaces ca2 and mg2 in soil rendering it compact and impervious joshi et al 2009 the potential for a sodium hazard increases in waters with higher sar values sar was computed by eq 1 below richards 1954 1 sar na ca2 mg2 2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l sar values in the study area are given in table 7 which are within the excellent class and acceptable for irrigation according to the classification in table 8 to assess the suitability of water for irrigation purposes ec and sar of the water samples plotted on the ussl diagram fig 4 ussl 1954 the diagram illustrates that 78 of the groundwater samples fall in the field of c3s1 and c3s2 indicating high salinity and low to medium alkali hazard nearly 17 of the groundwater samples fall in the field of c4s1 and c4s2 indicating very high salinity and low to medium alkali hazard rsc is another important parameter which indicates the hazardous effect of co3 2 and hco3 on irrigation water the movement of water and air in the soil might be prevented by blocking the soil pores up with the salt which is formed due to the continuous use of water having rsc above 2 5 meq l sudhakar and narsimha 2013 rsc was computed by eq 2 below raghunath 1987 2 rsc hco3 co3 2 ca2 mg2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the sodium in groundwater is usually denoted as na sodium percentage high concentrations of na relative to ca2 and mg2 in groundwater reacts with soil and decreases its permeability leading to deterioration of soil structure thereby stunting plant growth richards 1954 na can be computed with respect to relative proportions of cations present in water using eq 3 below todd 1960 3 na na k ca2 mg2 na k 100 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l generally mg2 presents less than ca2 in groundwater due to the fact that earth crust is rich in ca2 comparing to mg2 and also mg2 rich dolomites cannot dissolve easily to release mg2 into groundwater however in some special cases mg2 can exist in higher amount comparing to ca2 in groundwater which comes from mg2 rich olivine basalts serpentines ultrabasic rocks and dolomites şahinci 1991 excess mg2 present in waters affects the crop growth and yield as the soils become more alkaline and saline bhat and jeelani 2015 in addition infiltration problems are appeared in the soils as they contain high levels of exchangeable mg2 fao 1985 richards la us salinity laboratory 1954 named mg2 ca2 ratio as magnesium hazard mh when this ratio exceeds 4 in the groundwater adsorption of na by soil increases at the same level of salinity and sar because the bonding energy of mg2 is less than that of ca2 which causes more na adsorption and this takes place when the ratio is more than 4 michael 1978 except sample 11 the study area have lower mg2 ca2 ratios than 4 which shows no threat of infiltration problem for soil from the groundwater szabolcs and darab 1964 was suggested eq 4 for the calculation of mar 4 mar mg2 ca2 mg2 100 where all the ions are expressed in meq l kelly 1940 was computed a significant parameter to evaluate irrigation water quality based on the level of na measured against sum of ca2 and mg2 eq 5 5 ki na ca2 mg2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l total hardness is a natural characteristic of groundwater which is important especially for domestic and industrial usage of water it is enhanced especially by dissolved ca2 and mg2 which are mostly leached from soils and become common constituents of natural waters samantara et al 2017 hardness of the water has no known adverse effects however it causes scale formation in pipes reduces the aesthetic quality of water and efficiency of water treatment and increases soap consumption sojobi 2016 it was believed that water hardness leads to cardiovascular diseases and leukaemia however further studies investigated negative relationship between them edmunds and smedley 1996 th was calculated by eq 6 below todd 1960 6 th 2 497 ca2 4 11 mg2 doneen 1964 has evolved eq 7 for assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation based on the pi which can be classified as class i 75 class ii 25 75 and class iii 25 orders 7 pi na hco3 ca2 mg2 na 100 another parameter to find the suitability of water for irrigation is residual mg2 ca2 ratio the residual ratio was calculated using eq 8 below kumar et al 2007 8 residual ratio mg2 ca2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l based on the standard classification system richards 1954 11 11 of the samples falling into the good 66 67 falling into permissible 16 67 falling into the doubtful and the remaining 5 56 unsuitable signifying high salinity hazard for irrigational practice revelle index is widely known parameter to assess groundwater quality in contrary to irrigation water quality indexes ri as contamination indexes is generally used to determine contamination of groundwater for human consumption lobo ferreira et al 2005 used this index to assess seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer in india similarly zaharin et al 2009 classified the salinization of groundwater in the shallow aquifer of a tropical island in sabah malaysia using this index based on these studies seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer and so salinization of groundwater in güzelyurt area were evaluated using eq 9 below revelle 1941 9 ri cl hco3 co3 2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l thus ri 0 5 unaffected ri between 0 5 6 6 slightly affected ri 6 6 strongly affected zaharin et al 2009 revelle 1941 4 discussion the results obtained for the various parameters are then analysed in detail these values and relevant discussions are forwarded below salinity diagram utilized for salinity and sodium hazard gave results for sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc percent of sodium na magnesium adsorption ratio mar kelly s index ki total hardness th permeability index pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and electrical conductivity ec only sar values indicated excellent groundwater quality while others indicated good quality with the exception of mar which was unsuitable in conclusion the study revealed the safe use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes in the study the ph of the groundwater samples fall within the ph range 6 5 8 4 recommended for irrigation purposes bauder et al 2010 fao 1985 the high doc value in sample 1 and 18 is probably because of intensive use of organic fertilisers such as manure from dairy farm activities around these wells subsurface microbial activity and mobility are enhanced by microbial oxygen availability which is directly affected by high doc concentrations thayalakumaran et al 2015 for this reason further microbial analysis should be carried out on sample 1 and 18 to reveal rate and type of microbial contamination in the area ec and sar of the water samples plotted on the ussl diagram fig 4 ussl 1954 indicates that only sample 15 falls in the field of c2s1 indicating excellent irrigation water properties in the study area 5 of the rsc values showed doubtful rsc value and rest of the samples are within the safe category for irrigation purposes since the sum of co3 2 and hco3 in the water samples is lower than sum of ca2 and mg2 most of the results are in the negative form this means that there is not any residual co3 2 to react with na to aggravate the alkali hazard in the soil abdel satar et al 2017 the computed na reveals the following based on todd 1960 classification 5 56 of the water samples from the study area are within the excellent class 61 11 are within good class 22 22 are within permissible and 11 11 are doubtful in the analysed groundwater samples mar values are evaluated as follows the mar values exceeding 50 is considered harmful and unsuitable for irrigation use naseem et al 2010 this implies that the groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation use due to the high mg2 ratios according to paliwal 1972 classification 94 44 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigational practice the reason of these high mg2 ratios in the area is probably basaltic pillow lavas and olivine diabase which were eroded from troodos mountains and transported by the rain to the lower güzelyurt basin the ki values of groundwater samples in güzelyurt area vary from 0 22 to 2 15 and it is known that a kelly s index of more than 1 indicates an excess level of na in waters thus the values indicate the good quality of the groundwater for irrigation purpose only four water samples have ki values more than 1 th values between showed that 66 67 of the groundwater samples fall in very hard water category and 32 33 fall in hard category according to classification of groundwater based on total hardness sawyer and mccarthy 1967 hard irrigation water in the area might cause blocking problems in dripping systems in the present study the minimum and maximum permeability values indicate the following on the basis of pi classification the groundwater in the study area falls under class i and ii and hence the water is considered suitable for irrigation residual mg2 ca2 ratio values revealed that 44 44 of the water samples from studying area are within safe 44 44 samples are within moderately safe and only 11 11 samples are within unsuitable category the total concentration of soluble salts salinity hazard in irrigation water can be expressed in terms of ec which is the most important water quality guideline on crop productivity osmotic activity of plants decreases by excessive salinity thereby hindering the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil the results indicated 11 11 of the samples are good 66 67 permissible 16 67 doubtful and the remaining 5 56 unsuitable thus it can be said that high salinity hazard is present for irrigational practice the studied samples were not analysed in terms of drinking water quality however since the seawater intrusion is an ongoing problem in the area ri was calculated to assess the salinization according to ri classification 16 67 of samples n 3 are unaffected 72 22 of samples n 13 are slightly affected and 11 11 of samples n 2 are strongly affected from the seawater intrusion the relationship between the ri and cl concentrations showed a strong positive linear relationship r 0 95 p 0 05 this linear relationship indicates seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater zaharin et al 2009 strongly affected areas are where sample 1 and sample 18 were collected thus precautions should be taken to prevent seawater intrusion in these areas in order to ensure good quality irrigation water the salinity findings complied with the 2015 güzelyurt aquifer salinity map prepared by the geology and mining department of north cyprus as for the effects on plants water samples collected in the scope of this project mainly used for the irrigation of fields where intensive vegetable cultivation is carried out type of the vegetable samples in each field was recorded while water samples have been collected some plants are more susceptible to the electrical conductivity than others and each specie has an electrical conductivity threshold beyond which yield is decreased based on the ec and ph values of the irrigation water crop yield and suitability of the water for specific crops were evaluated table 9 it is known that best crop yield can be obtained between ph 6 5 7 00 however ph of the water samples in this area are in the alkaline range farmers with the guidance of agricultural engineers are used to add nitric and phosphoric acid into fertilizers to decrease the ph of the environment citrus trees have less resistance against salinity comparing to various crops according to experienced agricultural engineers working in the field yeild can be decreased by 50 with ec values more than 3000 μs cm for this reason some of the water samples in the area which have ec values close or above 3000 μs cm are not suitable for the irrigation of citrus trees the most important thing is to find appropriate crop to be cultivated in available irrigation water properties 5 conclusions regarding the water management issues the following precautions are deemed necessary for the idealized and optimistic irrigation water management not only in general but especially in güzelyurt region a prevention of leaks at water supply networks b efficient reuse of the wastewater in country including the treated water at haspolat plant c modernization of irrigation methods coupled with necessary scientific training of producers d setting up drainage and irrigation systems and relevant planning and management e desalination projects should be considered at coastal areas in conformance with feasibility studies f new licenses for water well drilling should not be granted and stopped by law g private water well owners must be inspected regarding water use and strict penalties must be set for those overusing and especially selling water which in fact belongs to the state as underground resources as for quality wise the groundwater in güzelyurt area has been evaluated for its chemical composition and suitability for agricultural purposes the groundwater of the study area indicated slightly alkaline to alkaline hard to very hard conditions while major cations are in the order of na mg2 ca2 k and the major anions are in the order of cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 the concentration of heavy metals as cd cr hg pb and fe in groundwater samples were complying with the guideline limits with an order of fe cr as pb hg cd according to sar rsc na ki pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and ec results the quality of güzelyurt groundwater was generally suitable for irrigation while mar values showed unsuitable values for irrigation purposes this can be explained by excess amount of mg2 in the samples the observed high mg2 concentrations resulted from basaltic pillow lavas and olivine diabase which belong to troodos ophiolite revelle index showed that 16 67 of samples are unaffected 72 22 of the samples are slightly affected and 11 11 of samples are strongly affected from the seawater intrusion 
10942,the aim of the research is to shed light on the irrigation water management in güzelyurt region in north cyprus and to assess the groundwater quality a screenshot is taken for the water management system whereas private wells and state owned artificial lakes and water wells are utilized on cost basis for irrigation purposes as well as the water arriving from turkey through pipelines crossing the mediterranean the management methodology was studied and representative groundwater samples collected from different villages were analysed for physicochemical parameters and contamination main cations indicated na mg2 ca2 k while anions showed cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 in conformance with irrigation water standards on the other hand concentration of heavy metals were all below the threshold limits with the order fe cr as pb hg cd seawater intrusion was determined by revelle index and ca2 mg2 cl was the predominant hydrochemical facies while us salinity laboratory diagram was utilized for salinity and sodium hazard various ratios and indices were also utilized in detail to uncover the quality conformance of the irrigation water in use only sodium adsorption ratio sar values indicated excellent groundwater quality while others indicated good quality with the exception of magnesium adsorption ratio mar which was unsuitable in conclusion the study revealed the safe use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes keywords groundwater heavy metal contamination irrigation water quality irrigation techniques physicochemical parameter water management 1 introduction water resource management includes planning developing distributing and optimized managing of water resources not only quantity but the quality of groundwater is also decreasing nowadays due to increasing population and industrial activities overuse of fertilizers in agricultural products and intensive farming therefore management of water resources takes its top priority position on the agenda of countries especially those with significant agricultural activities that is why it is also very important to identify both physical and chemical composition of groundwater for the assessment of quality for various uses such as human consumption agricultural and industrial activities poor quality of irrigation water may also concentrate salts and other toxic elements in soils and change their physical and chemical conditions leading to some negative effects on crop yield and food safety in north cyprus agriculture is one of the main economic activities this is why not only in north cyprus as a whole but specifically in güzelyurt area water management is of utmost importance also because the region hosts the most extensive aquifer of cyprus exploited since 1957 for municipal and irrigation water supply however sea water intrusion has severely affected the aquifer quality due to extensive withdrawal and resulted in physical chemical and microbiological changes in the water quality irrigation associations were founded and policies were set to manage and schedule the convenient distribution of the water to the producers for continuity and sustainability the mega project of bringing water from turkey to northern cyprus through the mediterranean has been completed in 2015 this international water diversion project as the first of its kind in the world is supplying 75 million cubic meters of water annually for a time span of 50 years municipality water reached the main inhabited areas of lefkoşa 67 km girne 161 km mağusa 154 km and dipkarpaz 95 km although the municipal water for the consumption of inhabitants is completed it has not reach the irrigation areas yet until this is realized current water resources will continue to be used and this is why the current study collected samples from these resources and quality tests were performed a similar study was also carried in the same area in 1987 81 groundwater samples were collected from different municipal irrigation and observation wells to evaluate both domestic and agricultural quality of güzelyurt basin gökçekuş and doyuran 1997 like our current study the irrigation waters were found to be hard to very hard and slightly alkaline to alkaline within the scope of the ussl diagram the majority of the samples just like the current study fell into the groups c3s1 and c3s2 groups indicating high salinity low to medium alkali hazard even though the hydrochemical facies is na so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl the study put forth the finding as ca2 mg2 cl resembling the current study the sar values were found to be below 10 and classified as excellent na values were found to be higher than the current study values heavy metal contamination was not studied current water resources in north cyprus are administratively twofold state owned artificial dams and water wells and private owned water wells state owned artificial dams and water wells are administered by irrigation associations a president and elected five members administer and manage the distribution of the water to the producers on a voluntary base at specified dates and time periods these village based associations provide the necessary amount of water at a specified price on pre designated dates and hours in this way when associations are on duty water resources can be better managed as to the amount and time of consumption per producer however under the circumstances when the water wells are private owned control and inspection is absent and is thus against the general rule that underground resources belong to everyone the associations collect and prepare a pond and render it full to be ready for pumping water to the agricultural fields through pvc pipes generally water is supplied once per week to each of the fields and around 25 30 tons is suggested per decare although the cost of water changes from village to village it changes between 0 14 0 29 euros ton the cost is dependent on different parameters varying for different villages in general the high cost of electricity is the principal factor negatively affecting the affordability of the irrigation water however this is also dependent on the depth of the water wells and for shallow wells cost of electricity is reduced as one of the foremost management issues the amount of water and the method of irrigation adopted should be optimized in accordance with the agricultural requirements of the specific plants for instance springer irrigation system is adopted for citrus fruits and horticultural crops while for potatoes on the other hand drip irrigation system is adopted some incidents also negatively affect management procedures some of which are below 1 leakage is present to a certain extent at both previously constructed and current water transportation pipe systems 2 licenses for drilling new water wells are granted without any scientific consideration 3 certain water well owners are producing water at extra high amounts and sell the water without any administrative permission 4 the nicosia bi communal wastewater treatment plant funded by undp pff united nations development programme partnership for the future and commissioned in april 2014 serves nicosia s two divided communities it has a capacity to produce ten million cubic metres of treated water annually though only partially utilized 5 the installation of pipelines to supply the water from turkey has not yet been completed and in addition management and pricing policies are not yet set in the study current water resources were evaluated in terms of irrigation water quality collecting representative water samples from groundwater wells which are currently used to water agricultural fields in the area in general quality of water is judged by four important parameters salinity hazard ec sodium hazard sar residual sodium carbonate hazard rsc and toxicity hazard michael 1978 the physiochemical characteristics of the groundwater have been assessed and irrigation water quality was evaluated by some determining factors such as sar rsc sodium percentage na magnesium adsorption ratio mar kelly s index ki total hardness th permeability index pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and ec with reference to their suitability for irrigation in addition to all these parameters ri was also calculated to see if the groundwater is mixed with seawater toxicity hazard of the groundwater has been investigated by determining as cd cr hg pb and fe concentrations thus one of the mentioned aims of the study was fulfilled which are essential for crop yield and food safety 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is located within the güzelyurt basin at the north western part of cyprus bounded by utm coordinates 475 000 507 000 e longitude and 3 887 000 3 896 000 n latitude with an average elevation of 65 m fig 1 the figure also shows the sampling locations and covers more than 85 of the total agricultural activities part of the study area was an old copper mine where intensive ore processing activities took place the estimated population of the selected area is 30 037 and has a semi arid mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters the precipitation ranges between 276 355 mm year temperature between 18 3 19 2 c and relative humidity between 68 71 güzelyurt plain is characterised as a slightly sloping coastal plain and central parts where agriculture is mainly carried out is characterised as flat terrain there are some elevated hills rising from north east to south west and except these hills the gradient of the area is about 1 ergil 2000 the major occupation of the people is agriculture in güzelyurt while some livestock farming also exist citrus which meets all needs of the island is the symbol of the area it is very vital in the economy of country covering 40 percent of currency input into the export of island some other vegetables and fruits like melon water melon strawberry carrot potatoes molehiya pepper eggplant etc are also cultivated in these fertile agricultural lands in the güzelyurt plain the groundwater occurs under unfractured unconfined aquifer conditions within the semi consolidated and weakly cemented fanglomerates and younger alluvial surficial deposits in general the geological map of the basin comprises permeable deposits consisting of various proportions of gravel sand clay coastal sand and fluvial sediments fig 2 in the western part of the area around lefke and yeşilırmak upper part of the troodos ophiolite which contains impervious basaltic pillow lavas and diabase are present this pillowed and sheet lava flows include olivine and pyroxene phyric with abundant dikes and sills and altered to zeolite facies from place to place some reef limestones and marls are outcropping besides these lithological units permeable semi permeable deposits of calcarenite marly gravel chalks and marls are also seen in the southern part of the studying area the maximum thickness of the aquifer is 100 m at the far western part and it gradually thins out eastward away from the coastline reducing to 40 m ergil 2000 the coastline is almost 12 km long and it consists of alluvium and sand with different ratios of gravels and pebbles 2 2 sample collection and preservation a total of 18 groundwater samples from the water wells ranging from 18 to 91 m deep were collected in the dry season in september 2016 from different inhabited areas which were used in the irrigation of various agricultural fields under study aydınköy taşpınar doğancı yeşilyurt yedidalga yeşilırmak güneşköy lefke cengizköy bostancı zümrütköy güzelyurt geographical locations were recorded at each sampling site using a hand held garmin etrex 30x gps shown in fig 2 two sets of water samples were collected from each sampling site one set for physicochemical parameters and the other one for trace metal analysis sampling was carried out after operating the pumps for five minutes for homogenizing and temperature stabilisation to measure reliable ec redox potential eh and ph values the water samples for trace metal analysis were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles pre soaked in 20 diluted hno3 for overnight and subsequently rinsed with distilled water the sampling bottles were rinsed with the sample water itself 2 3 times to mitigate the chance of any contamination 2 ml of concentrated hno3 was added into each sample to decrease the ph below 2 for the stabilisation of metal ions in the solution the water samples were kept in an ice box at 4 c transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until further analyses in addition to the above an extra 500 ml water sample for each location was also collected for physicochemical analysis some aliquots of these samples were filtered acidified with h2so4 and stored in glass containers at 4 c in the dark for dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn analysis the other part was kept at 4 c for the following parameters to be tested sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 carbonate co3 2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 during all these processes standard sampling and preservation procedures apha 2005 were followed 2 3 measurements and analysis measurements of temperature ph ec eh and dissolved oxygen were carried out three times at each sampling site inolab ph 7110 was used to measure ph and oxi 3210 was used for the temperature and do for the ph electrode standardization was performed daily with ph 4 ph 7 and ph 10 buffers in some wells do values seemed to be high probably due to contamination with atmosphere eh was measured with a platinum combination sentix orp reference electrode prior to the measurement accuracy of the equipment was checked by orp calibrating solution rh 28 220 mv at 25 c ec μs cm 1 values of the samples was measured using a conductivity meter cond600 eutech instruments doc was analysed using a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn shimadzu and tn was measured using a total nitrogen measuring unit tnm 1 shimadzu the concentrations of na and k were determined using a flame photometer jenway pfp 7 edta titrimetric method was used to determine ca² and mg² concentrations the presence of so4² was determined with turbidimetric method using uv visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm wavelength providing a light path of 10 cm alkalinity primarily hco3 and co3² was measured by titration using phenolphthalein and bromocresol green indicators cl was determined using potassium chromate indicator and titrating the samples with standard silver nitrate titrant to a pinkish yellow end point the procedures used were specified in apha 2005 to ensure quality all the samples were analysed in triplicates using analytical grade reagents the concentrations of the total heavy metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for as cd cr hg pb and fe epa 6020a 2007 method was used for the determination of the element contents the limit of detections of as cd cr hg pb and fe were 0 002 0 002 0 01 0 002 0 002 and 0 2 μg l respectively on the other hand the quantification limits of as cd cr hg pb and fe were determined as 0 01 0 01 0 05 0 01 0 01 and 1 μg l respectively the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were not less than 0 999 quality assurance was achieved by triplicate determination of the samples and the data were presented as mean standard error of mean sem all calculations were conducted using microsoft excel version 2013 statistical analyses were carried out using statistical package for social science spss version 20 usa physicochemical parameters were presented as means all heavy metal concentrations were presented as means and standard error of mean the location map and geological map of the study are were prepared by using arc gis version 9 3 chemical characteristic of the groundwater was determined by piper diagram using aquachem version 2014 1 which is useful in the classification of the groundwater types according to different hydro geochemical facies ussl diagram sar vs ec which helps to access the suitability of water for irrigation purpose was also prepared using aquachem 3 results 3 1 chemical properties of groundwater the measured physicochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 which are statistically analysed to include mean minimum maximum standard deviation cv and skewness values table 2 water ph is a very important parameter on which chemical reactions are dependent since the mobility and solubility of minerals are affected adversely by the water ph samantara et al 2017 in the study the ph of the groundwater samples are convenient for irrigation purposes fao 1985 the ec values in the studied samples were also within the acceptable range below 3000 μs cm while eh values in the groundwater samples ranged from 177 10 to 284 mv mean 233 98 mv indicated oxidation conditions except sample 1 and sample 18 doc values were below 4 mg l which is frequently encountered in unpolluted aquifers regan et al 2017 in the studied samples the concentrations of na mg2 ca2 and k varied largely as well as the cl hco3 so4² and co3² probably due to the proximity of the coast and thus seawater the presence of high cl content in well 1 and well 18 is derived from seawater intrusion as it was verified by ri pearson correlation coefficient matrix of physicochemical parameters are presented in table 3 the table indicates certain positive correlation between the parameters for instance ec showed a strong correlation with ca 2 mg 2 na and cl at the significance level of p 0 01 a good linear correlation of ec with na and cl implies that the increase in ec is directly related to salinity the concentrations of major ions of 18 groundwater samples were plotted on the piper diagram to classify and compare hydrochemical facies water types based on their ionic compositions fig 3 on the cationic triangle the samples fall within the no dominant type na k dominant type and mg2 dominant type on the anionic triangle the samples can be classified as no dominant type cl dominant type and hco3 co3 2 dominant type in this figure i stands for nacl ii for cahco3 iii for canahco3 iv for camgcl v for cacl and vi for nahco3 type five groundwater facies can be identified on the diamond of the piper plot based on the major ion chemistry of the groundwater of this area with a decreasing order of na mg2 ca2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 for cations and anions respectively the type of the facies are ca2 hco3 type na cl type mixed ca2 na hco3 type mixed ca2 mg2 cl type and ca2 cl type however based on hydrochemical facies the type of water that predominates in the study area is ca2 mg2 cl ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 water types represent fresh groundwater or freshwater which has recently infiltrated or temporary hard water obviously na cl type represents water that is enriched by salinity occurrence of ca2 mg2 cl type clearly hints that na cl mix with fresh groundwater ca2 mg2 hco3 causing salinization of the groundwater the hydrochemical facies indicate alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 exceeded alkali metals na k and strong acid cl so4 2 exceeded weak acid hco3 co3 2 heavy metals are the most important pollutants that can cause serious problems to human health although less dangerous than drinking water due to direct consumption irrigation water pollutants are also dangerous as they enter the human body indirectly through the food chain arslan et al 2016 concentrations of as cd cr hg pb and fe in groundwater samples are presented in table 4 all the results for as cd cr hg pb and fe are below the fao guideline limits setting for irrigation water the order of heavy metals in groundwater samples are fe cr as pb hg cd 3 2 evaluation of irrigation water quality physicochemical parameters were intensively utilized to assess the irrigation water quality table 5 after designating the detailed findings additional parameters were also calculated such as sar rsc na mar ki th pi and residual mg2 ca2 ratio table 6 these parameters along with ec are of utmost importance for evaluating the suitability of the studied water samples for irrigation the water quality was assessed by the following physicochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl and so4 2 it was observed that 8 of the samples indicated values exceeding the permissible limits for mg2 the findings also showed that one of the samples provided a value that exceeded the permissible limit for cl the sodium hazard is expressed as the sodium adsorption ratio it effects infiltration rate of water nag and lahiri 2012 water is drawn by the plants through enhanced cation exchange reactions in soil sar governs this action and is defined as sodium hazard in agriculture under limiting conditions the limiting condition in turn occurs when na replaces ca2 and mg2 in soil rendering it compact and impervious joshi et al 2009 the potential for a sodium hazard increases in waters with higher sar values sar was computed by eq 1 below richards 1954 1 sar na ca2 mg2 2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l sar values in the study area are given in table 7 which are within the excellent class and acceptable for irrigation according to the classification in table 8 to assess the suitability of water for irrigation purposes ec and sar of the water samples plotted on the ussl diagram fig 4 ussl 1954 the diagram illustrates that 78 of the groundwater samples fall in the field of c3s1 and c3s2 indicating high salinity and low to medium alkali hazard nearly 17 of the groundwater samples fall in the field of c4s1 and c4s2 indicating very high salinity and low to medium alkali hazard rsc is another important parameter which indicates the hazardous effect of co3 2 and hco3 on irrigation water the movement of water and air in the soil might be prevented by blocking the soil pores up with the salt which is formed due to the continuous use of water having rsc above 2 5 meq l sudhakar and narsimha 2013 rsc was computed by eq 2 below raghunath 1987 2 rsc hco3 co3 2 ca2 mg2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the sodium in groundwater is usually denoted as na sodium percentage high concentrations of na relative to ca2 and mg2 in groundwater reacts with soil and decreases its permeability leading to deterioration of soil structure thereby stunting plant growth richards 1954 na can be computed with respect to relative proportions of cations present in water using eq 3 below todd 1960 3 na na k ca2 mg2 na k 100 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l generally mg2 presents less than ca2 in groundwater due to the fact that earth crust is rich in ca2 comparing to mg2 and also mg2 rich dolomites cannot dissolve easily to release mg2 into groundwater however in some special cases mg2 can exist in higher amount comparing to ca2 in groundwater which comes from mg2 rich olivine basalts serpentines ultrabasic rocks and dolomites şahinci 1991 excess mg2 present in waters affects the crop growth and yield as the soils become more alkaline and saline bhat and jeelani 2015 in addition infiltration problems are appeared in the soils as they contain high levels of exchangeable mg2 fao 1985 richards la us salinity laboratory 1954 named mg2 ca2 ratio as magnesium hazard mh when this ratio exceeds 4 in the groundwater adsorption of na by soil increases at the same level of salinity and sar because the bonding energy of mg2 is less than that of ca2 which causes more na adsorption and this takes place when the ratio is more than 4 michael 1978 except sample 11 the study area have lower mg2 ca2 ratios than 4 which shows no threat of infiltration problem for soil from the groundwater szabolcs and darab 1964 was suggested eq 4 for the calculation of mar 4 mar mg2 ca2 mg2 100 where all the ions are expressed in meq l kelly 1940 was computed a significant parameter to evaluate irrigation water quality based on the level of na measured against sum of ca2 and mg2 eq 5 5 ki na ca2 mg2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l total hardness is a natural characteristic of groundwater which is important especially for domestic and industrial usage of water it is enhanced especially by dissolved ca2 and mg2 which are mostly leached from soils and become common constituents of natural waters samantara et al 2017 hardness of the water has no known adverse effects however it causes scale formation in pipes reduces the aesthetic quality of water and efficiency of water treatment and increases soap consumption sojobi 2016 it was believed that water hardness leads to cardiovascular diseases and leukaemia however further studies investigated negative relationship between them edmunds and smedley 1996 th was calculated by eq 6 below todd 1960 6 th 2 497 ca2 4 11 mg2 doneen 1964 has evolved eq 7 for assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation based on the pi which can be classified as class i 75 class ii 25 75 and class iii 25 orders 7 pi na hco3 ca2 mg2 na 100 another parameter to find the suitability of water for irrigation is residual mg2 ca2 ratio the residual ratio was calculated using eq 8 below kumar et al 2007 8 residual ratio mg2 ca2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l based on the standard classification system richards 1954 11 11 of the samples falling into the good 66 67 falling into permissible 16 67 falling into the doubtful and the remaining 5 56 unsuitable signifying high salinity hazard for irrigational practice revelle index is widely known parameter to assess groundwater quality in contrary to irrigation water quality indexes ri as contamination indexes is generally used to determine contamination of groundwater for human consumption lobo ferreira et al 2005 used this index to assess seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer in india similarly zaharin et al 2009 classified the salinization of groundwater in the shallow aquifer of a tropical island in sabah malaysia using this index based on these studies seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer and so salinization of groundwater in güzelyurt area were evaluated using eq 9 below revelle 1941 9 ri cl hco3 co3 2 where all the ions are expressed in meq l thus ri 0 5 unaffected ri between 0 5 6 6 slightly affected ri 6 6 strongly affected zaharin et al 2009 revelle 1941 4 discussion the results obtained for the various parameters are then analysed in detail these values and relevant discussions are forwarded below salinity diagram utilized for salinity and sodium hazard gave results for sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc percent of sodium na magnesium adsorption ratio mar kelly s index ki total hardness th permeability index pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and electrical conductivity ec only sar values indicated excellent groundwater quality while others indicated good quality with the exception of mar which was unsuitable in conclusion the study revealed the safe use of the groundwater for irrigation purposes in the study the ph of the groundwater samples fall within the ph range 6 5 8 4 recommended for irrigation purposes bauder et al 2010 fao 1985 the high doc value in sample 1 and 18 is probably because of intensive use of organic fertilisers such as manure from dairy farm activities around these wells subsurface microbial activity and mobility are enhanced by microbial oxygen availability which is directly affected by high doc concentrations thayalakumaran et al 2015 for this reason further microbial analysis should be carried out on sample 1 and 18 to reveal rate and type of microbial contamination in the area ec and sar of the water samples plotted on the ussl diagram fig 4 ussl 1954 indicates that only sample 15 falls in the field of c2s1 indicating excellent irrigation water properties in the study area 5 of the rsc values showed doubtful rsc value and rest of the samples are within the safe category for irrigation purposes since the sum of co3 2 and hco3 in the water samples is lower than sum of ca2 and mg2 most of the results are in the negative form this means that there is not any residual co3 2 to react with na to aggravate the alkali hazard in the soil abdel satar et al 2017 the computed na reveals the following based on todd 1960 classification 5 56 of the water samples from the study area are within the excellent class 61 11 are within good class 22 22 are within permissible and 11 11 are doubtful in the analysed groundwater samples mar values are evaluated as follows the mar values exceeding 50 is considered harmful and unsuitable for irrigation use naseem et al 2010 this implies that the groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation use due to the high mg2 ratios according to paliwal 1972 classification 94 44 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigational practice the reason of these high mg2 ratios in the area is probably basaltic pillow lavas and olivine diabase which were eroded from troodos mountains and transported by the rain to the lower güzelyurt basin the ki values of groundwater samples in güzelyurt area vary from 0 22 to 2 15 and it is known that a kelly s index of more than 1 indicates an excess level of na in waters thus the values indicate the good quality of the groundwater for irrigation purpose only four water samples have ki values more than 1 th values between showed that 66 67 of the groundwater samples fall in very hard water category and 32 33 fall in hard category according to classification of groundwater based on total hardness sawyer and mccarthy 1967 hard irrigation water in the area might cause blocking problems in dripping systems in the present study the minimum and maximum permeability values indicate the following on the basis of pi classification the groundwater in the study area falls under class i and ii and hence the water is considered suitable for irrigation residual mg2 ca2 ratio values revealed that 44 44 of the water samples from studying area are within safe 44 44 samples are within moderately safe and only 11 11 samples are within unsuitable category the total concentration of soluble salts salinity hazard in irrigation water can be expressed in terms of ec which is the most important water quality guideline on crop productivity osmotic activity of plants decreases by excessive salinity thereby hindering the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil the results indicated 11 11 of the samples are good 66 67 permissible 16 67 doubtful and the remaining 5 56 unsuitable thus it can be said that high salinity hazard is present for irrigational practice the studied samples were not analysed in terms of drinking water quality however since the seawater intrusion is an ongoing problem in the area ri was calculated to assess the salinization according to ri classification 16 67 of samples n 3 are unaffected 72 22 of samples n 13 are slightly affected and 11 11 of samples n 2 are strongly affected from the seawater intrusion the relationship between the ri and cl concentrations showed a strong positive linear relationship r 0 95 p 0 05 this linear relationship indicates seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater zaharin et al 2009 strongly affected areas are where sample 1 and sample 18 were collected thus precautions should be taken to prevent seawater intrusion in these areas in order to ensure good quality irrigation water the salinity findings complied with the 2015 güzelyurt aquifer salinity map prepared by the geology and mining department of north cyprus as for the effects on plants water samples collected in the scope of this project mainly used for the irrigation of fields where intensive vegetable cultivation is carried out type of the vegetable samples in each field was recorded while water samples have been collected some plants are more susceptible to the electrical conductivity than others and each specie has an electrical conductivity threshold beyond which yield is decreased based on the ec and ph values of the irrigation water crop yield and suitability of the water for specific crops were evaluated table 9 it is known that best crop yield can be obtained between ph 6 5 7 00 however ph of the water samples in this area are in the alkaline range farmers with the guidance of agricultural engineers are used to add nitric and phosphoric acid into fertilizers to decrease the ph of the environment citrus trees have less resistance against salinity comparing to various crops according to experienced agricultural engineers working in the field yeild can be decreased by 50 with ec values more than 3000 μs cm for this reason some of the water samples in the area which have ec values close or above 3000 μs cm are not suitable for the irrigation of citrus trees the most important thing is to find appropriate crop to be cultivated in available irrigation water properties 5 conclusions regarding the water management issues the following precautions are deemed necessary for the idealized and optimistic irrigation water management not only in general but especially in güzelyurt region a prevention of leaks at water supply networks b efficient reuse of the wastewater in country including the treated water at haspolat plant c modernization of irrigation methods coupled with necessary scientific training of producers d setting up drainage and irrigation systems and relevant planning and management e desalination projects should be considered at coastal areas in conformance with feasibility studies f new licenses for water well drilling should not be granted and stopped by law g private water well owners must be inspected regarding water use and strict penalties must be set for those overusing and especially selling water which in fact belongs to the state as underground resources as for quality wise the groundwater in güzelyurt area has been evaluated for its chemical composition and suitability for agricultural purposes the groundwater of the study area indicated slightly alkaline to alkaline hard to very hard conditions while major cations are in the order of na mg2 ca2 k and the major anions are in the order of cl hco3 so4 2 co3 2 the concentration of heavy metals as cd cr hg pb and fe in groundwater samples were complying with the guideline limits with an order of fe cr as pb hg cd according to sar rsc na ki pi residual mg2 ca2 ratio and ec results the quality of güzelyurt groundwater was generally suitable for irrigation while mar values showed unsuitable values for irrigation purposes this can be explained by excess amount of mg2 in the samples the observed high mg2 concentrations resulted from basaltic pillow lavas and olivine diabase which belong to troodos ophiolite revelle index showed that 16 67 of samples are unaffected 72 22 of the samples are slightly affected and 11 11 of samples are strongly affected from the seawater intrusion 
10943,crop productivity under controlled drainage was studied in long term field experiment with shallow fluctuating water table in north eastern italy fourteen years of hydrological and yield data including winter wheat sugarbeet soybean and maize were collected over two monitoring periods 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 controlled drainage cd and free drainage fd were tested in combination with open ditches o and subsurface pipes p systems cd reduced outflow waters by 69 respect to fd wheat produced on average 4 9 t ha 1 p system was more productive up to 14 2 in drier years characterized by sparse and more intense spring rainfalls due to reduced runoff and increased infiltration o system was more productive up to 27 9 in wet years with frequent rainfalls after sowing as water was removed faster from soil surface avoiding waterlogging soybean produced on average 3 2 t ha 1 with higher yield 5 7 more in p probably due to better and more uniform topsoil moisture conditions sugarbeet sucrose production showed no univocal response to cd as a great variety of factors were involved in determining root growth and sucrose concentration maize yield had great variability among the years depending on weather however the best results were always obtained with cd up to 14 5 t ha 1 of grain showing a definite increase in productivity on average with cd grain maize produced 27 3 more and silage maize 4 0 more the benefits of cd on maize yield were more pronounced in years with wet springs followed by summer droughts subirrigation in cd helped to achieve higher yields when soil moisture content was declining due to prolonged dry periods in our environment cd proved to be extremely helpful in reducing water outflows and increasing maize yield mitigating drought stress keywords water table management land drainage system crop yield maize soybean winter wheat sugarbeet 1 introduction the wide diffusion of artificial drainage in agricultural fields raised concerns about water conservation and surface water pollution borin et al 1997 drury et al 2009 skaggs et al 2012 wesström and messing 2007 in temperate regions with rainy autumns and springs and dry summers controlled drainage was developed to harvest rainwater in fields characterized by shallow groundwater evans et al 1995 gilliam and skaggs 1986 husk et al 2017 controlled drainage was developed with the main purpose of reducing water and nutrient losses from agricultural fields by retaining rainfall water in the soil or in delivery ditches control structures installed directly on drainage pipes or at the outlet of open ditches regulate the water flowing from agricultural fields since nitrogen and phosphorus losses from agricultural fields are of main concern for water pollution and eutrophication of surface waters and seas boesch and brinsfield 2000 controlled drainage gained an increasing interest in the last decades skaggs et al 2012 specifically it has been effectively applied to reduce both n and p losses to surface waters mainly by reducing water outflows but also to lower water nitrogen concentrations through denitrification processes kalita and kanwar 1993 borin et al 2001 wesström et al 2001 environmental benefits are more pronounced during autumn and winter especially with bare soil and right after fertilizer application since this period is the rainiest and contributes the most to water and nutrient losses controlled drainage is particularly efficient drury et al 1996 in certain conditions controlled drainage can support crop growth by increasing soil water content through the regulation of the water table level delbecq et al 2012 wesström et al 2014 for this purpose controlled drainage can be associated with subirrigation practices as reported by lu 2015 madramootoo et al 1993 and satchithanantham et al 2014 yield increases are usually obtained with summer crops when water harvested in spring supports plants growth skaggs et al 2012 some successful results were also obtained with winter cereals in sweden where the pedoclimatic conditions and the shallow water table permitted to lower the mineralization rate and increase nitrogen utilization by the crop and crop yield wesström et al 2014 in rare cases the use of controlled drainage can reduce crop production due to excess soil water content and reduced soil trafficability this can be avoided with a careful management of the control structures helmers et al 2012 since results may vary depending on climatic and pedological characteristics and on the weather course of each year cooke and verma 2012 thorp et al 2008 long term data is needed to assess the effects of controlled drainage on crop yield in different environments and under different weather conditions so far no experiences in this field have been reported for mediterranean area in this context the drainage basin of venice lagoon in north eastern italy offers an opportunity to study the effects of controlled drainage application as characterized by flat lands and a shallow phreatic groundwater at the same time though the large fluctuation of the water table level during the year is a peculiar trait whose impacts are worth to be investigated for this reason a field trial was set up in 1995 in this area by the university of padova to study the effects of controlled drainage on nutrient losses and on crop production this work aims at evaluating the efficacy of controlled drainage in affecting crop yield from the beginning of the experiment in 1995 analyzing two monitoring periods 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 the application of water table management is tested in combination with two land drainage systems subsurface pipes and open ditches 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment is located into the experimental farm l toniolo in legnaro 45 20 53 n 11 57 11 e 6 m above sea level in the padano valley north eastern italy the padano valley is a plain region of fluvial origin with fertile conditions for intensive crop cultivation soil is classified as fluvi calcaric cambisol cmcf with a loamy silty loam texture iuss working group wrb 2014 and is characterized by sandy vein at the depth of 80 cm and below the carbonate content is high 32 the total limestone and ph sub basic 7 6 8 1 an impermeable layer at about 3 m depth allows the creation of a shallow phreatic groundwater data on main soil hydrological properties is reported in table 1 values were obtained from undisturbed soil samples up to 2 m depth for each soil layer soil water content at saturation field capacity and wilting point is reported the climate zone is part of the cfa class in köppen classification rubel et al 2017 it is a warm temperate climate with hot summers water surplus is common in autumn and spring while water stress often occurs in summer weather data was collected from the meteorological station of the national agency for environmental protection arpav rainfall and temperature were measured and reference evapotranspiration et₀ was calculated with hargreaves formula locally calibrated berti et al 2014 annual mean temperature is 13 5 c annual average minimum temperature is 8 7 c and annual average maximum temperature is 18 6 c the month with the lowest average minimum temperature is january 0 15 c while the month with the highest average maximum temperature is july 29 5 c 2 2 experimental scheme the experiment was first set up in 1996 in a 5 5 ha wide area the experimental design is a split plot with 3 blocks it is organized into 12 plots of 0 3 0 5 ha each at the end of each a delivery ditch collects runoff and drainage water fig 1 outlines the experimental design the main studied factor is water table management in the northern part of the field the water table level is regulated with controlled drainage technique cd in the outlet ditch of each cd plot a control structure is installed to reduce water outflows and increase water table level and soil moisture in the field eventually subirrigation can be applied in cd plots as described in bonaiti and borin 2010 in the southern part of the trial drainage water is free to flow away fd free drainage since no control structure is installed in the delivery ditches controlled drainage plots are isolated from free drainage plots with a pvc film buried into the soil to the depth of 1 5 m the second studied factor is the land drainage system in half of the plots excess water is removed trough open ditches o in the other half through subsurface pipes p these are the two land drainage systems most widely used in our region borin et al 1997 a total of 4 theses with three replicates each are tested cd o controlled drainage with open ditches cd p controlled drainage with subsurface pipes fd o free drainage with open ditches fd p free drainage with subsurface pipes phreatimeters are installed at the center of each plot to measure water table level and collect groundwater samples for chemical analysis at the outlet of each delivery ditch after the control structure in cd plots a turbine flow meter is installed it is used both to monitor outflow volumes and to collect outflow water samples the water that flows out from each plot is transported to the pump of the wetland in the northern part of the field for further treatment of agricultural pollutants in o plots two ditches are dug up to the depth of 0 6 m at a 30 m distance from each other in p plots pvc pipes are installed at 0 8 m depth at 12 m distance from each other the delivery ditches that collect the outflow water of each plot are dug up to a depth of 1 2 m at the outlet of these ditches in cd plots modular pvc risers are installed to regulate outflows in fd plots risers are not installed and the water is free to flow away the water retained inside cd outlet ditches raises the water table level inside the fields in the northern part of the field a surface flow constructed wetland collects all the water outflows from the 12 plots for further treatment of water pollutants in the southern part the meteorological station of the regional agency for environmental protection

subirrigation cultivated crops included winter wheat sugarbeet soybean and maize in non strict crop rotation especially in the last years of the experiment maize was cultivated more often and a higher n rate was applied basic information on crop and fertilizer management 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 is reported in table 2 in general tillage operations included ploughing and harrowing for all the cultivated crops mouldboard plough to 35 cm was carried out either right after manure or liquid manure application to incorporate the organic amendment into the soil or closer to sowing if only mineral fertilizers were applied harrowing was carried before seeding crop residues of sugarbeet soybean and maize were incorporated with ploughing while wheat straw was removed and used as livestock bedding by the farm water table level was generally monitored once twice a month and right after significant rainfall events outflow water volumes were measured each time discharge occurred through the flow meters at the outlet of the collecting ditches marketable yield of each plot was harvested and dried at 65 c for 48 h data on crop production water table level and outflow water volumes were collected during two monitoring periods from 1995 to 2002 and from 2006 to 2013 hydrological years october to september were considered in calculating water balance this work updates and extends the partial results presented by borin et al 2002 on the first years of crop production providing a broader and longer term perspective that permits to better identify the factors involved in determining crop yield in our experiment further results on nutrient losses from the system are reported in bonaiti and borin 2010 and tolomio and borin 2018 yield data was fitted to a mixed effect model year

differences between the groups since plots were organized into a split plot design and year was considered as the overlying factor anova was performed considering a split split plot scheme these choices were made upon the considerations of bennington and thayne 1994 first the interactions between year and other factors were of particular interest for this study to justify the study of year as a fixed effect second too few years were monitored for each crop to consider that factor as a random term third main plots for the study of the water table regulation factor were not subject to complete randomization within the year factor as the same plots were examined each year thus creating the conditions to consider the experimental scheme as a split split plot the residuals of the model were visually checked and satisfied the anova assumptions of normality and of homogeneity of variance graphs and statistical analysis were obtained using r software r core team 2018 and statistica 8 software statsoft inc 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 water dynamics the trends of monthly rainfall and et₀ fig 2 top show that water surplus is more common in autumn and winter when rainfall is usually greater and evapotranspiration smaller water deficit is more frequent in summer because of the high evapotranspiration rate during the years monitored in this study november october and may had greater rainfall with an average of 85 80 and 80 mm respectively july june and august had greater et₀ with 167 153 and 147 mm respectively thus a greater risk of water shortage occurs for summer crops while winter crops may be adversely affected by waterlogging subirrigation was applied to cd fields during the maize cropping season 1996 97 1997 98 1999 00 and sugarbeet cropping season 2006 07 pumping into the system a total of 419 259 290 and 233 mm of water respectively the water table level fig 2 middle usually drops during summer and rises again in autumn this clearly reflects the rainfall and et₀ trend in cd plots risers height was kept at 90 cm below ground level during the first two years then set to 40 cm for most of the experimental period from november 2010 to march 2013 risers height was set to 15 cm below ground level and lowered again to 40 cm only when water started to flow again from the cultivated fields during subirrigation the control structures were temporarily raised to ground level to prevent losses of water during the intervention in our environment the cd system did not create a stable water table level throughout all the seasons rather the drop of the water table was lagged with respect to fd during periods following heavy rains and during prolonged dry periods consistently with the groundwater dynamics water discharge fig 2 bottom was more common during winter dry periods were characterized by deeper water table levels and flat lines in the cumulative outflow curves overall fd p showed the greatest water losses on average 182 mm y 1 cd reduced water discharge by 69 respect to fd in line with the values reported by skaggs et al 2012 in their review further information of water dynamics as well as on nutrient losses are provided in bonaiti and borin 2010 and tolomio and borin 2018 3 2 crop production year by year marketable yield of each crop is reported in table 3 while p values of the anova are reported in table 4 maize was cultivated more often than any other crop this led to a high variability in maize productivity due to the different weather conditions of each year nonetheless maize grain production was on average 26 3 greater in cd than in fd sugarbeet had a different response to water table management depending on the year soybean was on average 5 7 more productive in p treatment as expected for a winter crop wheat grain yield was not significantly influenced by water table regulation being rather dependent on the interaction between the land drainage system and the weather course of each year in the following sections an in depth analysis of crop yield is provided 3 2 1 winter wheat during the experimental period wheat was the only winter crop cultivated grain yield data of 1998 99 2001 02 and 2008 09 are reported in table 3 1998 99 had the lowest average grain production in the experimental period 4 0 t ha 1 while 2008 09 resulted in the highest yield on average 5 9 t ha 1 in general wheat productivity showed to be sensitive to the interaction between year and land drainage system adopted while no effect was reported for water table regulation table 4 in 1998 99 plots with pipe drainage were more productive than plots with open ditches on average 14 2 more while in 2008 09 winter wheat showed higher average yield with the open ditches system 27 9 more the effect of the drainage system didn t show a definite direction in 1998 99 growing conditions were more favorable with subsurface pipes while in 2008 09 with open ditches due to the different drainage and soil water dynamics the open ditches system that is widely used in our area borin et al 1997 is designed to provide faster water removal from the soil surface the additional slope in the direction of the open ditches produces greater surface runoff in addition cannell et al 1980 highlighted that excess water in winter can be a major limiting factor in wheat grain production while extra water from spring rainfalls can be crucial to avoid wheat drought stresses during drier years in our case 1998 1999 was generally dry with poor autumn and winter precipitation and spring rainfalls characterized by low frequency and high intensity fig 3 left especially in june with 3 events of 62 30 and 39 mm d 1 each open ditches removed excess water coming from high intensity rainfalls faster than subsurface pipe system reducing infiltration and water storage in the topsoil due to this particular weather trend 1998 99 was the only year when water discharge was greater in fd o than in fd p respectively with 131 and 78 mm wheat drought stress of later growth stages could have been mitigated more efficiently in the pipe system considering the described hydrological conditions on the contrary 2008 09 was one of the rainiest years 36 above the average and rainfall events were more frequent in autumn and winter fig 3 right open ditches could have reduced the risk of water logging at the initial stages of wheat growth as reported by sands 2001 tile drainage systems have the capacity to provide extra water storage sponge effect due to greater infiltration and reduced runoff this can lead to a more effective utilization of rainwater coming from higher frequency but lower intensity precipitations but also to higher risk of waterlogging during wetter periods as regards the water table control it didn t significantly affect wheat production skaggs et al 2012 showed that controlled drainage in general does not affect winter crop even though results may vary depending on the specific environment where it is applied for example wesström and messing 2007 found an increase in cereals grain yield with controlled drainage in sweden however respect to us their site was characterized by a shallower and more stable water table level in our environment winter wheat showed to be more sensitive to the land drainage system adopted rather than to water table regulation rainfall frequency and intensity soil infiltration rate and surface runoff phenomena played an important role in determining the productivity of this crop 3 2 2 sugarbeet sugarbeet was cultivated in 1997 98 and 2007 08 sucrose production is reported in table 3 the crop was more productive in 2007 08 14 4 t ha 1 of sucrose on average than in 1997 98 9 5 t ha 1 in june and july 1998 259 mm of water were applied with subirrigation into the outlet ditches of controlled drainage plots despite subirrigation in 1998 cd showed a slight reduction in sucrose production on average 5 4 less than fd and greater variability on the other hand in 2008 fields with water table regulation produced on average 10 1 more with higher variability in fd plots as reported in table 4 the effect on productivity of the interaction between year and water table management was significant while the effect of water table management itself was not this indicates that the influence of controlled drainage on sucrose yield was not univocal in the two years sucrose production is determined by both root weight and sucrose concentration which are influenced in various ways by water availability and soil nutrient content fabeiro et al 2003 reported that medium to severe water restriction in summer did not decrease sugarbeet production while increasing water use efficiency in a study in our same site vamerali et al 2009 reported that sugarbeet root growth was influenced by water availability soil nitrogen content and the combination of both the effect of water availability was not univocal at different levels of nitrogen supply with fluctuating water table and alternate drought stress periods these dynamics can strongly influence root growth and in turn sucrose yield due to the complexity of factors involved and to the limitations of data in our possession we do not feel like providing in depth interpretations of our results we do feel like stressing however that in our environment the use of controlled drainage and of subirrigation with sugarbeet at field scale should be carefully planned 3 2 3 soybean soybean was cultivated in 1995 96 and 2000 01 grain production is reported in table 3 overall subsurface pipe system produced slightly more than open ditches 5 7 more maybe due to better and more uniform moisture conditions of the topsoil at early stages of plant growth the increase in crop yield was statistically significant table 4 on the other hand water table control did not provide meaningful increases in productivity opposed to what could be expected for a summer crop madramootoo et al 1993 reported clear increases in soybean yield only in dry summers when water table was maintained at an optimal level through the whole growing period so that topsoil moisture was at a constantly higher level 3 2 4 maize maize was cultivated in 1996 97 1999 00 2006 07 2010 11 2011 12 and 2012 13 grain production of 1997 2000 2007 and 2012 and silage production of 2011 and 2013 is reported in table 3 subirrigation was applied in 1997 2000 and 2007 as maize was cultivated so often it was easier to define controlled drainage effects on that crop under various weather conditions in silage maize production only differences between the years were obtained in 2011 the average harvested biomass was of 15 5 t ha 1 in 2013 of 13 3 t ha 1 results coming from data analysis of grain yield confirm the expectations of a general increase in productivity with water table regulation table 4 in agreement with what reported by skaggs et al 2012 2012 was extremely dry with only 557 mm of rain throughout the whole hydrological year as a result of this and of a heavy hailstorm event in the summer maize grain productivity was extremely low in all the fields on average 1 3 t ha 1 on the contrary 2007 was the year with the highest average productivity 12 4 t ha 1 1997 and 2000 showed the same average yield 9 3 t ha 1 but in 2000 cd plots produced 27 9 more and in 1997 only 4 7 as subirrigation was applied in both years and soil moisture was monitored too information on rainfall subirrigation and soil moisture are reported in fig 4 as an example overall 1997 was a wetter year with rainfall more homogeneously distributed during the year and subirrigation applied for a longer period in july august and september in comparison 2000 was generally drier with spring rainfalls more concentrated in late march and early april providing a greater increase in the gap of soil moisture between controlled drainage and free drainage fields after subirrigation was applied for a short period at the end of july the gap increased even further soil moisture in free drainage continued with the decreasing trend while in controlled drainage it was able to maintain a more stable profile weather differences of the years and timing and amount of water applied with subirrigation played an important role in the final outcome of controlled drainage on crop yield as reported by skaggs et al 2012 controlled drainage has greater effects on yield in years with alternation of wet periods and moderately long periods poole et al 2013 also showed the effects of cd were weakly correlated to the growing season rainfall but more influenced by the amount of water conserved in the profile and by the timing by which water was available for plants during certain growth stages finally as reported by delbecq et al 2012 crucial factors in determining crop growth are the amount and timing of precipitation as well as the frequency by which water table and risers are managed in our study controlled drainage effectiveness in increasing maize productivity was unequivocal but the magnitude of its effect was dependent on the weather course of each year subirrigation was more efficient in increasing soil water content in drier periods suggesting that the application of this practice should be planned within the framework of the weather course of each year in terms of both timing and amount 4 conclusions our work focused on the effects of water table management and land drainage system on crop yield two monitoring periods were analyzed 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 cultivated crops included winter wheat sugarbeet soybean and maize water table depth of controlled drainage system was slightly shallower and had smaller fluctuations than free drainage water table management reduced water outflows of 69 on average winter wheat production was influenced mainly by the land drainage system adopted depending on the weather course open ditches system produced greater surface water runoff limiting the risk of water logging especially in early stages of wheat growth subsurface pipe system had greater water infiltration and was more beneficial in years with poor winter precipitation and occasional heavy spring rainfalls since more water infiltrated the soil as regards summer crops soybean production didn t show yield differences with controlled drainage application while sugarbeet and maize did sugarbeet sucrose production showed an ambiguous response to water table regulation probably due to the complexity of the factors determining sucrose yield in our environment controlled drainage and subirrigation may not be beneficial for sugarbeet if not adjusted to root growth dynamics maize showed the most promising results with water table regulation it was cultivated for 6 years during our experiment and this permitted to observe the effects of controlled drainage and subirrigation on crop yield under various weather conditions overall maize cultivated for grain produced 26 3 more with controlled drainage and silage maize 4 0 more controlled drainage was more effective in dry years when water harvested in the fields mitigated drought stress eventually subirrigation helped to achieve higher soil water content and productivity its efficiency depending on the weather course in general summer crops with deeper roots sugarbeet and maize were more sensitive to the differences in soil water content produced by controlled drainage in the deeper layers winter crops wheat and summer crops with shallower roots soybean were more sensitive to the land drainage system adopted as it influences more topsoil moisture in our area controlled drainage and subirrigation were with no doubt effective in reducing water outflows even if stable and shallow groundwater level was not reached in addition positive and encouraging effects on maize yield were always reported even though they were dependent on rainfall amount intensity and

10943,crop productivity under controlled drainage was studied in long term field experiment with shallow fluctuating water table in north eastern italy fourteen years of hydrological and yield data including winter wheat sugarbeet soybean and maize were collected over two monitoring periods 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 controlled drainage cd and free drainage fd were tested in combination with open ditches o and subsurface pipes p systems cd reduced outflow waters by 69 respect to fd wheat produced on average 4 9 t ha 1 p system was more productive up to 14 2 in drier years characterized by sparse and more intense spring rainfalls due to reduced runoff and increased infiltration o system was more productive up to 27 9 in wet years with frequent rainfalls after sowing as water was removed faster from soil surface avoiding waterlogging soybean produced on average 3 2 t ha 1 with higher yield 5 7 more in p probably due to better and more uniform topsoil moisture conditions sugarbeet sucrose production showed no univocal response to cd as a great variety of factors were involved in determining root growth and sucrose concentration maize yield had great variability among the years depending on weather however the best results were always obtained with cd up to 14 5 t ha 1 of grain showing a definite increase in productivity on average with cd grain maize produced 27 3 more and silage maize 4 0 more the benefits of cd on maize yield were more pronounced in years with wet springs followed by summer droughts subirrigation in cd helped to achieve higher yields when soil moisture content was declining due to prolonged dry periods in our environment cd proved to be extremely helpful in reducing water outflows and increasing maize yield mitigating drought stress keywords water table management land drainage system crop yield maize soybean winter wheat sugarbeet 1 introduction the wide diffusion of artificial drainage in agricultural fields raised concerns about water conservation and surface water pollution borin et al 1997 drury et al 2009 skaggs et al 2012 wesström and messing 2007 in temperate regions with rainy autumns and springs and dry summers controlled drainage was developed to harvest rainwater in fields characterized by shallow groundwater evans et al 1995 gilliam and skaggs 1986 husk et al 2017 controlled drainage was developed with the main purpose of reducing water and nutrient losses from agricultural fields by retaining rainfall water in the soil or in delivery ditches control structures installed directly on drainage pipes or at the outlet of open ditches regulate the water flowing from agricultural fields since nitrogen and phosphorus losses from agricultural fields are of main concern for water pollution and eutrophication of surface waters and seas boesch and brinsfield 2000 controlled drainage gained an increasing interest in the last decades skaggs et al 2012 specifically it has been effectively applied to reduce both n and p losses to surface waters mainly by reducing water outflows but also to lower water nitrogen concentrations through denitrification processes kalita and kanwar 1993 borin et al 2001 wesström et al 2001 environmental benefits are more pronounced during autumn and winter especially with bare soil and right after fertilizer application since this period is the rainiest and contributes the most to water and nutrient losses controlled drainage is particularly efficient drury et al 1996 in certain conditions controlled drainage can support crop growth by increasing soil water content through the regulation of the water table level delbecq et al 2012 wesström et al 2014 for this purpose controlled drainage can be associated with subirrigation practices as reported by lu 2015 madramootoo et al 1993 and satchithanantham et al 2014 yield increases are usually obtained with summer crops when water harvested in spring supports plants growth skaggs et al 2012 some successful results were also obtained with winter cereals in sweden where the pedoclimatic conditions and the shallow water table permitted to lower the mineralization rate and increase nitrogen utilization by the crop and crop yield wesström et al 2014 in rare cases the use of controlled drainage can reduce crop production due to excess soil water content and reduced soil trafficability this can be avoided with a careful management of the control structures helmers et al 2012 since results may vary depending on climatic and pedological characteristics and on the weather course of each year cooke and verma 2012 thorp et al 2008 long term data is needed to assess the effects of controlled drainage on crop yield in different environments and under different weather conditions so far no experiences in this field have been reported for mediterranean area in this context the drainage basin of venice lagoon in north eastern italy offers an opportunity to study the effects of controlled drainage application as characterized by flat lands and a shallow phreatic groundwater at the same time though the large fluctuation of the water table level during the year is a peculiar trait whose impacts are worth to be investigated for this reason a field trial was set up in 1995 in this area by the university of padova to study the effects of controlled drainage on nutrient losses and on crop production this work aims at evaluating the efficacy of controlled drainage in affecting crop yield from the beginning of the experiment in 1995 analyzing two monitoring periods 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 the application of water table management is tested in combination with two land drainage systems subsurface pipes and open ditches 2 materials and methods 2

water surplus is common in autumn and spring while water stress often occurs in summer weather data was collected from the meteorological station of the national agency for environmental protection arpav rainfall and temperature were measured and reference evapotranspiration et₀ was calculated with hargreaves formula locally calibrated berti et al 2014 annual mean temperature is 13 5 c annual average minimum temperature is 8 7 c and annual average maximum temperature is 18 6 c the month with the lowest average minimum temperature is january 0 15 c while the month with the highest average maximum temperature is july 29 5 c 2 2 experimental scheme the experiment was first set up in 1996 in a 5 5 ha wide area the experimental design is a split plot with 3 blocks it is organized into 12 plots of 0 3 0 5 ha each at the end of each a delivery ditch collects runoff and drainage water fig 1 outlines the experimental design the main studied factor is water table management in the northern part of the field the water table level is regulated with controlled drainage technique cd in the outlet ditch of each cd plot a control structure is installed to reduce water outflows and increase water table level and soil moisture in the field eventually subirrigation can be applied in cd plots as described in bonaiti and borin 2010 in the southern part of the trial drainage water is free to flow away fd free drainage since no control structure is installed in the delivery ditches controlled drainage plots are isolated from free drainage plots with a pvc film buried into the soil to the depth of 1 5 m the second studied factor is the land drainage system in half of the plots excess water is removed trough open ditches o in the other half through subsurface pipes p these are the two land drainage systems most widely used in our region borin et al 1997 a total of 4 theses with three replicates each are tested cd o controlled drainage with open ditches cd p controlled drainage with subsurface pipes fd o free drainage with open ditches fd p free drainage with subsurface pipes phreatimeters are installed at the center of each plot to measure water table level and collect groundwater samples for chemical analysis at the outlet of each delivery ditch after the control structure in cd plots a turbine flow meter is installed it is used both to monitor outflow volumes and to collect outflow water samples the water that flows out from each plot is transported to the pump of the wetland in the northern part of the field for further treatment of agricultural pollutants in o plots two ditches are dug up to the depth of 0 6 m at a 30 m distance from each other in p plots pvc pipes are installed at 0 8 m depth at 12 m distance from each other the delivery ditches that collect the outflow water of each plot are dug up to a depth of 1 2 m at the outlet of these ditches in cd plots modular pvc risers are installed to regulate outflows in fd plots risers are not installed and the water is free to flow away the water retained inside cd outlet ditches raises the water table level inside the fields in the northern part of the field a surface flow constructed wetland collects all the water outflows from the 12 plots for further treatment of water pollutants in the southern part the meteorological station of the regional agency for environmental protection

site was characterized by a shallower and more stable water table level in our environment winter wheat showed to be more sensitive to the land drainage system adopted rather than to water table regulation rainfall frequency and intensity soil infiltration rate and surface runoff phenomena played an important role in determining the productivity of this crop 3 2 2 sugarbeet sugarbeet was cultivated in 1997 98 and 2007 08 sucrose production is reported in table 3 the crop was more productive in 2007 08 14 4 t ha 1 of sucrose on average than in 1997 98 9 5 t ha 1 in june and july 1998 259 mm of water were applied with subirrigation into the outlet ditches of controlled drainage plots despite subirrigation in 1998 cd showed a slight reduction in sucrose production on average 5 4 less than fd and greater variability on the other hand in 2008 fields with water table regulation produced on average 10 1 more with higher variability in fd plots as reported in table 4 the effect on productivity of the interaction between year and water table management was significant while the effect of water table management itself was not this indicates that the influence of controlled drainage on sucrose yield was not univocal in the two years sucrose production is determined by both root weight and sucrose concentration which are influenced in various ways by water availability and soil nutrient content fabeiro et al 2003 reported that medium to severe water restriction in summer did not decrease sugarbeet production while increasing water use efficiency in a study in our same site vamerali et al 2009 reported that sugarbeet root growth was influenced by water availability soil nitrogen content and the combination of both the effect of water availability was not univocal at different levels of nitrogen supply with fluctuating water table and alternate drought stress periods these dynamics can strongly influence root growth and in turn sucrose yield due to the complexity of factors involved and to the limitations of data in our possession we do not feel like providing in depth interpretations of our results we do feel like stressing however that in our environment the use of controlled drainage and of subirrigation with sugarbeet at field scale should be carefully planned 3 2 3 soybean soybean was cultivated in 1995 96 and 2000 01 grain production is reported in table 3 overall subsurface pipe system produced slightly more than open ditches 5 7 more maybe due to better and more uniform moisture conditions of the topsoil at early stages of plant growth the increase in crop yield was statistically significant table 4 on the other hand water table control did not provide meaningful increases in productivity opposed to what could be expected for a summer crop madramootoo et al 1993 reported clear increases in soybean yield only in dry summers when water table was maintained at an optimal level through the whole growing period so that topsoil moisture was at a constantly higher level 3 2 4 maize maize was cultivated in 1996 97 1999 00 2006 07 2010 11 2011 12 and 2012 13 grain production of 1997 2000 2007 and 2012 and silage production of 2011 and 2013 is reported in table 3 subirrigation was applied in 1997 2000 and 2007 as maize was cultivated so often it was easier to define controlled drainage effects on that crop under various weather conditions in silage maize production only differences between the years were obtained in 2011 the average harvested biomass was of 15 5 t ha 1 in 2013 of 13 3 t ha 1 results coming from data analysis of grain yield confirm the expectations of a general increase in productivity with water table regulation table 4 in agreement with what reported by skaggs et al 2012 2012 was extremely dry with only 557 mm of rain throughout the whole hydrological year as a result of this and of a heavy hailstorm event in the summer maize grain productivity was extremely low in all the fields on average 1 3 t ha 1 on the contrary 2007 was the year with the highest average productivity 12 4 t ha 1 1997 and 2000 showed the same average yield 9 3 t ha 1 but in 2000 cd plots produced 27 9 more and in 1997 only 4 7 as subirrigation was applied in both years and soil moisture was monitored too information on rainfall subirrigation and soil moisture are reported in fig 4 as an example overall 1997 was a wetter year with rainfall more homogeneously distributed during the year and subirrigation applied for a longer period in july august and september in comparison 2000 was generally drier with spring rainfalls more concentrated in late march and early april providing a greater increase in the gap of soil moisture between controlled drainage and free drainage fields after subirrigation was applied for a short period at the end of july the gap increased even further soil moisture in free drainage continued with the decreasing trend while in controlled drainage it was able to maintain a more stable profile weather differences of the years and timing and amount of water applied with subirrigation played an important role in the final outcome of controlled drainage on crop yield as reported by skaggs et al 2012 controlled drainage has greater effects on yield in years with alternation of wet periods and moderately long periods poole et al 2013 also showed the effects of cd were weakly correlated to the growing season rainfall but more influenced by the amount of water conserved in the profile and by the timing by which water was available for plants during certain growth stages finally as reported by delbecq et al 2012 crucial factors in determining crop growth are the amount and timing of precipitation as well as the frequency by which water table and risers are managed in our study controlled drainage effectiveness in increasing maize productivity was unequivocal but the magnitude of its effect was dependent on the weather course of each year subirrigation was more efficient in increasing soil water content in drier periods suggesting that the application of this practice should be planned within the framework of the weather course of each year in terms of both timing and amount 4 conclusions our work focused on the effects of water table management and land drainage system on crop yield two monitoring periods were analyzed 1995 2002 and 2006 2013 cultivated crops included winter wheat sugarbeet soybean and maize water table depth of controlled drainage system was slightly shallower and had smaller fluctuations than free drainage water table management reduced water outflows of 69 on average winter wheat production was influenced mainly by the land drainage system adopted depending on the weather course open ditches system produced greater surface water runoff limiting the risk of water logging especially in early stages of wheat growth subsurface pipe system had greater water infiltration and was more beneficial in years with poor winter precipitation and occasional heavy spring rainfalls since more water infiltrated the soil as regards summer crops soybean production didn t show yield differences with controlled drainage application while sugarbeet and maize did sugarbeet sucrose production showed an ambiguous response to water table regulation probably due to the complexity of the factors determining sucrose yield in our environment controlled drainage and subirrigation may not be beneficial for sugarbeet if not adjusted to root growth dynamics maize showed the most promising results with water table regulation it was cultivated for 6 years during our experiment and this permitted to observe the effects of controlled drainage and subirrigation on crop yield under various weather conditions overall maize cultivated for grain produced 26 3 more with controlled drainage and silage maize 4 0 more controlled drainage was more effective in dry years when water harvested in the fields mitigated drought stress eventually subirrigation helped to achieve higher soil water content and productivity its efficiency depending on the weather course in general summer crops with deeper roots sugarbeet and maize were more sensitive to the differences in soil water content produced by controlled drainage in the deeper layers winter crops wheat and summer crops with shallower roots soybean were more sensitive to the land drainage system adopted as it influences more topsoil moisture in our area controlled drainage and subirrigation were with no doubt effective in reducing water outflows even if stable and shallow groundwater level was not reached in addition positive and encouraging effects on maize yield were always reported even though they were dependent on rainfall amount intensity and

10944,the role of irrigation water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool for irrigation developments has been strongly upheld while the ability and willingness to pay wtp of smallholder farmers for irrigation water could profoundly determine sustainability of irrigation projects little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing based on direct survey of smallholder farmers wtp particularly from drier regions of the globe such as the sahel here we economically evaluate the consequences of irrigation water pricing through a direct survey of farmers wtp and the factors that affect farmers wtp for irrigation supply improvements we collected unique data through a double bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of smallholder irrigation farmers in eritrea eritrea has set pricing guidelines designed to reflect irrigation water as an economic good while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert as well as being home to globally the poorest smallholder farmers bivariate probit and logistic regression models were employed for data analysis and revealed 1 some 54 of the farmers perceived water as an economic good 2 about 76 of the farmers were willing to pay the initial offered bid for irrigation water and 3 the average wtp of farmers was about 5 of average farm income our results further indicated that initial bid land tenure security age of a farmer households income from irrigation farming and source of water being used are all significant determinants of farmers wtp for irrigation water supply improvement overall our findings provide evidence that smallholder farmers are willing to pay for increased volumes of water for irrigation purposes and suggest that public private partnerships for the storage and delivery of water for irrigation could be economically feasible even in poor countries such as eritrea keywords willingness to pay irrigation water water pricing smallholder farmers the sahel 1 introduction the challenge of freshwater scarcity has been intensified with growing economies increasing population agricultural expansion urbanization and changing climatic patterns luo et al 2015 the increasing demand and dwindling supply of freshwater requires prudent decisions on allocations among its competing uses continuous and intensified pressure on freshwater resources leads to tensions conflicts among users and environmental pressure thus the scarcity of fresh water is of an issue of great concern for life s future and development prospects fao 2017 agriculture faces the greatest risk of freshwater scarcity and accounts for up to 70 of the annual freshwater withdrawal iwmi 2006 in particular many farmers in sub saharan africa and the sahel are massively affected by water scarcity due to the subsistence nature of their farms and the multidimensional vulnerability of their livelihoods xie et al 2014 because of their geographical position to the sahara countries in the sahel are particularly affected further the effects of climate change on water availability with negative consequences for agricultural is viewed as one of the greatest threats to poverty eradication and prospects of economic and social development in africa de wit and stankiewicz 2006 thus the development challenge is to optimize the available water and to reallocate water especially during dry seasons through integrating effective conservation practices in this regard the role of water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool of irrigation development has been strongly upheld introducing water pricing mechanisms might be essential for achieving the goals of water use efficiency financial sustainability and equity dinar and mody 2004 in fact cost recovery pricing schemes have been the most common motive for countries to introduce irrigation water pricing easter and liu 2005 the ability and willingness to pay for water services could significantly determine the sustainability of irrigation projects in developing countries particularly in the projects involving smallholder farmers where there is willingness to pay wtp for water supply services revenues generated from water charges can be used to augment supplies and create an incentive to water use efficiency easter and liu 2005 given this background however little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers based on direct survey of farmers wtp for irrigation water particularly the case of farmers residing in drier regions of the world the limited empirical evidence exist is based on mainly data from east and south east asia and relatively wetter highlands of the sub saharan africa and the findings are mixed chandrasekaran et al 2009 and biswas and venkatachalam 2015 from the semi arid region of india reported that farmers are willing to pay more for irrigation water however in the arid region of north west china tang et al 2013 found that farmers are unwilling to pay for irrigation water while the existing water prices are low in light of sustainable water use and better irrigation services similarly studies from the sab saharan countries identified several farm and socioeconomic factors including education and access to training on irrigation crop income household size gender of household head and cultivated land size as significant predictors of willingness to pay kiprop et al 2017 alemayehu 2014 angella et al 2014 speelman et al 2010 surprisingly several key factors that could possibly affect farmers wtp such as the impact of land tenure systems and differences in sources of irrigation water have not been considered in those studies moreover we are not aware of any study from the sahel a region experiencing massive water crises with profound agricultural and socioeconomic implications boyd et al 2013 in this study we aim to address this gap in the literature by examining the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers in sub saharan and the sahel region of africa in particular we contribute to the literature by answering the following questions a how is the perception of smallholder farmers on water pricing b are the globally most affected by water crises and food insecurity boyd et al 2013 farmers willing to pay for irrigation water and c what factors affect farmers wtp for irrigation water the data for empirical analysis comes from a direct survey of farmers wtp for irrigation water in one of the least developed countries eritrea eritrea is an interesting country for such analysis for three reasons first despite the country s heavy investment in soil and water conservation practices to mitigate water scarcity economic incentives to reduce the growth of in water use has to date been eschewed alemngus et al 2017 second eritrea is home to the world s poorest smallholder farmers massively affected by water crises and widespread undernutrition which is typical for some parts of the sub saharan and sahel region of africa boyd et al 2013 xie et al 2014 third the country has set a proclamation and pricing guidelines designed to reflect water as an economic good proclamation 162 2010 ministry of land water and environment 2017 while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert given that scant evidence exists from such drier regions of the globe this means that our study results have more relevance to research and policy making than some earlier findings in the literature the next section provides information about eritrea s agriculture water crises and land tenure system a brief conceptual explanation is proved in section three data sources and empirical methodologies are described in section four empirical results and discussions are presented in sections five and six respectively section seven concludes 2 agriculture water crises and land tenure system in eritrea in eritrea mean air temperature varies with agro ecological zones ranging from 25 c in the highlands to 40 c in the lowlands similarly average annual rainfall is 350 mm and ranges from under 200 mm a year in the lowlands to 700 mm in the wet highlands molwe 2012 eritrea has an estimated total arable land of 1 176 000 ha out of which only 439 000 37 33 is under cultivation with 417 000 ha being under rainfed and 22 000 ha under irrigation moa 2002 the agricultural sector employs 80 of the population however it contributes only 14 5 to the annual gross domestic product gdp breuil and grima 2014 the dominant food crops in the country are sorghum teff wheat and maize through traditional mechanisms some farmers also grow cash crops such as banana citrus and mango along seasonal rivers moa 2002 irrigation in eritrea was started with the establishment of horticultural commercial farms during the italian colonization in the early 1900s moa 2002 nowadays the main types of irrigation include furrow basin and spate irrigation systems with a few newly introduced pressurized irrigation systems eritrea is not endowed with perennial rivers except the setit river which forms the border with ethiopia rainwater groundwater sources reservoirs and small seasonal rivers are the source of fresh water supply for domestic and agricultural purposes water scarcity is arguably the greatest environmental risk facing the country the world resource institute country level water scarcity estimates for 2040 has identified eritrea as one of the few countries with the highest potential of water stress in the world luo et al 2015 climate variability an increasing in demand for water low levels of investment on improving the supply and efficiency of water use a weak regulatory and enforcement mechanism for water allocation and use high level of environmental degradations low level of knowledge on the resources base are the key water management challenges facing eritrea molwe 2008 the impact of climate variability and water scarcity is highly visible in the vulnerability of the country s agricultural production as indicated by the dwindling cereal production and low permanent cropland coverage fig 1 compares the average cereal yield ha in eritrea with the cereal yield ha in the sub saharan african countries while the average cereal production per ha has shown a steady increase between the years 2000 2015 in the sub saharan africa in eritrea it is decreasing at fluctuating rates strikingly cereal crops make up the most stable food in the country but eritrea s cereal production is below half of the sub saharan african countries moreover the sahelian country has a very negligible percentage of its land area covered by permanent crops fig 2 in response to its water scarcity challenges eritrea has made huge public investment in soil and water conservation swc practices particularly dam construction and more advanced irrigation systems yet agricultural water withdrawal in eritrea still accounts for up to 94 fao 2017 as stated in the introduction the ministry of land water and environment molwe in its proclamation 162 2010 has identified water as a scarce resource in eritrea according to the proclamation water charges were expected to be applied in accordance with pricing guidelines designed to reflect water as an economic good manage demand encourage rational water use raise revenue for operation and maintenance of water systems molwe 2017 nevertheless this proclamation has not yet been implemented and there are no water tariffs or other economic incentives to encourage efficient irrigation water use it is finally important to explain the nature of land tenure system and land use arrangement in eritrea because land tenure security could possibly affect long term agricultural policy reforms under the existing land tenure system commonly referred as dessa land is owned by the state and managed by a village while every citizen has the usufruct right each village has the responsibility to allocate the land for different uses equally to all members of a community farmland is redistributed among members of the community every seven years tikabo 2003 thus villagers have lifetime usufruct right to farmland but not the same plot as the plot is redistributed to other villagers in seven years as such a farmland under this system cannot be inherited or sold but it can be leased and sharecropped on a short term basis tikabo 2003 sharecropping has an advantage in pooling resources and sharing the potential risks yet sharecropping as a form of short term land use arrangement is also criticized for its poor land use management as it creates a disincentive to invest in long term conservation practices quan 2006 3 conceptual framework willingness to pay valuation techniques are broadly classified into observed revealed and stated attitudinal preferences carson et al 2001 revealed preference refers to the forecast of change in preferences based observed market information and use this information to assign a value for non market goods goods not traded in markets stated techniques on the other hand are methods used in a situation where it might not be possible to obtain market information to value preferences therefore a researcher often collects information about consumer s preferences attitudes for environmental amenity of interest by constructing a hypothetical scenario from which respondents can choose in a survey stated preferences methods are commonly referred to as contingent valuation methods cvm mainly because they are contingent on the observed choice constructed in the survey carson et al 2001 cvm has become the most commonly used method to value non market environmental amenities mainly because of its flexibility and ability to account for the passive value of a resource there has been a controversial debate on the reliability and theoretical inconsistencies of cv estimates however many of the suspected problems with cv can be fixed by careful study design and implementation carson et al 2001 besides carson et al 2001 indicated that the claims of theoretical inconsistency of cvm s empirical findings lack supportive literature in this study a contingent valuation method was applied through a double bound dichotomous elicitation format the double bound dichotomous elicitation method is a discrete choice method of direct surveys where respondents are presented with initial bid prices following their initial responses respondents are given new prices lower price if their initial responses were no and higher price if the responses were yes haab and mcconnell 2002 the bids were designed as follows let t1 and t2 represent the initial and follow up bids respectively y is the farmer s willingness to pay that takes the value 1 if yes 0 otherwise and x is value of initial bid determined from a pilot survey then t 1 x t 2 2 x i f y t 1 1 a n d t 2 x 2 i f y t 1 0 double bound models have efficiency gains as compared to single bound models haab and mcconnell 2002 the first gain comes from the clear bounds on wtp obtained from yes no or no yes response second the no no pairs and the yes yes pairs also increase efficiency gains because additional questions even when they do not bound completely limit the part of the distribution where the respondents wtp can lie finally the number of responses is increased so that a given function is fitted with more observations that contribute to lower variances of willingness to pay 4 materials and methods 4 1 the farm survey we surveyed farm households in the southern region of eritrea in august and september 2018 we select the southern region purposely because the government is particularly making heavy investments in soil and water conservation practices micro dams and wells to mitigate water scarcity for drinking and irrigation in the region we used a two stage cluster random sampling technique to draw a sample of 202 farmers first the total number of irrigation farmers was divided into different clusters based on the geographical location of the areas with potential for irrigation development from wells and dams as a water source then four sample clusters namely sememo 42 tsilma 28 maitekela 23 and derko 7 were selected randomly from the total number of clusters finally the irrigation farmers were selected randomly from each of the selected clusters in proportion to the cluster size data were collected through face to face interviews of irrigation farmers using a structured questionnaire that included closed and open ended questions the questionnaire was designed for eliciting farmer s willingness to pay through two price bids the initial bid price and a follow up four sets of bids starting with 188 ern eritrean nakfa 12 5 us dollars 250 ern 16 7 us dollars 313 ern 20 9 us dollars and 375 25 0 us dollars per tsimdi per one time irrigation were distributed randomly and proportionally so that each farmer had the same chance of getting each initial bid 1 1 the villagers measure the size of their farmland in tsimdi which approximately is equivalent to 0 25 ha tsimdi literally means a pair and indicates the area of land a pair of oxen could plow in a day these four initial bids were determined through a pilot survey conducted prior to the main survey moreover the questionnaire included socioeconomic and demographic characteristics including household characteristics landholding and irrigation practice water source crop type and livestock households expenditure and income and households access to market and extension services 4 2 estimation strategy this study employed a bivariate probit model for estimating willingness to pay from the data collected through the double bound dichotomous elicitation method of contingent valuation survey moreover binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors that affect farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water the specification of the two models is given below the bivariate probit model is a parametric model of two response surveys in this study yes yes yes no no yes no no are the possible responses and a double bound data including two price bids obtained through contingent valuation survey was used to estimate the mean willingness to pay the most general econometric model for the double bounded data comes from the formulation w t p i j μ i ε i j where w t p i j represents the jth respondent s willingness to pay and i 1 2 represents the first and second answers the μ1 and μ2 are the means for the first and second responses then the likelihood function can be constructed from the probability of observing each of the possible two bid responses as given below haab and mcconnell 2002 p r o y e s n o p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o y e s n o p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i p r o y e s y e s p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o y e s y e s p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i i p r o n o y e s p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o n o y e s p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i i i p r o n o n o p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o n o n o p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i v then the jth contribution to the likelihood function becomes l j u t i y n i i y y i i i n y i v n n where t1 and t2 are first and second bid prices and i ii iii and iv refer to the probability equations given above yn 1 for yes no answer 0 otherwise yy 1 for yes yes answer 0 otherwise ny 1 for no yes answer 0 otherwise nn 1 for no no answer 0 otherwise this formulation is referred to as a bivariate discrete choice model in the model error terms are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and respective variances of σ2 1 and σ2 2 and therefore the wtp1j and wtp2j have a bivariate normal distribution with means μ1 and μ2 variances σ2 1 and σ2 2 and correlation coefficient ρ given the dichotomous responses to each question the normally distributed model is represented as a bivariate probit model and each respondent s contribution to the bivariate probit likelihood function can be shown as given by haab and mcconnell 2002 l j μ t φ ԑ 1 ԑ 2 d 1 j t 1 μ 1 σ 1 d 2 j t 2 μ 2 σ 2 d 1 j d 2 j ρ φ ԑ 1 ԑ 2 the bivariate normal cumulative distribution function with zero means d 1 j 2 y 1 j 1 a n d d 2 j 2 y 2 j 1 y 1 j 1 if the response to the first question is yes and 0 otherwise y 2 j 1 if the response to the second equation is yes 0 otherwise ρ is correlation coefficient and σ is standard deviation of the error assuming that the willingness to pay is normally distributed and estimating the model through maximum likelihood estimation method the mean willingness to pay was determined following haab and mcconnell 2002 m w t p α β where mwtp is the mean wtp for irrigation water use α is the intercept of the estimated model and β is coefficient of the bid values meanwhile lopez feldman 2012 has developed a customized probit command to directly estimate the mean wtp using maximum likelihood from double bound dichotomous contingent valuation surveys to estimate the factors affecting farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water the binary logistic regression model was employed following wooldridge 2012 the mathematical form of the logit model is l n p i 1 p i β 0 β i x i μ i where i refers to a given farm household β i represents parameters affecting willingness to pay for the given bid p i is the probability of i th farmer will be willing to pay for a given bid x i represents factors affecting farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water while l n p i 1 p i is the log of odds ratio in favor of willingness to pay for initially offered bid 5 results 5 1 descriptive statistics table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of sample households the average family size was found to be 5 2 persons per household which is not far from the national average of 5 7 per household debesai and lackshimi 2014 moreover 93 of the sample households cultivate a total area of less than two ha fig 3 the total average cultivated land both under rainfed and irrigated was found to be 2 15 ha per household while the average irrigated land is 0 83 ha per household irrigated land is obtained in three different ways own parcel about 0 2 ha rented land and land obtained through sharecropping as shown in fig 4 38 of the households were found to cultivate only their own parcel while 5 obtained irrigated land through only sharecropping 6 cultivate rented land and 51 cultivate their own parcel and land obtained through sharecropping the average irrigation farm income per ha measured by value output produced per season at current prices july august 2018 was estimated 159 045 eritrean nakfa ern moreover the average distance of farmstead to input and output market was found to be 2 5 km meanwhile the majority of farmers ranked the unavailability of inputs such as seeds fertilizer pesticides fuel as their first constraint for irrigation development in the study area 5 2 farmers perception on irrigation water pricing and response to offered bids an attempt was made to understand farmers understanding by asking the farmers if they agree with irrigation water pricing farmers responses to irrigation water pricing and the different reasons for both yes and no answers are summarized in table 2 the results indicate that about 46 of the total sample do not perceive irrigation water as an economic good and disagree with the concept of irrigation water charging however there is no statistically significant difference t 1 129 between the percentage of yes and no responses it gives a clue that the longstanding public nature of the resource might have contributed to this understanding moreover four set of bids were distributed randomly to elicit farmer s willingness to pay for irrigation water improvement the summary of the responses for the offered bids shows that only 3 of the sample had no response to both initial and follow up bids 30 responded no to the first bid and yes to the second bid 37 responded yes to both offered bids and 46 responded yes to the first bid and no to the second bid table 3 overall 76 of the respondents were willing to pay the initially offered bid even though there was no statistically significant difference between those who agreed with irrigation water pricing and otherwise the responses to the offered bids indicated that farmers are willing to pay for irrigation water this implies that even those farmers who perceive that irrigation water should not be priced are willing to pay the offered bids for irrigation water improvement 5 3 average willingness to pay for irrigation water improvement the average willingness to pay for irrigation water supply improvement was estimated ern 459 ha one time irrigation application table 4 this is much higher than the average initial bid ern 281 and slightly higher than the follow up bid ern 452 the farmers reported that on average 16 times harvest irrigation is required for most of the crops grown under irrigation in the study area this means the total average willingness to pay for full harvest irrigation is ern 7351 ha which is 4 6 of the average income from irrigated farms 5 4 factors affecting wtp for irrigation water improvement table 5 shows the logistic regression estimates of factors affecting farmer s willingness to pay for irrigation water and table 6 shows the average marginal effect of each variable keeping all others constant as expected farmers willingness to pay decreased significantly with increasing initial bid besides farmers perception on the scarcity of irrigation water was found to have very significant positive impact on farmers willingness to pay the probability of wtp increased by 19 with greater degree of perception on scarcity of irrigation water likewise the farmers perception on irrigation water pricing was found to have a positive and significant effect a farmer who perceives irrigation water as an economic good as indicated by the agreement on whether it should be priced was estimated to have 11 more probability of wtp than otherwise similarly income from irrigation farming was found to have positive and significant effect on farmers wtp a unit increase in irrigation farm income was estimated to increase the probability of farmer s wtp by about 9 farmers who reported insecure to the land tenure systems have expressed 15 less probability of wtp than otherwise there might be two levels of tenure insecurity in the study area first as described above land tenure system in the study area involves redistribution of farmland every seven years second the sharecropping land use arrangements practiced in the area are not enforced by law tikabo 2003 thus the land use right holder of a certain plot can make many sharecropping arrangements with different farmers in different production years seasons within the given tenancy the periodic land redistribution determines the usufruct rights of both land and water farmers with use rights to dug wells 50 5 of the sample are those farmers whom by chance have got a farm plot located near the water source usually 4 8 farmers thus a farmer who has enough capital and labor to invest in irrigation farming uses the chance or otherwise give the plot to another farmer in the form of sharecropping or short term lease the farmers reported this phenomenon as particularly common since the last land redistribution after which digging new wells has been prohibited due to environmental concerns however the quasi public nature of the dug wells has increased pressure over the existing wells resulting in over pumping of groundwater in this scenario 74 of the farmers are either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied by the irrigation water management in the study area and described it as leading to the overexploitation of underground water resources and inefficient use of the surface water fig 5 whereas the remaining 26 reported that they are satisfied mainly because they have had a chance to have a farm plot near water source which they couldn t get in the previous land tenure periods yet the latter are concerned that they may lose the opportunity soon because of another redistribution moreover age of respondent was found to have a negative impact on wtp a ten year increase in household heads age was found to be associated with a 7 decrease wtp the fact that irrigation water has been used free might have contributed to the older farmer s understanding of the resource as a free good likewise farmers who used groundwater dug well as a water source were found to have 24 4 less probability of wtp than those who use surface water dam as will be discussed below this is probably due to the differences in ownership of wells and dams moreover a farm household s distance to market was found to have a negative and significant effect on farmers wtp 6 discussion the farmers responses to the offered bids showed that sample farmers understanding on the economic properties of water is increasing the estimated willingness to pay 4 6 of farm income is close to the reports of tang et al 2013 from northwest china where farmers wtp was estimated about 6 1 and the actual amount paid by farmers was 4 4 of farm income moreover reports from pakistan ul hassan 2002 indicated that the actual charge of farmers was 2 of farm income while the operation and maintenance costs range between 3 8 3 5 of net farm income thus our findings imply that smallholder farmers might be willing to pay for reliable supply of irrigation water that is irrigation water pricing might be a feasible option of financing irrigation development projects in eritrea through private sector involvement the high demand for irrigation water supply improvement could be an incentive for private investors that gives an opportunity governments have an option for decentralized decision making and shared investment shared public private investment in irrigation water supply improvement is a growing business strategy to deal with lack of resources and managerial inefficiencies particularly faced by the developing countries public projects world bank 2018b mandri perrott and bisbey 2016 according to mandri perrott and bisbey 2016 where there is a high willingness to pay for water as an input public private partnerships ppps are potentially feasible as a means of expanding private sector in irrigation ppps can support in organizing the expertise and ensuring the medium and long term sustainability of irrigation development projects this type of irrigation projects has been practiced in countries such as egypt brazil peru and ethiopia in different forms world bank 2018b along with the dire need for investment in complementary inputs and market access there is a large scope for expansion of irrigation investment in sub saharan africa de fraiture and wichelns 2010 given the lack of previous investment in irrigation and the potential for expansion of the high wtp estimates these findings suggest that ppps are potentially feasible financing options for irrigation projects in the least developed countries such as eritrea in the analysis of factors affecting farmers wtp the negative impact of the initial bid was expected from the basic law of demand that a farmer wtp would decrease with the increasing price of irrigation water moreover the positive impact of farm income indicates that farmers who have higher marginal product of water have higher wtp similarly farmers understanding on the economic properties of irrigation water as described by water pricing and water scarcity was found to have a positive impact on wtp this implies that farmers wtp for irrigation water is affected not only by its productivity but also by the farmers understanding of the economic properties of the resource this is in line with previous studies carried in ethiopia kenya and south africa that several farm and socio economic factors also influence farmers wtp for irrigation water kiprop et al 2017 alemayehu 2014 angella et al 2014 speelman et al 2010 the negative impact of tenure insecurity was also expected as stated above sharecropping is a preferred form of land use arrangement because of the type of land tenure system exercised in the study area despite its advantages sharecropping also generates another level of tenure insecurity through its short term contracts the farmers reported that they could not plan for long term investments as their farm plots will change hands not only by the village land redistribution but also by insecure contracts with the sharecropper a recent study tesfay et al 2018 also reported that land tenure insecurity negatively influences investments in soil and water conservation practices in eritrea a saying in the study area that goes a plot under sharecropping is unblessed actually summarizes all that is a farmland under sharecropping is so cursed that it receives no care and often gives bad yield the negative impact of well borehole as a source of irrigation water could be attributed to the differences in ownership system of wells as compared to dams as described above wells are under quasi public ownership while the dams are purely public thus relative periodic control gives farmers who use wells better access to pump more water meanwhile it may not make them accountable as there were no clear entitlements through which they could be charged those who use dams however are more prone to crop failures due to the seasonal and erratic rainfall in the area thus while there are no clear water rights different sources of water imply different forms of ownership which in turn affects farmer s services and wtp lastly the negative impact of distance to market on wtp could be explained by the proximity of getting any other complementary inputs and overall integration of farm household to market considering the undeveloped market infrastructure in the study area farmers located farther from and less integrated into markets may therefore express less wtp 7 conclusion agriculture faces the greatest risk of freshwater scarcity many smallholder farmers in the sahel region are severely affected by water scarcity due to the subsistence nature of their farms and the multidimensional vulnerability of their livelihoods the role of irrigation water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool for irrigation developments has been strongly upheld although the ability and willingness to pay wtp of smallholder farmers for irrigation water could profoundly determine sustainability of irrigation projects little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing based on direct survey of smallholder farmers wtp particularly from drier regions of the globe such as the sahel in this study we address this gap in the literature by examining the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers in sub saharan and sahel region of africa using eritrean smallholder farmers as an example we specifically collected data on smallholder farmers wtp for irrigation water and the factors that affect farmers wtp for irrigation supply improvements the sahelian country is an interesting study area where lessons could be learned and extrapolated to other global areas with similar characteristics because it has set a proclamation and pricing guidelines designed to reflect irrigation water as an economic good while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert and at the same time housing some of the poorest smallholder farmers worldwide we employed bivariate probit and binary logistic regression models for data analyses results suggest that despite the longstanding public nature of irrigation water in eritrea smallholder farmers understanding of irrigation water as a free good is waning due to observed scarcity of the resource we found that on average farmers wtp for irrigation water supply in eritrea is about 5 of average household income from irrigated farms price of irrigation water source of irrigation water being well farm household s distance to market and age of the respondent were found to be negatively influencing factors whereas irrigation farm income and farmers understanding on the economic properties of irrigation water were found to have a positive effect on farmer s wtp our study estimates provide evidence that smallholder farmers might be willing to pay for increased volumes of water for irrigation purposes and suggest that public private partnerships for the storage and delivery of water for irrigation might be economically feasible even in poor countries such as eritrea moreover our work suggests that designs of irrigation water pricing schemes might need to consider land tenure policy local specific land use arrangements and differences in sources of irrigation water and their implications to ownership development of the input output markets including water markets could go hand in hand with strengthening legal and regulatory institutions for effective land and water law design and enforcement finally our study suggests that in areas where irrigation water charges have not been applied enhancing farmers understanding about the economic properties of water is an important prerequisite for effective implementation of irrigation water charging schemes conflict of interest the

10944,the role of irrigation water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool for irrigation developments has been strongly upheld while the ability and willingness to pay wtp of smallholder farmers for irrigation water could profoundly determine sustainability of irrigation projects little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing based on direct survey of smallholder farmers wtp particularly from drier regions of the globe such as the sahel here we economically evaluate the consequences of irrigation water pricing through a direct survey of farmers wtp and the factors that affect farmers wtp for irrigation supply improvements we collected unique data through a double bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of smallholder irrigation farmers in eritrea eritrea has set pricing guidelines designed to reflect irrigation water as an economic good while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert as well as being home to globally the poorest smallholder farmers bivariate probit and logistic regression models were employed for data analysis and revealed 1 some 54 of the farmers perceived water as an economic good 2 about 76 of the farmers were willing to pay the initial offered bid for irrigation water and 3 the average wtp of farmers was about 5 of average farm income our results further indicated that initial bid land tenure security age of a farmer households income from irrigation farming and source of water being used are all significant determinants of farmers wtp for irrigation water supply improvement overall our findings provide evidence that smallholder farmers are willing to pay for increased volumes of water for irrigation purposes and suggest that public private partnerships for the storage and delivery of water for irrigation could be economically feasible even in poor countries such as eritrea keywords willingness to pay irrigation water water pricing smallholder farmers the sahel 1 introduction the challenge of freshwater scarcity has been intensified with growing economies increasing population agricultural expansion urbanization and changing climatic patterns luo et al 2015 the increasing demand and dwindling supply of freshwater requires prudent decisions on allocations among its competing uses continuous and intensified pressure on freshwater resources leads to tensions conflicts among users and environmental pressure thus the scarcity of fresh water is of an issue of great concern for life s future and development prospects fao 2017 agriculture faces the greatest risk of freshwater scarcity and accounts for up to 70 of the annual freshwater withdrawal iwmi 2006 in particular many farmers in sub saharan africa and the sahel are massively affected by water scarcity due to the subsistence nature of their farms and the multidimensional vulnerability of their livelihoods xie et al 2014 because of their geographical position to the sahara countries in the sahel are particularly affected further the effects of climate change on water availability with negative consequences for agricultural is viewed as one of the greatest threats to poverty eradication and prospects of economic and social development in africa de wit and stankiewicz 2006 thus the development challenge is to optimize the available water and to reallocate water especially during dry seasons through integrating effective conservation practices in this regard the role of water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool of irrigation development has been strongly upheld introducing water pricing mechanisms might be essential for achieving the goals of water use efficiency financial sustainability and equity dinar and mody 2004 in fact cost recovery pricing schemes have been the most common motive for countries to introduce irrigation water pricing easter and liu 2005 the ability and willingness to pay for water services could significantly determine the sustainability of irrigation projects in developing countries particularly in the projects involving smallholder farmers where there is willingness to pay wtp for water supply services revenues generated from water charges can be used to augment supplies and create an incentive to water use efficiency easter and liu 2005 given this background however little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers based on direct survey of farmers wtp for irrigation water particularly the case of farmers residing in drier regions of the world the limited empirical evidence exist is based on mainly data from east and south east asia and relatively wetter highlands of the sub saharan africa and the findings are mixed chandrasekaran et al 2009 and biswas and venkatachalam 2015 from the semi arid region of india reported that farmers are willing to pay more for irrigation water however in the arid region of north west china tang et al 2013 found that farmers are unwilling to pay for irrigation water while the existing water prices are low in light of sustainable water use and better irrigation services similarly studies from the sab saharan countries identified several farm and socioeconomic factors including education and access to training on irrigation crop income household size gender of household head and cultivated land size as significant predictors of willingness to pay kiprop et al 2017 alemayehu 2014 angella et al 2014 speelman et al 2010 surprisingly several key factors that could possibly affect farmers wtp such as the impact of land tenure systems and differences in sources of irrigation water have not been considered in those studies moreover we are not aware of any study from the sahel a region experiencing massive water crises with profound agricultural and socioeconomic implications boyd et al 2013 in this study we aim to address this gap in the literature by examining the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers in sub saharan and the sahel region of africa in particular we contribute to the literature by answering the following questions a how is the perception of smallholder farmers on water pricing b are the globally most affected by water crises and food insecurity boyd et al 2013 farmers willing to pay for irrigation water and c what factors affect farmers wtp for irrigation water the data for empirical analysis comes from a direct survey of farmers wtp for irrigation water in one of the least developed countries eritrea eritrea is an interesting country for such analysis for three reasons first despite the country s heavy investment in soil and water conservation practices to mitigate water scarcity economic incentives to reduce the growth of in water use has to date been eschewed alemngus et al 2017 second eritrea is home to the world s poorest smallholder farmers massively affected by water crises and widespread undernutrition which is typical for some parts of the sub saharan and sahel region of africa boyd et al 2013 xie et al 2014 third the country has set a proclamation and pricing guidelines designed to reflect water as an economic good proclamation 162 2010 ministry of land water and environment 2017 while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert given that scant evidence exists from such drier regions of the globe this means that our study results have more relevance to research and policy making than some earlier findings in the literature the next section provides information about eritrea s agriculture water crises and land tenure system a brief conceptual explanation is proved in section three data sources and empirical methodologies are described in section four empirical results and discussions are presented in sections five and six respectively section seven concludes 2 agriculture water crises and land tenure system in eritrea in eritrea mean air temperature varies with agro ecological zones ranging from 25 c in the highlands to 40 c in the lowlands similarly average annual rainfall is 350 mm and ranges from under 200 mm a year in the lowlands to 700 mm in the wet highlands molwe 2012 eritrea has an estimated total arable land of 1 176 000 ha out of which only 439 000 37 33 is under cultivation with 417 000 ha being under rainfed and 22 000 ha under irrigation moa 2002 the agricultural sector employs 80 of the population however it contributes only 14 5 to the annual gross domestic product gdp breuil and grima 2014 the dominant food crops in the country are sorghum teff wheat and maize through traditional mechanisms some farmers also grow cash crops such as banana citrus and mango along seasonal rivers moa 2002 irrigation in eritrea was started with the establishment of horticultural commercial farms during the italian colonization in the early 1900s moa 2002 nowadays the main types of irrigation include furrow basin and spate irrigation systems with a few newly introduced pressurized irrigation systems eritrea is not endowed with perennial rivers except the setit river which forms the border with ethiopia rainwater groundwater sources reservoirs and small seasonal rivers are the source of fresh water supply for domestic and agricultural purposes water scarcity is arguably the greatest environmental risk facing the country the world resource institute country level water scarcity estimates for 2040 has identified eritrea as one of the few countries with the highest potential of water stress in the world luo et al 2015 climate variability an increasing in demand for water low levels of investment on improving the supply and efficiency of water use a weak regulatory and enforcement mechanism for water allocation and use high level of environmental degradations low level of knowledge on the resources base are the key water management challenges facing eritrea molwe 2008 the impact of climate variability and water scarcity is highly visible in the vulnerability of the country s agricultural production as indicated by the dwindling cereal production and low permanent cropland coverage fig 1 compares the average cereal yield ha in eritrea with the cereal yield ha in the sub saharan african countries while the average cereal production per ha has shown a steady increase between the years 2000 2015 in the sub saharan africa in eritrea it is decreasing at fluctuating rates strikingly cereal crops make up the most stable food in the country but eritrea s cereal production is below half of the sub saharan african countries moreover the sahelian country has a very negligible percentage of its land area covered by permanent crops fig 2 in response to its water scarcity challenges eritrea has made huge public investment in soil and water conservation swc practices particularly dam construction and more advanced irrigation systems yet agricultural water withdrawal in eritrea still accounts for up to 94 fao 2017 as stated in the introduction the ministry of land water and environment molwe in its proclamation 162 2010 has identified water as a scarce resource in eritrea according to the proclamation water charges were expected to be applied in accordance with pricing guidelines designed to reflect water as an economic good manage demand encourage rational water use raise revenue for operation and maintenance of water systems molwe 2017 nevertheless this proclamation has not yet been implemented and there are no water tariffs or other economic incentives to encourage efficient irrigation water use it is finally important to explain the nature of land tenure system and land use arrangement in eritrea because land tenure security could possibly affect long term agricultural policy reforms under the existing land tenure system commonly referred as dessa land is owned by the state and managed by a village while every citizen has the usufruct right each village has the responsibility to allocate the land for different uses equally to all members of a community farmland is redistributed among members of the community every seven years tikabo 2003 thus villagers have lifetime usufruct right to farmland but not the same plot as the plot is redistributed to other villagers in seven years as such a farmland under this system cannot be inherited or sold but it can be leased and sharecropped on a short term basis tikabo 2003 sharecropping has an advantage in pooling resources and sharing the potential risks yet sharecropping as a form of short term land use arrangement is also criticized for its poor land use management as it creates a disincentive to invest in long term conservation practices quan 2006 3 conceptual framework willingness to pay valuation techniques are broadly classified into observed revealed and stated attitudinal preferences carson et al 2001 revealed preference refers to the forecast of change in preferences based observed market information and use this information to assign a value for non market goods goods not traded in markets stated techniques on the other hand are methods used in a situation where it might not be possible to obtain market information to value preferences therefore a researcher often collects information about consumer s preferences attitudes for environmental amenity of interest by constructing a hypothetical scenario from which respondents can choose in a survey stated preferences methods are commonly referred to as contingent valuation methods cvm mainly because they are contingent on the observed choice constructed in the survey carson et al 2001 cvm has become the most commonly used method to value non market environmental amenities mainly because of its flexibility and ability to account for the passive value of a resource there has been a controversial debate on the reliability and theoretical inconsistencies of cv estimates however many of the suspected problems with cv can be fixed by careful study design and implementation carson et al 2001 besides carson et al 2001 indicated that the claims of theoretical inconsistency of cvm s empirical findings lack supportive literature in this study a contingent valuation method was applied through a double bound dichotomous elicitation format the double bound dichotomous elicitation method is a discrete choice method of direct surveys where respondents are presented with initial bid prices following their initial responses respondents are given new prices lower price if their initial responses were no and higher price if the responses were yes haab and mcconnell 2002 the bids were designed as follows let t1 and t2 represent the initial and follow up bids respectively y is the farmer s willingness to pay that takes the value 1 if yes 0 otherwise and x is value of initial bid determined from a pilot survey then t 1 x t 2 2 x i f y t 1 1 a n d t 2 x 2 i f y t 1 0 double bound models have efficiency gains as compared to single bound models haab and mcconnell 2002 the first gain comes from the clear bounds on wtp obtained from yes no or no yes response second the no no pairs and the yes yes pairs also increase efficiency gains because additional questions even when they do not bound completely limit the part of the distribution where the respondents wtp can lie finally the number of responses is increased so that a given function is fitted with more observations that contribute to lower variances of willingness to pay 4 materials and methods 4 1 the farm survey we surveyed farm households in the southern region of eritrea in august and september 2018 we select the southern region purposely because the government is particularly making heavy investments in soil and water conservation practices micro dams and wells to mitigate water scarcity for drinking and irrigation in the region we used a two stage cluster random sampling technique to draw a sample of 202 farmers first the total number of irrigation farmers was divided into different clusters based on the geographical location of the areas with potential for irrigation development from wells and dams as a water source then four sample clusters namely sememo 42 tsilma 28 maitekela 23 and derko 7 were selected randomly from the total number of clusters finally the irrigation farmers were selected randomly from each of the selected clusters in proportion to the cluster size data were collected through face to face interviews of irrigation farmers using a structured questionnaire that included closed and open ended questions the questionnaire was designed for eliciting farmer s willingness to pay through two price bids the initial bid price and a follow up four sets of bids starting with 188 ern eritrean nakfa 12 5 us dollars 250 ern 16 7 us dollars 313 ern 20 9 us dollars and 375 25 0 us dollars per tsimdi per one time irrigation were distributed randomly and proportionally so that each farmer had the same chance of getting each initial bid 1 1 the villagers measure the size of their farmland in tsimdi which approximately is equivalent to 0 25 ha tsimdi literally means a pair and indicates the area of land a pair of oxen could plow in a day these four initial bids were determined through a pilot survey conducted prior to the main survey moreover the questionnaire included socioeconomic and demographic characteristics including household characteristics landholding and irrigation practice water source crop type and livestock households expenditure and income and households access to market and extension services 4 2 estimation strategy this study employed a bivariate probit model for estimating willingness to pay from the data collected through the double bound dichotomous elicitation method of contingent valuation survey moreover binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors that affect farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water the specification of the two models is given below the bivariate probit model is a parametric model of two response surveys in this study yes yes yes no no yes no no are the possible responses and a double bound data including two price bids obtained through contingent valuation survey was used to estimate the mean willingness to pay the most general econometric model for the double bounded data comes from the formulation w t p i j μ i ε i j where w t p i j represents the jth respondent s willingness to pay and i 1 2 represents the first and second answers the μ1 and μ2 are the means for the first and second responses then the likelihood function can be constructed from the probability of observing each of the possible two bid responses as given below haab and mcconnell 2002 p r o y e s n o p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o y e s n o p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i p r o y e s y e s p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o y e s y e s p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i i p r o n o y e s p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o n o y e s p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i i i p r o n o n o p r o w t p 1 j t 1 w t p 2 j t 2 p r o n o n o p r o μ 1 ε 1 j t 1 μ 2 ε 2 j t 2 i v then the jth contribution to the likelihood function becomes l j u t i y n i i y y i i i n y i v n n where t1 and t2 are first and second bid prices and i ii iii and iv refer to the probability equations given above yn 1 for yes no answer 0 otherwise yy 1 for yes yes answer 0 otherwise ny 1 for no yes answer 0 otherwise nn 1 for no no answer 0 otherwise this formulation is referred to as a bivariate discrete choice model in the model error terms are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and respective variances of σ2 1 and σ2 2 and therefore the wtp1j and wtp2j have a bivariate normal distribution with means μ1 and μ2 variances σ2 1 and σ2 2 and correlation coefficient ρ given the dichotomous responses to each question the normally distributed model is represented as a bivariate probit model and each respondent s contribution to the bivariate probit likelihood function can be shown as given by haab and mcconnell 2002 l j μ t φ ԑ 1 ԑ 2 d 1 j t 1 μ 1 σ 1 d 2 j t 2 μ 2 σ 2 d 1 j d 2 j ρ φ ԑ 1 ԑ 2 the bivariate normal cumulative distribution function with zero means d 1 j 2 y 1 j 1 a n d d 2 j 2 y 2 j 1 y 1 j 1 if the response to the first question is yes and 0 otherwise y 2 j 1 if the response to the second equation is yes 0 otherwise ρ is correlation coefficient and σ is standard deviation of the error assuming that the willingness to pay is normally distributed and estimating the model through maximum likelihood estimation method the mean willingness to pay was determined following haab and mcconnell 2002 m w t p α β where mwtp is the mean wtp for irrigation water use α is the intercept of the estimated model and β is coefficient of the bid values meanwhile lopez feldman 2012 has developed a customized probit command to directly estimate the mean wtp using maximum likelihood from double bound dichotomous contingent valuation surveys to estimate the factors affecting farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water the binary logistic regression model was employed following wooldridge 2012 the mathematical form of the logit model is l n p i 1 p i β 0 β i x i μ i where i refers to a given farm household β i represents parameters affecting willingness to pay for the given bid p i is the probability of i th farmer will be willing to pay for a given bid x i represents factors affecting farmers willingness to pay for irrigation water while l n p i 1 p i is the log of odds ratio in favor of willingness to pay for initially offered bid 5 results 5 1 descriptive statistics table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of sample households the average family size was found to be 5 2 persons per household which is not far from the national average of 5 7 per household debesai and lackshimi 2014 moreover 93 of the sample households cultivate a total area of less than two ha fig 3 the total average cultivated land both under rainfed and irrigated was found to be 2 15 ha per household while the average irrigated land is 0 83 ha per household irrigated land is obtained in three different ways own parcel about 0 2 ha rented land and land obtained through sharecropping as shown in fig 4 38 of the households were found to cultivate only their own parcel while 5 obtained irrigated land through only sharecropping 6 cultivate rented land and 51 cultivate their own parcel and land obtained through sharecropping the average irrigation farm income per ha measured by value output produced per season at current prices july august 2018 was estimated 159 045 eritrean nakfa ern moreover the average distance of farmstead to input and output market was found to be 2 5 km meanwhile the majority of farmers ranked the unavailability of inputs such as seeds fertilizer pesticides fuel as their first constraint for irrigation development in the study area 5 2 farmers perception on irrigation water pricing and response to offered bids an attempt was made to understand farmers understanding by asking the farmers if they agree with irrigation water pricing farmers responses to irrigation water pricing and the different reasons for both yes and no answers are summarized in table 2 the results indicate that about 46 of the total sample do not perceive irrigation water as an economic good and disagree with the concept of irrigation water charging however there is no statistically significant difference t 1 129 between the percentage of yes and no responses it gives a clue that the longstanding public nature of the resource might have contributed to this understanding moreover four set of bids were distributed randomly to elicit farmer s willingness to pay for irrigation water improvement the summary of the responses for the offered bids shows that only 3 of the sample had no response to both initial and follow up bids 30 responded no to the first bid and yes to the second bid 37 responded yes to both offered bids and 46 responded yes to the first bid and no to the second bid table 3 overall 76 of the respondents were willing to pay the initially offered bid even though there was no statistically significant difference between those who agreed with irrigation water pricing and otherwise the responses to the offered bids indicated that farmers are willing to pay for irrigation water this implies that even those farmers who perceive that irrigation water should not be priced are willing to pay the offered bids for irrigation water improvement 5 3 average willingness to pay for irrigation water improvement the average willingness to pay for irrigation water supply improvement was estimated ern 459 ha one time irrigation application table 4 this is much higher than the average initial bid ern 281 and slightly higher than the follow up bid ern 452 the farmers reported that on average 16 times harvest irrigation is required for most of the crops grown under irrigation in the study area this means the total average willingness to pay for full harvest irrigation is ern 7351 ha which is 4 6 of the average income from irrigated farms 5 4 factors affecting wtp for irrigation water improvement table 5 shows the logistic regression estimates of factors affecting farmer s willingness to pay for irrigation water and table 6 shows the average marginal effect of each variable keeping all others constant as expected farmers willingness to pay decreased significantly with increasing initial bid besides farmers perception on the scarcity of irrigation water was found to have very significant positive impact on farmers willingness to pay the probability of wtp increased by 19 with greater degree of perception on scarcity of irrigation water likewise the farmers perception on irrigation water pricing was found to have a positive and significant effect a farmer who perceives irrigation water as an economic good as indicated by the agreement on whether it should be priced was estimated to have 11 more probability of wtp than otherwise similarly income from irrigation farming was found to have positive and significant effect on farmers wtp a unit increase in irrigation farm income was estimated to increase the probability of farmer s wtp by about 9 farmers who reported insecure to the land tenure systems have expressed 15 less probability of wtp than otherwise there might be two levels of tenure insecurity in the study area first as described above land tenure system in the study area involves redistribution of farmland every seven years second the sharecropping land use arrangements practiced in the area are not enforced by law tikabo 2003 thus the land use right holder of a certain plot can make many sharecropping arrangements with different farmers in different production years seasons within the given tenancy the periodic land redistribution determines the usufruct rights of both land and water farmers with use rights to dug wells 50 5 of the sample are those farmers whom by chance have got a farm plot located near the water source usually 4 8 farmers thus a farmer who has enough capital and labor to invest in irrigation farming uses the chance or otherwise give the plot to another farmer in the form of sharecropping or short term lease the farmers reported this phenomenon as particularly common since the last land redistribution after which digging new wells has been prohibited due to environmental concerns however the quasi public nature of the dug wells has increased pressure over the existing wells resulting in over pumping of groundwater in this scenario 74 of the farmers are either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied by the irrigation water management in the study area and described it as leading to the overexploitation of underground water resources and inefficient use of the surface water fig 5 whereas the remaining 26 reported that they are satisfied mainly because they have had a chance to have a farm plot near water source which they couldn t get in the previous land tenure periods yet the latter are concerned that they may lose the opportunity soon because of another redistribution moreover age of respondent was found to have a negative impact on wtp a ten year increase in household heads age was found to be associated with a 7 decrease wtp the fact that irrigation water has been used free might have contributed to the older farmer s understanding of the resource as a free good likewise farmers who used groundwater dug well as a water source were found to have 24 4 less probability of wtp than those who use surface water dam as will be discussed below this is probably due to the differences in ownership of wells and dams moreover a farm household s distance to market was found to have a negative and significant effect on farmers wtp 6 discussion the farmers responses to the offered bids showed that sample farmers understanding on the economic properties of water is increasing the estimated willingness to pay 4 6 of farm income is close to the reports of tang et al 2013 from northwest china where farmers wtp was estimated about 6 1 and the actual amount paid by farmers was 4 4 of farm income moreover reports from pakistan ul hassan 2002 indicated that the actual charge of farmers was 2 of farm income while the operation and maintenance costs range between 3 8 3 5 of net farm income thus our findings imply that smallholder farmers might be willing to pay for reliable supply of irrigation water that is irrigation water pricing might be a feasible option of financing irrigation development projects in eritrea through private sector involvement the high demand for irrigation water supply improvement could be an incentive for private investors that gives an opportunity governments have an option for decentralized decision making and shared investment shared public private investment in irrigation water supply improvement is a growing business strategy to deal with lack of resources and managerial inefficiencies particularly faced by the developing countries public projects world bank 2018b mandri perrott and bisbey 2016 according to mandri perrott and bisbey 2016 where there is a high willingness to pay for water as an input public private partnerships ppps are potentially feasible as a means of expanding private sector in irrigation ppps can support in organizing the expertise and ensuring the medium and long term sustainability of irrigation development projects this type of irrigation projects has been practiced in countries such as egypt brazil peru and ethiopia in different forms world bank 2018b along with the dire need for investment in complementary inputs and market access there is a large scope for expansion of irrigation investment in sub saharan africa de fraiture and wichelns 2010 given the lack of previous investment in irrigation and the potential for expansion of the high wtp estimates these findings suggest that ppps are potentially feasible financing options for irrigation projects in the least developed countries such as eritrea in the analysis of factors affecting farmers wtp the negative impact of the initial bid was expected from the basic law of demand that a farmer wtp would decrease with the increasing price of irrigation water moreover the positive impact of farm income indicates that farmers who have higher marginal product of water have higher wtp similarly farmers understanding on the economic properties of irrigation water as described by water pricing and water scarcity was found to have a positive impact on wtp this implies that farmers wtp for irrigation water is affected not only by its productivity but also by the farmers understanding of the economic properties of the resource this is in line with previous studies carried in ethiopia kenya and south africa that several farm and socio economic factors also influence farmers wtp for irrigation water kiprop et al 2017 alemayehu 2014 angella et al 2014 speelman et al 2010 the negative impact of tenure insecurity was also expected as stated above sharecropping is a preferred form of land use arrangement because of the type of land tenure system exercised in the study area despite its advantages sharecropping also generates another level of tenure insecurity through its short term contracts the farmers reported that they could not plan for long term investments as their farm plots will change hands not only by the village land redistribution but also by insecure contracts with the sharecropper a recent study tesfay et al 2018 also reported that land tenure insecurity negatively influences investments in soil and water conservation practices in eritrea a saying in the study area that goes a plot under sharecropping is unblessed actually summarizes all that is a farmland under sharecropping is so cursed that it receives no care and often gives bad yield the negative impact of well borehole as a source of irrigation water could be attributed to the differences in ownership system of wells as compared to dams as described above wells are under quasi public ownership while the dams are purely public thus relative periodic control gives farmers who use wells better access to pump more water meanwhile it may not make them accountable as there were no clear entitlements through which they could be charged those who use dams however are more prone to crop failures due to the seasonal and erratic rainfall in the area thus while there are no clear water rights different sources of water imply different forms of ownership which in turn affects farmer s services and wtp lastly the negative impact of distance to market on wtp could be explained by the proximity of getting any other complementary inputs and overall integration of farm household to market considering the undeveloped market infrastructure in the study area farmers located farther from and less integrated into markets may therefore express less wtp 7 conclusion agriculture faces the greatest risk of freshwater scarcity many smallholder farmers in the sahel region are severely affected by water scarcity due to the subsistence nature of their farms and the multidimensional vulnerability of their livelihoods the role of irrigation water pricing as a signal for scarcity and opportunity cost of water and financing tool for irrigation developments has been strongly upheld although the ability and willingness to pay wtp of smallholder farmers for irrigation water could profoundly determine sustainability of irrigation projects little empirical evidence exists about the consequences of irrigation water pricing based on direct survey of smallholder farmers wtp particularly from drier regions of the globe such as the sahel in this study we address this gap in the literature by examining the consequences of irrigation water pricing mechanisms among smallholder farmers in sub saharan and sahel region of africa using eritrean smallholder farmers as an example we specifically collected data on smallholder farmers wtp for irrigation water and the factors that affect farmers wtp for irrigation supply improvements the sahelian country is an interesting study area where lessons could be learned and extrapolated to other global areas with similar characteristics because it has set a proclamation and pricing guidelines designed to reflect irrigation water as an economic good while the entire country is being swallowed by the ever expanding sahara desert and at the same time housing some of the poorest smallholder farmers worldwide we employed bivariate probit and binary logistic regression models for data analyses results suggest that despite the longstanding public nature of irrigation water in eritrea smallholder farmers understanding of irrigation water as a free good is waning due to observed scarcity of the resource we found that on average farmers wtp for irrigation water supply in eritrea is about 5 of average household income from irrigated farms price of irrigation water source of irrigation water being well farm household s distance to market and age of the respondent were found to be negatively influencing factors whereas irrigation farm income and farmers understanding on the economic properties of irrigation water were found to have a positive effect on farmer s wtp our study estimates provide evidence that smallholder farmers might be willing to pay for increased volumes of water for irrigation purposes and suggest that public private partnerships for the storage and delivery of water for irrigation might be economically feasible even in poor countries such as eritrea moreover our work suggests that designs of irrigation water pricing schemes might need to consider land tenure policy local specific land use arrangements and differences in sources of irrigation water and their implications to ownership development of the input output markets including water markets could go hand in hand with strengthening legal and regulatory institutions for effective land and water law design and enforcement finally our study suggests that in areas where irrigation water charges have not been applied enhancing farmers understanding about the economic properties of water is an important prerequisite for effective implementation of irrigation water charging schemes conflict of interest the
