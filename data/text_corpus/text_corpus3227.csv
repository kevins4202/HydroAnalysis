corresponding authors dark carbon fixation dcf contributes approximately 0 77 pg c y 1 to oceanic primary production and the global carbon budget it is estimated that nearly half of the dcf in marine sediments occurs in estuarine and coastal regions but the environmental factors controlling dcf and the microorganisms responsible for its production remain under exploration in this study we investigated dcf rates and the active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments of the yangtze estuary using 14c labeling and dna stable isotope probing dna sip techniques the measured dcf rates ranged from 0 27 to 3 37 mmol c m 2 day 1 in intertidal surface sediments the rates of dcf were closely related to sediment sulfide content demonstrating that the availability of reductive substrates may be the dominant factor controlling dcf in the intertidal sediments a significant positive correlation was also observed between the dcf rates and abundance of the cbbm gene dna stable isotope probing dna sip results further confirmed that cbbm harboring bacteria rather than cbbl harboring bacteria played a dominant role in dcf in intertidal sediments phylogenetic analysis showed that the predominant cbbm harboring bacteria were affiliated with burkholderia including sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis moreover metagenome analyses indicated that most of the potential dark carbon fixing bacteria detected in intertidal sediments also harbor genes for sulfur oxidation denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra indicating that these chemoautotrophic microorganisms may play important roles in coupled carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles these results shed light on the ecological importance and the underlying mechanisms of the dcf process driven by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal wetlands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dark carbon fixation dna sip intertidal wetlands sediments chemoautotrophy 1 introduction chemoautotrophy has been considered an insignificant carbon sink process in coastal sediments compared with photosynthetic production thus dark carbon fixation dcf has been largely ignored in coastal carbon cycles due to its apparently low growth yield bauer et al 2013 in recent years dcf has received increasing attention because it is increasingly seen as a potentially important source of organic matter available for marine food webs including the water column and sediments baltar and herndl 2019 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 in particular estuarine and coastal wetlands have been suggested to be hotspots of microbially driven dcf dyksma et al 2016 howarth 1984 middelburg 2011 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 chemoautotrophic carbon fixation in global coastal sediments is estimated at approximately 175 tg c year 1 which represents approximately 22 7 of oceanic dcf production middelburg 2011 due to the influence of periodic exposure and inundation under tidal action intertidal wetlands exhibit extremely active redox reactions arndt et al 2013 wang et al 2012a these reductive and oxidative processes tightly link the cycles of sediment carbon nitrogen sulfur hydrogen and metals and provide abundant substrates for chemoautotrophy hooper and dispirito 2013 sulfate reduction has been documented to account for 50 to 70 of total respiration in nearshore sediments and for the production of a large amount of inorganic reduced sulfur compounds in turn performing as an important driver for chemoautotrophic carbon fixation howarth 1984 in addition due to a large amount of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen input in estuarine and coastal ecosystems the oxidation of reduced inorganic nitrogen can also be an important energy source for carbon sequestration by chemoautotrophic microorganisms guerrero feijoo et al 2018 meador et al 2020 currently seven pathways are known to be used by chemoautotrophic microorganisms for dcf berg 2011 figueroa et al 2018 the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle and the 3 hydroxypropionate 4 hydroxybutyrate 3 hp 4 hb cycle are quantitively the most important known chemoautotrophic co2 fixation pathways in various habitats berg et al 2010 herndl et al 2005 yakimov et al 2011 ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco is the key enzyme in the cbb cycle and the gene encoding the large subunit of rubisco has four distinct forms of which form i cbbl and form ii cbbm are the most important markers for the analysis of chemoautotrophic microorganisms using the cbb cycle alfreider et al 2017 badger and bek 2008 acetyl coa carboxylase accase encoded by the marker gene acca catalyzes the transformation of acetyl coa and bicarbonate into malonyl coa and it is the accepted indicator of the 3 hp 4 hb cycle in autotrophic archaea yakimov et al 2009 several studies have investigated dcf rates in estuarine and coastal sediments and found that the upper few millimeters of sediments have the highest dcf rates boschker et al 2014 lipsewers et al 2017 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 while other studies have suggested that dcf rates in oxygen depleted sediments are significantly higher than those in oxic conditions rastelli et al 2016 to date there is still a gap in understanding how environmental factors such as temperature reducing substrate and terminal electron acceptors teas affect dcf in addition which chemoautotrophic microorganisms actively drive dcf in intertidal sediments also remains unclear hence the objectives of the present study were i to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of dcf rates and functional gene abundance in intertidal sediments ii to explore potential links between environmental variables and dcf activity and iii to identify active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments based on the dna stable isotope probing dna sip technique this study provides a comprehensive understanding of dcf driven by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments and may also supply an important scientific basis for a more accurate assessment of coastal primary productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field sampling the yangtze river is the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world with a length of 6300 km

active chemoautotrophic prokaryotes active chemoautotrophic prokaryotes were determined by identifying the relatively heavier microorganisms through dna sip incubation although dna sip incubation could disturb the sediment matrix and the microbial community to some extent no significant variation in microbial communities between sip microcosm and in situ sediments was detected in the present study p 0 05 fig s5 after gradient ultracentrifugation the cbbl cbbm and acca genes were enumerated from each dna fraction using qpcr to distinguish the heavy from the light dnas the 13c labeled cbbm gene peak was observed at a buoyant density bd of 1 729 g ml 1 whereas the 12c labeled cbbm gene peak was at a bd of 1 720 g ml 1 fig 5 the acca gene abundance peaked in the fractions with bds of 1 714 g ml 1 and 1 707 g ml 1 in the 13c and 12c treatments respectively however no obvious shift in cbbl gene abundance was observed in the light versus heavy fractions by comparing the microbial community composition of 12c and 13c targeted fractions we can identify microbes that have become heavier due to assimilation of 13c and those that should be in the heavier fraction due to high gc content chemoautotrophs with similar abundances in the 12c and 13c fractions were active players while microbes distributed in only one fraction were present as background dna the most abundant groups in these fractions are summarized in fig 6 bacteria affiliated with gammaproteobacteria dominated the heavy fractions of the 13c treatment 29 in summer and 40 in winter which also dominated the light fractions of the 12c treatment 31 in summer and 38 in winter fig 6a archaea affiliated with nitrososphaeria dominated both the heavy fractions of 13c treatment 36 in summer and 30 in winter and the light fractions of 12c treatment 39 in summer and 30 in winter fig 6b indicating that nitrososphaeria were the main chemoautotrophic archaea through the 3 hp 4 hb cycle the cbbm and cbbl gene amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the genetic diversity of form i and form ii types of rubisco which cover most chemoautotrophic bacteria using the cbb cycle for dcf dna sip incubation showed that cbbm harboring bacteria significantly assimilated 13c fig 5 based on the phylogenetic analysis most of the cbbm sequences were affiliated to gammaproteobacteria and were related with uncultured or cultured sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis fig 7 these sequences showed a high diversity in community composition but in terms of abundance and distribution bacteria including burkholderiales and chromatiales were of major importance in dcf in intertidal surface sediments fig 7 among these sequences the relative abundance of otu68 was the highest in summer 17 0 which was affiliated with sulfuricella denitrificans sk26 with up to 86 5 sequence identity six otus represented by otu128 were the highest in winter 29 1 which showed up to 85 8 gene identity with sulfuriferula sp ah1 however cbbl harboring bacteria affiliated with a high diversity of gammaproteobacteria had no assimilation of 13c labeled bicarbonate suggesting that they may not be responsible for dcf in intertidal surface sediments fig s6 acca gene amplicon sequencing was used to target the chemoautotrophic archaea using the 3 hp 4 hb cycle for dcf consistent with the archaeal 16s sequencing the acca sequences were mostly affiliated with nitrososphaeria with a relative abundance of 67 0 in summer and 86 8 in winter fig s7 3 6 metagenomic analysis of dark carbon fixing microorganisms metagenomic analysis for dna obtained from the dna sip incubation showed that the cbb cycle and the 3 hp 4 hb cycle are the most important chemoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways in coastal sediments fig s8 analysis of rubisco genes in the metagenomic data showed 6242 and 1262 sequences matching the large and small chain genes respectively fig s9 taxonomic assignments indicated that most of these genes were associated with taxa belonging to burkholderiales 3652 large and 636 small chain genes chromatiales 518 large and 12 small chain genes rhodospirillales 120 large and 202 small chain genes and xanthomonadales 98 large and 102 small chain genes fig s9 in addition the relative abundances of genes coding for acetyl coa c acetyltransferase acetyl coa carboxylase and methylmalonyl coa mutase of the 3 hp 4 hb pathway for carbon fixation were 7 5 6 8 and 4 9 respectively fig s10 notably the relative abundance of genes coding for 4 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydratase was 0 5 which is a key gene of the 4 hb part of the pathway hugler and sievert 2011 a total of 16 assembled bins with genes coding for rubisco were recovered from the assembled metagenomes fig s11 genes encoding subunits of the thiosulfate oxidizing sox multienzyme complex soxb sulfate adenylyltransferase sat cysdn and reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrab were observed in most bins 12 12 and 11 of 16 respectively fig 8 indicating a widespread ability to utilize active sulfur as an electron donor conversely genes coding subunits

reductase narghi periplasmic nitrate reductase napab and nitrite reductase nirk s were identified in 15 12 and 13 bins respectively while nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were only found in 6 and 1 bins respectively in addition genes coding for pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase which is a key enzyme for conducting dnra were found in 10 bins fig 8 4 discussion as part of global primary productivity oc fixed by chemoautotrophs is a key component of food webs in many ecosystems pachiadaki et al 2017 yakimov et al 2011 middelburg 2011 suggested that the amount of oc fixed by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the ocean was on the same order of magnitude as the annual oc burial due to rapid consumption of oxygen in intertidal sediments the reoxidation of reducing substrates produced by the mineralization of organic matter mainly occurs at the surface of the sediments which is the most active layer of dcf boschker et al 2014 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 in this study we investigated the dcf rates and their main driving factors in intertidal surface sediments meanwhile through dna sip experiments this study provided new insights into the composition and diversity of the active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments moreover metagenome analyses further showed that chemoautotrophy coupled with sulfur oxidation and denitrification or dnra may play a more significant role in dcf than has been assumed measured dcf rates in the surface sediments of the yangtze estuary were on the same order of magnitude as those reported in other intertidal coastal sediments 0 68 6 45 mmol c m 2 d 1 boschker et al 2014 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 but higher than those of subtidal shelf 0 03 0 42 mmol c m 2 d 1 and sub arctic sediments 0 08 0 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 vasquez cardenas et al 2018 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 compared with other freshwater ecosystems dcf rates measured in yangtze estuarine sediments were identical to those reported in swedish boreal lakes 1 1 4 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 but lower than those found in cascade reservoirs 1 5 14 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 santoro et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 if the dcf rates we measured are extrapolated to the entire yangtze estuary approximately 8500 km2 it is estimated that approximately 4 5 104 t of carbon is fixed to oc by chemoautotrophs in the estuarine surface sediments annually in addition the estimated dcf tou ratios ranged between 2 31 and 9 47 in the yangtze estuary sediments which were comparable to those reported in coastal and lake sediments santoro et al 2013 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 this indicated that dcf was an important source of organic carbon in intertidal sediments dcf rates in intertidal sediments vary greatly across different sampling sites at different seasons but only a few studies have investigated the potential environmental drivers for this difference santoro et al 2013 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 it is well known that chemoautotrophy depends primarily on the oxidation of reducing substrates and the reduction of teas hooper and dispirito 2013 in the present study the average dcf rate was 60 higher in summer than in winter indicating that temperature may be an important environmental factor affecting the activity of chemoautotrophs in intertidal surface sediments sem analysis also showed that temperature was significantly associated with dcf rates and cbbm gene abundance fig 3 similarly zhao et al 2020 documented that the average dcf rate in reservoir sediments was 36 6 higher at 25 c than that at 15 c these seasonal variations may be due to the effects of temperature on the metabolic activity of chemoautotrophs arndt et al 2013 in addition higher temperature may promote the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria which may provide more sulfide and thus facilitate dcf abdollahi and nedwell 1979 however in some benthic sediments the seasonal variations may be complicated by other influencing factors for example previous studies have reported that in bioturbated sediments the activity of macrofauna can change the availability of electron donors and acceptors which can further affect chemoautotrophy vasquez cardenas et al 2020 however this possible influence of bioturbation on dcf was not examined in the present study which will be explored in our further work in coastal sediments biogeochemical evidence showed that sulfur oxidation dominated chemoautotrophy in reducing substrates while ammonia oxidation was suggested to play only a minor role howarth 1984 middelburg 2011 the production of sulfide depends on the mineralization of organic matter in anoxic sediments and dissimilatory sulfate reduction by anaerobic microorganisms dominates this process jorgensen et al 2019 the main teas responsible for sulfur oxidation in coastal sediments are oxygen and nitrate glud 2008 in coastal sediments both mechanisms of microbial sulfur oxidation have been observed sulfide aerobic oxidation at the oxygen sulfide interface and sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction and their importance in dcf has been demonstrated lipsewers et al 2017 in some studies the dcf rates were observed to be significantly related to the availability of teas represented by oxygen for example lipsewers et al 2017 showed that the hypoxia of overlying water leads to lower dcf rates in coastal sediments compared with oxic conditions in addition a strong correlation was found between sedimentary o2 uptake and dcf rates in coastal sediments which indicated that an increase in oxygen consumption as a proxy for organic matter mineralization leads to an increase in dcf rates vasquez cardenas et al 2020 similarly our results showed that the tou rates were higher in sediments with higher dcf rates figs s3 and s4 however rastelli et al 2016 showed that the dcf rates in a freshwater lake were significantly higher in oxygen depleted water and sediments than those in oxic conditions in their study the microbial abundance including that of viruses and other prokaryotes was higher in anoxic sediment and the activity of viruses accelerated heterotrophic processes and the supply of inorganic reduced compounds such as sulfides and ammonia thereby enhancing chemoautotrophy rastelli et al 2016 moreover the supply of more organic carbon and more reduced inorganic electron donors led to greater dcf rates in reservoir surface sediments zhao et al 2020 in the present study pearson s correlation and sem analyses showed that the availability of reducing substrates represented by sulfide was the key factor affecting the dcf rates in intertidal surface sediments however no significant correlation was observed between dcf rates and organic carbon content fig s3 which was consistent with the studies by santoro et al 2013 and vasquez cardenas et al 2020 these results suggest that sulfide driven dcf in coastal surface sediments may be derived from the mineralization of organic matter in subsurface sediments jorgensen et al 2019 no significant correlation between dcf rates and the concentrations of nitrate was observed in pearson s correlation analysis dyksma et al 2016 found that the addition of nitrate did not increase the dcf rates in anoxic slurry incubations but the addition of thiosulfate in surface sediments stimulated dic assimilation indicating that nitrate as tea may be sufficient in the process of chemoautotrophy these results indicated that the availability of reductive substrates represented by sulfide might be the most important limiting factor of dcf in intertidal surface sediments the abundance and composition of microbial communities also determine the biogeochemical behavior of coastal sediments we investigated the abundance of the cbbl and cbbm genes and found a significant positive correlation between cbbm gene abundance and dcf rates figs 3 and s3 this result indicated that cbbm harboring microorganisms may play a leading role in the dcf of intertidal sediments different chemoautotrophic microbial communities may exhibit different dcf activities alfreider et al 2017 however in the present study no significant correlations were observed between the communities of chemoautotrophic microorganisms and the dcf rates p 0 05 fig 4 at sites lhk and wsk the dcf rate in summer was much higher than that in winter fig 2 but the microbial communities of cbbm and cbbl harboring chemoautotrophic bacteria remained quite stable between different seasons figs 3 and s12 the acca harboring archaeal community at these sites showed some seasonal variation fig s12 but it was unlikely the main cause for the detected seasonal change of dcf rates as the abundance of acca harboring archaea remained quite low compared with that of chemoautotrophic bacteria fig 1 actually the abundance of chemoautotrophic microorganisms played a more important role in regulating dcf rates than their community compositions as significant correlations were observed between chemoautotrophic bacterial abundance and the dcf rates for example although the communities of chemoautotrophic microorganisms acquired from site blg were similar to those from the sites wsk and lhk the dcf rates were low at site blg due to the low abundance of chemoautotrophic microorganisms figs 2 3 and s12 herrmann et al 2015 suggested that although cbbl and cbbm genes were widely distributed their expression may be limited due to distinct levels of oxygen and organic matter in different habitats therefore dna sip experiments were conducted to determine the metabolically active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal surface sediments the results showed that cbbm harboring bacteria were the dominant active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal surface sediments fig 5 according to sequence analysis the retrieved cbbm gene otus were mainly affiliated with gammaproteobacteria fig 7 nevertheless many bacteria harboring this rubisco form ii phylotype were not obviously affiliated with known chemoautotrophic strains indicating that we still know little about this functional group in intertidal ecosystems the dominant genotype during the summer was affiliated with sulfuricella denitrificans and it was found in many habitats including groundwater freshwater lakes and reservoir sediments kumar et al 2018 watanabe et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 s denitrificans is a facultative anaerobe that can oxidize elemental sulfur and thiosulfate as sole energy sources and can utilize oxygen or nitrate as an electron acceptor kojima and fukui 2010 previous studies suggested that sulfur oxidizers including beggiatoa chromaticaeae ectothiorhodospiracea thiotrichales and xanthomonadales were the dominant chemoautotrophic microorganisms in coastal sediments boschker et al 2014 dyksma et al 2016 vasquez cardenas et al 2018 however in the present study burkholderiales and chromatiales represented by sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis were found to be dominant in dcf in intertidal surface sediments figs 7 and s9 in this study ammonia oxidizing archaea represented by nitrososphaeraceae and nitrosopumilaceae were the main microorganisms using the 3 hp 4 hb pathway to fix dic fig s7 however no significant correlation was found between the abundance of the acca gene and the dcf rates although they are important autotrophs in benthic deep sea sediment molari et al 2013 and the deep ocean herndl et al 2005 ammonia oxidizing archaea may play a minor role in dcf in coastal sediments dyksma et al 2016 in addition cbbl harboring bacteria did not show obvious dcf activity previous studies have shown that many bacteria harboring the cbbl gene are associated with facultative chemoautotrophs badger and bek 2008 form ii rubisco was characterized by a poor affinity for co2 and a low discrimination against o2 and consequently it prefers high co2 and low o2 environments alfreider et al 2017 berg 2011 previous studies have shown that gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers gsos play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen sulfur and carbon glaubitz et al 2013 in the present study based on metagenomic surveys most of the observed gsos in intertidal surface sediments harbored genes related to carbon fixation sulfur oxidation denitrification or dnra fig 8 showing that these microorganisms may play a vital role in the coupled cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in intertidal sediments however the presence of these functional genes was not proof of their activity and future transcriptomic experiments will be required to reveal the active genes in these coastal sediments 5 conclusion this study explored the rates and roles of dcf in estuarine intertidal sediments significant correlations were found between dcf rates and sulfide content demonstrating that the availability of reductive substrates represented by sulfide is a primary limiting factor of dcf in intertidal sediments temperature was also a key factor affecting dcf rates and cbbm gene abundance compared with cbbl harboring bacteria cbbm harboring bacteria were more responsible for dcf in the intertidal ecosystem dna sip further confirmed that cbbm harboring sulfur oxidizing bacteria represented by sulfuricella denitrificans and sulfuriferula were the dominant active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments moreover metagenomic results demonstrated the enormous potential of these chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the coupled cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in intertidal sediments this study provides an important scientific basis for the accurate assessment of coastal primary productivity and improves our

corresponding authors dark carbon fixation dcf contributes approximately 0 77 pg c y 1 to oceanic primary production and the global carbon budget it is estimated that nearly half of the dcf in marine sediments occurs in estuarine and coastal regions but the environmental factors controlling dcf and the microorganisms responsible for its production remain under exploration in this study we investigated dcf rates and the active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments of the yangtze estuary using 14c labeling and dna stable isotope probing dna sip techniques the measured dcf rates ranged from 0 27 to 3 37 mmol c m 2 day 1 in intertidal surface sediments the rates of dcf were closely related to sediment sulfide content demonstrating that the availability of reductive substrates may be the dominant factor controlling dcf in the intertidal sediments a significant positive correlation was also observed between the dcf rates and abundance of the cbbm gene dna stable isotope probing dna sip results further confirmed that cbbm harboring bacteria rather than cbbl harboring bacteria played a dominant role in dcf in intertidal sediments phylogenetic analysis showed that the predominant cbbm harboring bacteria were affiliated with burkholderia including sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis moreover metagenome analyses indicated that most of the potential dark carbon fixing bacteria detected in intertidal sediments also harbor genes for sulfur oxidation denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra indicating that these chemoautotrophic microorganisms may play important roles in coupled carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles these results shed light on the ecological importance and the underlying mechanisms of the dcf process driven by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal wetlands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dark carbon fixation dna sip intertidal wetlands sediments chemoautotrophy 1 introduction chemoautotrophy has been considered an insignificant carbon sink process in coastal sediments compared with photosynthetic production thus dark carbon fixation dcf has been largely ignored in coastal carbon cycles due to its apparently low growth yield bauer et al 2013 in recent years dcf has received increasing attention because it is increasingly seen as a potentially important source of organic matter available for marine food webs including the water column and sediments baltar and herndl 2019 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 in particular estuarine and coastal wetlands have been suggested to be hotspots of microbially driven dcf dyksma et al 2016 howarth 1984 middelburg 2011 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 chemoautotrophic carbon fixation in global coastal sediments is estimated at approximately 175 tg c year 1 which represents approximately 22 7 of oceanic dcf production middelburg 2011 due to the influence of periodic exposure and inundation under tidal action intertidal wetlands exhibit extremely active redox reactions arndt et al 2013 wang et al 2012a these reductive and oxidative processes tightly link the cycles of sediment carbon nitrogen sulfur hydrogen and metals and provide abundant substrates for chemoautotrophy hooper and dispirito 2013 sulfate reduction has been documented to account for 50 to 70 of total respiration in nearshore sediments and for the production of a large amount of inorganic reduced sulfur compounds in turn performing as an important driver for chemoautotrophic carbon fixation howarth 1984 in addition due to a large amount of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen input in estuarine and coastal ecosystems the oxidation of reduced inorganic nitrogen can also be an important energy source for carbon sequestration by chemoautotrophic microorganisms guerrero feijoo et al 2018 meador et al 2020 currently seven pathways are known to be used by chemoautotrophic microorganisms for dcf berg 2011 figueroa et al 2018 the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle and the 3 hydroxypropionate 4 hydroxybutyrate 3 hp 4 hb cycle are quantitively the most important known chemoautotrophic co2 fixation pathways in various habitats berg et al 2010 herndl et al 2005 yakimov et al 2011 ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco is the key enzyme in the cbb cycle and the gene encoding the large subunit of rubisco has four distinct forms of which form i cbbl and form ii cbbm are the most important markers for the analysis of chemoautotrophic microorganisms using the cbb cycle alfreider et al 2017 badger and bek 2008 acetyl coa carboxylase accase encoded by the marker gene acca catalyzes the transformation of acetyl coa and bicarbonate into malonyl coa and it is the accepted indicator of the 3 hp 4 hb cycle in autotrophic archaea yakimov et al 2009 several studies have investigated dcf rates in estuarine and coastal sediments and found that the upper few millimeters of sediments have the highest dcf rates boschker et al 2014 lipsewers et al 2017 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 while other studies have suggested that dcf rates in oxygen depleted sediments are significantly higher than those in oxic conditions rastelli et al 2016 to date there is still a gap in understanding how environmental factors such as temperature reducing substrate and terminal electron acceptors teas affect dcf in addition which chemoautotrophic microorganisms actively drive dcf in intertidal sediments also remains unclear hence the objectives of the present study were i to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of dcf rates and functional gene abundance in intertidal sediments ii to explore potential links between environmental variables and dcf activity and iii to identify active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments based on the dna stable isotope probing dna sip technique this study provides a comprehensive understanding of dcf driven by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments and may also supply an important scientific basis for a more accurate assessment of coastal primary productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field sampling the yangtze river is the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world with a length of 6300 km it has a basin area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 and carries approximately 5 108 t of sediment and 2 5 106 t of organic carbon annually into the east china sea wang et al 2012a most of these materials are deposited in the estuarine and adjacent continental shelf areas which makes the yangtze estuary an active ecological transition zone of redox reaction activity in this study we selected six sites

abundances of autotrophic marker genes abundances of autotrophic marker genes at all sampling sites were determined using q pcr significant seasonal variation was detected for the abundance of the cbbm gene 7 03 107 to 4 94 108 copies g 1 in summer and 5 66 106 to 1 22 108 copies g 1 in winter one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 the highest cbbm gene abundance was detected at site lhk in summer and the lowest appeared at site lcg in winter neither spatial nor temporal variation was found for the numbers of the cbbl gene 6 44 107 to 6 67 108 copies g 1 however the abundance of the cbbl gene tended to be higher in winter than in summer and it had a positive correlation with that of the bacterial 16s rrna gene r 0 808 p 0 001 the abundances of the cbbm and cbbl genes were much lower at sites lcg and blg than at other sites fig 1 the numbers of the acca gene were observed to be between 7 52 106 and 2 96 108 copies g 1 the acca gene numbers at sites lcg cync and cmdt were significantly greater than those at sites blg wsk and lhk one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 3 3 dark carbon fixation rates 14c labeled bicarbonate method was conducted to evaluate the dcf rates in the intertidal surface sediments of the yangtze estuary dcf rates ranged from 0 32 to 3 37 mmol c m 2 d 1 in summer and from 0 27 to 1 22 mmol c m 2 d 1 in winter except for sites lcg and blg significant temporal variation was observed for dcf rates one way anova p 0 05 fig 2 in summer the highest dcf rate was detected at site lhk while the lowest rate was found at site lcg in winter the maximum dcf rate was measured at site wsk while the minimum rate still appeared at site lcg the dcf rates were positively and significantly correlated with the numbers of cbbm gene r 0 96 p 0 001 but no significant relationship was observed between the dcf rates and the numbers of cbbl and acca genes p 0 05 fig s3 in addition we observed that dcf rates were significantly correlated with tou rates r 0 70 p 0 05 fig s3 a power law relation with an exponent of 1 11 was observed between the dcf and tou rates r 2 0 75 fig s4 the dcf tou ratios ranged from 2 31 to 9 47 in summer and from 2 44 to 4 77 in winter table s2 3 4 relationships of dcf rates gene abundance and community structure with environmental parameters pearson s correlation analysis was used to explore the influence of environmental parameters on the dcf rates and gene abundances the statistical analyses showed that dcf rates were significantly related to sulfide r 0 83 p 0 001 nh4 r 0 80 p 0 01 and temperature r 0 57 p 0 05 fig s3 likewise the abundance of the cbbm gene was also positively correlated with sulfide r 0 82 p 0 001 nh4 r 0 78 p 0 01 and temperature r 0 66 p 0 05 the cbbl gene abundance was positively related to tc r 0 72 p 0 01 toc r 0 59 p 0 05 and fe2 r 0 79 p 0 01 while the acca gene abundance was positively related to the concentrations of so4 2 r 0 82 p 0 01 fe3 r 0 80 p 0 01 and no3 r 0 69 p 0 05 sem analysis was used to further explore the effects of key physicochemical parameters on dcf rates and functional gene abundance fig 3 the results showed that sulfide and temperature significantly affected the cbbm gene abundance with estimated effects of 0 65 and 0 35 respectively p 0 05 consistent with pearson s correlation analysis cbbm gene abundance exhibited a positive effect on the dcf rates with an estimated effect of 0 84 p 0 001 in addition fe2 showed a positive effect on cbbl gene abundance with an estimated effect of 0 86 p 0 001 and temperature was significantly correlated with the contents of sulfide and nh4 with estimated effects of 0 48 and 0 64 respectively p 0 05 cca analysis was carried out to investigate the potential relationships among the community structure of chemoautotrophic microorganisms environmental parameters and the dcf rates fig 4 the first two cca ordination axes explained 44 49 of the total variance of the cbbm harboring bacterial communities fig 4a while they explained 45 9 of the cbbl harboring bacterial community variation fig 4b results indicated that cbbm harboring bacterial community structure was significantly related to sulfide and salinity p 0 05 499 monte carlo permutations while cbbl harboring bacterial community structure was significantly correlated with sulfide salinity and water content p 0 05 499 monte carlo permutations in the cca ordination plot of the acca harboring archaea the first axes provided 63 19 of the total variance but no significant relationship was observed between the acca harboring archaeal community structure and the measured environmental parameters fig 4c likewise there was no significant correlation between the community of acca harboring archaea and the dcf rates p 0 05 499 monte carlo permutations 3 5 community of the active chemoautotrophic prokaryotes active chemoautotrophic prokaryotes were determined by identifying the relatively heavier microorganisms through dna sip incubation although dna sip incubation could disturb the sediment matrix and the microbial community to some extent no significant variation in microbial communities between sip microcosm and in situ sediments was detected in the present study p 0 05 fig s5 after gradient ultracentrifugation the cbbl cbbm and acca genes were enumerated from each dna fraction using qpcr to distinguish the heavy from the light dnas the 13c labeled cbbm gene peak was observed at a buoyant density bd of 1 729 g ml 1 whereas the 12c labeled cbbm gene peak was at a bd of 1 720 g ml 1 fig 5 the acca gene abundance peaked in the fractions with bds of 1 714 g ml 1 and 1 707 g ml 1 in the 13c and 12c treatments respectively however no obvious shift in cbbl gene abundance was observed in the light versus heavy fractions by comparing the microbial community composition of 12c and 13c targeted fractions we can identify microbes that have become heavier due to assimilation of 13c and those that should be in the heavier fraction due to high gc content chemoautotrophs with similar abundances in the 12c and 13c fractions were active players while microbes distributed in only one fraction were present as background dna the most abundant groups in these fractions are summarized in fig 6 bacteria affiliated with gammaproteobacteria dominated the heavy fractions of the 13c treatment 29 in summer and 40 in winter which also dominated the light fractions of the 12c treatment 31 in summer and 38 in winter fig 6a archaea affiliated with nitrososphaeria dominated both the heavy fractions of 13c treatment 36 in summer and 30 in winter and the light fractions of 12c treatment 39 in summer and 30 in winter fig 6b indicating that nitrososphaeria were the main chemoautotrophic archaea through the 3 hp 4 hb cycle the cbbm and cbbl gene amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the genetic diversity of form i and form ii types of rubisco which cover most chemoautotrophic bacteria using the cbb cycle for dcf dna sip incubation showed that cbbm harboring bacteria significantly assimilated 13c fig 5 based on the phylogenetic analysis most of the cbbm sequences were affiliated to gammaproteobacteria and were related with uncultured or cultured sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis fig 7 these sequences showed a high diversity in community composition but in terms of abundance and distribution bacteria including burkholderiales and chromatiales were of major importance in dcf in intertidal surface sediments fig 7 among these sequences the relative abundance of otu68 was the highest in summer 17 0 which was affiliated with sulfuricella denitrificans sk26 with up to 86 5 sequence identity six otus represented by otu128 were the highest in winter 29 1 which showed up to 85 8 gene identity with sulfuriferula sp ah1 however cbbl harboring bacteria affiliated with a high diversity of gammaproteobacteria had no assimilation of 13c labeled bicarbonate suggesting that they may not be responsible for dcf in intertidal surface sediments fig s6 acca gene amplicon sequencing was used to target the chemoautotrophic archaea using the 3 hp 4 hb cycle for dcf consistent with the archaeal 16s sequencing the acca sequences were mostly affiliated with nitrososphaeria with a relative abundance of 67 0 in summer and 86 8 in winter fig s7 3 6 metagenomic analysis of dark carbon fixing microorganisms metagenomic analysis for dna obtained from the dna sip incubation showed that the cbb cycle and the 3 hp 4 hb cycle are the most important chemoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways in coastal sediments fig s8 analysis of rubisco genes in the metagenomic data showed 6242 and 1262 sequences matching the large and small chain genes respectively fig s9 taxonomic assignments indicated that most of these genes were associated with taxa belonging to burkholderiales 3652 large and 636 small chain genes chromatiales 518 large and 12 small chain genes rhodospirillales 120 large and 202 small chain genes and xanthomonadales 98 large and 102 small chain genes fig s9 in addition the relative abundances of genes coding for acetyl coa c acetyltransferase acetyl coa carboxylase and methylmalonyl coa mutase of the 3 hp 4 hb pathway for carbon fixation were 7 5 6 8 and 4 9 respectively fig s10 notably the relative abundance of genes coding for 4 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydratase was 0 5 which is a key gene of the 4 hb part of the pathway hugler and sievert 2011 a total of 16 assembled bins with genes coding for rubisco were recovered from the assembled metagenomes fig s11 genes encoding subunits of the thiosulfate oxidizing sox multienzyme complex soxb sulfate adenylyltransferase sat cysdn and reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrab were observed in most bins 12 12 and 11 of 16 respectively fig 8 indicating a widespread ability to utilize active sulfur as an electron donor conversely genes coding subunits of sulfite dehydrogenase sorab and oxidase suox adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apra and phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase cysh were less frequently detected fig 8 cytoplasmic nitrate reductase narghi periplasmic nitrate reductase napab and nitrite reductase nirk s were identified in 15 12 and 13 bins respectively while nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were only found in 6 and 1 bins respectively in addition genes coding for pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase which is a key enzyme for conducting dnra were found in 10 bins fig 8 4 discussion as part of global primary productivity oc fixed by chemoautotrophs is a key component of food webs in many ecosystems pachiadaki et al 2017 yakimov et al 2011 middelburg 2011 suggested that the amount of oc fixed by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the ocean was on the same order of magnitude as the annual oc burial due to rapid consumption of oxygen in intertidal sediments the reoxidation of reducing substrates produced by the mineralization of organic matter mainly occurs at the surface of the sediments which is the most active layer of dcf boschker et al 2014 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 in this study we investigated the dcf rates and their main driving factors in intertidal surface sediments meanwhile through dna sip experiments this study provided new insights into the composition and diversity of the active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments moreover metagenome analyses further showed that chemoautotrophy coupled with sulfur oxidation and denitrification or dnra may play a more significant role in dcf than has been assumed measured dcf rates in the surface sediments of the yangtze estuary were on the same order of magnitude as those reported in other intertidal coastal sediments 0 68 6 45 mmol c m 2 d 1 boschker et al 2014 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 but higher than those of subtidal shelf 0 03 0 42 mmol c m 2 d 1 and sub arctic sediments 0 08 0 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 vasquez cardenas et al 2018 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 compared with other freshwater ecosystems dcf rates measured in yangtze estuarine sediments were identical to those reported in swedish boreal lakes 1 1 4 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 but lower than those found in cascade reservoirs 1 5 14 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 santoro et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 if the dcf rates we measured are extrapolated to the entire yangtze estuary approximately 8500 km2 it is estimated that approximately 4 5 104 t of carbon is fixed to oc by chemoautotrophs in the estuarine surface sediments annually in addition the estimated dcf tou ratios ranged between 2 31 and 9 47 in the yangtze estuary sediments which were comparable to those reported in coastal and lake sediments santoro et al 2013 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 this indicated that dcf was an important source of organic carbon in intertidal sediments dcf rates in intertidal sediments vary greatly across different sampling sites at different seasons but only a few studies have investigated the potential environmental drivers for this difference santoro et al 2013 vasquez cardenas et al 2020 it is well known that chemoautotrophy depends primarily on the oxidation of reducing substrates and the reduction of teas hooper and dispirito 2013 in the present study the average dcf rate was 60 higher in summer than in winter indicating that temperature may be an important environmental factor affecting the activity of chemoautotrophs in intertidal surface sediments sem analysis also showed that temperature was significantly associated with dcf rates and cbbm gene abundance fig 3 similarly zhao et al 2020 documented that the average dcf rate in reservoir sediments was 36 6 higher at 25 c than that at 15 c these seasonal variations may be due to the effects of temperature on the metabolic activity of chemoautotrophs arndt et al 2013 in addition higher temperature may promote the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria which may provide more sulfide and thus facilitate dcf abdollahi and nedwell 1979 however in some benthic sediments the seasonal variations may be complicated by other influencing factors for example previous studies have reported that in bioturbated sediments the activity of macrofauna can change the availability of electron donors and acceptors which can further affect chemoautotrophy vasquez cardenas et al 2020 however this possible influence of bioturbation on dcf was not examined in the present study which will be explored in our further work in coastal sediments biogeochemical evidence showed that sulfur oxidation dominated chemoautotrophy in reducing substrates while ammonia oxidation was suggested to play only a minor role howarth 1984 middelburg 2011 the production of sulfide depends on the mineralization of organic matter in anoxic sediments and dissimilatory sulfate reduction by anaerobic microorganisms dominates this process jorgensen et al 2019 the main teas responsible for sulfur oxidation in coastal sediments are oxygen and nitrate glud 2008 in coastal sediments both mechanisms of microbial sulfur oxidation have been observed sulfide aerobic oxidation at the oxygen sulfide interface and sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction and their importance in dcf has been demonstrated lipsewers et al 2017 in some studies the dcf rates were observed to be significantly related to the availability of teas represented by oxygen for example lipsewers et al 2017 showed that the hypoxia of overlying water leads to lower dcf rates in coastal sediments compared with oxic conditions in addition a strong correlation was found between sedimentary o2 uptake and dcf rates in coastal sediments which indicated that an increase in oxygen consumption as a proxy for organic matter mineralization leads to an increase in dcf rates vasquez cardenas et al 2020 similarly our results showed that the tou rates were higher in sediments with higher dcf rates figs s3 and s4 however rastelli et al 2016 showed that the dcf rates in a freshwater lake were significantly higher in oxygen depleted water and sediments than those in oxic conditions in their study the microbial abundance including that of viruses and other prokaryotes was higher in anoxic sediment and the activity of viruses accelerated heterotrophic processes and the supply of inorganic reduced compounds such as sulfides and ammonia thereby enhancing chemoautotrophy rastelli et al 2016 moreover the supply of more organic carbon and more reduced inorganic electron donors led to greater dcf rates in reservoir surface sediments zhao et al 2020 in the present study pearson s correlation and sem analyses showed that the availability of reducing substrates represented by sulfide was the key factor affecting the dcf rates in intertidal surface sediments however no significant correlation was observed between dcf rates and organic carbon content fig s3 which was consistent with the studies by santoro et al 2013 and vasquez cardenas et al 2020 these results suggest that sulfide driven dcf in coastal surface sediments may be derived from the mineralization of organic matter in subsurface sediments jorgensen et al 2019 no significant correlation between dcf rates and the concentrations of nitrate was observed in pearson s correlation analysis dyksma et al 2016 found that the addition of nitrate did not increase the dcf rates in anoxic slurry incubations but the addition of thiosulfate in surface sediments stimulated dic assimilation indicating that nitrate as tea may be sufficient in the process of chemoautotrophy these results indicated that the availability of reductive substrates represented by sulfide might be the most important limiting factor of dcf in intertidal surface sediments the abundance and composition of microbial communities also determine the biogeochemical behavior of coastal sediments we investigated the abundance of the cbbl and cbbm genes and found a significant positive correlation between cbbm gene abundance and dcf rates figs 3 and s3 this result indicated that cbbm harboring microorganisms may play a leading role in the dcf of intertidal sediments different chemoautotrophic microbial communities may exhibit different dcf activities alfreider et al 2017 however in the present study no significant correlations were observed between the communities of chemoautotrophic microorganisms and the dcf rates p 0 05 fig 4 at sites lhk and wsk the dcf rate in summer was much higher than that in winter fig 2 but the microbial communities of cbbm and cbbl harboring chemoautotrophic bacteria remained quite stable between different seasons figs 3 and s12 the acca harboring archaeal community at these sites showed some seasonal variation fig s12 but it was unlikely the main cause for the detected seasonal change of dcf rates as the abundance of acca harboring archaea remained quite low compared with that of chemoautotrophic bacteria fig 1 actually the abundance of chemoautotrophic microorganisms played a more important role in regulating dcf rates than their community compositions as significant correlations were observed between chemoautotrophic bacterial abundance and the dcf rates for example although the communities of chemoautotrophic microorganisms acquired from site blg were similar to those from the sites wsk and lhk the dcf rates were low at site blg due to the low abundance of chemoautotrophic microorganisms figs 2 3 and s12 herrmann et al 2015 suggested that although cbbl and cbbm genes were widely distributed their expression may be limited due to distinct levels of oxygen and organic matter in different habitats therefore dna sip experiments were conducted to determine the metabolically active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal surface sediments the results showed that cbbm harboring bacteria were the dominant active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal surface sediments fig 5 according to sequence analysis the retrieved cbbm gene otus were mainly affiliated with gammaproteobacteria fig 7 nevertheless many bacteria harboring this rubisco form ii phylotype were not obviously affiliated with known chemoautotrophic strains indicating that we still know little about this functional group in intertidal ecosystems the dominant genotype during the summer was affiliated with sulfuricella denitrificans and it was found in many habitats including groundwater freshwater lakes and reservoir sediments kumar et al 2018 watanabe et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 s denitrificans is a facultative anaerobe that can oxidize elemental sulfur and thiosulfate as sole energy sources and can utilize oxygen or nitrate as an electron acceptor kojima and fukui 2010 previous studies suggested that sulfur oxidizers including beggiatoa chromaticaeae ectothiorhodospiracea thiotrichales and xanthomonadales were the dominant chemoautotrophic microorganisms in coastal sediments boschker et al 2014 dyksma et al 2016 vasquez cardenas et al 2018 however in the present study burkholderiales and chromatiales represented by sulfuricella denitrificans sulfuriferula acidihalobacter thiobacillus and sulfurivermis fontis were found to be dominant in dcf in intertidal surface sediments figs 7 and s9 in this study ammonia oxidizing archaea represented by nitrososphaeraceae and nitrosopumilaceae were the main microorganisms using the 3 hp 4 hb pathway to fix dic fig s7 however no significant correlation was found between the abundance of the acca gene and the dcf rates although they are important autotrophs in benthic deep sea sediment molari et al 2013 and the deep ocean herndl et al 2005 ammonia oxidizing archaea may play a minor role in dcf in coastal sediments dyksma et al 2016 in addition cbbl harboring bacteria did not show obvious dcf activity previous studies have shown that many bacteria harboring the cbbl gene are associated with facultative chemoautotrophs badger and bek 2008 form ii rubisco was characterized by a poor affinity for co2 and a low discrimination against o2 and consequently it prefers high co2 and low o2 environments alfreider et al 2017 berg 2011 previous studies have shown that gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers gsos play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen sulfur and carbon glaubitz et al 2013 in the present study based on metagenomic surveys most of the observed gsos in intertidal surface sediments harbored genes related to carbon fixation sulfur oxidation denitrification or dnra fig 8 showing that these microorganisms may play a vital role in the coupled cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in intertidal sediments however the presence of these functional genes was not proof of their activity and future transcriptomic experiments will be required to reveal the active genes in these coastal sediments 5 conclusion this study explored the rates and roles of dcf in estuarine intertidal sediments significant correlations were found between dcf rates and sulfide content demonstrating that the availability of reductive substrates represented by sulfide is a primary limiting factor of dcf in intertidal sediments temperature was also a key factor affecting dcf rates and cbbm gene abundance compared with cbbl harboring bacteria cbbm harboring bacteria were more responsible for dcf in the intertidal ecosystem dna sip further confirmed that cbbm harboring sulfur oxidizing bacteria represented by sulfuricella denitrificans and sulfuriferula were the dominant active chemoautotrophic microorganisms in intertidal sediments moreover metagenomic results demonstrated the enormous potential of these chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the coupled cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in intertidal sediments this study provides an important scientific basis for the accurate assessment of coastal primary productivity and improves our

16136,urban water management uwm is a complex problem characterized by multiple alternatives conflicting objectives and multiple uncertainties about key drivers like climate change population growth and increasing urbanization serious games are becoming a popular means to support decision makers who are responsible for the planning and management of urban water systems this is evident in the increasing number of articles about serious games in recent years however the effectiveness of these games in improving decision making and the quality of their design and evaluation approaches remains unclear to understand this better in this paper we identified 41 serious games covering the urban water cycle of these games 15 were shortlisted for a detailed review by using common rational decision making and game design phases from literature we evaluated and mapped how the shortlisted games contribute to these phases our research shows that current serious game applications have multiple limitations lack of focus on executing the initial phases of decision making limited use of storytelling and adaptive game elements use of low quality evaluation design and explicit indicators to measure game outcomes and lastly lack of attention to cognitive processes of players playing the game addressing these limitations is critical for advancing purposeful game design supporting uwm graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords decision analysis urban water systems long term planning serious games design evaluation 1 introduction the health and growth of a city are strongly interlinked to water a city depends on urban water systems to collect treat manage and distribute drinking water wastewater groundwater surfacewater and stormwater adapted from larsen and gujer 1997 today urban water systems face immense pressure on the one hand they need to serve multiple functions such as protecting public health reducing the risk of flooding supporting urban agriculture and providing water of sufficient quantity and quality for domestic use and recreational purposes larsen and gujer 1997 on the other hand urban water systems must deal with the challenges of climate change population growth and rapid urbanization to ensure that urban water systems are future proof a transition to sustainable urban water management uwm is imperative brown et al 2009 this entails strategic planning and adopting alternatives that deliver sustainable outcomes in the long term to achieve sustainable uwm decision makers such as municipality officials or water utility managers need to take decisions concerning how to adapt the urban water systems to reduce the risk of pluvial flooding alves et al 2020 to do so they need to select and assess a large number of relevant gray blue and blue green measures while balancing conflicting social economic and environmental objectives decision making is further complicated by uncertainty about future developments that influence technical biophysical environment and the social context of the urban water system consequently decision quality is often limited including the omission of promising alternatives reliance on unreliable information or logically incorrect reasoning lacking clarity of values and trade offs at stake nor ensuring commitment to action by other crucial stakeholders among other elements that ensure quality decisions spetzler et al 2016 hence for such complex decisions decision makers often rely on facilitated decision making processes to ensure decision quality serious games are gaining popularity as a means to support decision making processes in the water sector these are games that do not have entertainment enjoyment or fun as their primary purpose michael and chen 2006 instead they aim to educate train motivate and induce behavior change ritterfeld et al 2009 serious games are an engaging way for decision makers to experiment and learn things within a game setting that can be later transferred to real world problems the popularity of serious gaming is evident in the manifold games that have been developed in the water sector to enable learning about complex problems and support decision making aubert et al 2018 madani et al 2017 savić et al 2016 although serious games are ubiquitous it is not clear from the current literature how these games improve decision making i e which phases of structured decision making processes do current gaming applications support in what way and which aspects need further attention furthermore a common limitation of existing serious games is that their impact is not studied and the quality of their design is often not evaluated mayer 2012 mitgutsch and alvarado 2012 recent reviews aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 reiterate the need to systematically study the design and evaluation of serious games in the water sector in this paper we build on this issue by examining the design and evaluation approaches for uwm serious games i e games covering issues related to the urban water cycle and highlight aspects that need improvement to address above challenges the following research questions are answered in this paper 1 how do uwm serious games map to common decision making phases 2 how do uwm serious games map to common game design and evaluation approaches we answer these questions by identifying relevant uwm games and critically analyzing their contributions and limitations to the decision analysis and game design and evaluation processes by doing this we aim to improve the design and usability of serious games for structured decision making and highlight future research directions the outline for the paper is as follows in section 2 we highlight common phases followed in a decision making process that follows procedural rationality as well as serious game design and evaluation phases in section 3 the methodology to select and analyze relevant uwm games is presented in section 4 the mappings of selected games to decision making and game design and evaluation phases are presented in section 5 gaps for future research are highlighted and the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 serious games for decision making 2 1 decision making challenges in sustainable uwm cities are increasingly subjected to uwm challenges such as growing population climate change effects and rapid urbanization urban water systems in most developed countries across europe and north america were built a long time ago hering et al 2013 and are not equipped to withstand these pressures failure to rehabilitate these systems may lead to serious issues in the coming decades ashley and cashman 2007 e g water supply shortage or supply with substandard water quality pluvial flooding issues due to insufficient system capacity to accommodate extreme rainfall affected by climate change increase in the risk of fluvial flooding due to dike failures increase in pollution of surface water bodies and other recipients deterioration of ecosystems to name but a few to ensure that urban water systems are climate proof and future proof we need a transition towards a water sensitive city one where the city acts as a water supply catchment provides ecosystem services and comprises water sensitive communities brown et al 2009 ferguson et al 2013 this entails breaking away from the conventional uwm approaches and undertaking a major technical overhaul through wider uptake of innovative alternatives such as decentralized non grid water supply and wastewater alternatives hoffmann et al 2020 kiparsky et al 2013 larsen et al 2016 marlow et al 2013 using stormwater and wastewater as a resource using water for reduced heat stress among other alternatives however this is a complex planning process with many challenges long term planning involves multiple stakeholders each with their own objectives values and perceptions about the problem typical stakeholders include water utilities municipalities different government agencies and water boards consultants and researchers civil society non governmental organizations ngo among many more these stakeholders have different objectives for the planning of urban infrastructure lienert et al 2015 skrydstrup et al 2020 e g water utilities may prioritize low costs safety and security government agencies might focus on the health and well being of citizens whilst advocacy organizations may be driven by nature conservation given the multitude of objectives and agendas that are brought to the forefront by different actors it becomes critical to search for alternatives that perform well across multiple objectives furthermore decision makers can choose from a plethora of available alternatives that need to be evaluated these could be large scale alternatives such as transitioning from centralized water collection and treatment to decentralized systems or increasing the capacity of the existing infrastructure i e pipes pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants butler and davies 2004 other available alternatives include implementing blue green infrastructures to store rainwater and reduce runoff to sewerage pipes these alternatives range from deploying green roofs constructing pervious pavements collecting roof runoff in rain barrels implementing flood parks disconnecting downpipes from sewers or constructing ditches to temporarily store water and allow it to sink slowly into the ground amsterdam rainproof 2021 ciria 2015 however even if a shortlist of relevant alternatives is made and there are reliable ways to measure the performance of these alternatives the impact of these alternatives may vary across criteria and indicators thereby forcing decision makers to make tradeoffs for example increasing pipe capacity may cost more but has higher flood risk reduction potential whereas green blue infrastructures cost less but have limited water retention capacity alves et al 2020 similarly installing green roofs may on the one hand reduce the amount of stormwater runoff but on the other hand it can expose the runoff to nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen used in fertilizers thereby reducing the quality of stormwater pataki et al 2011 furthermore the above decisions need to be taken under pervasive uncertainties for instance climate change is expected to cause more frequent and severe storms in central europe e g kyselý et al 2011 resulting in more stormwater that must be drained by the urban drainage infrastructure similarly population growth increase in urbanization together with complex interactions between the social and environmental systems further add to planning uncertainty not to mention the ever present legislative policy and technological development uncertainties all these uncertainties make it difficult to estimate the future consequences of the alternatives under consideration and hence increase the complexity of related decision making 2 2 decision making phases as the complexity of planning urban water systems increases it becomes important to assist decision makers with appropriate tools and methods to systematically and objectively assess information relevant to the decision problem and make a decision this has been the focus of multiple research fields such as operations research decision support systems and decision analysis which vary in their approach to supporting decision making in this paper we use the decision analysis lens to assess and analyze uwm serious games decision analysis is commonly defined as a formalization of common sense for decision problems which are too complex for informal use of common sense keeney 1982 it is an interdisciplinary field that aims to improve decision making by guiding decision makers through the right procedure of making a decision instead of aiming for the outcome of a rational decision this approach strives for procedural rationality eisenführ et al 2010 the rationale is that by following the right procedure the decision makers will be able to make a good quality decision which is characterized by choosing the appropriate frame creating a set of rich alternatives obtaining relevant and reliable information clarifying values and tradeoffs of decision makers using sound reasoning to select the alternatives and ensuring commitment to implementing the decision taken spetzler et al 2016 it is important to note that decision analysis is not synonymous with decision support nor are these two the same decision analysis employs conceptual and quantitative models to structure and support the decision making process across different phases of decision making it goes far beyond the mathematical modeling of alternatives and their outcomes that are at the heart of most of the model based decision support literature in the water domain hamouda et al 2009 makropoulos and savíc 2019 mannina et al 2019 vojinovic and abbott 2017 at the core of decision analysis six generic phases are usually carried out in series or parallel if not interlacing belton and stewart 2002 eisenführ et al 2010 greco et al 2016 gregory et al 2012 keeney and raiffa 1993 lienert et al 2015 pollack 2009 while their arrangement in time matters for the acceptability and success of the decision process within a specific decision context see e g henao and franco 2016 most frameworks assume a simplistic step wise procedure to characterize the process and its phases as shown in fig 1 1 structuring the problem 2 defining objectives and attributes 3 developing alternatives 4 estimating consequences of alternatives 5 evaluating tradeoffs and selecting alternatives and lastly 6 implementing monitoring and reviewing the decision the starting point of decision making is a problem that can range from messy and unstructured to well defined therefore phase 1 of decision making focuses on structuring the decision problem i e demarcating relevant stakeholders their key issues values uncertainties and constraints and then selecting the appropriate frame of the problem to achieve decision quality in this phase stakeholders must agree on a shared frame of the problem by discussing what is the decision problem being solved how do different stakeholders perceive the problem and what aspects of the problem should be left in and out of consideration spetzler et al 2016 in phase 2 the underlying objectives of the decision maker are defined and they are further operationalized into attributes against which the performance of the alternatives is measured special attention is required in this phase to support uwm decision makers to think of their fundamental objectives and go beyond the salient objective of minimizing costs in phase 3 promising alternatives are shortlisted the surfacing of objectives and search for alternatives occur often through iterations a goal focused process can indicate directions for developing relevant alternatives from using the identified objectives whereas an alternative focused process can lead to identifying the objectives that the explored alternatives have a bearing on belton and stewart 2010 to achieve good decision quality a set of alternatives that are creative varied feasible and representative of a broad range of choices should be prepared through creative thinking techniques such as brainstorming spetzler et al 2016 a common challenge in this phase is to ensure that uwm decision makers think beyond customary alternatives e g adopting blue green measures for stormwater management instead of increasing capacity of drainage pipes or recycling reusing water instead of increasing supply once the alternatives are defined the consequences of these on attributes can be determined in phase 4 using expert judgment available performance data or using mathematical models of different complexity scholten et al 2015 here all relevant and reliable information must be considered in anticipating the outcome of an alternative spetzler et al 2016 once the consequences of alternatives are determined phase 5 focuses on eliciting the subjective preferences of the decision maker s towards the alternatives with respect to their consequences different mathematical aggregation models can be used to evaluate sort or rank the alternatives depending on the decision problem at hand greco et al 2016 langhans et al 2014 following multi attribute value and utility theory a linear additive model is often used to score alternatives whilst the applications by researchers for normative purposes typically aim to identify the highest scoring alternative s to propose to a decision maker the idea of multi criteria decision analysis mcda models is to provide a model for discussion belton and stewart 2002 through which learning about trade offs construction of preferences and identification of suitable alternatives is facilitated once the decision is implemented in phase 6 the real world impact of the decision may be monitored and reviewed which could lead to initiating another decision making cycle to support one or more decision making phases mentioned above serious games are being used to address uwm decision problems which is evident from the manifold games that have been published aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 world water day 2018 however their contribution to decision making processes has not yet been evaluated given their popularity it is important to understand how current serious game applications map to specific decision making phases as defined above thereby revealing the research gaps that still need to be addressed 2 3 serious games a game can be defined as a voluntary activity that immerses a player into an imaginary world that may or may not have a relation to real life a game is bounded by rules location and time and can create a community of players that may last even after the game is over huizinga 1980 games are attractive to play as they provide a sense of autonomy competence and relatedness to players ryan et al 2006 although games are generally thought of as a means of entertainment more recently they are also being used for serious purposes the notion of serious games was first introduced by abt 1970 establishing that games can be used for purposes such as education decision making and policymaking a key advantage of serious games is that they provide an engaging and immersive platform for players to experiment with their decisions which can be costly to do in the real world they not only challenge the players to do better but also provide them with a chance to reflect on their behavior within the game and understand its consequences for the real world what sets serious games apart from other games is that instead of having entertainment as a primary goal michael and chen 2006 they strive for a more serious purpose based on the classification by uskov and sekar 2014 the purpose of serious games can be divided into the following categories 1 decision making improve decision making e g accelerating decision making processes 2 simulation face to face in person or digital computerized simulation of reality 3 sharing of knowledge educative or informative games 4 persuasion attitude or behavior change 5 data collection exchange exploration data collection or exchange research discovery innovation and adventure 6 motivation through rewards badges and scores 7 training practicing or teaching skills such as communication skills management skills problem solving skills technical skills or teamwork and collaboration skills 2 3 1 serious game design phases five phases are generally carried out for the design of serious games as proposed by duke and geurts 2004 and further adapted by peters and westelaken 2014 these phases shown in fig 2 are 1 design specifications 2 systems analysis 3 detailed game design 4 game construction testing and validation and finally 5 game implementation and evaluation the game design process starts with phase 1 where the design specifications of the game are clarified i e the purpose of the game what the final product should look like and under what conditions will it be used this phase is carried out in consultation with the client or the intended players of the game once the design specifications are captured the real world system where the problem lies is analyzed in phase 2 in this phase important elements to be highlighted in the game are captured e g processes theoretical concepts actors information technical artifacts and the relations between these elements such as responsibilities exchange of resources or information once the real world system is captured the focus of phase 3 is on translating the real world elements into game mechanics and game elements in this phase the game concept and all game elements are worked out in detail on paper before the actual game is constructed this involves selecting which elements from the system analysis should be included in the game how should these elements be represented in the game e g through scenarios roles events analogies rules policies accounting system scoring visuals indicators story and what format best suits the game e g board game card game computer based game or an online game although there is no clear consensus on what elements a good serious game must include ravyse et al 2017 identify 5 success factors that impact the learning experience of players 1 backstory and production 2 realism 3 interaction 4 feedback and debriefing and 5 artificial intelligence ai and adaptivity a good backstory or game narrative not only engages immerses and motivates players but can also significantly enhance the learning experience naul and liu 2020 similarly high fidelity realistic games lead to increased game appreciation among the players ravyse et al 2017 by providing a platform for players to interact with each other serious games can enable players to learn together while creating a feeling of relatedness that can enhance the motivational pull of the game ryan et al 2006 in game feedback through rewards and punishments provide immediate effects caused by a player s action and post game feedback helps consolidate the player s learnings crookall 2010 plass et al 2015 lastly making a game adaptive through the use of ai accommodates players with different skills learning abilities and learning needs and may even increase the replay potential of games as new scenarios challenges are encountered across multiple game sessions lopes and bidarra 2011 using inputs from phase 3 the game is constructed in phase 4 and converted into a tangible product this phase is not a one shot production process but involves ample testing debugging validation and improvement of the game lastly in phase 5 the meta cycle in which the game is embedded called the macro cycle klabbers 2009 is designed starting from briefing session gameplay followed by debriefing and evaluation of outcomes the evaluation of serious games involves both the achievement of the learning goal s and other aspects such as participants engagement acceptance game design performance user experience enjoyment cognition and behavior and satisfaction with the game baalsrud hauge et al 2013 calderón ruiz 2015 in this phase participants learning and experience is evaluated through various methods such as questionnaires interviews participant observation and focus group discussions these methods can be deployed either by a facilitator if their presence is required or can be integrated in the game e g by rating the game or filling an online questionnaire after playing the digital game furthermore experimental design approaches are often applied to explain variability of result and to establish a causal relationship between the game contents and the outcomes the gold standard for such experiments are randomized controlled trials rct as common in statistics medical and health research and other research fields that draw heavily on experimental design in rcts a sufficiently large number of participants are randomly allocated to different treatments with intervention and control group s without intervention list et al 2011 this approach has been adopted for serious gaming in the health sector where rcts are commonly used as they can control over confounding effects and the difference in outcomes between the control and the treatment group can be attributed to the game intervention gentry et al 2019 primack et al 2012 other non experimental or quasi experimental approaches to ascertain the effect of games are also commonly applied e g single group post evaluation or pre and post testing these suffer however from low internal validity than rcts in terms of establishing causal effects see further marsden torgerson 2012 shadish et al 2001 although serious games are increasingly being used as part of the decision making process there is a risk of placing high hopes in games without acknowledging that poor game development and evaluation can undermine these ambitions hence in this paper we assess the detailed design phase 3 and evaluation phase 5 approaches of selected serious game applications with respect to best practices described above 3 methodology 3 1 study selection to answer the research questions posed in this paper we opt for a narrative review of games that are designed to support decision making for uwm issues this method is most suited when researchers aim to gain an initial impression of the research area without the aim of being exhaustive in their search bryman 2012 following this method we analyze a small but representative set of serious games the procedure followed for selection appraisal and analysis of articles for this review is described below 3 1 1 search strategy and keywords a search strategy refers to the process followed for finding relevant papers we initiated our search by scanning key review papers on serious games in the water sector aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 and browsing the gaming websites geneva water hub n d world water day 2018 a broader search was further conducted in google scholar scopus and ieee explore databases to conduct this search the keywords were divided into the following categories to cover the topics of serious games and urban water management category a serious gam simulation gam an asterisk was used to include different forms of the same word e g gam to include both game and gaming in the search category b urban water urban water manag urban water planning urban water infrastructure these keywords were further used in search strings to cover different combinations of keywords in the above categories therefore the search strings covered the combinations a1 or a2 or a3 and or b1 or b2 or b3 the bibliography of articles found through this search was further scanned for relevant references a total of 41 serious games were identified this way these were further shortlisted for a detailed review based on the selection criteria shown in the next section 3 1 2 selection criteria to select games relevant for this paper we applied the following criteria on the set of 41 games 1 games covered in recent academic papers only serious games in papers published from the year 2010 onwards were included in the review although we found relevant commercial games as well e g dowino 2019 ibm 2010 michigan state university msu 2018 ram jam 2021 university of california berkley ucb 2014 these were left out due to limited documentation about their game mechanics and game design processes 2 game purpose and format in addition to games aimed at improving decision making we also consider games designed for other purposes described in section 2 3 since these games may also contribute to one or more phases of decision making for example data collection games may help monitor and understand decision maker s current preferences or their decision making behavior moreover we consider both digital and non digital serious games that could occur in different formats card games board games simulation games or a role playing game implemented with or without the use of a computer 3 gaming applications we only include game applications not stand alone simulations e g makropoulos et al 2008 willuweit and o sullivan 2013 or ict tools e g pahl wostl et al 2003 furthermore we excluded publications that only present frameworks to use a game elsawah et al 2015 or ideas to improve an existing game d artista and hellweger 2007 without developing the game application 4 urban peri urban water management problems we only include games that are focused on urban or peri urban water management issues referred to in this paper as uwm games games focused on more broad water management problems were excluded e g douven et al 2014 dray et al 2006 stefanska et al 2011 sušnik et al 2018 5 decision makers and types of decisions we include games that are targeted at uwm professionals or have been tested played with them these professionals could be government officials water managers private enterprises research institutes journalists urban planners environmental organizations policymakers and ngos games targeted at the education or engagement of the general public or students appel et al 2019 arbesser rastburg and fuchs hanusch 2019 aubert and lienert 2019 cheng et al 2019 hirsch 2010 predescu et al 2021 rebolledo mendez et al 2009 rusca et al 2012 are not included in the review furthermore we cover games that involve both individual and group decision making and decisions made at the strategic operational or tactical level the initial set of 41 papers was first assessed based on their title abstract and conclusion to check if they matched the selection criteria whenever this information was insufficient the articles were read more thoroughly a total of 15 games were selected this way for further analysis supplementary material a provides additional information about the excluded games including the reasons for exclusion an overview of the 15 shortlisted games is provided in table 1 along with the following additional information 1 topic the focus area of the game within uwm problems 2 game purpose the intended aim of the game as declared by the game developers 3 game purpose category categories as defined in section 2 3 decision making simulation knowledge sharing persuasion data collection exchange exploration motivation or training 3 2 analysis in this paper each game presented in table 1 was analyzed based on information available in the academic publication or by playing the game where possible for instance the first author played the segwade game online information on decision phases and game design phases was extracted for each game and mapped onto the decision making and game design phases presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 3 2 1 decision making phases to map the serious games to decision making phases the following three levels of mapping are defined well addressed the decision making phase is executed in the game partially addressed the decision making is partially executed in the game and its implementation can be improved not addressed no information the decision making phase is not executed in the game or no information is provided in the paper when mapping the games to decision making phases it was found that some games are not implemented as a stand alone game but embedded into a larger workshop process where players could be involved in the early phases of decision making in these cases we also considered the contribution of activities conducted in addition to the game session towards decision making and game design phases for example if a game only presented pre decided alternatives to players then it was considered to not contribute to phase 3 developing alternatives of decision making opposite of this if the players were involved in developing alternatives either while developing the game or in the game session then that game was considered to contribute to phase 3 3 2 2 game design phases to map the selected games to phase 3 detailed game design gaming elements were categorized for each game using the following success factors identified by ravyse et al 2017 1 backstory and production storyline or narrative of the game 2 realism resemblance of the game to real life 3 interaction interaction among the players and between the game interface and the player 4 feedback and debriefing in game cause and effect feedback and post game debriefing 5 ai and adaptivity dynamic adjustment of game response challenge based on the player s skills learning ability and learning needs similarly phase 5 implementation and evaluation of each game was assessed by extracting information on 1 evaluation methods and research approach used post test design pre test post test design rct or a similar approach 2 characteristics assessed during evaluation adapted from calderón and ruiz 2015 learning goals achievement of game objective with or without explicit indicators game design mechanics realism rules level of detail aesthetics game complexity clarity and ease of understanding player experience ease of use playability aspects satisfaction player engagement interaction with user interface players enjoyment and fun cognition and behavior impact on player s emotions mood attention level the results of the above analysis are presented in section 4 4 results 4 1 mapping serious games to decision making phases table 2 presents the mapping of serious games reviewed in this paper to decision making phases see supplementary material b for more details a common observation across all games is that all phases of decision making were not addressed in any game in order of the decision making phases phase 1 problem structuring was covered in 4 games phase 2 defining objectives and attributes was covered in 3 games and phase 3 developing alternatives was covered in 4 games in games that covered phase 1 5 7 10 15 players were involved in demarcating the decision problem tackled in the game in ter aguas 10 and waterstory 15 companion group modeling approach was used to identify the key water issues actors and their negotiation strategies and recreate the real world problem in the game in game 7 interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with relevant stakeholders to identify their main concern access to safe drinking water supply the serious game was then designed to provide more insight into this problem in the management game asset management 5 phase 1 was executed in the game itself as the players discussed problems within different departments in the organization and the differences in their perception about asset management in contrast games in which phase 1 was not covered adopted a decision problem either as pre determined by previous work e g 9 took a known real world problem 2 3 6 or tested a hypothesis 1 4 few games in which phase 1 was covered also implicitly covered phases 2 and 3 7 10 15 although specific methods to find fundamental objectives of the intended players or generate new alternatives were not deployed in these game it is implicit that the companion modeling workshops and stakeholder consultations were used to develop a broader understanding of stakeholders objectives and seek suggestions for relevant alternatives this was not the case for management game asset management 5 because the alternatives and objectives were pre decided and provided to the participants in the game in idt 2 phase 3 was well covered as the game allowed players to come up with their own creative drought management alternatives termed as innovations thus encouraging them to think beyond conventional alternatives such as water use restrictions increasing irrigation efficiencies or developing wetlands in comparison to the first three phases of decision making the later phases received much greater attention in the games reviewed phase 4 estimating consequences of alternatives was covered in 14 out of 15 games in most games computer models and tools were deployed to determine the consequences of alternatives these ranged from system dynamics or integrated assessment models in idt 2 la water game 3 perspective based simulation game 8 waterstory 15 to capture causal relations to a simple excel spreadsheet as used in wastewater rpg 13 in other games a simpler approach was adopted as they used fictitious case studies and performance numbers as in water safety plan 14 or provided relevant pieces of information to the players e g current and forecasted reservoir volumes as in call for water 1 based on which players could take decisions phase 5 evaluating trade offs and selecting alternatives was covered in all games this was expected since most games reviewed in this paper aim to support decision processes where the player decides the gameplay in this phase players evaluated trade offs spanning across economic social or environmental objectives for instance in the climate game 11 players could choose from a list of decisions such as improving housing conditions developing more green areas or water storage facilities and evaluate the tradeoffs in performance of these alternatives on values of quality of life costs added water storage capacity water safety and climate proof advantage lastly phase 6 implementing monitoring and reviewing the decision was covered in 11 out of 15 games in these games the decision was not implemented in the real world but in the gaming environment often simulated using an underlying model in some games player s in game decisions were even monitored and recorded for further analysis for instance in the call for water 1 and maintenance in motion 4 games players decisions were monitored to understand the relation between the quality of information provided in the game and the decision making strategies adopted by the player in addition to the individual frequencies of each decision making phase it is evident that phases 4 5 and 6 are most frequently covered in the analyzed games covered in 11 out of 15 games these games were typically played in multiple rounds and used an action reaction feedback loop in such a loop players first chose from a set of alternatives then their decision was either fed into a model or led to certain rule based consequences once confronted with the impact of their decision players learn from the game reaction and re formulate their strategy for the next round 4 2 assessing game design and game evaluation table 3 provides an overview of game design elements used in the selected games as mapped to five success criteria backstory and production realism interaction feedback ai and adaptivity that are associated with enhanced learning from games ravyse et al 2017 in 5 out of 15 games 6 8 10 12 14 reviewed in this paper backstory was incorporated in the game design by setting the scene through a short introduction or play for instance the perspective based simulation game 8 started by introducing the players to the present situation of management of river waas through a story in the game visimple 12 a virtual engineer gave a short introductory speech hinting at optimization hot spots to the player and guided the player throughout the game by providing context specific feedback in the other 10 games story elements such as a narrative virtual agents or a non player character were not explicitly incorporated instead the players were only introduced to the game objectives at the start of the game regarding realism all serious games incorporated elements to make the game resemble reality various approaches were used for this assigning roles to players based on real world actors using realistic scenarios high fidelity visuals such as geographical maps visualizing the terrain and geography of the real world area on the game board or through 3d technology and rounds to simulate different climatic conditions in all games players could interact with the game or with each other in some form the most common approach used to stimulate player to player interactions was through cooperative playing where players negotiated and discussed to agree on a common strategy e g 2 3 4 7 10 11 14 other than that digital games such as call for water 1 millbrook serious game 6 segwade 9 visimple 12 and waterstory 15 allowed players to interact with the game interface players explored the game environment by clicking moving or zooming in on objects in the game and selecting their actions feedback mechanisms were incorporated in all games in some form this was done either by visualizing performance indicators game scores or organizing debriefing to let players reflect on the game strategy and the results in several games e g 3 5 7 8 10 11 14 15 debriefing was also implemented at the end of each round or in the middle of the game to provide more frequent feedback and reflection to the players a common observation across all games reviewed in this paper is that ai and adaptivity elements were not incorporated in any game i e individual characteristics of a player such as skill level learning ability or learning needs were not taken into account this is also recognized as one of the limitations in call for water 1 game where the authors mention that the game difficulty should be adapted to match the player s level of knowledge crochemore et al 2021 concerning phase 5 implementation and evaluation table 4 summarizes the evaluation methods and experimental approach and the characteristics assessed in 7 out of 15 games 1 2 3 4 8 14 15 a post game evaluation approach was used by conducting a debriefing session discussion or asking players to fill a questionnaire in 4 games 6 7 10 11 a single group pre game and post game design was used by conducting interviews or discussions in 3 games 5 9 13 participants were observed by a facilitator or their in game decisions were logged to evaluate the game impact whereas no information on evaluation was provided by the game visimple 12 to know whether a game achieved its purpose it is not only important to evaluate the performance of the game on learning outcomes but also aspects such as game design game complexity player experience player engagement and cognition and behavior in the 15 games reviewed in this paper the frequency of characteristics evaluated were as follows learning goals evaluated in 13 games player experience 4 games game design 2 games game complexity 2 games player engagement 1 game cognition and behavior related aspects were not evaluated by any of the games this indicates that characteristics other than learning goals are often under evaluated moreover among games in which learning goal was evaluated explicit criteria was used in only 6 games 1 3 4 6 7 9 to measure the game impact for instance in segwade 9 learning outcomes were operationalized as closeness to the best solution as reported in the literature and in maintenance in motion 4 the change in confirmation or rejection of seven different hypotheses related to the millbrook flooding case was measured in other games a generic description of players learnings was provided as mentioned either by the players themselves or as observed by the game facilitators 5 future research directions in this paper we reviewed and analyzed 15 serious games for their contribution to 6 decision making phases and 2 game design phases based on the above review and associated analyses the following directions for improvement of uwm games and future research have been identified 1 support and include early phases of decision making from our review of 15 uwm games we did not find sufficient evidence that the initial phases of decision making were explicitly addressed by the game authors phase 1 problem structuring was covered by 4 games phase 2 defining objectives and attributes was covered by 3 games and phase 3 developing alternatives was covered by 4 games one plausible explanation for the lack of attention on these phases is that information about the early phases of game development process was not provided in the reviewed publications another reason could be that games were not explicitly designed to target initial phases of decision making this phenomenon is also observed in the software tools designed to support mcda processes mustajoki and marttunen 2017 indicating a broader lack of support for early decision making phases to better target the initial phases through a game we recommend using a companion modelling approach etienne 2014 as done in games ter aguas 10 and waterstory 15 using this approach a workshop can be conducted centered around a role playing game that helps model the complexity of the decision problem by taking the perspectives of different stakeholders into account aubert et al 2018 note that by suggesting that games include earlier phases of decision making we do not intend to recommend that games must be designed to cover all decision making phases such an attempt will be difficult to achieve as different decision making phases have different demands however even if a serious game is focused on improving the later phases of decision making we recommend that the game developers walk through the initial decision making phases with the target audience and relevant stakeholders to define an appropriate decision frame and capture the relevant complexities of the real world problem this can be done using popular problem structuring methods that can help identify key areas of concern stakeholders objectives alternatives and uncertainties ackermann 2012 mingers 2011 mingers and rosenhead 2004 rosenhead 1996 2 improve game narrative and adaptivity for an immersive player experience out of 15 games reviewed only 5 games incorporated story elements such as an introductory narrative or a virtual agent hence there is scope to improve things in this area as noted by barab et al 2007 we lose interest in a world without story in their review of 26 educational serious games naul liu 2019 list down 4 features of effective game narratives 1 narrative should not be located in one place but distributed throughout the game 2 strong relatable characters can help immerse the players further into the story 3 stories can be made more compelling if they are personalized to the player and respond to their in game decisions and 4 linking the fantasy to the learning objective can be useful these suggestions can provide pointers on how to make a game narrative richer and more immersive none of the games reviewed in this paper were adaptive in nature a common way to make serious games adaptive is to log and process player data and use virtual agents to intervene when e g a player repeats a mistake or is inactive for a long time ravyse et al 2017 some games reviewed e g 4 9 already log players actions for post game analysis so using the data to provide dynamic feedback during the game could be implemented adaptivity can further be improved by personalizing the game s narrative scenarios and quests or adjusting the style and strategy of the non player character using ai lopes and bidarra 2011 although ai holds the promise to enhance immersive learning such high end software development comes with a tradeoff of high computational and development costs a plausible reason that the reviewed games did not incorporate ai is that associated costs cannot be accommodated in typical research budgets available for serious games that are published in the academic literature as opposed to entertainment games developed by the game industry 3 evaluate uwm serious games using controlled experiments and use explicit decision quality indicators the most common approach used to evaluate changes attributed to the reviewed games was a single group post test design 7 out of 15 games this approach also referred to as as a one shot case study has limited scientific value as the observed outcomes of the game intervention cannot be compared to a baseline before the game nor compared to any reference group campbell and stanley 1963 single group pre test post test design was the second most common approach and used in 4 out of 15 games although this approach is better than a single group post test design in that it sets a baseline to which changes after the game can be compared this experimental design faces multiple threats to internal validity campbell and stanley 1963 marsden and torgerson 2012 none of the game evaluations reviewed in this paper applied a qualified experimental design let alone a randomized experiment or rct to the contrary in the healthcare sector use of rcts to establish causality is common practice where a gamified intervention is often compared to a non gamified intervention gentry et al 2019 primack et al 2012 we recommend the water sector to move in that direction to build rigor and better understand the causal effect and added value of serious games for uwm applications if the aim is to identify which specific element of a game led to the observed change then experimental designs that explicitly isolate and study the impact of the game elements should be preferred to comparison of gamified interventions with non gamified interventions landers et al 2018 regarding the characteristics evaluated in analyzed uwm games very few games focused on evaluating characteristics other than learning outcomes i e game design game complexity player experience player engagement and cognition and behavior whilst the focus on the attainment of the serious part of the game is understandable game developers should not lose sight of evaluating the fun aspects of gaming too existing questionnaires e g ijsselsteijn et al 2013 and högberg et al 2019 can be deployed to better assess a player s gaming experience uwm serious games should also further benefit by taking into closer consideration state of the art in the field of decision science despite aiming to improve decision making only 6 games used explicit indicators to evaluate whether the game improved decision making or not the decision maker s intuitive responses must be checked against evidence and the quality of their decisions should be checked against evaluation criteria to achieve this decision quality indicators provided by spetzler et al 2016 can be used as a starting point following these indicators a few guiding questions to consider while designing game evaluation could be did the players consider the broader context of the infrastructure related choices to be made e g climate change adaption opportunities alongside more immediate infrastructure replacement needs did the game help players go beyond traditional uwm alternatives and come up with new alternatives such as blue green measures did players refer to factsheets or future predictions while choosing a uwm alternative or was their decision intuitive in nature what reasoning did players use while choosing between different uwm alternatives was there a difference between the reasoning reported pre game and post game 4 incorporate cognitive processes in game design so far we assumed that the decision maker is rational and that they can achieve a good quality decision if supported by the correct procedure however this does not resemble reality well behavioral science shows that cognitive processes significantly influence if not determine information processing judgment and decision making biases and heuristics commonly lead the decision maker astray from what rational decision making theory would prescribe for example player s decisions are impacted by framing effects of how the set of alternatives are presented or mood states and emotions induced when playing the game lerner et al 2015 tversky and kahneman 1989 none of the games reviewed in this paper evaluated cognitive effects of the game games aim to create immersive environments that impact people s attention cognitive and affective processing in addition to actions or choices within a given framing hence understanding the impact of these aspects on the achievement of the purpose of a serious game with regard to improving decision making in uwm is a promising future direction experiments could be set up to test this impact with potential independent variables being different framings of an alternative emotions induced at the start of during a game and dependent variables such as decision quality or engagement indicators conclusion planning and management of urban water systems are critical to mitigate the challenges that the future brings population growth climate change and rapid urbanization to name but a few stakeholders in charge of uwm are confronted with complex planning and other decisions that need to be made serious games have emerged as a popular tool for decision making but their current contribution to decision making and game design processes both remain unassessed in this paper we reviewed 15 serious games that were a mapped to common decision making phases and b assessed in terms of game design and evaluation approaches the results obtained show that serious games designed for supporting uwm related decisions focus primarily on the later phases of decision making while the initial phases i e phase 1 problem structuring phase 2 defining objectives and attributes and phase 3 defining alternatives are not well covered although the focus on the later phases is understandable given that serious games are a medium for trial and error in a safe environment initial phases of decision making should not be ignored even if the game is designed to support the later phases covering the initial phases well makes sure that the right decision problem will be addressed through the serious game with respect to the game design each game s design elements phase 3 detailed game design and methods used to evaluate the game s impact phase 5 implementation and evaluation were assessed the results obtained for the game design elements show that uwm games reviewed in this paper lack elements of a backstory and production and b ai and adaptivity crafting a richer game narrative and making the game response personalized to the player can make these games more attractive and immersive to play thereby providing improved learning gains regarding the game evaluation it was found that single group post test research design is the most commonly used approach to evaluate the outcomes of uwm games although this approach may be adopted for pragmatic reasons the results of such an evaluation make it difficult to establish a causal inference between the game intervention and its outcomes thus it is recommended to use the rct instead following research designs proposed by landers et al 2018 other aspects that can be improved in the game evaluation include the use of explicit decision quality indicators to measure the game impact and paying equal focus to the evaluation of both learning outcomes and game experience design related characteristics the scope of the review conducted in this paper has its limitations since only uwm games targeted at professionals were reviewed in this paper the scope can be further extended to cover games targeted at students and general public see supplementary material for examples with respect to game design the findings obtained are limited by the criteria used to evaluate this aspect the successful game design factors listed by ravyse et al 2017 were derived by evaluating edutainment education games targeted at students at different levels of schooling primary to college level in this paper it was assumed that the findings from ravyse et al 2017 are transferrable to adults professionals at later stages of brain and personal development and who have higher education levels the applicability of these factors for serious gaming with adults professionals needs further investigation beyond the scope of this paper furthermore the results obtained apply only to the 15 uwm games reviewed however given that mapping of serious games to decision and games design processes is missing in the urban water sector we hope that that designers and practitioners can gain insights from this review leading to improved design and utility of serious games it is further speculated that the review findings obtained will be of use to decision making in sectors other than water it is worthwhile to conduct a domain independent review of serious games for decision making further improvement can be made to such a review by including games that are not published in academic journals although very limited information was available for these games online this can be supplemented by conducting interviews with relevant game developers finally to overcome the gaps identified in the review the following future research directions and recommendations are made to improve the design and utility of uwm games 1 support and include early phases of decision making through serious games using a gamified companion modelling approach 2 create a rich game narrative and adapt the game to the skill learning ability and learning needs of the player 3 ensure uwm games are systematically evaluated by using explicit evaluation indicators and controlled experiments and 4 incorporate cognitive processes in the game design and test the influence of behavioral factors such as emotions using a suitable

16136,urban water management uwm is a complex problem characterized by multiple alternatives conflicting objectives and multiple uncertainties about key drivers like climate change population growth and increasing urbanization serious games are becoming a popular means to support decision makers who are responsible for the planning and management of urban water systems this is evident in the increasing number of articles about serious games in recent years however the effectiveness of these games in improving decision making and the quality of their design and evaluation approaches remains unclear to understand this better in this paper we identified 41 serious games covering the urban water cycle of these games 15 were shortlisted for a detailed review by using common rational decision making and game design phases from literature we evaluated and mapped how the shortlisted games contribute to these phases our research shows that current serious game applications have multiple limitations lack of focus on executing the initial phases of decision making limited use of storytelling and adaptive game elements use of low quality evaluation design and explicit indicators to measure game outcomes and lastly lack of attention to cognitive processes of players playing the game addressing these limitations is critical for advancing purposeful game design supporting uwm graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords decision analysis urban water systems long term planning serious games design evaluation 1 introduction the health and growth of a city are strongly interlinked to water a city depends on urban water systems to collect treat manage and distribute drinking water wastewater groundwater surfacewater and stormwater adapted from larsen and gujer 1997 today urban water systems face immense pressure on the one hand they need to serve multiple functions such as protecting public health reducing the risk of flooding supporting urban agriculture and providing water of sufficient quantity and quality for domestic use and recreational purposes larsen and gujer 1997 on the other hand urban water systems must deal with the challenges of climate change population growth and rapid urbanization to ensure that urban water systems are future proof a transition to sustainable urban water management uwm is imperative brown et al 2009 this entails strategic planning and adopting alternatives that deliver sustainable outcomes in the long term to achieve sustainable uwm decision makers such as municipality officials or water utility managers need to take decisions concerning how to adapt the urban water systems to reduce the risk of pluvial flooding alves et al 2020 to do so they need to select and assess a large number of relevant gray blue and blue green measures while balancing conflicting social economic and environmental objectives decision making is further complicated by uncertainty about future developments that influence technical biophysical environment and the social context of the urban water system consequently decision quality is often limited including the omission of promising alternatives reliance on unreliable information or logically incorrect reasoning lacking clarity of values and trade offs at stake nor ensuring commitment to action by other crucial stakeholders among other elements that ensure quality decisions spetzler et al 2016 hence for such complex decisions decision makers often rely on facilitated decision making processes to ensure decision quality serious games are gaining popularity as a means to support decision making processes in the water sector these are games that do not have entertainment enjoyment or fun as their primary purpose michael and chen 2006 instead they aim to educate train motivate and induce behavior change ritterfeld et al 2009 serious games are an engaging way for decision makers to experiment and learn things within a game setting that can be later transferred to real world problems the popularity of serious gaming is evident in the manifold games that have been developed in the water sector to enable learning about complex problems and support decision making aubert et al 2018 madani et al 2017 savić et al 2016 although serious games are ubiquitous it is not clear from the current literature how these games improve decision making i e which phases of structured decision making processes do current gaming applications support in what way and which aspects need further attention furthermore a common limitation of existing serious games is that their impact is not studied and the quality of their design is often not evaluated mayer 2012 mitgutsch and alvarado 2012 recent reviews aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 reiterate the need to systematically study the design and evaluation of serious games in the water sector in this paper we build on this issue by examining the design and evaluation approaches for uwm serious games i e games covering issues related to the urban water cycle and highlight aspects that need improvement to address above challenges the following research questions are answered in this paper 1 how do uwm serious games map to common decision making phases 2 how do uwm serious games map to common game design and evaluation approaches we answer these questions by identifying relevant uwm games and critically analyzing their contributions and limitations to the decision analysis and game design and evaluation processes by doing this we aim to improve the design and usability of serious games for structured decision making and highlight future research directions the outline for the paper is as follows in section 2 we highlight common phases followed in a decision making process that follows procedural rationality as well as serious game design and evaluation phases in section 3 the methodology to select and analyze relevant uwm games is presented in section 4 the mappings of selected games to decision making and game design and evaluation phases are presented in section 5 gaps for future research are highlighted and the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 serious games for decision making 2 1 decision making challenges in sustainable uwm cities are increasingly subjected to uwm challenges such as growing population climate change effects and rapid urbanization urban water systems in most developed countries across europe and north america were built a long time ago hering et al 2013 and are not equipped to withstand these pressures failure to rehabilitate these systems may lead to serious issues in the coming decades ashley and cashman 2007 e g water supply shortage or supply with substandard water quality pluvial flooding issues due to insufficient system capacity to accommodate extreme rainfall affected by climate change increase in the risk of fluvial flooding due to dike failures increase in pollution of surface water bodies and other recipients deterioration of ecosystems to name but a few to ensure that urban water systems are climate proof and future proof we need a transition towards a water sensitive city one where the city acts as a water supply catchment provides ecosystem services and comprises water sensitive communities brown et al 2009 ferguson et al 2013 this entails breaking away from the conventional uwm approaches and undertaking a major technical overhaul through wider uptake of innovative alternatives such as decentralized non grid water supply and wastewater alternatives hoffmann et al 2020 kiparsky et al 2013 larsen et al 2016 marlow et al 2013 using stormwater and wastewater as a resource using water for reduced heat stress among other alternatives however this is a complex planning process with many challenges long term planning involves multiple stakeholders each with their own objectives values and perceptions about the problem typical stakeholders include water utilities municipalities different government agencies and water boards consultants and researchers civil society non governmental organizations ngo among many more these stakeholders have different objectives for the planning of urban infrastructure lienert et al 2015 skrydstrup et al 2020 e g water utilities may prioritize low costs safety and security government agencies might focus on the health and well being of citizens whilst advocacy organizations may be driven by nature conservation given the multitude of objectives and agendas that are brought to the forefront by different actors it becomes critical to search for alternatives that perform well across multiple objectives furthermore decision makers can choose from a plethora of available alternatives that need to be evaluated these could be large scale alternatives such as transitioning from centralized water collection and treatment to decentralized systems or increasing the capacity of the existing infrastructure i e pipes pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants butler and davies 2004 other available alternatives include implementing blue green infrastructures to store rainwater and reduce runoff to sewerage pipes these alternatives range from deploying green roofs constructing pervious pavements collecting roof runoff in rain barrels implementing flood parks disconnecting downpipes from sewers or constructing ditches to temporarily store water and allow it to sink slowly into the ground amsterdam rainproof 2021 ciria 2015 however even if a shortlist of relevant alternatives is made and there are reliable ways to measure the performance of these alternatives the impact of these alternatives may vary across criteria and indicators thereby forcing decision makers to make tradeoffs for example increasing pipe capacity may cost more but has higher flood risk reduction potential whereas green blue infrastructures cost less but have limited water retention capacity alves et al 2020 similarly installing green roofs may on the one hand reduce the amount of stormwater runoff but on the other hand it can expose the runoff to nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen used in fertilizers thereby reducing the quality of stormwater pataki et al 2011 furthermore the above decisions need to be taken under pervasive uncertainties for instance climate change is expected to cause more frequent and severe storms in central europe e g kyselý et al 2011 resulting in more stormwater that must be drained by the urban drainage infrastructure similarly population growth increase in urbanization together with complex interactions between the social and environmental systems further add to planning uncertainty not to mention the ever present legislative policy and technological development uncertainties all these uncertainties make it difficult to estimate the future consequences of the alternatives under consideration and hence increase the complexity of related decision making 2 2 decision making phases as the complexity of planning urban water systems increases it becomes important to assist decision makers with appropriate tools and methods to systematically and objectively assess information relevant to the decision problem and make a decision this has been the focus of multiple research fields such as operations research decision support systems and decision analysis which vary in their approach to supporting decision making in this paper we use the decision analysis lens to assess and analyze uwm serious games decision analysis is commonly defined as a formalization of common sense for decision problems which are too complex for informal use of common sense keeney 1982 it is an interdisciplinary field that aims to improve decision making by guiding decision makers through the right procedure of making a decision instead of aiming for the outcome of a rational decision this approach strives for procedural rationality eisenführ et al 2010 the rationale is that by following the right procedure the decision makers will be able to make a good quality decision which is characterized by choosing the appropriate frame creating a set of rich alternatives obtaining relevant and reliable information clarifying values and tradeoffs of decision makers using sound reasoning to select the alternatives and ensuring commitment to implementing the decision taken spetzler et al 2016 it is important to note that decision analysis is not synonymous with decision support nor are these two the same decision analysis employs conceptual and quantitative models to structure and support the decision making process across different phases of decision making it goes far beyond the mathematical modeling of alternatives and their outcomes that are at the heart of most of the model based decision support literature in the water domain hamouda et al 2009 makropoulos and savíc 2019 mannina et al 2019 vojinovic and abbott 2017 at the core of decision analysis six generic phases are usually carried out in series or parallel if not interlacing belton and stewart 2002 eisenführ et al 2010 greco et al 2016 gregory et al 2012 keeney and raiffa 1993 lienert et al 2015 pollack 2009 while their arrangement in time matters for the acceptability and success of the decision process within a specific decision context see e g henao and franco 2016 most frameworks assume a simplistic step wise procedure to characterize the process and its phases as shown in fig 1 1 structuring the problem 2 defining objectives and attributes 3 developing alternatives 4 estimating consequences of alternatives 5 evaluating tradeoffs and selecting alternatives and lastly 6 implementing monitoring and reviewing the decision the starting point of decision making is a problem that can range from messy and unstructured to well defined therefore phase 1 of decision making focuses on structuring the decision problem i e demarcating relevant stakeholders their key issues values uncertainties and constraints and then selecting the appropriate frame of the problem to achieve decision quality in this phase stakeholders must agree on a shared frame of the problem by discussing what is the decision problem being solved how do different stakeholders perceive the problem and what aspects of the problem should be left in and out of consideration spetzler et al 2016 in phase 2 the underlying objectives of the decision maker are defined and they are further operationalized into attributes against which the performance of the alternatives is measured special attention is required in this phase to support uwm decision makers to think of their fundamental objectives and go beyond the salient objective of minimizing costs in phase 3 promising alternatives are shortlisted the surfacing of objectives and search for alternatives occur often through iterations a goal focused process can indicate directions for developing relevant alternatives from using the identified objectives whereas an alternative focused process can lead to identifying the objectives that the explored alternatives have a bearing on belton and stewart 2010 to achieve good decision quality a set of alternatives that are creative varied feasible and representative of a broad range of choices should be prepared through creative thinking techniques such as brainstorming spetzler et al 2016 a common challenge in this phase is to ensure that uwm decision makers think beyond customary alternatives e g adopting blue green measures for stormwater management instead of increasing capacity of drainage pipes or recycling reusing water instead of increasing supply once the alternatives are defined the consequences of these on attributes can be determined in phase 4 using expert judgment available performance data or using mathematical models of different complexity scholten et al 2015 here all relevant and reliable information must be considered in anticipating the outcome of an alternative spetzler et al 2016 once the consequences of alternatives are determined phase 5 focuses on eliciting the subjective preferences of the decision maker s towards the alternatives with respect to their consequences different mathematical aggregation models can be used to evaluate sort or rank the alternatives depending on the decision problem at hand greco et al 2016 langhans et al 2014 following multi attribute value and utility theory a linear additive model is often used to score alternatives whilst the applications by researchers for normative purposes typically aim to identify the highest scoring alternative s to propose to a decision maker the idea of multi criteria decision analysis mcda models is to provide a model for discussion belton and stewart 2002 through which learning about trade offs construction of preferences and identification of suitable alternatives is facilitated once the decision is implemented in phase 6 the real world impact of the decision may be monitored and reviewed which could lead to initiating another decision making cycle to support one or more decision making phases mentioned above serious games are being used to address uwm decision problems which is evident from the manifold games that have been published aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 world water day 2018 however their contribution to decision making processes has not yet been evaluated given their popularity it is important to understand how current serious game applications map to specific decision making phases as defined above thereby revealing the research gaps that still need to be addressed 2 3 serious games a game can be defined as a voluntary activity that immerses a player into an imaginary world that may or may not have a relation to real life a game is bounded by rules location and time and can create a community of players that may last even after the game is over huizinga 1980 games are attractive to play as they provide a sense of autonomy competence and relatedness to players ryan et al 2006 although games are generally thought of as a means of entertainment more recently they are also being used for serious purposes the notion of serious games was first introduced by abt 1970 establishing that games can be used for purposes such as education decision making and policymaking a key advantage of serious games is that they provide an engaging and immersive platform for players to experiment with their decisions which can be costly to do in the real world they not only challenge the players to do better but also provide them with a chance to reflect on their behavior within the game and understand its consequences for the real world what sets serious games apart from other games is that instead of having entertainment as a primary goal michael and chen 2006 they strive for a more serious purpose based on the classification by uskov and sekar 2014 the purpose of serious games can be divided into the following categories 1 decision making improve decision making e g accelerating decision making processes 2 simulation face to face in person or digital computerized simulation of reality 3 sharing of knowledge educative or informative games 4 persuasion attitude or behavior change 5 data collection exchange exploration data collection or exchange research discovery innovation and adventure 6 motivation through rewards badges and scores 7 training practicing or teaching skills such as communication skills management skills problem solving skills technical skills or teamwork and collaboration skills 2 3 1 serious game design phases five phases are generally carried out for the design of serious games as proposed by duke and geurts 2004 and further adapted by peters and westelaken 2014 these phases shown in fig 2 are 1 design specifications 2 systems analysis 3 detailed game design 4 game construction testing and validation and finally 5 game implementation and evaluation the game design process starts with phase 1 where the design specifications of the game are clarified i e the purpose of the game what the final product should look like and under what conditions will it be used this phase is carried out in consultation with the client or the intended players of the game once the design specifications are captured the real world system where the problem lies is analyzed in phase 2 in this phase important elements to be highlighted in the game are captured e g processes theoretical concepts actors information technical artifacts and the relations between these elements such as responsibilities exchange of resources or information once the real world system is captured the focus of phase 3 is on translating the real world elements into game mechanics and game elements in this phase the game concept and all game elements are worked out in detail on paper before the actual game is constructed this involves selecting which elements from the system analysis should be included in the game how should these elements be represented in the game e g through scenarios roles events analogies rules policies accounting system scoring visuals indicators story and what format best suits the game e g board game card game computer based game or an online game although there is no clear consensus on what elements a good serious game must include ravyse et al 2017 identify 5 success factors that impact the learning experience of players 1 backstory and production 2 realism 3 interaction 4 feedback and debriefing and 5 artificial intelligence ai and adaptivity a good backstory or game narrative not only engages immerses and motivates players but can also significantly enhance the learning experience naul and liu 2020 similarly high fidelity realistic games lead to increased game appreciation among the players ravyse et al 2017 by providing a platform for players to interact with each other serious games can enable players to learn together while creating a feeling of relatedness that can enhance the motivational pull of the game ryan et al 2006 in game feedback through rewards and punishments provide immediate effects caused by a player s action and post game feedback helps consolidate the player s learnings crookall 2010 plass et al 2015 lastly making a game adaptive through the use of ai accommodates players with different skills learning abilities and learning needs and may even increase the replay potential of games as new scenarios challenges are encountered across multiple game sessions lopes and bidarra 2011 using inputs from phase 3 the game is constructed in phase 4 and converted into a tangible product this phase is not a one shot production process but involves ample testing debugging validation and improvement of the game lastly in phase 5 the meta cycle in which the game is embedded called the macro cycle klabbers 2009 is designed starting from briefing session gameplay followed by debriefing and evaluation of outcomes the evaluation of serious games involves both the achievement of the learning goal s and other aspects such as participants engagement acceptance game design performance user experience enjoyment cognition and behavior and satisfaction with the game baalsrud hauge et al 2013 calderón ruiz 2015 in this phase participants learning and experience is evaluated through various methods such as questionnaires interviews participant observation and focus group discussions these methods can be deployed either by a facilitator if their presence is required or can be integrated in the game e g by rating the game or filling an online questionnaire after playing the digital game furthermore experimental design approaches are often applied to explain variability of result and to establish a causal relationship between the game contents and the outcomes the gold standard for such experiments are randomized controlled trials rct as common in statistics medical and health research and other research fields that draw heavily on experimental design in rcts a sufficiently large number of participants are randomly allocated to different treatments with intervention and control group s without intervention list et al 2011 this approach has been adopted for serious gaming in the health sector where rcts are commonly used as they can control over confounding effects and the difference in outcomes between the control and the treatment group can be attributed to the game intervention gentry et al 2019 primack et al 2012 other non experimental or quasi experimental approaches to ascertain the effect of games are also commonly applied e g single group post evaluation or pre and post testing these suffer however from low internal validity than rcts in terms of establishing causal effects see further marsden torgerson 2012 shadish et al 2001 although serious games are increasingly being used as part of the decision making process there is a risk of placing high hopes in games without acknowledging that poor game development and evaluation can undermine these ambitions hence in this paper we assess the detailed design phase 3 and evaluation phase 5 approaches of selected serious game applications with respect to best practices described above 3 methodology 3 1 study selection to answer the research questions posed in this paper we opt for a narrative review of games that are designed to support decision making for uwm issues this method is most suited when researchers aim to gain an initial impression of the research area without the aim of being exhaustive in their search bryman 2012 following this method we analyze a small but representative set of serious games the procedure followed for selection appraisal and analysis of articles for this review is described below 3 1 1 search strategy and keywords a search strategy refers to the process followed for finding relevant papers we initiated our search by scanning key review papers on serious games in the water sector aubert et al 2018 savić et al 2016 and browsing the gaming websites geneva water hub n d world water day 2018 a broader search was further conducted in google scholar scopus and ieee explore databases to conduct this search the keywords were divided into the following categories to cover the topics of serious games and urban water management category a serious gam simulation gam an asterisk was used to include different forms of the same word e g gam to include both game and gaming in the search category b urban water urban water manag urban water planning urban water infrastructure these keywords were further used in search strings to cover different combinations of keywords in the above categories therefore the search strings covered the combinations a1 or a2 or a3 and or b1 or b2 or b3 the bibliography of articles found through this search was further scanned for relevant references a total of 41 serious games were identified this way these were further shortlisted for a detailed review based on the selection criteria shown in the next section 3 1 2 selection criteria to select games relevant for this paper we applied the following criteria on the set of 41 games 1 games covered in recent academic papers only serious games in papers published from the year 2010 onwards were included in the review although we found relevant commercial games as well e g dowino 2019 ibm 2010 michigan state university msu 2018 ram jam 2021 university of california berkley ucb 2014 these were left out due to limited documentation about their game mechanics and game design processes 2 game purpose and format in addition to games aimed at improving decision making we also consider games designed for other purposes described in section 2 3 since these games may also contribute to one or more phases of decision making for example data collection games may help monitor and understand decision maker s current preferences or their decision making behavior moreover we consider both digital and non digital serious games that could occur in different formats card games board games simulation games or a role playing game implemented with or without the use of a computer 3 gaming applications we only include game applications not stand alone simulations e g makropoulos et al 2008 willuweit and o sullivan 2013 or ict tools e g pahl wostl et al 2003 furthermore we excluded publications that only present frameworks to use a game elsawah et al 2015 or ideas to improve an existing game d artista and hellweger 2007 without developing the game application 4 urban peri urban water management problems we only include games that are focused on urban or peri urban water management issues referred to in this paper as uwm games games focused on more broad water management problems were excluded e g douven et al 2014 dray et al 2006 stefanska et al 2011 sušnik et al 2018 5 decision makers and types of decisions we include games that are targeted at uwm professionals or have been tested played with them these professionals could be government officials water managers private enterprises research institutes journalists urban planners environmental organizations policymakers and ngos games targeted at the education or engagement of the general public or students appel et al 2019 arbesser rastburg and fuchs hanusch 2019 aubert and lienert 2019 cheng et al 2019 hirsch 2010 predescu et al 2021 rebolledo mendez et al 2009 rusca et al 2012 are not included in the review furthermore we cover games that involve both individual and group decision making and decisions made at the strategic operational or tactical level the initial set of 41 papers was first assessed based on their title abstract and conclusion to check if they matched the selection criteria whenever this information was insufficient the articles were read more thoroughly a total of 15 games were selected this way for further analysis supplementary material a provides additional information about the excluded games including the reasons for exclusion an overview of the 15 shortlisted games is provided in table 1 along with the following additional information 1 topic the focus area of the game within uwm problems 2 game purpose the intended aim of the game as declared by the game developers 3 game purpose category categories as defined in section 2 3 decision making simulation knowledge sharing persuasion data collection exchange exploration motivation or training 3 2 analysis in this paper each game presented in table 1 was analyzed based on information available in the academic publication or by playing the game where possible for instance the first author played the segwade game online information on decision phases and game design phases was extracted for each game and mapped onto the decision making and game design phases presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 3 2 1 decision making phases to map the serious games to decision making phases the following three levels of mapping are defined well addressed the decision making phase is executed in the game partially addressed the decision making is partially executed in the game and its implementation can be improved not addressed no information the decision making phase is not executed in the game or no information is provided in the paper when mapping the games to decision making phases it was found that some games are not implemented as a stand alone game but embedded into a larger workshop process where players could be involved in the early phases of decision making in these cases we also considered the contribution of activities conducted in addition to the game session towards decision making and game design phases for example if a game only presented pre decided alternatives to players then it was considered to not contribute to phase 3 developing alternatives of decision making opposite of this if the players were involved in developing alternatives either while developing the game or in the game session then that game was considered to contribute to phase 3 3 2 2 game design phases to map the selected games to phase 3 detailed game design gaming elements were categorized for each game using the following success factors identified by ravyse et al 2017 1 backstory and production storyline or narrative of the game 2 realism resemblance of the game to real life 3 interaction interaction among the players and between the game interface and the player 4 feedback and debriefing in game cause and effect feedback and post game debriefing 5 ai and adaptivity dynamic adjustment of game response challenge based on the player s skills learning ability and learning needs similarly phase 5 implementation and evaluation of each game was assessed by extracting information on 1 evaluation methods and research approach used post test design pre test post test design rct or a similar approach 2 characteristics assessed during evaluation adapted from calderón and ruiz 2015 learning goals achievement of game objective with or without explicit indicators game design mechanics realism rules level of detail aesthetics game complexity clarity and ease of understanding player experience ease of use playability aspects satisfaction player engagement interaction with user interface players enjoyment and fun cognition and behavior impact on player s emotions mood attention level the results of the above analysis are presented in section 4 4 results 4 1 mapping serious games to decision making phases table 2 presents the mapping of serious games reviewed in this paper to decision making phases see supplementary material b for more details a common observation across all games is that all phases of decision making were not addressed in any game in order of the decision making phases phase 1 problem structuring was covered in 4 games phase 2 defining objectives and attributes was covered in 3 games and phase 3 developing alternatives was covered in 4 games in games that covered phase 1 5 7 10 15 players were involved in demarcating the decision problem tackled in the game in ter aguas 10 and waterstory 15 companion group modeling approach was used to identify the key water issues actors and their negotiation strategies and recreate the real world problem in the game in game 7 interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with relevant stakeholders to identify their main concern access to safe drinking water supply the serious game was then designed to provide more insight into this problem in the management game asset management 5 phase 1 was executed in the game itself as the players discussed problems within different departments in the organization and the differences in their perception about asset management in contrast games in which phase 1 was not covered adopted a decision problem either as pre determined by previous work e g 9 took a known real world problem 2 3 6 or tested a hypothesis 1 4 few games in which phase 1 was covered also implicitly covered phases 2 and 3 7 10 15 although specific methods to find fundamental objectives of the intended players or generate new alternatives were not deployed in these game it is implicit that the companion modeling workshops and stakeholder consultations were used to develop a broader understanding of stakeholders objectives and seek suggestions for relevant alternatives this was not the case for management game asset management 5 because the alternatives and objectives were pre decided and provided to the participants in the game in idt 2 phase 3 was well covered as the game allowed players to come up with their own creative drought management alternatives termed as innovations thus encouraging them to think beyond conventional alternatives such as water use restrictions increasing irrigation efficiencies or developing wetlands in comparison to the first three phases of decision making the later phases received much greater attention in the games reviewed phase 4 estimating consequences of alternatives was covered in 14 out of 15 games in most games computer models and tools were deployed to determine the consequences of alternatives these ranged from system dynamics or integrated assessment models in idt 2 la water game 3 perspective based simulation game 8 waterstory 15 to capture causal relations to a simple excel spreadsheet as used in wastewater rpg 13 in other games a simpler approach was adopted as they used fictitious case studies and performance numbers as in water safety plan 14 or provided relevant pieces of information to the players e g current and forecasted reservoir volumes as in call for water 1 based on which players could take decisions phase 5 evaluating trade offs and selecting alternatives was covered in all games this was expected since most games reviewed in this paper aim to support decision processes where the player decides the gameplay in this phase players evaluated trade offs spanning across economic social or environmental objectives for instance in the climate game 11 players could choose from a list of decisions such as improving housing conditions developing more green areas or water storage facilities and evaluate the tradeoffs in performance of these alternatives on values of quality of life costs added water storage capacity water safety and climate proof advantage lastly phase 6 implementing monitoring and reviewing the decision was covered in 11 out of 15 games in these games the decision was not implemented in the real world but in the gaming environment often simulated using an underlying model in some games player s in game decisions were even monitored and recorded for further analysis for instance in the call for water 1 and maintenance in motion 4 games players decisions were monitored to understand the relation between the quality of information provided in the game and the decision making strategies adopted by the player in addition to the individual frequencies of each decision making phase it is evident that phases 4 5 and 6 are most frequently covered in the analyzed games covered in 11 out of 15 games these games were typically played in multiple rounds and used an action reaction feedback loop in such a loop players first chose from a set of alternatives then their decision was either fed into a model or led to certain rule based consequences once confronted with the impact of their decision players learn from the game reaction and re formulate their strategy for the next round 4 2 assessing game design and game evaluation table 3 provides an overview of game design elements used in the selected games as mapped to five success criteria backstory and production realism interaction feedback ai and adaptivity that are associated with enhanced learning from games ravyse et al 2017 in 5 out of 15 games 6 8 10 12 14 reviewed in this paper backstory was incorporated in the game design by setting the scene through a short introduction or play for instance the perspective based simulation game 8 started by introducing the players to the present situation of management of river waas through a story in the game visimple 12 a virtual engineer gave a short introductory speech hinting at optimization hot spots to the player and guided the player throughout the game by providing context specific feedback in the other 10 games story elements such as a narrative virtual agents or a non player character were not explicitly incorporated instead the players were only introduced to the game objectives at the start of the game regarding realism all serious games incorporated elements to make the game resemble reality various approaches were used for this assigning roles to players based on real world actors using realistic scenarios high fidelity visuals such as geographical maps visualizing the terrain and geography of the real world area on the game board or through 3d technology and rounds to simulate different climatic conditions in all games players could interact with the game or with each other in some form the most common approach used to stimulate player to player interactions was through cooperative playing where players negotiated and discussed to agree on a common strategy e g 2 3 4 7 10 11 14 other than that digital games such as call for water 1 millbrook serious game 6 segwade 9 visimple 12 and waterstory 15 allowed players to interact with the game interface players explored the game environment by clicking moving or zooming in on objects in the game and selecting their actions feedback mechanisms were incorporated in all games in some form this was done either by visualizing performance indicators game scores or organizing debriefing to let players reflect on the game strategy and the results in several games e g 3 5 7 8 10 11 14 15 debriefing was also implemented at the end of each round or in the middle of the game to provide more frequent feedback and reflection to the players a common observation across all games reviewed in this paper is that ai and adaptivity elements were not incorporated in any game i e individual characteristics of a player such as skill level learning ability or learning needs were not taken into account this is also recognized as one of the limitations in call for water 1 game where the authors mention that the game difficulty should be adapted to match the player s level of knowledge crochemore et al 2021 concerning phase 5 implementation and evaluation table 4 summarizes the evaluation methods and experimental approach and the characteristics assessed in 7 out of 15 games 1 2 3 4 8 14 15 a post game evaluation approach was used by conducting a debriefing session discussion or asking players to fill a questionnaire in 4 games 6 7 10 11 a single group pre game and post game design was used by conducting interviews or discussions in 3 games 5 9 13 participants were observed by a facilitator or their in game decisions were logged to evaluate the game impact whereas no information on evaluation was provided by the game visimple 12 to know whether a game achieved its purpose it is not only important to evaluate the performance of the game on learning outcomes but also aspects such as game design game complexity player experience player engagement and cognition and behavior in the 15 games reviewed in this paper the frequency of characteristics evaluated were as follows learning goals evaluated in 13 games player experience 4 games game design 2 games game complexity 2 games player engagement 1 game cognition and behavior related aspects were not evaluated by any of the games this indicates that characteristics other than learning goals are often under evaluated moreover among games in which learning goal was evaluated explicit criteria was used in only 6 games 1 3 4 6 7 9 to measure the game impact for instance in segwade 9 learning outcomes were operationalized as closeness to the best solution as reported in the literature and in maintenance in motion 4 the change in confirmation or rejection of seven different hypotheses related to the millbrook flooding case was measured in other games a generic description of players learnings was provided as mentioned either by the players themselves or as observed by the game facilitators 5 future research directions in this paper we reviewed and analyzed 15 serious games for their contribution to 6 decision making phases and 2 game design phases based on the above review and associated analyses the following directions for improvement of uwm games and future research have been identified 1 support and include early phases of decision making from our review of 15 uwm games we did not find sufficient evidence that the initial phases of decision making were explicitly addressed by the game authors phase 1 problem structuring was covered by 4 games phase 2 defining objectives and attributes was covered by 3 games and phase 3 developing alternatives was covered by 4 games one plausible explanation for the lack of attention on these phases is that information about the early phases of game development process was not provided in the reviewed publications another reason could be that games were not explicitly designed to target initial phases of decision making this phenomenon is also observed in the software tools designed to support mcda processes mustajoki and marttunen 2017 indicating a broader lack of support for early decision making phases to better target the initial phases through a game we recommend using a companion modelling approach etienne 2014 as done in games ter aguas 10 and waterstory 15 using this approach a workshop can be conducted centered around a role playing game that helps model the complexity of the decision problem by taking the perspectives of different stakeholders into account aubert et al 2018 note that by suggesting that games include earlier phases of decision making we do not intend to recommend that games must be designed to cover all decision making phases such an attempt will be difficult to achieve as different decision making phases have different demands however even if a serious game is focused on improving the later phases of decision making we recommend that the game developers walk through the initial decision making phases with the target audience and relevant stakeholders to define an appropriate decision frame and capture the relevant complexities of the real world problem this can be done using popular problem structuring methods that can help identify key areas of concern stakeholders objectives alternatives and uncertainties ackermann 2012 mingers 2011 mingers and rosenhead 2004 rosenhead 1996 2 improve game narrative and adaptivity for an immersive player experience out of 15 games reviewed only 5 games incorporated story elements such as an introductory narrative or a virtual agent hence there is scope to improve things in this area as noted by barab et al 2007 we lose interest in a world without story in their review of 26 educational serious games naul liu 2019 list down 4 features of effective game narratives 1 narrative should not be located in one place but distributed throughout the game 2 strong relatable characters can help immerse the players further into the story 3 stories can be made more compelling if they are personalized to the player and respond to their in game decisions and 4 linking the fantasy to the learning objective can be useful these suggestions can provide pointers on how to make a game narrative richer and more immersive none of the games reviewed in this paper were adaptive in nature a common way to make serious games adaptive is to log and process player data and use virtual agents to intervene when e g a player repeats a mistake or is inactive for a long time ravyse et al 2017 some games reviewed e g 4 9 already log players actions for post game analysis so using the data to provide dynamic feedback during the game could be implemented adaptivity can further be improved by personalizing the game s narrative scenarios and quests or adjusting the style and strategy of the non player character using ai lopes and bidarra 2011 although ai holds the promise to enhance immersive learning such high end software development comes with a tradeoff of high computational and development costs a plausible reason that the reviewed games did not incorporate ai is that associated costs cannot be accommodated in typical research budgets available for serious games that are published in the academic literature as opposed to entertainment games developed by the game industry 3 evaluate uwm serious games using controlled experiments and use explicit decision quality indicators the most common approach used to evaluate changes attributed to the reviewed games was a single group post test design 7 out of 15 games this approach also referred to as as a one shot case study has limited scientific value as the observed outcomes of the game intervention cannot be compared to a baseline before the game nor compared to any reference group campbell and stanley 1963 single group pre test post test design was the second most common approach and used in 4 out of 15 games although this approach is better than a single group post test design in that it sets a baseline to which changes after the game can be compared this experimental design faces multiple threats to internal validity campbell and stanley 1963 marsden and torgerson 2012 none of the game evaluations reviewed in this paper applied a qualified experimental design let alone a randomized experiment or rct to the contrary in the healthcare sector use of rcts to establish causality is common practice where a gamified intervention is often compared to a non gamified intervention gentry et al 2019 primack et al 2012 we recommend the water sector to move in that direction to build rigor and better understand the causal effect and added value of serious games for uwm applications if the aim is to identify which specific element of a game led to the observed change then experimental designs that explicitly isolate and study the impact of the game elements should be preferred to comparison of gamified interventions with non gamified interventions landers et al 2018 regarding the characteristics evaluated in analyzed uwm games very few games focused on evaluating characteristics other than learning outcomes i e game design game complexity player experience player engagement and cognition and behavior whilst the focus on the attainment of the serious part of the game is understandable game developers should not lose sight of evaluating the fun aspects of gaming too existing questionnaires e g ijsselsteijn et al 2013 and högberg et al 2019 can be deployed to better assess a player s gaming experience uwm serious games should also further benefit by taking into closer consideration state of the art in the field of decision science despite aiming to improve decision making only 6 games used explicit indicators to evaluate whether the game improved decision making or not the decision maker s intuitive responses must be checked against evidence and the quality of their decisions should be checked against evaluation criteria to achieve this decision quality indicators provided by spetzler et al 2016 can be used as a starting point following these indicators a few guiding questions to consider while designing game evaluation could be did the players consider the broader context of the infrastructure related choices to be made e g climate change adaption opportunities alongside more immediate infrastructure replacement needs did the game help players go beyond traditional uwm alternatives and come up with new alternatives such as blue green measures did players refer to factsheets or future predictions while choosing a uwm alternative or was their decision intuitive in nature what reasoning did players use while choosing between different uwm alternatives was there a difference between the reasoning reported pre game and post game 4 incorporate cognitive processes in game design so far we assumed that the decision maker is rational and that they can achieve a good quality decision if supported by the correct procedure however this does not resemble reality well behavioral science shows that cognitive processes significantly influence if not determine information processing judgment and decision making biases and heuristics commonly lead the decision maker astray from what rational decision making theory would prescribe for example player s decisions are impacted by framing effects of how the set of alternatives are presented or mood states and emotions induced when playing the game lerner et al 2015 tversky and kahneman 1989 none of the games reviewed in this paper evaluated cognitive effects of the game games aim to create immersive environments that impact people s attention cognitive and affective processing in addition to actions or choices within a given framing hence understanding the impact of these aspects on the achievement of the purpose of a serious game with regard to improving decision making in uwm is a promising future direction experiments could be set up to test this impact with potential independent variables being different framings of an alternative emotions induced at the start of during a game and dependent variables such as decision quality or engagement indicators conclusion planning and management of urban water systems are critical to mitigate the challenges that the future brings population growth climate change and rapid urbanization to name but a few stakeholders in charge of uwm are confronted with complex planning and other decisions that need to be made serious games have emerged as a popular tool for decision making but their current contribution to decision making and game design processes both remain unassessed in this paper we reviewed 15 serious games that were a mapped to common decision making phases and b assessed in terms of game design and evaluation approaches the results obtained show that serious games designed for supporting uwm related decisions focus primarily on the later phases of decision making while the initial phases i e phase 1 problem structuring phase 2 defining objectives and attributes and phase 3 defining alternatives are not well covered although the focus on the later phases is understandable given that serious games are a medium for trial and error in a safe environment initial phases of decision making should not be ignored even if the game is designed to support the later phases covering the initial phases well makes sure that the right decision problem will be addressed through the serious game with respect to the game design each game s design elements phase 3 detailed game design and methods used to evaluate the game s impact phase 5 implementation and evaluation were assessed the results obtained for the game design elements show that uwm games reviewed in this paper lack elements of a backstory and production and b ai and adaptivity crafting a richer game narrative and making the game response personalized to the player can make these games more attractive and immersive to play thereby providing improved learning gains regarding the game evaluation it was found that single group post test research design is the most commonly used approach to evaluate the outcomes of uwm games although this approach may be adopted for pragmatic reasons the results of such an evaluation make it difficult to establish a causal inference between the game intervention and its outcomes thus it is recommended to use the rct instead following research designs proposed by landers et al 2018 other aspects that can be improved in the game evaluation include the use of explicit decision quality indicators to measure the game impact and paying equal focus to the evaluation of both learning outcomes and game experience design related characteristics the scope of the review conducted in this paper has its limitations since only uwm games targeted at professionals were reviewed in this paper the scope can be further extended to cover games targeted at students and general public see supplementary material for examples with respect to game design the findings obtained are limited by the criteria used to evaluate this aspect the successful game design factors listed by ravyse et al 2017 were derived by evaluating edutainment education games targeted at students at different levels of schooling primary to college level in this paper it was assumed that the findings from ravyse et al 2017 are transferrable to adults professionals at later stages of brain and personal development and who have higher education levels the applicability of these factors for serious gaming with adults professionals needs further investigation beyond the scope of this paper furthermore the results obtained apply only to the 15 uwm games reviewed however given that mapping of serious games to decision and games design processes is missing in the urban water sector we hope that that designers and practitioners can gain insights from this review leading to improved design and utility of serious games it is further speculated that the review findings obtained will be of use to decision making in sectors other than water it is worthwhile to conduct a domain independent review of serious games for decision making further improvement can be made to such a review by including games that are not published in academic journals although very limited information was available for these games online this can be supplemented by conducting interviews with relevant game developers finally to overcome the gaps identified in the review the following future research directions and recommendations are made to improve the design and utility of uwm games 1 support and include early phases of decision making through serious games using a gamified companion modelling approach 2 create a rich game narrative and adapt the game to the skill learning ability and learning needs of the player 3 ensure uwm games are systematically evaluated by using explicit evaluation indicators and controlled experiments and 4 incorporate cognitive processes in the game design and test the influence of behavioral factors such as emotions using a suitable

16137,chloride ions cl which are omnipresent in reclaimed water can cause various problems in water reuse systems especially during water transmission and at end use sites although reverse osmosis ro is considered as an effective technology to reduce chloride its high investment and complex maintenance requirements hinder its application in many water reclamation plants wrps recently several technologies bringing new options to better deal with chloride have gained increased attention this review provides detailed information on the harmful effects concentration levels and sources of chloride in reclaimed water and summarizes and discusses various chloride removal technologies including non selective methods e g membrane filtration adsorption and ion exchange oxidation and electrochemical methods and selective methods e g precipitation and specially designed electrochemical methods among these friedel s salt precipitation and capacitive deionization showed attractive development potential this review also proposes a holistic framework for chloride control from aspects of fit for purpose planning technical system development and whole process optimization which could facilitate the planning and operation of long term sustainable water reuse practices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloride control water reuse technical measures management strategy 1 introduction reclaimed water reuse offers the potential to increase available water resources and ensure water ecological security however risk control and ensuring water safety are essential to water reuse radcliffe and page 2020 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 in recent years the potential risks posed by organic contaminants and microorganisms have been of great concern delli compagni et al 2020 wang et al 2021 accordingly great efforts have been made to control organic and microbial risks in water reclamation plants wrps cui et al 2020 meng et al 2021 however the risks caused by inorganic salts have received less attention although inorganic salts have less direct impact on human health than organic contaminants and microorganisms they may form scale corrode pipelines and affect the end use of reclaimed water cui et al 2016 garrido arias et al 2021 chloride which accounts for the majority of inorganic components in reclaimed water has multiple harmful effects on water reuse chloride ion is one of the most common anions in nature guo and compton 2021 and is essential to physiological and industrial processes both domestic and industrial wastewater contain a considerable amount 200 mg l of chloride ions hu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 however chloride ion is generally not a mandatory control indicator for wastewater treatment therefore wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove chloride and it often ends up being discharged to water reclamation plants wrps unlike sulfate ions chloride ions are reactive table 1 as a result chloride containing water shows greater corrosivity toward pipelines or facilities lun et al 2021 yan et al 2021 chloride ions may also have harmful effects on end use of reclaimed water applied for agricultural irrigation and industrial purposes such as crop yield loss soil salinization equipment corrosion in addition it has been observed that chloride concentrations in freshwater have been increasing at rate of approximately 2 worldwide over the last few decades corsi et al 2015 kaushal 2016 notably indirect potable reuse may contribute to freshwater salinization bhide et al 2021 for these reasons it is essential to control chloride in water reuse system currently it is difficult for wrps to remove chloride from reclaimed water this is because chloride ion has good solubility a small ion radius low charge and limited bioavailability table 1 which prevents secondary treatment and conventional tertiary treatment technologies e g coagulation biofiltration and microfiltration from effectively removing chloride ions some wrps have applied reverse osmosis ro units for chloride removal but this is not always cost effective which obstructs the efficient use of reclaimed water generous et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in recent years several emerging chloride removal technologies that can provide alternatives for wrps have appeared moreover given the foreseeable development of the reclaimed water industry control of chloride ions will likely receive increased attention therefore the present study is intended to provide comprehensive information and analysis regarding chloride in the context of water reuse based on its harmful effects concentration levels and removal methods herein many existing technologies for chloride removal are compared and analyzed this study also provides practical insights into chloride control strategy for wrps to promote efficient and sustainable use of reclaimed water 2 harmful effects of chlorides on water reuse 2 1 harmful effects on wastewater treatment and reclamation processes conventional activated sludge processes biofilm processes biological aerated filters bafs and denitrification biofilters dnbf are common biological treatment units in wastewater treatment systems these units rely on the physiological functions of microorganisms to purify water notably high concentrations of chloride are likely to affect biological treatment units because of the physiological characteristics of chloride ions when the concentration of chloride is not suitable the treatment efficiency of the biological treatment unit will change significantly for example chen et al 2019 found that adding excessive chlorides nacl decreased the ammonium removal efficiency of a zeolite baf and inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria another study demonstrated that chloride decreased the cod bod5 and tn removal rate of a biofilm process dinh et al 2021 however chloride will only have a significant impact on biological treatment units when its concentration is high enough 2000 mg l lefebvre and moletta 2006 chloride can also affect advanced oxidation processes aop which comprise the main reclamation units in wrp because chloride ion has free radical chemical activity under light heat or radiation conditions it may change the reaction pathway of aop such alterations can have negative impacts on aop oyekunle et al 2021 in some cases aop are very sensitive to chloride concentrations in a peroxymonosulfate pms fe2o3 system the degradation rate of atrazine decreased from 96 to 26 when the chloride concentration increased by only 35 5 mg l zheng et al 2019 the mechanism was direct consumption of oxidants and replacement of sulfate radicals by chloride ions a similar phenomenon was also observed in a peroxydisulfate fe0 system in which chloride at 355 mg l reduced the rate of acid blue 9 removal from 94 to 76 ghanbari et al 2020 it should be noted that chloride ions do not always have negative effects on aop indeed in some cases chloride ions can have positive effects or concentration dependent dual effects on aop for instance in a pms based disinfection system increasing the chloride concentration from 0 5 g l to 4 86 g l was found to accelerate the inactivation rate of aspergillus niger penicillium polonicum and cladosporium cladosporioides by more that 7 fold wen et al 2019 another example is that the impacts of chloride on methylparaben removal in a pms based aop process were found to be chloride concentration dependent with chloride levels below 710 mg l having negative effects and those exceeding 1775 mg l having positive effects peng et al 2021 in addition chloride may lead to toxic byproducts formation during oxidation chlorinated organic matters have endocrine disrupting effects cytotoxicity and genotoxicity kali et al 2021 it has been reported that more than 2 mg l absorbable organic halogen aox may be produced during oxidation when chloride is present at level as low as 7 mg l yuan et al 2011 aox are refractory compounds in water xu et al 2021a because oxidation processes are usually downstream units in wrp aox produced during oxidation will remain in the effluent accordingly this issue requires further attention 2 2 harmful effects on water transmission and distribution system reclaimed water distribution systems consist of pipelines pump stations and their accessories chlorides ions can accelerate the corrosion of pipelines both metal and cement and fittings in distribution systems lytle et al 2005 stets et al 2018 lee et al 2018 examined four different pipe materials galvanized steel pipe gsp cast iron pipe cip stainless steel pipe stsp and polyvinyl chloride pipe pvcp and found that chloride and sulfate ions were the dominant factors responsible for acceleration of corrosion in reclaimed water the corrosion rate was highest in cip followed by gsp and stsp whereas pvcp showed no electrochemical corrosion chen et al 2021 evaluated the corrosion resistance of 304 and 316 stainless steel pipes in reclaimed water and found that chloride could significantly reduce corrosion resistance r2 0 9 another series of experiments showed chloride at 90 mg l could reduce the corrosion resistance of stainless steel lu et al 2008 this is because chloride ion has a relatively small radius 181 pm and a certain degree of complexation that enables it to strip the passivation film of materials and trigger pitting corrosion it is noteworthy that the actual corrosion process might be much more complicated due to the complex water matrix and microbial composition zhang et al 2018 the problems caused by pipeline corrosion include leakage and water quality deterioration wilson et al 2021 which are both expensive to address huang et al 2018 2 3 harmful effects on agricultural reuse applications chloride is one of the most abundant anions in organisms and participates in many physiological activities including charge balance osmotic pressure regulation cell turgor and membrane potential regulation when using reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation purposes excess chloride ions may adversely affect crop growth table 2 chlorides at 180 mg l in irrigation water may cause direct foliar injury and yield loss moreover when chlorides in reclaimed water accumulate in soil after long term irrigation soil salinization and soil quality degradation may occur when the chloride content in soil exceeds 200 mg kg the growth of plants will be affected martins noguerol et al 2021 the negative impacts include photosynthesis inhibition nutrient composition change and biomass loss additionally increases in soil salinity in reclaimed water irrigation areas has been extensively reported leonel and tonetti 2021 which requires further attention 2 4 harmful effects on industrial reuse applications for some water consuming industries and water scarce areas the use of reclaimed water is important to alleviation of the contradiction between water supply and demand however there are strict regulations on chloride ion concentrations in industrial water for some industries conventional industrial reuse applications mainly include cooling water and boiler feed water garrido arias et al 2021 corrosion of equipment and facilities is the biggest concern additionally excessive chloride may lead to additional process risks and hinder reclaimed water reuse in other value added industries for example the electrolysis industry requires a large amount of water aydin et al 2021 however excessive chloride may corrode electrolysis equipment and form chlorine gas cl2 at the anode seriously affecting the electrolysis process the electronics industry which is also highly dependent on water may face similar problems eng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 2 5 harmful effects on other water reuse applications in addition to agricultural and industrial applications reclaimed water is also widely applied for environmental reuse urban miscellaneous reuse groundwater recharge potable reuse etc when compared to pathogens and micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupting chemicals that are of high concern to human health and the environment chloride is not the main risk factor in these reuse applications deng et al 2019 however because chloride can accumulate via water reuse practices the long term effects of chloride require attention in summary chloride ion is highly important for sustainable water reuse since it has multiple adverse effects on reclaimed water distribution and end use applications fig 1 chloride is also one of the main ions responsible for high salinity and tds levels besides other counter ions e g na mg2 ca2 in reclaimed water also need to be addressed high concentrations of mg2 and ca2 may lead to high water hardness thereby inducing scaling and clogging problems because other ions such as mg2 ca2 and so4 2 can be more easily removed through precipitation and nanofiltration approaches than chloride chloride is of critical concern during water reclamation and reuse given current technological conditions as organic contaminants and microbial risks of reclaimed water are effectively controlled with unremitting efforts kong et al 2021 chlorides and other reactive inorganic ions may become the biggest uncertainties restricting further promotion and expansion of water reuse market 3 concentration and source of chlorides in reclaimed water 3 1 concentration levels of chlorides in reclaimed water reclaimed water rw can generally be divided into three classes class c class b and class a which refer to secondary effluent tertiary treatment coagulation filtration ozonation microfiltration ultrafiltration etc effluent and quaternary treatment high grade treatments such as aop nanofiltration ro and ion exchange effluent information on the chloride concentrations in reclaimed water of each of these classes was collected from published literature table s1 and summarized in fig 2 the chloride concentration in class c rw ranges from approximately 100 mg l to 1000 mg l while that in class b rw ranges from 80 mg l to 600 mg l and that in class a rw is 100 mg l as the class of reclaimed water increases the average chloride concentration and standard deviation are gradually reduced however the changes brought about by upgrading from class c to class b are significantly less than those that occur when upgrading from class b to class a this shows that tertiary treatment has limited effects on chloride removal and only high grade treatment can effectively remove chloride ions some water reuse standards or guidelines stipulate the concentration limits of chloride for example the chinese national standard gb t 19923 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for industrial uses and gb t 25499 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for green space irrigation limits the chloride ion level to no more than 250 mg l as shown in fig 2 class c and class b reclaimed water cannot fully meet these requirements for some wrps especially those in arid and coastal regions chloride may not meet reuse requirements while other indicators are sufficient for example an urban wrp in valencia region of spain was found to have good ultrafiltration effluent with a turbidity and cod of 0 43 ntu and 27 1 mg l respectively however the chloride concentration of this wrp reaches 499 mg l which has caused it to apply ro at great expense melgarejo et al 2016 3 2 sources of chlorides in reclaimed water 3 2 1 water reclamation plant wrp influent secondary treatment and conventional tertiary treatment cannot effectively remove chlorides and chlorides in reclaimed water mainly originate from wrp influent i e wastewater fig 3 summarizes the chloride concentration levels of domestic wastewater ww and several typical industrial ww based on data collected from published literature table s2 the chloride concentration of domestic ww ranges from 100 mg l to 450 mg l which is similar to but slightly lower than those of class c rw in contrast the chloride concentration of industrial ww is almost always 1000 mg l although industrial wastewater will be preliminarily treated locally to meet certain standards before it is introduced into the municipal ww pipe network monitoring and regulation of chloride ions is often neglected in this process if industrial ww is brought into municipal wrp the chloride concentration in reclaimed water is more likely to exceed 250 mg l 3 2 2 reagents addition during wastewater treatment and reclamation processes during wastewater treatment and reclamation it is often necessary to add various kinds of reagents including coagulants disinfectants and anti fouling reagents some which contain chlorine table 3 coagulation is a common treatment unit in reclaimed water production at present commonly used coagulants mainly include aluminum salts and iron salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride poly aluminum chloride pac poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc etc musikavong et al 2005 if fecl3 pac or pafc is added for coagulation the chloride concentration in reclaimed water might increase by 3 10 mg l in some occasional cases the dosage of coagulant may be as high as 100 mg l which means that an additional 50 mg l of chloride ion will be introduced into reclaimed water racar et al 2019 in addition disinfection is the key unit responsible for ensuring the microbial safety of reclaimed water and chlorine disinfection is widely utilized in wrp the typical dosage of chlorine containing disinfectants is 3 8 mg l cao et al 2021 following chlorination these chlorine containing disinfectants will form chlorides moreover it is sometimes necessary to adjust ph value during water reclamation if hydrochloric acid is used the chloride ion content will also be increased in addition ion exchange is a common unit in water and wastewater treatment to reduce hardness tang et al 2021 after ca2 and mg2 ions are captured by ion exchange resin the resin requires regeneration which is commonly accomplished using sodium chloride or potassium chloride solution this process may generate a brine solution which can be an indirect source of chloride 3 2 3 conversion during water reclamation processes chlorinated organic materials such as trichloromethane tetrachloroethylene and pentachlorophenol may occur in wastewater when these organics are mineralized during the water reclamation process they can form chloride ions el sheikh et al 2021 since the concentration of chlorinated organic materials in ww is not high 5 mg l and is subject to relatively strict control this is generally not a major source of chloride ions in reclaimed water xu et al 2021b in addition in the context of zero liquid discharge zld that was implemented in some industrial parks as the number of water recycling and recirculation cycles increases chloride ions continuously accumulate in reclaimed water systems sahu 2021 therefore high efficiency technologies for removal of chloride ions from reclaimed water are greatly needed 4 chloride control methods for reclaimed water 4 1 source reduction because of high concentrations of chloride in wastewater origins and poor removal efficiencies during secondary and tertiary treatment it is essential to employ source control strategies to mitigate chloride the following measures can reduce chloride ions in reclaimed water from the source 1 preventing of high chloride industrial wastewater from entering the municipal wastewater treatment system as shown in fig 3 the concentration of chloride in industrial wastewater is much higher than that in domestic wastewater for chloride sensitive wrps prohibiting high chloride industrial wastewater from entering is the foremost approach to controlling chloride 2 replacement of chlorine containing reagents with chlorine free reagents in the water reclamation process as discussed in section 3 2 2 reagents addition may introduce chlorides at concentrations of 5 50 mg l when the chloride concentration is higher than the desired level wrps should consider switching to chlorine free reagents polyferric sulfate pfs and aluminum sulfate can replace polyaluminum chloride pac additionally combined disinfection processes chlorine disinfection combined with other disinfection technologies can replace single chlorine disinfection processes while simultaneously realizing a reduction in chlorine dosage and ensuring residual chlorine concentration shi et al 2021 3 advocating reduction in the use of chlorine containing commodities or substances in daily life these substances include household disinfectants e g naclo toilet cleaners e g hcl and deicers e g chloride salt 4 2 chloride removal technologies 4 2 1 non selective chloride removal technology non selective treatment technologies can remove chloride ions from water while simultaneously eliminating other substances such as other salts or organics non selective chloride removal technologies mainly include conventional desalination technologies advanced oxidation processes and electrochemical technology related cases and reported removal efficiencies of chloride removal technology are summarized in table 4 and fig 4 conventional desalination technologies mainly include distillation electrodialysis ion exchange and membrane technology among these membrane technologies i e microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and ro have been widely applied in wrps importantly ro is the only choice capable of efficient chloride removal tseng et al 2021 although microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration cannot reject chlorides they can act as reliable pre treatment processes for ro units as shown in fig 4 the removal rate of chloride by ro generally exceeds 90 and the effluent chloride level is 100 mg l however the operational expenditure of ro is admittedly expensive czuba et al 2021 it has been reported that the operational cost of ro unit is about 2 3 cny m3 0 36 usd m3 which is three times that of ultrafiltration kehrein et al 2021 in fact the chloride concentration does not need to be reduced to an excessively low level e g less than 100 mg l therefore some wrps adopt a partial ro strategy to reduce costs for example the jingu wrp in tianjin china transports part of the ultrafiltration effluent to the ro unit and then to the disinfection unit while it transports the other part directly to the ozone treatment unit without passing the ro unit tian et al 2014 the ro unit is mainly adopted for further removal of total dissolved solids chloride sulfate and other key parameters the ro permeate is then blended with the treated effluent from the ultrafiltration ozone unit at a mixture ratio of 2 3 the blended water is of high quality and suitable for industrial cooling applications in the surrounding areas of tianjin chen et al 2017 however this approach still requires investment in ro construction which is quite costly for underdeveloped areas moreover many types and large amounts of chemicals are required during the operation of ro huang et al 2021 and there are often membrane fouling wu et al 2021 and concentrate treatment problems tomasini et al 2019 it should also be noted that some of the necessary chemicals non oxidizing biocides such as chloromethylisothiazolinone and benzalkonium chlorides required by ro systems show acute toxicity median effective concentration 1 1 2940 µg l to aquatic organisms huang et al 2020 these issues have caused ro to be questioned and challenged electrodialysis and forward osmosis fo which are listed in table 4 are additional membrane based desalination technologies that can remove chloride effectively 90 but are not widely used in wrps at present thermal operations such as multi effect distillation and mechanical vapor compression are additional methods of desalination feria díaz et al 2021 in the context of water reclamation the function of thermal operations can be completely fulfilled by ro but the expenditure of thermal operations is much higher than those of ro specifically the cost of distillation methods ranges from 3 3 cny m3 to 17 8 cny m3 0 52 2 8 usd m3 ali et al 2021 which makes thermal operations an expensive choice some emerging electrochemical methods have been developed to remove salts from water capacitive deionization cdi is a promising desalination technology which is capable to remove charged ions suss et al 2015 in cdi systems ions migrate directionally under the traction of the electric field between the electrodes and then stick to the electrodes electrosorption process consequently reducing the salt content of the water being treated when the electrodes can no longer bind extra ions the power supply is shorted or reversed and the ions on the electrodes are released resulting in a brine stream yang et al 2021 the operational cost of cdi is associated with the influent salt concentration specifically it is estimated that the operational cost of cdi is 0 63 cny m3 0 1 usd m3 when the salt concentration is 20 mm but this increases to 3 2 cny m3 0 5 usd m3 when the salt concentration is 100 mm cdi is supposed to replace or even outperform ro when the salt concentration is less than 1000 mg l sharan et al 2021 in some oxidation or advanced oxidation processes cl may be oxidized to cl2 after which chloride can be removed from water the redox potential of cl cl2 is 1 36 v and many oxidation processes can exceed this redox potential for example the redox potential of sulfate radical is 2 5 3 1 v and sulfate radical based aop is supposed to be an effective chloride oxidation technology xian et al 2020 a study of metal smelting wastewater showed that sulfate radical based aop can effectively remove chloride ions with a removal rate of up to 98 2 hu et al 2021 moreover ozone oxidation and fenton processes are also used to remove chloride liu et al 2016 the oxidation product cl2 can be absorbed by alkaline solution and recycled as disinfectant however because of the high concentration of organics in reclaimed water doc 5 mg l chlorides will not be preferentially removed during oxidation processes furthermore such oxidation processes generally cannot be conducted under normal temperature neutral ph or catalyst free conditions which limits their use and application giannakis et al 2021 adsorption or ion exchange can be alternative treatment methods in some cases which is listed in table 4 as shown in fig 4 the chloride removal rates of adsorption and ion exchange are about 90 it is important to note that the above technologies not only remove chloride ions but also other substances in the water which is unnecessary and may lead to higher energy consumption for this reason selective technology for chloride removal is desired to better satisfy the ever increasing demand for water reuse 4 2 2 selective chloride removal technology it is difficult to selectively or preferentially remove chloride ions from water due to their good solubility small radius and small charge amount as a result chloride can only be selectively removed in certain cases or by deliberate design some selective chloride removal technologies are discussed below it should be noted that these technologies are not absolutely selective but instead preferentially remove chloride ions despite its good solubility chloride ion can be precipitated under certain conditions although silver chloride is a well known insoluble substance it is not feasible to use silver ion in wrp in contrast friedel s salt fs precipitation is a promising choice for chloride removal fs is a layered double hydroxide ldh salt that has poor solubility the chemical formula of fs is ca2al oh 6cl 2h2o by adding lime cao and sodium meta aluminate naalo2 ca2al oh 6 is formed in water this cation has a high adhesion for cl resulting in chloride being precipitated several studies table 4 have demonstrated that fs precipitation can reduce chloride from 1000 mg l to 250 mg l although the removal rate is not as high as ro fs precipitation can fit the actual demand for chloride control in wrp several methods have been applied in attempts to enhance the performance of fs precipitation ye et al 2021 conducted systematic optimization of fs precipitation and found the optimal condition was temperature of 35 c cl cao alo2 ratio of 1 6 2 and reaction time of 90 min zhang et al 2021b employed ultrasound 20 khz 480 w to fs precipitation which improved the chloride removal rate by 9 1 via cavitation effects and hydraulic disturbance of ultrasound the cost of fs precipitation process is closely associated with the dosage of the precipitants under optimal conditions the cost of fs precipitation can be as low as 28 cny per kg cl removed 4 5 usd per kg cl removed ye et al 2021 however poor settleability of fs may make solid liquid separation a practical problem fortunately anionic polyacrylamides pam can significantly improve the settleability of fs by enlarging the particle size of fs sun et al 2021 another concern about fs precipitation is the side effects caused by chemical usage including waste sludge production and ph increase waste sludge i e fs sediment is difficult to treat and dispose of because the theoretical yield is 7 9 g fs g cl based on the chemical formula of fs the amount of waste fs sludge will be considerable attempts have been made to convert this waste sludge into poly aluminum chloride which can serve as a commercial coagulant guo et al 2022 nevertheless the ph will inevitably increase because alkaline lime is introduced during the fs precipitation process accordingly ph adjustment may be a necessity in wrp another inadequacy is that sulfate is simultaneously precipitated which is unnecessary and will consume ca2 and alo2 another precipitation method is cuprous chloride cucl precipitation cuprous ions are not stable in water and tend to result in disproportionation reaction notably cuprous chloride is a stable and insoluble substance therefore chloride can be precipitated in the form of cucl by dosing cu ⅱ and cu 0 into water gao et al 2021 the theoretical yield of precipitation is 2 8 g cucl g cl based on chemical formula of cucl which is much lower than that of fs however cucl precipitation requires high temperature 60 80 c by introducing uv 25 w 25 min the efficiency of cucl precipitation doubled and the reaction can take place at room temperature peng et al 2019 bismuthyl chloride biocl is a well known photocatalytic material that can be used for heterogeneous catalytic degradation of water contaminants long et al 2020 chloride ion precipitation technology can also be designed according to the insolubility of biocl when bismuth ion bi3 is present in water it will combine with chloride ion and form biocl via hydrolysis reaction for reasons of practicality stable bismuth containing salts such as bi2o3 and bio 2so4 are often chosen as bismuth reagents sun et al 2020 in order to enhance biocl precipitation the introduction of uv is evaluated experiments showed that uv 28 w 60 min can improve the chloride removal rate from 63 9 to 98 3 dou et al 2019 based on the characteristics of biocl it is also possible to create an electrochemical system to remove chloride ions nam et al 2021 emoloyed bismuth bi foam electrodes as the anode and a pt electrode as the cathode to form a galvanic cell this allowed a spontaneous electrochemical reaction during which cl was bonded to the bi anode in the form of biocl the used bi electrodes which carried a lot of biocl could be regenerated by electrolysis process in this process the used bi electrodes acted as the cathode and were converted into bi via reduction reaction 4 3 strengths and practicality of chloride removal technologies membrane technology distillation adsorption ion exchange oxidation precipitation and electrochemical methods are discussed above these technologies have their own merits and are suitable for different application scenarios table 5 summarizes the strengths and limitations of each technology in detail as discussed in section 4 2 ro is still the mainstream process for chloride removal from reclaimed water ro is the most mature technology with highly commercialized equipment and standardized operating procedures galizia et al 2021 van rooij et al 2022 in addition ro has a wide practical application range blue area in fig 4 making it useful for nearly all kinds of treated wastewater some wrps may hesitate to introduce ro units because of the high capital expenditure required therefore it is hoped that fs precipitation can become a substitute for ro because the operation procedure of fs precipitation is similar to that of coagulation sedimentation processes it is easily accepted by wrps sam et al 2021 additionally fs precipitation does not require special equipment with only cao and naalo2 being added during treatment further enhancing the attractiveness of this method although the chloride removal efficiency of fs precipitation method is not as good as that of ro yellow area in fig 4 fs precipitation can reduce chloride to 250 mg l however fs precipitation method may cause an increase in ph and tds the increase in ph may occur because both cao and naalo2 are alkaline while the increase in tds may occur because the precipitation method can only achieve ions replacement and the precipitant is usually excessive as in table 4 moreover fs precipitation replaces cl with oh and introduces a lot of ca2 and alo2 nevertheless oh ca2 and alo2 are much easier to cope with than cl sulfuric acid is theoretically able to fix these problem by neutralizing oh precipitating ca2 in the form of caso4 and converting alo2 into al3 which can act as a coagulant for reclaimed water therefore fs precipitation is believed to be an alternative for budget limited wrps that are subjected to excess chloride other technologies may be considered as backups for wrp electrochemical methods are not mature at present for reclaimed water desalination among these capacitive deionization cdi has the highest technical readiness and full scale practical projects have appeared maheshwari and agrawal 2020 for example the capacity of a cdi plant in belgium reached 1500 m3 d huyskens et al 2015 because cdi does not operate under high pressure the operational costs of cdi are lower than those of ro it has been reported that the energy consumption of cdi is 1 0 kwh m3 while that of ro is 1 5 kwh m3 suss et al 2015 however cdi requires a relatively high investment nevertheless it is likely that the costs required for cdi will be gradually reduced in the coming years hasseler et al 2020 which may further enhance the feasibility of its application for water reclamation however oxidation may not fit wrps where chloride is the only problem because the oxidation reactions cannot be triggered unless adequate energy is applied garrido cardenas et al 2019 if a wrp plans to use oxidation technology to remove organic micropollutants the design and operation of the oxidation unit should take the removal of chloride ions into consideration at the same time 5 future perspectives framework of chloride control in water reuse 5 1 fit for purpose planning the above sections have systematically described the harmful effects and concentration levels of chlorides as well as technologies for their removal in the context of water reuse however it is still necessary to determine how to deal with chloride rationally and effectively below some key points regarding chloride control in water reuse are discussed and a framework is proposed in fig 5 fit for purpose planning is the basic principle of reclaimed water reuse chhipi shrestha et al 2017 the core of fit for purpose planning is the balance between reclaimed water quality and reuse applications this means reuse demand should determine reclaimed water quality while reclaimed water quality should determine the range of reuse applications fit for purpose is not just a one way process but a two way interaction when controlling chloride chloride standards should be aligned with reuse demand some reclaimed water practitioners and customers especially industrial users have strict requirements on chloride concentrations while other users may have little concern regarding chloride for these reasons different chloride standards should be set for different types of reclaimed water users for example different industrial users require water of different qualities chloride in recirculating cooling water for boilers wash water and process water should be lower than 250 mg l while chloride in cooling for air conditioning system should be lower than 100 mg l however the electrolysis and electronics industries have higher requirements for chloride 2 mg l in water bakshi et al 2021 wrps and users should be encouraged to independently negotiate reclaimed water supply standards so that fit for case can be achieved under these conditions multi class reclaimed water supply becomes a necessity in fact some existing wrps are multi class projects in which reclaimed water produced within one wrp is treated to different water quality levels to meet the demands of an array of end users cherchi et al 2019 on the other hand wrps should improve reclaimed water quality proactively to expand the range of reuse scenarios and enlarge the potential market at present excessive chloride levels have hindered class c and class b reclaimed water reuse in many fields fig 2 when wrps are capable of controlling chloride in reclaimed water it will be natural to seek more users this will improve the economic benefits of wrps as well as effectively support sustainable development of the region reynaert et al 2021 5 2 technical system development a complete technical system provides strong support for chloride control in reclaimed water hansen et al 2021 although various kinds of chloride removal technologies are available they are not systematic accordingly a technology bank should be developed to support the demand of different reclaimed water users table 4 provides a summary of chloride removal technologies but this list is not fully comprehensive and is therefore insufficient to meet practical requirements additional efforts are required to establish chloride removal technology systems selective removal of chloride ions is still not practical although fs precipitation cucl precipitation and biocl technology have selectivity their use in wrp has not been fully developed applicability tests optimization and cost effectiveness evaluation of these technologies in wrp are urgently needed additionally more effort should be put into the development of revolutionary technologies by employing new mechanisms new materials and new equipment angelakis et al 2021 it is noteworthy that chloride in zero liquid discharge systems will continuously accumulate in water targeted technologies are required to reduce the concentration of chloride in recycling water onsite techno economic considerations are an important aspect of technical systems the cost of a chloride removal unit can be divided into capital expenditure capex and operational expenditure opex technical systems should provide such cost information of each alternative technology which can guide and facilitate wrps in choosing the optimal technology innocenzi et al 2021 judd 2017 in addition side effects control cannot be ignored the side effects brought by chloride removal technologies include tds increase precipitation ph alteration fs precipitation concentrate or brine production ro and cdi waste sludge production precipitation and oxidation byproducts formation oxidation control of these issues needs to be considered together in the technical system 5 3 whole process optimization when chloride is brought under control the treatment system of wrps may undergo various changes and adjustments therefore whole process optimization should be conducted to ensure that each unit exerts the best performance the first critical control point for chloride control in wrps is the influent the chloride concentration in wrp influent should be reduced as much as possible to reduce the load on the chloride removal unit for subsequent water reclamation units they needs to be coordinated integrally to the greatest extent possible to promote synergy and avoid antagonism for example fs precipitation unit should be placed directly followed by secondary treatment unit so that low amount of chloride will not affect the subsequent treatment units e g oxidation unit and fs sediments can be removed in subsequent units e g coagulation unit overall coordination of each unit should become an essential principle in wrp design operation and management in addition system reliability should be emphasized during whole process optimization reliability consists of robustness ability to prevent failure and resilience ability to recover from failure and reliability of a system can ensure stable operation zhang et al 2021a appropriate redundancy to cope with occasional accidents multi barrier strategy to properly allocate and undertake the loads and real time feedback control system to adapt to exogenous changes can help boost system reliability sari et al 2017 6 conclusions common but less noticed chloride ions in reclaimed water have harmful effects on water reclamation processes distribution systems agricultural reuse and industrial reuse the chloride concentration in some class b and class c reclaimed water exceeds 250 mg l which exceeds acceptable limits for irrigation and industrial reuse water and therefore requires treatment with suitable chloride removal units membrane ro fo electrodialysis cdi ion exchange adsorption and oxidation are non selective chloride removal technologies while precipitation fs cucl biocl and specially designed electrochemical methods can remove chloride selectively ro is still the mainstream technology for reclaimed water chloride removal but fs precipitation and cdi may become substitutes in some cases integrated frameworks for wrp are vital to support optimized chloride control in different water reuse scenarios declaration of

16137,chloride ions cl which are omnipresent in reclaimed water can cause various problems in water reuse systems especially during water transmission and at end use sites although reverse osmosis ro is considered as an effective technology to reduce chloride its high investment and complex maintenance requirements hinder its application in many water reclamation plants wrps recently several technologies bringing new options to better deal with chloride have gained increased attention this review provides detailed information on the harmful effects concentration levels and sources of chloride in reclaimed water and summarizes and discusses various chloride removal technologies including non selective methods e g membrane filtration adsorption and ion exchange oxidation and electrochemical methods and selective methods e g precipitation and specially designed electrochemical methods among these friedel s salt precipitation and capacitive deionization showed attractive development potential this review also proposes a holistic framework for chloride control from aspects of fit for purpose planning technical system development and whole process optimization which could facilitate the planning and operation of long term sustainable water reuse practices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloride control water reuse technical measures management strategy 1 introduction reclaimed water reuse offers the potential to increase available water resources and ensure water ecological security however risk control and ensuring water safety are essential to water reuse radcliffe and page 2020 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 in recent years the potential risks posed by organic contaminants and microorganisms have been of great concern delli compagni et al 2020 wang et al 2021 accordingly great efforts have been made to control organic and microbial risks in water reclamation plants wrps cui et al 2020 meng et al 2021 however the risks caused by inorganic salts have received less attention although inorganic salts have less direct impact on human health than organic contaminants and microorganisms they may form scale corrode pipelines and affect the end use of reclaimed water cui et al 2016 garrido arias et al 2021 chloride which accounts for the majority of inorganic components in reclaimed water has multiple harmful effects on water reuse chloride ion is one of the most common anions in nature guo and compton 2021 and is essential to physiological and industrial processes both domestic and industrial wastewater contain a considerable amount 200 mg l of chloride ions hu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 however chloride ion is generally not a mandatory control indicator for wastewater treatment therefore wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove chloride and it often ends up being discharged to water reclamation plants wrps unlike sulfate ions chloride ions are reactive table 1 as a result chloride containing water shows greater corrosivity toward pipelines or facilities lun et al 2021 yan et al 2021 chloride ions may also have harmful effects on end use of reclaimed water applied for agricultural irrigation and industrial purposes such as crop yield loss soil salinization equipment corrosion in addition it has been observed that chloride concentrations in freshwater have been increasing at rate of approximately 2 worldwide over the last few decades corsi et al 2015 kaushal 2016 notably indirect potable reuse may contribute to freshwater salinization bhide et al 2021 for these reasons it is essential to control chloride in water reuse system currently it is difficult for wrps to remove chloride from reclaimed water this is because chloride ion has good solubility a small ion radius low charge and limited bioavailability table 1 which prevents secondary treatment and conventional tertiary treatment technologies e g coagulation biofiltration and microfiltration from effectively removing chloride ions some wrps have applied reverse osmosis ro units for chloride removal but this is not always cost effective which obstructs the efficient use of reclaimed water generous et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in recent years several emerging chloride removal technologies that can provide alternatives for wrps have appeared moreover given the foreseeable development of the reclaimed water industry control of chloride ions will likely receive increased attention therefore the present study is intended to provide comprehensive information and analysis regarding chloride in the context of water reuse based on its harmful effects concentration levels and removal methods herein many existing technologies for chloride removal are compared and analyzed this study also provides practical insights into chloride control strategy for wrps to promote efficient and sustainable use of reclaimed water 2 harmful effects of chlorides on water reuse 2 1 harmful effects on wastewater treatment and reclamation processes conventional activated sludge processes biofilm processes biological aerated filters bafs and denitrification biofilters dnbf are common biological treatment units in wastewater treatment systems these units rely on the physiological functions of microorganisms to purify water notably high concentrations of chloride are likely to affect biological treatment units because of the physiological characteristics of chloride ions when the concentration of chloride is not suitable the treatment efficiency of the biological treatment unit will change significantly for example chen et al 2019 found that adding excessive chlorides nacl decreased the ammonium removal efficiency of a zeolite baf and inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria another study demonstrated that chloride decreased the cod bod5 and tn removal rate of a biofilm process dinh et al 2021 however chloride will only have a significant impact on biological treatment units when its concentration is high enough 2000 mg l lefebvre and moletta 2006 chloride can also affect advanced oxidation processes aop which comprise the main reclamation units in wrp because chloride ion has free radical chemical activity under light heat or radiation conditions it may change the reaction pathway of aop such alterations can have negative impacts on aop oyekunle et al 2021 in some cases aop are very sensitive to chloride concentrations in a peroxymonosulfate pms fe2o3 system the degradation rate of atrazine decreased from 96 to 26 when the chloride concentration increased by only 35 5 mg l zheng et al 2019 the mechanism was direct consumption of oxidants and replacement of sulfate radicals by chloride ions a similar phenomenon was also observed in a peroxydisulfate fe0 system in which chloride at 355 mg l reduced the rate of acid blue 9 removal from 94 to 76 ghanbari et al 2020 it should be noted that chloride ions do not always have negative effects on aop indeed in some cases chloride ions can have positive effects or concentration dependent dual effects on aop for instance in a pms based disinfection system increasing the chloride concentration from 0 5 g l to 4 86 g l was found to accelerate the inactivation rate of aspergillus niger penicillium polonicum and cladosporium cladosporioides by more that 7 fold wen et al 2019 another example is that the impacts of chloride on methylparaben removal in a pms based aop process were found to be chloride concentration dependent with chloride levels below 710 mg l having negative effects and those exceeding 1775 mg l having positive effects peng et al 2021 in addition chloride may lead to toxic byproducts formation during oxidation chlorinated organic matters have endocrine disrupting effects cytotoxicity and genotoxicity kali et al 2021 it has been reported that more than 2 mg l absorbable organic halogen aox may be produced during oxidation when chloride is present at level as low as 7 mg l yuan et al 2011 aox are refractory compounds in water xu et al 2021a because oxidation processes are usually downstream units in wrp aox produced during oxidation will remain in the effluent accordingly this issue requires further attention 2 2 harmful effects on water transmission and distribution system reclaimed water distribution systems consist of pipelines pump stations and their accessories chlorides ions can accelerate the corrosion of pipelines both metal and cement and fittings in distribution systems lytle et al 2005 stets et al 2018 lee et al 2018 examined four different pipe materials galvanized steel pipe gsp cast iron pipe cip stainless steel pipe stsp and polyvinyl chloride pipe pvcp and found that chloride and sulfate ions were the dominant factors responsible for acceleration of corrosion in reclaimed water the corrosion rate was highest in cip followed by gsp and stsp whereas pvcp showed no electrochemical corrosion chen et al 2021 evaluated the corrosion resistance of 304 and 316 stainless steel pipes in reclaimed water and found that chloride could significantly reduce corrosion resistance r2 0 9 another series of experiments showed chloride at 90 mg l could reduce the corrosion resistance of stainless steel lu et al 2008 this is because chloride ion has a relatively small radius 181 pm and a certain degree of complexation that enables it to strip the passivation film of materials and trigger pitting corrosion it is noteworthy that the actual corrosion process might be much more complicated due to the complex water matrix and microbial composition zhang et al 2018 the problems caused by pipeline corrosion include leakage and water quality deterioration wilson et al 2021 which are both expensive to address huang et al 2018 2 3 harmful effects on agricultural reuse applications chloride is one of the most abundant anions in organisms and participates in many physiological activities including charge balance osmotic pressure regulation cell turgor and membrane potential regulation when using reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation purposes excess chloride ions may adversely affect crop growth table 2 chlorides at 180 mg l in irrigation water may cause direct foliar injury and yield loss moreover when chlorides in reclaimed water accumulate in soil after long term irrigation soil salinization and soil quality degradation may occur when the chloride content in soil exceeds 200 mg kg the growth of plants will be affected martins noguerol et al 2021 the negative impacts include photosynthesis inhibition nutrient composition change and biomass loss additionally increases in soil salinity in reclaimed water irrigation areas has been extensively reported leonel and tonetti 2021 which requires further attention 2 4 harmful effects on industrial reuse applications for some water consuming industries and water scarce areas the use of reclaimed water is important to alleviation of the contradiction between water supply and demand however there are strict regulations on chloride ion concentrations in industrial water for some industries conventional industrial reuse applications mainly include cooling water and boiler feed water garrido arias et al 2021 corrosion of equipment and facilities is the biggest concern additionally excessive chloride may lead to additional process risks and hinder reclaimed water reuse in other value added industries for example the electrolysis industry requires a large amount of water aydin et al 2021 however excessive chloride may corrode electrolysis equipment and form chlorine gas cl2 at the anode seriously affecting the electrolysis process the electronics industry which is also highly dependent on water may face similar problems eng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 2 5 harmful effects on other water reuse applications in addition to agricultural and industrial applications reclaimed water is also widely applied for environmental reuse urban miscellaneous reuse groundwater recharge potable reuse etc when compared to pathogens and micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupting chemicals that are of high concern to human health and the environment chloride is not the main risk factor in these reuse applications deng et al 2019 however because chloride can accumulate via water reuse practices the long term effects of chloride require attention in summary chloride ion is highly important for sustainable water reuse since it has multiple adverse effects on reclaimed water distribution and end use applications fig 1 chloride is also one of the main ions responsible for high salinity and tds levels besides other counter ions e g na mg2 ca2 in reclaimed water also need to be addressed high concentrations of mg2 and ca2 may lead to high water hardness thereby inducing scaling and clogging problems because other ions such as mg2 ca2 and so4 2 can be more easily removed through precipitation and nanofiltration approaches than chloride chloride is of critical concern during water reclamation and reuse given current technological conditions as organic contaminants and microbial risks of reclaimed water are effectively controlled with unremitting efforts kong et al 2021 chlorides and other reactive inorganic ions may become the biggest uncertainties restricting further promotion and expansion of water reuse market 3 concentration and source of chlorides in reclaimed water 3 1 concentration levels of chlorides in reclaimed water reclaimed water rw can generally be divided into three classes class c class b and class a which refer to secondary effluent tertiary treatment coagulation filtration ozonation microfiltration ultrafiltration etc effluent and quaternary treatment high grade treatments such as aop nanofiltration ro and ion exchange effluent information on the chloride concentrations in reclaimed water of each of these classes was collected from published literature table s1 and summarized in fig 2 the chloride concentration in class c rw ranges from approximately 100 mg l to 1000 mg l while that in class b rw ranges from 80 mg l to 600 mg l and that in class a rw is 100 mg l as the class of reclaimed water increases the average chloride concentration and standard deviation are gradually reduced however the changes brought about by upgrading from class c to class b are significantly less than those that occur when upgrading from class b to class a this shows that tertiary treatment has limited effects on chloride removal and only high grade treatment can effectively remove chloride ions some water reuse standards or guidelines stipulate the concentration limits of chloride for example the chinese national standard gb t 19923 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for industrial uses and gb t 25499 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for green space irrigation limits the chloride ion level to no more than 250 mg l as shown in fig 2 class c and class b reclaimed water cannot fully meet these requirements for some wrps especially those in arid and coastal regions chloride may not meet reuse requirements while other indicators are sufficient for example an urban wrp in valencia region of spain was found to have good ultrafiltration effluent with a turbidity and cod of 0 43 ntu and 27 1 mg l respectively however the chloride concentration of this wrp reaches 499 mg l which has caused it to apply ro at great expense melgarejo et al 2016 3 2 sources of chlorides in reclaimed water 3 2 1 water reclamation plant wrp influent secondary treatment and conventional tertiary treatment cannot effectively remove chlorides and chlorides in reclaimed water mainly originate from wrp influent i e wastewater fig 3 summarizes the chloride concentration levels of domestic wastewater ww and several typical industrial ww based on data collected from published literature table s2 the chloride concentration of domestic ww ranges from 100 mg l to 450 mg l which is similar to but slightly lower than those of class c rw in contrast the chloride concentration of industrial ww is almost always 1000 mg l although industrial wastewater will be preliminarily treated locally to meet certain standards before it is introduced into the municipal ww pipe network monitoring and regulation of chloride ions is often neglected in this process if industrial ww is brought into municipal wrp the chloride concentration in reclaimed water is more likely to exceed 250 mg l 3 2 2 reagents addition during wastewater treatment and reclamation processes during wastewater treatment and reclamation it is often necessary to add various kinds of reagents including coagulants disinfectants and anti fouling reagents some which contain chlorine table 3 coagulation is a common treatment unit in reclaimed water production at present commonly used coagulants mainly include aluminum salts and iron salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride poly aluminum chloride pac poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc etc musikavong et al 2005 if fecl3 pac or pafc is added for coagulation the chloride concentration in reclaimed water might increase by 3 10 mg l in some occasional cases the dosage of coagulant may be as high as 100 mg l which means that an additional 50 mg l of chloride ion will be introduced into reclaimed water racar et al 2019 in addition disinfection is the key unit responsible for ensuring the microbial safety of reclaimed water and chlorine disinfection is widely utilized in wrp the typical dosage of chlorine containing disinfectants is 3 8 mg l cao et al 2021 following chlorination these chlorine containing disinfectants will form chlorides moreover it is sometimes necessary to adjust ph value during water reclamation if hydrochloric acid is used the chloride ion content will also be increased in addition ion exchange is a common unit in water and wastewater treatment to reduce hardness tang et al 2021 after ca2 and mg2 ions are captured by ion exchange resin the resin requires regeneration which is commonly accomplished using sodium chloride or potassium chloride solution this process may generate a brine solution which can be an indirect source of chloride 3 2 3 conversion during water reclamation processes chlorinated organic materials such as trichloromethane tetrachloroethylene and pentachlorophenol may occur in wastewater when these organics are mineralized during the water reclamation process they can form chloride ions el sheikh et al 2021 since the concentration of chlorinated organic materials in ww is not high 5 mg l and is subject to relatively strict control this is generally not a major source of chloride ions in reclaimed water xu et al 2021b in addition in the context of zero liquid discharge zld that was implemented in some industrial parks as the number of water recycling and recirculation cycles increases chloride ions continuously accumulate in reclaimed water systems sahu 2021 therefore high efficiency technologies for removal of chloride ions from reclaimed water are greatly needed 4 chloride control methods for reclaimed water 4 1 source reduction because of high concentrations of chloride in wastewater origins and poor removal efficiencies during secondary and tertiary treatment it is essential to employ source control strategies to mitigate chloride the following measures can reduce chloride ions in reclaimed water from the source 1 preventing of high chloride industrial wastewater from entering the municipal wastewater treatment system as shown in fig 3 the concentration of chloride in industrial wastewater is much higher than that in domestic wastewater for chloride sensitive wrps prohibiting high chloride industrial wastewater from entering is the foremost approach to controlling chloride 2 replacement of chlorine containing reagents with chlorine free reagents in the water reclamation process as discussed in section 3 2 2 reagents addition may introduce chlorides at concentrations of 5 50 mg l when the chloride concentration is higher than the desired level wrps should consider switching to chlorine free reagents polyferric sulfate pfs and aluminum sulfate can replace polyaluminum chloride pac additionally combined disinfection processes chlorine disinfection combined with other disinfection technologies can replace single chlorine disinfection processes while simultaneously realizing a reduction in chlorine dosage and ensuring residual chlorine concentration shi et al 2021 3 advocating reduction in the use of chlorine containing commodities or substances in daily life these substances include household disinfectants e g naclo toilet cleaners e g hcl and deicers e g chloride salt 4 2 chloride removal technologies 4 2 1 non selective chloride removal technology non selective treatment technologies can remove chloride ions from water while simultaneously eliminating other substances such as other salts or organics non selective chloride removal technologies mainly include conventional desalination technologies advanced oxidation processes and electrochemical technology related cases and reported removal efficiencies of chloride removal technology are summarized in table 4 and fig 4 conventional desalination technologies mainly include distillation electrodialysis ion exchange and membrane technology among these membrane technologies i e microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and ro have been widely applied in wrps importantly ro is the only choice capable of efficient chloride removal tseng et al 2021 although microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration cannot reject chlorides they can act as reliable pre treatment processes for ro units as shown in fig 4 the removal rate of chloride by ro generally exceeds 90 and the effluent chloride level is 100 mg l however the operational expenditure of ro is admittedly expensive czuba et al 2021 it has been reported that the operational cost of ro unit is about 2 3 cny m3 0 36 usd m3 which is three times that of ultrafiltration kehrein et al 2021 in fact the chloride concentration does not need to be reduced to an excessively low level e g less than 100 mg l therefore some wrps adopt a partial ro strategy to reduce costs for example the jingu wrp in tianjin china transports part of the ultrafiltration effluent to the ro unit and then to the disinfection unit while it transports the other part directly to the ozone treatment unit without passing the ro unit tian et al 2014 the ro unit is mainly adopted for further removal of total dissolved solids chloride sulfate and other key parameters the ro permeate is then blended with the treated effluent from the ultrafiltration ozone unit at a mixture ratio of 2 3 the blended water is of high quality and suitable for industrial cooling applications in the surrounding areas of tianjin chen et al 2017 however this approach still requires investment in ro construction which is quite costly for underdeveloped areas moreover many types and large amounts of chemicals are required during the operation of ro huang et al 2021 and there are often membrane fouling wu et al 2021 and concentrate treatment problems tomasini et al 2019 it should also be noted that some of the necessary chemicals non oxidizing biocides such as chloromethylisothiazolinone and benzalkonium chlorides required by ro systems show acute toxicity median effective concentration 1 1 2940 µg l to aquatic organisms huang et al 2020 these issues have caused ro to be questioned and challenged electrodialysis and forward osmosis fo which are listed in table 4 are additional membrane based desalination technologies that can remove chloride effectively 90 but are not widely used in wrps at present thermal operations such as multi effect distillation and mechanical vapor compression are additional methods of desalination feria díaz et al 2021 in the context of water reclamation the function of thermal operations can be completely fulfilled by ro but the expenditure of thermal operations is much higher than those of ro specifically the cost of distillation methods ranges from 3 3 cny m3 to 17 8 cny m3 0 52 2 8 usd m3 ali et al 2021 which makes thermal operations an expensive choice some emerging electrochemical methods have been developed to remove salts from water capacitive deionization cdi is a promising desalination technology which is capable to remove charged ions suss et al 2015 in cdi systems ions migrate directionally under the traction of the electric field between the electrodes and then stick to the electrodes electrosorption process consequently reducing the salt content of the water being treated when the electrodes can no longer bind extra ions the power supply is shorted or reversed and the ions on the electrodes are released resulting in a brine stream yang et al 2021 the operational cost of cdi is associated with the influent salt concentration specifically it is estimated that the operational cost of cdi is 0 63 cny m3 0 1 usd m3 when the salt concentration is 20 mm but this increases to 3 2 cny m3 0 5 usd m3 when the salt concentration is 100 mm cdi is supposed to replace or even outperform ro when the salt concentration is less than 1000 mg l sharan et al 2021 in some oxidation or advanced oxidation processes cl may be oxidized to cl2 after which chloride can be removed from water the redox potential of cl cl2 is 1 36 v and many oxidation processes can exceed this redox potential for example the redox potential of sulfate radical is 2 5 3 1 v and sulfate radical based aop is supposed to be an effective chloride oxidation technology xian et al 2020 a study of metal smelting wastewater showed that sulfate radical based aop can effectively remove chloride ions with a removal rate of up to 98 2 hu et al 2021 moreover ozone oxidation and fenton processes are also used to remove chloride liu et al 2016 the oxidation product cl2 can be absorbed by alkaline solution and recycled as disinfectant however because of the high concentration of organics in reclaimed water doc 5 mg l chlorides will not be preferentially removed during oxidation processes furthermore such oxidation processes generally cannot be conducted under normal temperature neutral ph or catalyst free conditions which limits their use and application giannakis et al 2021 adsorption or ion exchange can be alternative treatment methods in some cases which is listed in table 4 as shown in fig 4 the chloride removal rates of adsorption and ion exchange are about 90 it is important to note that the above technologies not only remove chloride ions but also other substances in the water which is unnecessary and may lead to higher energy consumption for this reason selective technology for chloride removal is desired to better satisfy the ever increasing demand for water reuse 4 2 2 selective chloride removal technology it is difficult to selectively or preferentially remove chloride ions from water due to their good solubility small radius and small charge amount as a result chloride can only be selectively removed in certain cases or by deliberate design some selective chloride removal technologies are discussed below it should be noted that these technologies are not absolutely selective but instead preferentially remove chloride ions despite its good solubility chloride ion can be precipitated under certain conditions although silver chloride is a well known insoluble substance it is not feasible to use silver ion in wrp in contrast friedel s salt fs precipitation is a promising choice for chloride removal fs is a layered double hydroxide ldh salt that has poor solubility the chemical formula of fs is ca2al oh 6cl 2h2o by adding lime cao and sodium meta aluminate naalo2 ca2al oh 6 is formed in water this cation has a high adhesion for cl resulting in chloride being precipitated several studies table 4 have demonstrated that fs precipitation can reduce chloride from 1000 mg l to 250 mg l although the removal rate is not as high as ro fs precipitation can fit the actual demand for chloride control in wrp several methods have been applied in attempts to enhance the performance of fs precipitation ye et al 2021 conducted systematic optimization of fs precipitation and found the optimal condition was temperature of 35 c cl cao alo2 ratio of 1 6 2 and reaction time of 90 min zhang et al 2021b employed ultrasound 20 khz 480 w to fs precipitation which improved the chloride removal rate by 9 1 via cavitation effects and hydraulic disturbance of ultrasound the cost of fs precipitation process is closely associated with the dosage of the precipitants under optimal conditions the cost of fs precipitation can be as low as 28 cny per kg cl removed 4 5 usd per kg cl removed ye et al 2021 however poor settleability of fs may make solid liquid separation a practical problem fortunately anionic polyacrylamides pam can significantly improve the settleability of fs by enlarging the particle size of fs sun et al 2021 another concern about fs precipitation is the side effects caused by chemical usage including waste sludge production and ph increase waste sludge i e fs sediment is difficult to treat and dispose of because the theoretical yield is 7 9 g fs g cl based on the chemical formula of fs the amount of waste fs sludge will be considerable attempts have been made to convert this waste sludge into poly aluminum chloride which can serve as a commercial coagulant guo et al 2022 nevertheless the ph will inevitably increase because alkaline lime is introduced during the fs precipitation process accordingly ph adjustment may be a necessity in wrp another inadequacy is that sulfate is simultaneously precipitated which is unnecessary and will consume ca2 and alo2 another precipitation method is cuprous chloride cucl precipitation cuprous ions are not stable in water and tend to result in disproportionation reaction notably cuprous chloride is a stable and insoluble substance therefore chloride can be precipitated in the form of cucl by dosing cu ⅱ and cu 0 into water gao et al 2021 the theoretical yield of precipitation is 2 8 g cucl g cl based on chemical formula of cucl which is much lower than that of fs however cucl precipitation requires high temperature 60 80 c by introducing uv 25 w 25 min the efficiency of cucl precipitation doubled and the reaction can take place at room temperature peng et al 2019 bismuthyl chloride biocl is a well known photocatalytic material that can be used for heterogeneous catalytic degradation of water contaminants long et al 2020 chloride ion precipitation technology can also be designed according to the insolubility of biocl when bismuth ion bi3 is present in water it will combine with chloride ion and form biocl via hydrolysis reaction for reasons of practicality stable bismuth containing salts such as bi2o3 and bio 2so4 are often chosen as bismuth reagents sun et al 2020 in order to enhance biocl precipitation the introduction of uv is evaluated experiments showed that uv 28 w 60 min can improve the chloride removal rate from 63 9 to 98 3 dou et al 2019 based on the characteristics of biocl it is also possible to create an electrochemical system to remove chloride ions nam et al 2021 emoloyed bismuth bi foam electrodes as the anode and a pt electrode as the cathode to form a galvanic cell this allowed a spontaneous electrochemical reaction during which cl was bonded to the bi anode in the form of biocl the used bi electrodes which carried a lot of biocl could be regenerated by electrolysis process in this process the used bi electrodes acted as the cathode and were converted into bi via reduction reaction 4 3 strengths and practicality of chloride removal technologies membrane technology distillation adsorption ion exchange oxidation precipitation and electrochemical methods are discussed above these technologies have their own merits and are suitable for different application scenarios table 5 summarizes the strengths and limitations of each technology in detail as discussed in section 4 2 ro is still the mainstream process for chloride removal from reclaimed water ro is the most mature technology with highly commercialized equipment and standardized operating procedures galizia et al 2021 van rooij et al 2022 in addition ro has a wide practical application range blue area in fig 4 making it useful for nearly all kinds of treated wastewater some wrps may hesitate to introduce ro units because of the high capital expenditure required therefore it is hoped that fs precipitation can become a substitute for ro because the operation procedure of fs precipitation is similar to that of coagulation sedimentation processes it is easily accepted by wrps sam et al 2021 additionally fs precipitation does not require special equipment with only cao and naalo2 being added during treatment further enhancing the attractiveness of this method although the chloride removal efficiency of fs precipitation method is not as good as that of ro yellow area in fig 4 fs precipitation can reduce chloride to 250 mg l however fs precipitation method may cause an increase in ph and tds the increase in ph may occur because both cao and naalo2 are alkaline while the increase in tds may occur because the precipitation method can only achieve ions replacement and the precipitant is usually excessive as in table 4 moreover fs precipitation replaces cl with oh and introduces a lot of ca2 and alo2 nevertheless oh ca2 and alo2 are much easier to cope with than cl sulfuric acid is theoretically able to fix these problem by neutralizing oh precipitating ca2 in the form of caso4 and converting alo2 into al3 which can act as a coagulant for reclaimed water therefore fs precipitation is believed to be an alternative for budget limited wrps that are subjected to excess chloride other technologies may be considered as backups for wrp electrochemical methods are not mature at present for reclaimed water desalination among these capacitive deionization cdi has the highest technical readiness and full scale practical projects have appeared maheshwari and agrawal 2020 for example the capacity of a cdi plant in belgium reached 1500 m3 d huyskens et al 2015 because cdi does not operate under high pressure the operational costs of cdi are lower than those of ro it has been reported that the energy consumption of cdi is 1 0 kwh m3 while that of ro is 1 5 kwh m3 suss et al 2015 however cdi requires a relatively high investment nevertheless it is likely that the costs required for cdi will be gradually reduced in the coming years hasseler et al 2020 which may further enhance the feasibility of its application for water reclamation however oxidation may not fit wrps where chloride is the only problem because the oxidation reactions cannot be triggered unless adequate energy is applied garrido cardenas et al 2019 if a wrp plans to use oxidation technology to remove organic micropollutants the design and operation of the oxidation unit should take the removal of chloride ions into consideration at the same time 5 future perspectives framework of chloride control in water reuse 5 1 fit for purpose planning the above sections have systematically described the harmful effects and concentration levels of chlorides as well as technologies for their removal in the context of water reuse however it is still necessary to determine how to deal with chloride rationally and effectively below some key points regarding chloride control in water reuse are discussed and a framework is proposed in fig 5 fit for purpose planning is the basic principle of reclaimed water reuse chhipi shrestha et al 2017 the core of fit for purpose planning is the balance between reclaimed water quality and reuse applications this means reuse demand should determine reclaimed water quality while reclaimed water quality should determine the range of reuse applications fit for purpose is not just a one way process but a two way interaction when controlling chloride chloride standards should be aligned with reuse demand some reclaimed water practitioners and customers especially industrial users have strict requirements on chloride concentrations while other users may have little concern regarding chloride for these reasons different chloride standards should be set for different types of reclaimed water users for example different industrial users require water of different qualities chloride in recirculating cooling water for boilers wash water and process water should be lower than 250 mg l while chloride in cooling for air conditioning system should be lower than 100 mg l however the electrolysis and electronics industries have higher requirements for chloride 2 mg l in water bakshi et al 2021 wrps and users should be encouraged to independently negotiate reclaimed water supply standards so that fit for case can be achieved under these conditions multi class reclaimed water supply becomes a necessity in fact some existing wrps are multi class projects in which reclaimed water produced within one wrp is treated to different water quality levels to meet the demands of an array of end users cherchi et al 2019 on the other hand wrps should improve reclaimed water quality proactively to expand the range of reuse scenarios and enlarge the potential market at present excessive chloride levels have hindered class c and class b reclaimed water reuse in many fields fig 2 when wrps are capable of controlling chloride in reclaimed water it will be natural to seek more users this will improve the economic benefits of wrps as well as effectively support sustainable development of the region reynaert et al 2021 5 2 technical system development a complete technical system provides strong support for chloride control in reclaimed water hansen et al 2021 although various kinds of chloride removal technologies are available they are not systematic accordingly a technology bank should be developed to support the demand of different reclaimed water users table 4 provides a summary of chloride removal technologies but this list is not fully comprehensive and is therefore insufficient to meet practical requirements additional efforts are required to establish chloride removal technology systems selective removal of chloride ions is still not practical although fs precipitation cucl precipitation and biocl technology have selectivity their use in wrp has not been fully developed applicability tests optimization and cost effectiveness evaluation of these technologies in wrp are urgently needed additionally more effort should be put into the development of revolutionary technologies by employing new mechanisms new materials and new equipment angelakis et al 2021 it is noteworthy that chloride in zero liquid discharge systems will continuously accumulate in water targeted technologies are required to reduce the concentration of chloride in recycling water onsite techno economic considerations are an important aspect of technical systems the cost of a chloride removal unit can be divided into capital expenditure capex and operational expenditure opex technical systems should provide such cost information of each alternative technology which can guide and facilitate wrps in choosing the optimal technology innocenzi et al 2021 judd 2017 in addition side effects control cannot be ignored the side effects brought by chloride removal technologies include tds increase precipitation ph alteration fs precipitation concentrate or brine production ro and cdi waste sludge production precipitation and oxidation byproducts formation oxidation control of these issues needs to be considered together in the technical system 5 3 whole process optimization when chloride is brought under control the treatment system of wrps may undergo various changes and adjustments therefore whole process optimization should be conducted to ensure that each unit exerts the best performance the first critical control point for chloride control in wrps is the influent the chloride concentration in wrp influent should be reduced as much as possible to reduce the load on the chloride removal unit for subsequent water reclamation units they needs to be coordinated integrally to the greatest extent possible to promote synergy and avoid antagonism for example fs precipitation unit should be placed directly followed by secondary treatment unit so that low amount of chloride will not affect the subsequent treatment units e g oxidation unit and fs sediments can be removed in subsequent units e g coagulation unit overall coordination of each unit should become an essential principle in wrp design operation and management in addition system reliability should be emphasized during whole process optimization reliability consists of robustness ability to prevent failure and resilience ability to recover from failure and reliability of a system can ensure stable operation zhang et al 2021a appropriate redundancy to cope with occasional accidents multi barrier strategy to properly allocate and undertake the loads and real time feedback control system to adapt to exogenous changes can help boost system reliability sari et al 2017 6 conclusions common but less noticed chloride ions in reclaimed water have harmful effects on water reclamation processes distribution systems agricultural reuse and industrial reuse the chloride concentration in some class b and class c reclaimed water exceeds 250 mg l which exceeds acceptable limits for irrigation and industrial reuse water and therefore requires treatment with suitable chloride removal units membrane ro fo electrodialysis cdi ion exchange adsorption and oxidation are non selective chloride removal technologies while precipitation fs cucl biocl and specially designed electrochemical methods can remove chloride selectively ro is still the mainstream technology for reclaimed water chloride removal but fs precipitation and cdi may become substitutes in some cases integrated frameworks for wrp are vital to support optimized chloride control in different water reuse scenarios declaration of

16138,phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems therefore the estimation of total phosphorus tp concentration in eutrophic water using remote sensing technology is of great significance for lake environmental management however there is no tp remote sensing model for lake groups and thus far specific models have been used for specific lakes to address this issue this study proposes a framework for tp estimation first three algorithm development frameworks were compared and applied to the development of an algorithm for lake taihu which has complex water environment characteristics and is a representative of eutrophic lakes an extremely gradient boosting bst machine learning framework was proposed for developing the taihu tp algorithm the machine learning algorithm could mine the relationship between fai and tp in lake taihu where the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton the algorithm exhibited robust performance with an r2 value of 0 6 rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 then a general tp algorithm r2 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 was developed using the proposed framework and tested in seven other lakes using synchronous image data the algorithm accuracy was found to be affected by aquatic vegetation and enclosure aquaculture third compared with field investigations in other studies on lake taihu the taihu tp algorithm showed good performance for long term tp estimation therefore the machine learning framework developed in this study has application potential in large scale spatio temporal tp estimation in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords remote sensing total phosphorus lake taihu machine learning 1 introduction in recent decades with the rapid development of the global economy human activities have led to the discharge of large amounts of pollutants into lakes consequently lake eutrophication has become a major challenge facing the world and it has been attracting increasingly more attention le et al 2010 ma et al 2010 as of 2012 more than 60 of the world s large lakes can be considered highly eutrophic wang et al 2018 phosphorus p as a limiting nutrient for eutrophication in freshwater systems howarth and marino 2006 schindler 2006 has a prominent limiting effect on lake eutrophication in china p discharge has caused serious eutrophication problems in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river ji et al 2020 accordingly local governments have been striving to control lake eutrophication in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river therefore it is of great significance to clarify the spatiotemporal variability of total phosphorus tp concentration in lakes in this area the increasingly maturing remote sensing technology is the preferred method for rapid and accurate determination of lake water quality although remote sensing can facilitate the estimation of tp concentration the methodology involved is complicated because p does not have spectral characteristics in lakes p occurs mainly in the particulate form primarily derived from soil erosion and p concentration affects the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton gao et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 hence p is closely related to optical active constitutes oacs in water including colored dissolved organic matter cdom phytoplankton and non algae particulate matter phytoplankton can be quantitatively characterized by chlorophyll a chla concentration and non algae particulate matter mainly comprise suspended particulate inorganic matter spim li et al 2017b song et al 2012 wu et al 2010 xue and ma 2019 most studies use statistical methods to identify spectral bands that can be used to estimate tp concentration all bands from visible to near infrared can be used for estimating tp concentration table 1 because the optical properties and p forms in different lakes are variable therefore previous studies reported varying results the optical properties of most inland water bodies are dominated by spim and thus the estimation band for spim or suspended particulate matter spm can be considered for developing an appropriate tp algorithm liu and jiang 2013 xiong et al 2019 however in some lakes with severe eutrophication in the case of frequent algal blooms the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton tp is affected by the absorption and degradation of phytoplankton and its correlation with chla increases with increasing severity of eutrophication domagalski et al 2007 shi et al 2017 the optical properties of such lakes are very unstable therefore it is necessary to identify and eliminate algal bloom areas or classify algorithms according to the optical properties and lake areas and select multiple bands simultaneously to develop a tp estimation model gao et al 2015 sun et al 2012 sun et al 2014b frameworks for developing lake tp remote sensing algorithms are divided into two major categories 1 conventional algorithm development methods including direct and indirect derivation methods the direct derivation method uses the statistical relationship between reflectance and measured tp concentration to derive the tp remote sensing algorithm through regression methods such as multiple stepwise regression isenstein and park 2014 lim and choi 2015 xiong et al 2019 the indirect derivation method involves the initial derivation of tp concentration from oacs concentration and then selecting the oacs algorithm or band to develop the tp estimation algorithm following the literature liu and jiang 2013 wu et al 2010 the direct derivation method is more widely used because it is simple and often provides good results whereas the indirect derivation method is complex and susceptible to accuracy loss because of the two step method xiong et al 2019 2 machine learning methods the relationships between tp and oacs in eutrophic lakes are complicated and may not be expressed by linear or non linear functions as numerous types of lakes are distributed across the globe differences in the optical properties and water quality between lakes increase the difficulty of remote sensing research therefore machine learning method has been introduced into tp estimation chang et al 2013 sun et al 2014a wang et al 2003 in recent years with the increasing maturity of research on using remote sensing for determining lake water quality the application of machine learning to water quality estimation has been increasing on a large regional scale therefore machine learning algorithms are increasingly applied chen et al 2014 concha and schott 2016 sun et al 2011 especially for the estimation of non optically active substances such as p and dissolved carbon dioxide chen et al 2019 lake taihu is one of the largest freshwater lakes in china and it has a complex water environment therefore it can serve as a typical representative of eutrophic lakes firstly the optical properties of lake taihu are variable because of the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in the non algal bloom area optical properties is mainly affected by spm in algal bloom areas it affected by phytoplankton the coverage of algal blooms in lake taihu has exceeded 25 and the frequency of algal blooms has reached 30 hu et al 2010 moreover global warming significantly enhances the frequency and area of cyanobacteria bloom zhu et al 2020 in conventional remote sensing estimation of water quality algal bloom pixels are eliminated xue et al 2019 thus decreasing the number of available samples and images and lowering algorithm robustness therefore conventional remote sensing algorithms may not be applicable algal bloom pixels should be included in the estimation of tp in lake taihu and such algorithms have rarely been reported secondly the occurrence of phosphorus in lake taihu is not uniform the net reception of tp in lake taihu exceeds its discharge wang et al 2019b and the areas surrounding the lake have dense population and well developed industries p in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater mainly exists in the dissolved form carlson et al 2013 rattan et al 2021 the discharge of the domestic sewage and industrial wastewater causes tp enrichment in the upstream lake area and the spatial distribution of tp concentration is heterogeneous considering these issues lake taihu was selected as a typical eutrophic lake for developing a tp algorithm that can be extended to other similar lakes considering the close relationships between tp and oacs many studies have proved that tp concentration in lakes can be estimated by remote sensing xiong et al 2019 liu and jiang 2013 wu et al 2010 however the variability of oacs and forms of tp across various water bodies leads inconsistencies in the tp estimation bands algorithm types and development methods resulting in the lack of tp algorithms for extremely eutrophic large lakes or lake groups in large areas therefore developing an algorithm to solve this issue should be given priority this study selected lake taihu as a typical representative of eutrophic lakes and developed a framework for tp estimation the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated at various spatial and temporal scales in an attempt to obtain a tp algorithm that can be used for lake groups on the large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu 30 9 31 6 n 119 9 120 6 e is located in the core of the yangtze river delta it is an important water source in the surrounding areas fig 1 lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2338 1 km2 an average depth of 1 9 m and a maximum depth of 3 34 m due to the structure of the bottom the lake area basically does not change with the seasons lake taihu is divided into zhushan bay zs meiliang bay ml gonghu bay gh lake center lc west lake wl south lake sl and east lake el and the water quality of el is the best in lake taihu with dense aquatic vegetation and satellite sensors can not obtain effective water body information therefore the east lake would be masked in remote sensing estimation of water quality in lake taihu shen et al 2017 2 2 field data and laboratory analysis field measured data were acquired from two sources 1 monthly water quality survey data of lake taihu during 2005 2015 provided by taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research chinese ecosystem research network dataset 1 covering a total of 346 available samples 46 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis synchronization data including tp po4 3 chla and spm 2 data collected by the research team through field surveys of large lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and huai river yh during 2017 2020 dataset 2 including lake taihu lake chaohu lake hongze lake luoma lake gehu lake nanyi and lake shijiu the dataset covered 224 available samples 19 modis synchronization data including tp chla spm and optical absorption coefficient the statistics of samples from each lake are shown in table 2 water samples were collected using a 2 l polyethylene water sampling instrument the surrounding environment and meteorological characteristics at the sampling points were recorded using indicators such as sampling time weather conditions wind speed and direction and algal bloom the collected water samples were stored in a refrigerator in the dark and transported to the laboratory for further analysis chla was determined using the acetone extraction method and spm was determined using the weighing method samples for tp were acidified with h2so4 to ph 1 and then preserved at 2 5 c tp concentrations were determined through a spectrophotometric analysis after the decomposition of potassium persulfate xiong et al 2019 the oacs determine the optical properties of water accordingly absorption coefficients of cdom ag phytoplankton pigments aph detritus ad and water aw are used to analyze optical properties the test results of aw by pope and fry 1997 are generally accepted aph and ad were determined using the quantitative filter technique mitchell 1990 and ag was measured using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer bricaud et al 1981 xue et al 2020 2 3 satellite data and preprocessing existing mature atmospheric calibration algorithms do not provide accurate estimates of reflectivity over inland lakes many studies have proved that water properties can be estimated using the rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc dimensionless which is derived after correction for rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption effects following hu et al 2004 such as algal bloom identification hu et al 2010 spm cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 and particulate organic carbon duan et al 2014 modis aqua level 1a images were downloaded from the nasa ocean color website http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the modis aqua level 1a data were processed using the seadas software through the meteorological parameter file and the rayleigh scattering lookup table in order to obtain the rrc data product 2 4 algorithm development 2 4 1 modeling set construction due to saturation or failure of the modis band currently only 7 bands are available for inland turbid waters b1 645nm b2 859nm b3 469nm b4 555nm b5 1240nm b6 1640nm and b7 2130nm perform mathematical transformations of reciprocal logarithm exponent square root and square for each band and use four arithmetic operations and normalization methods to combine each band as an index for algorithm development since temperature affects the adsorption of solid particles to p the modis land surface temperature lst product myd11a1 https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov is also used as an index which has proved to have a significant correlation r2 0 96 with the actual water temperature liu et al 2015 hu 2009 developed floating algae index fai based on modis to detect algae blooms and it has been well applied in lake taihu hu et al 2010 algal blooms are not only closely related to optically active substances such as spm and chla but also closely related to nutrients therefore fai was selected as an index and the calculation method is 1 f a i r n i r r r e d r s w i r r r e d λ n i r λ r e d λ s w i r λ r e d where r n i r r s w i r and r r e d represent the near infrared short wave infrared and red light bands respectively and λ is the center wavelength of each band of modis in summary the input indexes include the mathematical transformation and combination of each band lst and fai there are 1199 indexes in total and the indexes information can be viewed in table s1 the indexes in the following text are labeled according to the id in the table not all of these indexes will be input into the algorithm as variables each algorithm will filter indexes as variables according to its own characteristics the algorithm development method is as follows 2 4 2 conventional algorithm there are two kinds of conventional algorithm framework direct derivation and indirect derivation the steps of direct derivation framework are determine the key oacs of lake taihu according to the measured results of water quality and develop tp algorithm according the characteristic band of key oacs 3 4 samples are used for training and 1 4 samples are used for verification fig 2 a the steps of the indirect derivation method are the tp concentration is fitted by empirical relationship between the measured oacs and tp concentration and then the tp algorithm is developed based on the oacs algorithm 3 4 of the samples are used for training and 1 4 of the samples are used for verification fig 2b 2 4 3 machine learning algorithm classification and regression trees cart is one of the important methods of data mining and the most widely used and efficient machine learning algorithm two common algorithms derived from cart are selected 1 extremely gradient boosting bst 2 random forest rf the machine learning algorithm used in this study is simple and easy to operate and the key part is the determination of input variables ① the increase in mean square error incmse of a total of 1199 indexes table s1 were calculated and sorted in descending order the mse calculation method is 2 mse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where n is the number of samples y is the true value and x is the simulated value ② the highest index of incmse is input into the bst model as an input variable ③ select the index with the highest incmse among the remaining indexes as the newly added variable and use the variance inflation factor vif to judge the collinearity between the newly added variable and the input variable if there is collinearity remove the variable and if there is no collinearity enter the model ④repeat step ③ until the verification accuracy of the algorithm does not increase in order to ensure the stability of the algorithm the 5 fold cross validation was used to ensure that the training dataset was randomly distributed in different segments the parameter adjustment of the two algorithms is based on the unified principle first ensure the accuracy of the algorithm and then try to make the structure of the algorithm as simple as possible for example reduce the depth of the tree and the number of leaves fig 2c 2 4 4 algorithm accuracy evaluation the accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated by the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mrd 3 r m s e 1 n 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 4 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i x i y i 100 where n is the number of data x is the estimated value and y is the measured value 3 results 3 1 water quality characterization the water quality of lake taihu is shown in fig 3 lake taihu is a typical eutrophic water body with an average spm concentration of 41 87 mg l and an average chla of 16 55 μg l different parts of the lake showed prominent differences in water quality the concentrations of tp and po4 in zs and wl were relatively high and their concentrations in gh lc and sl were relatively low the chla concentrations in zs ml and wl were higher than those in the other three lake areas the spm concentrations in zs ml and gh were lower than those in lc wl and sl which can be attributed to the less wind and wave disturbance in the lake bay in conclusion the water environment characteristics of lake taihu are complex and the water quality of each lake area exhibit clear differences therefore lake taihu is representative of inland eutrophic lakes 3 2 taihu tp algorithm directly and indirectly derived algorithms exhibited low accuracy with r2 less than 0 4 and mre more than 50 for the verification set fig 4 a b considering that the machine learning algorithm has a high training accuracy only the verification accuracy is shown fig 4c d bst showed the highest accuracy with r2 reaching 0 60 the scatters were uniformly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 the r2 of the rf algorithm was 0 52 and it showed significant underestimation when tp 0 3 mg l the input variables of machine learning algorithm are shown in table 3 the variables are sorted in descending order according to incmse since the number of indexes reaches 1199 all input variables are marked with id for details of variables please refer to supplementary material s1 most of the input variables of the two algorithms were the same but the values of incmse are different and the mean incmse value of thevariables of bst algorithm was higher than that of rf algorithm which verifies the higher accuracy of the bst algorithm over the rf algorithm overall the bst algorithm developed using the machine learning framework was the most suitable algorithm for tp estimation 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of tp in lake taihu the spatiotemporal distribution of tp concentration in lake taihu from 2003 to 2019 is shown fig 5 tp gradually decreased from east to west controlled by the qinghai tibet plateau most water systems in china flow from west to east the water systems in the upper reaches of lake taihu are located in the west and north terrigenous input leads to high tp concentration in the west and north of lake taihu and areas with low tp are mainly concentrated in lc tp concentration in most areas ranged from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l the tp concentration in lake taihu exhibited a trend of initial decline followed by an increase the lowest value of 0 13 mg l was observed in 2012 and the highest value of 0 17 mg l was observed in 2017 4 discussion as the machine learning algorithm is a black box process the bst algorithm integrates a large number of classifiers moreover the original intention of the machine learning algorithm is to process big data sample classification will reduce the number of samples and greatly reduce the stability of the algorithm therefore the performance of the algorithm cannot be evaluated internally but from the results before and after estimation in this study the feasibility of bst to the tp estimation was first explored by considering the optical properties and tp forms of the lake subsequently the applicability of the algorithm to other eutrophic lakes was evaluated finally according to relevant research on lake taihu the rationality of applying the algorithm to long time series data was evaluated 4 1 feasibility of machine learning algorithms in tp estimation dataset 1 was obtained from taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research and does not include absorption coefficients in order to analyze the optical properties of lake taihu the absorption coefficients were measured in dataset 2 so only 68 sample points were considered fig 6 a the influence of aph appeared to be stronger and its highest proportion reached more than 80 in contrast the proportions of ag and ad were generally 60 or less in addition chla showed a closer relationship with tp fig 6b in eutrophic lakes with infrequent algal blooms such as lake hongze xiong et al 2019 and lake poyang liu and jiang 2013 suspended solids were the dominant factor controlling tp however in lake taihu which experiences frequent algal blooms oacs are the key factor dominating tp owing to the drastic changes in chla concentration therefore the optical properties and tp forms in lake taihu were mainly influenced by phytoplankton the impact of all water quality parameters on the relationship between tp and oacs was analyzed only chla and po4 tp exhibited prominent effects and other indicators were placed in s2 with chla and po4 tp arranged in the ascending order the samples were divided into 16 groups each of which comprised 100 samples 20 samples as the interval subsequently the correlation coefficients between tp and oacs in each group were calculated the results showed that increases in chla concentration will strengthen the correlations between tp and oacs fig 6c and increases in po4 tp will reduce the correlation fig 6d po4 content was prominently higher in zs and wl in which algal blooms occur frequently than in other lake areas fig 3 with the increase of algal density in pixels the optical properties of water will change rapidly so traditional studies have eliminated algal bloom pixels as much as possible wang et al 2019a shi et al 2017 as shown in table 3 that the incmse of index no 1 and index no 1126 is obviously higher than the incmse of other variables these two variables represent fai and f2 f3 respectively fai is a key index for estimating tp in lake taihu but conventional algorithms cannot mine the potential relationship between fai and tp as a common method of data mining the bst algorithm can mine the relationship between fai and tp fai is the most commonly used index for detecting algal blooms hu et al 2010 as phytoplankton and tp have a close relationship fai has potential for estimating chla and tp when fai 0 06 fig 7 a b during the development of conventional algorithms when the fai exceeded 0 06 the algal bloom intensity exceeded the limit for characterizing water information therefore conventional algorithms cannot accurately mine the relationship between fai and chla in contrast the machine learning algorithm could mine the relationship between phytoplankton and tp the bst algorithm is an ensemble algorithm including multiple linear and non linear classifiers regarding the incmse index of fai bst provided the highest value and rf provided the second highest value table 3 also the relationship between f2 f3 and tp is not as close as that between fai and tp fig 7c which further explains the superior performance of bst over rf in terms of the incmse of lst bst ranked the third and temperature is an important factor affecting tp concentration in lakes wang et al 2019b with increases in temperature the solubility of p increases and the processes of biological disturbance and anaerobic transformation are accelerated resulting in the release of p from sediments jiang et al 2008 on the whole the bst algorithm could mine the impact of each index on tp in conclusion the optical properties and forms of tp in lake taihu are mainly affected by phytoplankton the conventional algorithm could not mine the relationship between remote sensing products and tp as a data mining algorithm bst could determine the relationships between tp fai and lst through which the lake taihu tp algorithm could be successfully developed 4 2 applicability of the lake taihu tp algorithm development framework to other lakes based on the synchronous sample data of all lakes in yh table 2 the yh tp algorithm was developed using the machine learning framework the accuracy of the algorithm reached 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 and the error was lower than that of the taihu tp algorithm however when tp 0 1 mg l the sample point error increased for lake chaohu indicating that the accuracy may widely vary among lakes the accuracy of the yh tp algorithm was found to depend on the sample discreteness of lake taihu therefore image testing was performed to analyze the generalizability of the algorithm fig 8 in the testing of the algorithm using synchronous image only the results of cloud free images were considered fig 9 the tp concentration in lake chaohu and lake gehu was significantly higher than that in other lakes which is consistent with previously reported results zhu et al 2019 the spatial variability of tp in lake chaohu was greater than that in other lakes in the images of august 23 2017 and july 14 2018 the tp concentration in areas covered by algal bloom was significantly higher than that in the surrounding areas it is worth noting that the distribution of sampling points will seriously affect the final results the tp concentrations in lake chaohu on april 28 2017 and august 23 2017 estimated using remote sensing data were lower than the average values measured for the samples this can be explained by the sampling points being mainly concentrated in the west of lake chaohu and the water quality of lake chaohu is significantly poorer in the west than that in other areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a therefore the average concentration of tp measured over the entire lake on july 14 2018 was 0 15 mg l which is consistent with the remote sensing estimation results fig 10 evident high value pixels were observed around lakes without algal blooms such as in lake shijiu lake nanyi and lake hongze because aquatic vegetation around the lake algal blooms and aquatic vegetation have similar spectral characteristics liang et al 2017 the algorithm overestimate the value of tp concentrations in addition the existence of paddy fields and net enclosure aquaculture around some lakes will also affect the tp estimation results such as in the west and north of lake hongze xiong et al 2019 moreover compared with lake chaohu and lake taihu seasonal changes in the water volume of lake hongze are more prominent due to which the marginal effect of the lake is also more pronounced cao et al 2017 the algorithm overestimates the tp concentration because of these high value pixels in lake shijiu lake nanyi lake gehu and lake hongze therefore when extending the yh tp algorithm to other lakes it is necessary to clarify the environment of each lake and control the pixel quality in order to completely utilize the algorithm in summary the bst algorithm can be used to develop a tp estimation algorithm for eutrophic waters when performing large scale and long term estimations it is necessary to strictly control the quality of pixels and investigate the environment of each lake especially the distinction between algae blooms and aquatic vegetation and net enclosure aquaculture 4 3 potential of the taihu tp algorithm to simulate long term tp changes in this study existing research results on tp in lake taihu were reviewed and relevant data from graphs or tables in literature were extracted table 4 most studies were found to focus on the three bays of lake taihu regarding zs the results of qin et al 2010 were significantly lower than those of other studies indicating the potential of large errors with field investigations because of the contingency of the sampling time and location the remote sensing estimation results and the survey results of xu et al 2019 showed that same tp concentration but the change trends were quite different which may be explained by the difference in sampling xu et al 2019 collected water samples from approximately one meter below the water surface whereas remote sensing techniques estimate the tp concentration on the surface of the lake due to the phototaxis of phytoplankton the concentration of phytoplankton in the surface water body will increase with tp concentration with increasing depth phytoplankton concentration will gradually decrease li et al 2017a qi et al 2018 accordingly the survey results of xu et al 2019 were also lower than the remote sensing estimation results in ml and gh in ml the remote sensing estimation results were basically consistent with the results of xu et al 2010 and paerl et al 2011 showing a trend of high in summer and autumn and low in winter and spring therefore the spatial unevenness and temporal contingency of sampling points are easy to lead to the deviation of researchers understanding of the real situation of the lake although the remote sensing algorithm has errors or uncertainties to a certain extent it can estimate the water quality index of each pixel in the entire plane moreover after excluding the images affected by cloud cover and flare a total of 1604 modis images were used for tp estimation of taihu lake from 2003 to 2019 with an average of 94 images per year therefore remote sensing estimationhas high potential for providing detailed information on the overall real situation of the lake in summary the results of the taihu tp algorithm can represent the long term tp changes in taihu lake and compared with field surveying it can reduce errors caused by the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of sampling points and reflect the actual water quality to a certain extent 5 conclusion in this study three frameworks of algorithm development were comparatively analysed in an extremely eutrophic large lake lake taihu and a machine learning framework was proposed for developing the taihu tp algorithm based on modis data and in situ data the machine learning algorithm especially bst could mine the relationship between fai and tp in lake taihu where the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton the taihu tp algorithm derived using bst exhibited robust performance with an r2 value of 0 6 rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 then the framework was tested in a large area the yh tp algorithm was developed using the proposed framework with an r2 value of 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 however the yh tp algorithm overestimated the tp concentration in areas of aquatic vegetation and enclosure aquaculture therefore it is necessary to identify and delete these pixels to improve the accuracy moreover for the first time the long term tp concentration estimated by machine learning was compared with that investigated in the field the algorithm results were found to be similar to some field survey results the algorithm may include certain errors but remote sensing estimation reduced errors attributable to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of sampling points and the actual water quality could be reflected to a certain

16138,phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems therefore the estimation of total phosphorus tp concentration in eutrophic water using remote sensing technology is of great significance for lake environmental management however there is no tp remote sensing model for lake groups and thus far specific models have been used for specific lakes to address this issue this study proposes a framework for tp estimation first three algorithm development frameworks were compared and applied to the development of an algorithm for lake taihu which has complex water environment characteristics and is a representative of eutrophic lakes an extremely gradient boosting bst machine learning framework was proposed for developing the taihu tp algorithm the machine learning algorithm could mine the relationship between fai and tp in lake taihu where the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton the algorithm exhibited robust performance with an r2 value of 0 6 rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 then a general tp algorithm r2 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 was developed using the proposed framework and tested in seven other lakes using synchronous image data the algorithm accuracy was found to be affected by aquatic vegetation and enclosure aquaculture third compared with field investigations in other studies on lake taihu the taihu tp algorithm showed good performance for long term tp estimation therefore the machine learning framework developed in this study has application potential in large scale spatio temporal tp estimation in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords remote sensing total phosphorus lake taihu machine learning 1 introduction in recent decades with the rapid development of the global economy human activities have led to the discharge of large amounts of pollutants into lakes consequently lake eutrophication has become a major challenge facing the world and it has been attracting increasingly more attention le et al 2010 ma et al 2010 as of 2012 more than 60 of the world s large lakes can be considered highly eutrophic wang et al 2018 phosphorus p as a limiting nutrient for eutrophication in freshwater systems howarth and marino 2006 schindler 2006 has a prominent limiting effect on lake eutrophication in china p discharge has caused serious eutrophication problems in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river ji et al 2020 accordingly local governments have been striving to control lake eutrophication in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river therefore it is of great significance to clarify the spatiotemporal variability of total phosphorus tp concentration in lakes in this area the increasingly maturing remote sensing technology is the preferred method for rapid and accurate determination of lake water quality although remote sensing can facilitate the estimation of tp concentration the methodology involved is complicated because p does not have spectral characteristics in lakes p occurs mainly in the particulate form primarily derived from soil erosion and p concentration affects the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton gao et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 hence p is closely related to optical active constitutes oacs in water including colored dissolved organic matter cdom phytoplankton and non algae particulate matter phytoplankton can be quantitatively characterized by chlorophyll a chla concentration and non algae particulate matter mainly comprise suspended particulate inorganic matter spim li et al 2017b song et al 2012 wu et al 2010 xue and ma 2019 most studies use statistical methods to identify spectral bands that can be used to estimate tp concentration all bands from visible to near infrared can be used for estimating tp concentration table 1 because the optical properties and p forms in different lakes are variable therefore previous studies reported varying results the optical properties of most inland water bodies are dominated by spim and thus the estimation band for spim or suspended particulate matter spm can be considered for developing an appropriate tp algorithm liu and jiang 2013 xiong et al 2019 however in some lakes with severe eutrophication in the case of frequent algal blooms the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton tp is affected by the absorption and degradation of phytoplankton and its correlation with chla increases with increasing severity of eutrophication domagalski et al 2007 shi et al 2017 the optical properties of such lakes are very unstable therefore it is necessary to identify and eliminate algal bloom areas or classify algorithms according to the optical properties and lake areas and select multiple bands simultaneously to develop a tp estimation model gao et al 2015 sun et al 2012 sun et al 2014b frameworks for developing lake tp remote sensing algorithms are divided into two major categories 1 conventional algorithm development methods including direct and indirect derivation methods the direct derivation method uses the statistical relationship between reflectance and measured tp concentration to derive the tp remote sensing algorithm through regression methods such as multiple stepwise regression isenstein and park 2014 lim and choi 2015 xiong et al 2019 the indirect derivation method involves the initial derivation of tp concentration from oacs concentration and then selecting the oacs algorithm or band to develop the tp estimation algorithm following the literature liu and jiang 2013 wu et al 2010 the direct derivation method is more widely used because it is simple and often provides good results whereas the indirect derivation method is complex and susceptible to accuracy loss because of the two step method xiong et al 2019 2 machine learning methods the relationships between tp and oacs in eutrophic lakes are complicated and may not be expressed by linear or non linear functions as numerous types of lakes are distributed across the globe differences in the optical properties and water quality between lakes increase the difficulty of remote sensing research therefore machine learning method has been introduced into tp estimation chang et al 2013 sun et al 2014a wang et al 2003 in recent years with the increasing maturity of research on using remote sensing for determining lake water quality the application of machine learning to water quality estimation has been increasing on a large regional scale therefore machine learning algorithms are increasingly applied chen et al 2014 concha and schott 2016 sun et al 2011 especially for the estimation of non optically active substances such as p and dissolved carbon dioxide chen et al 2019 lake taihu is one of the largest freshwater lakes in china and it has a complex water environment therefore it can serve as a typical representative of eutrophic lakes firstly the optical properties of lake taihu are variable because of the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in the non algal bloom area optical properties is mainly affected by spm in algal bloom areas it affected by phytoplankton the coverage of algal blooms in lake taihu has exceeded 25 and the frequency of algal blooms has reached 30 hu et al 2010 moreover global warming significantly enhances the frequency and area of cyanobacteria bloom zhu et al 2020 in conventional remote sensing estimation of water quality algal bloom pixels are eliminated xue et al 2019 thus decreasing the number of available samples and images and lowering algorithm robustness therefore conventional remote sensing algorithms may not be applicable algal bloom pixels should be included in the estimation of tp in lake taihu and such algorithms have rarely been reported secondly the occurrence of phosphorus in lake taihu is not uniform the net reception of tp in lake taihu exceeds its discharge wang et al 2019b and the areas surrounding the lake have dense population and well developed industries p in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater mainly exists in the dissolved form carlson et al 2013 rattan et al 2021 the discharge of the domestic sewage and industrial wastewater causes tp enrichment in the upstream lake area and the spatial distribution of tp concentration is heterogeneous considering these issues lake taihu was selected as a typical eutrophic lake for developing a tp algorithm that can be extended to other similar lakes considering the close relationships between tp and oacs many studies have proved that tp concentration in lakes can be estimated by remote sensing xiong et al 2019 liu and jiang 2013 wu et al 2010 however the variability of oacs and forms of tp across various water bodies leads inconsistencies in the tp estimation bands algorithm types and development methods resulting in the lack of tp algorithms for extremely eutrophic large lakes or lake groups in large areas therefore developing an algorithm to solve this issue should be given priority this study selected lake taihu as a typical representative of eutrophic lakes and developed a framework for tp estimation the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated at various spatial and temporal scales in an attempt to obtain a tp algorithm that can be used for lake groups on the large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu 30 9 31 6 n 119 9 120 6 e is located in the core of the yangtze river delta it is an important water source in the surrounding areas fig 1 lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2338 1 km2 an average depth of 1 9 m and a maximum depth of 3 34 m due to the structure of the bottom the lake area basically does not change with the seasons lake taihu is divided into zhushan bay zs meiliang bay ml gonghu bay gh lake center lc west lake wl south lake sl and east lake el and the water quality of el is the best in lake taihu with dense aquatic vegetation and satellite sensors can not obtain effective water body information therefore the east lake would be masked in remote sensing estimation of water quality in lake taihu shen et al 2017 2 2 field data and laboratory analysis field measured data were acquired from two sources 1 monthly water quality survey data of lake taihu during 2005 2015 provided by taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research chinese ecosystem research network dataset 1 covering a total of 346 available samples 46 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis synchronization data including tp po4 3 chla and spm 2 data collected by the research team through field surveys of large lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and huai river yh during 2017 2020 dataset 2 including lake taihu lake chaohu lake hongze lake luoma lake gehu lake nanyi and lake shijiu the dataset covered 224 available samples 19 modis synchronization data including tp chla spm and optical absorption coefficient the statistics of samples from each lake are shown in table 2 water samples were collected using a 2 l polyethylene water sampling instrument the surrounding environment and meteorological characteristics at the sampling points were recorded using indicators such as sampling time weather conditions wind speed and direction and algal bloom the collected water samples were stored in a refrigerator in the dark and transported to the laboratory for further analysis chla was determined using the acetone extraction method and spm was determined using the weighing method samples for tp were acidified with h2so4 to ph 1 and then preserved at 2 5 c tp concentrations were determined through a spectrophotometric analysis after the decomposition of potassium persulfate xiong et al 2019 the oacs determine the optical properties of water accordingly absorption coefficients of cdom ag phytoplankton pigments aph detritus ad and water aw are used to analyze optical properties the test results of aw by pope and fry 1997 are generally accepted aph and ad were determined using the quantitative filter technique mitchell 1990 and ag was measured using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer bricaud et al 1981 xue et al 2020 2 3 satellite data and preprocessing existing mature atmospheric calibration algorithms do not provide accurate estimates of reflectivity over inland lakes many studies have proved that water properties can be estimated using the rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc dimensionless which is derived after correction for rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption effects following hu et al 2004 such as algal bloom identification hu et al 2010 spm cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 and particulate organic carbon duan et al 2014 modis aqua level 1a images were downloaded from the nasa ocean color website http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the modis aqua level 1a data were processed using the seadas software through the meteorological parameter file and the rayleigh scattering lookup table in order to obtain the rrc data product 2 4 algorithm development 2 4 1 modeling set construction due to saturation or failure of the modis band currently only 7 bands are available for inland turbid waters b1 645nm b2 859nm b3 469nm b4 555nm b5 1240nm b6 1640nm and b7 2130nm perform mathematical transformations of reciprocal logarithm exponent square root and square for each band and use four arithmetic operations and normalization methods to combine each band as an index for algorithm development since temperature affects the adsorption of solid particles to p the modis land surface temperature lst product myd11a1 https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov is also used as an index which has proved to have a significant correlation r2 0 96 with the actual water temperature liu et al 2015 hu 2009 developed floating algae index fai based on modis to detect algae blooms and it has been well applied in lake taihu hu et al 2010 algal blooms are not only closely related to optically active substances such as spm and chla but also closely related to nutrients therefore fai was selected as an index and the calculation method is 1 f a i r n i r r r e d r s w i r r r e d λ n i r λ r e d λ s w i r λ r e d where r n i r r s w i r and r r e d represent the near infrared short wave infrared and red light bands respectively and λ is the center wavelength of each band of modis in summary the input indexes include the mathematical transformation and combination of each band lst and fai there are 1199 indexes in total and the indexes information can be viewed in table s1 the indexes in the following text are labeled according to the id in the table not all of these indexes will be input into the algorithm as variables each algorithm will filter indexes as variables according to its own characteristics the algorithm development method is as follows 2 4 2 conventional algorithm there are two kinds of conventional algorithm framework direct derivation and indirect derivation the steps of direct derivation framework are determine the key oacs of lake taihu according to the measured results of water quality and develop tp algorithm according the characteristic band of key oacs 3 4 samples are used for training and 1 4 samples are used for verification fig 2 a the steps of the indirect derivation method are the tp concentration is fitted by empirical relationship between the measured oacs and tp concentration and then the tp algorithm is developed based on the oacs algorithm 3 4 of the samples are used for training and 1 4 of the samples are used for verification fig 2b 2 4 3 machine learning algorithm classification and regression trees cart is one of the important methods of data mining and the most widely used and efficient machine learning algorithm two common algorithms derived from cart are selected 1 extremely gradient boosting bst 2 random forest rf the machine

④repeat step ③ until the verification accuracy of the algorithm does not increase in order to ensure the stability of the algorithm the 5 fold cross validation was used to ensure that the training

the structure of the algorithm as simple as possible for example reduce the depth of the tree and the number of leaves fig 2c 2 4 4 algorithm accuracy evaluation the accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated by the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mrd 3 r m s e 1 n 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 4 m r e 1 n i 1 n y i x i y i 100 where n is the number of data x is the estimated value and y is the measured value 3 results 3 1 water quality characterization the water quality of lake taihu is shown in fig 3 lake taihu is a typical eutrophic water body with an average spm concentration of 41 87 mg l and an average chla of 16 55 μg l different parts of the lake showed prominent differences in water quality the concentrations of tp and po4 in zs and wl were relatively high and their concentrations in gh lc and sl were relatively low the chla concentrations in zs ml and wl were higher than those in the other three lake areas the spm concentrations in zs ml and gh were lower than those in lc wl and sl which can be attributed to the less wind and wave disturbance in the lake bay in conclusion the water environment characteristics of lake taihu are complex and the water quality of each lake area exhibit clear differences therefore lake taihu is representative of inland eutrophic lakes 3 2 taihu tp algorithm directly and indirectly derived algorithms exhibited low accuracy with r2 less than 0 4 and mre more than 50 for the verification set fig 4 a b considering that the machine learning algorithm has a high training accuracy only the verification accuracy is shown fig 4c d bst showed the highest accuracy with r2 reaching 0 60 the scatters were uniformly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 the r2 of the rf algorithm was 0 52 and it showed significant underestimation when tp 0 3 mg l the input variables of machine learning algorithm are shown in table 3 the variables are sorted in descending order according to incmse since the number of indexes reaches 1199 all input variables are marked with id for details of variables please refer to supplementary material s1 most of the input variables of the two algorithms were the same but the values of incmse are different and the mean incmse value of thevariables of bst algorithm was higher than that of rf algorithm which verifies the higher accuracy of the bst algorithm over the rf algorithm overall the bst algorithm developed using the machine learning framework was the most suitable algorithm for tp estimation 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of tp in lake taihu the spatiotemporal distribution of tp concentration in lake taihu from 2003 to 2019 is shown fig 5 tp gradually decreased from east to west controlled by the qinghai tibet plateau most water systems in china flow from west to east the water systems in the upper reaches of lake taihu are located in the west and north terrigenous input leads to high tp concentration in the west and north of lake taihu and areas with low tp are mainly concentrated in lc tp concentration in most areas ranged from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l the tp concentration in lake taihu exhibited a trend of initial decline followed by an increase the lowest value of 0 13 mg l was observed in 2012 and the highest value of 0 17 mg l was observed in 2017 4 discussion as the machine learning algorithm is a black box process the bst algorithm integrates a large number of classifiers moreover the original intention of the machine learning algorithm is to process big data sample classification will reduce the number of samples and greatly reduce the stability of the algorithm therefore the performance of the algorithm cannot be evaluated internally but from the results before and after estimation in this study the feasibility of bst to the tp estimation was first explored by considering the optical properties and tp forms of the lake subsequently the applicability of the algorithm to other eutrophic lakes was evaluated finally according to relevant research on lake taihu the rationality of applying the algorithm to long time series data was evaluated 4 1 feasibility of machine learning algorithms in tp estimation dataset 1 was obtained from taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research and does not include absorption coefficients in order to analyze the optical properties of lake taihu the absorption coefficients were measured in dataset 2 so only 68 sample points were considered fig 6 a the influence of aph appeared to be stronger and its highest proportion reached more than 80 in contrast the proportions of ag and ad were generally 60 or less in addition chla showed a closer relationship with tp fig 6b in eutrophic lakes with infrequent algal blooms such as lake hongze xiong et al 2019 and lake poyang liu and jiang 2013 suspended solids were the dominant factor controlling tp however in lake taihu which experiences frequent algal blooms oacs are the key factor dominating tp owing to the drastic changes in chla concentration therefore the optical properties and tp forms in lake taihu were mainly influenced by phytoplankton the impact of all water quality parameters on the relationship between tp and oacs was analyzed only chla and po4 tp exhibited prominent effects and other indicators were placed in s2 with chla and po4 tp arranged in the ascending order the samples were divided into 16 groups each of which comprised 100 samples 20 samples as the interval subsequently the correlation coefficients between tp and oacs in each group were calculated the results showed that increases in chla concentration will strengthen the correlations between tp and oacs fig 6c and increases in po4 tp will reduce the correlation fig 6d po4 content was prominently higher in zs and wl in which algal blooms occur frequently than in other lake areas fig 3 with the increase of algal density in pixels the optical properties of water will change rapidly so traditional studies have eliminated algal bloom pixels as much as possible wang et al 2019a shi et al 2017 as shown in table 3 that the incmse of index no 1 and index no 1126 is obviously higher than the incmse of other variables these two variables represent fai and f2 f3 respectively fai is a key index for estimating tp in lake taihu but conventional algorithms cannot mine the potential relationship between fai and tp as a common method of data mining the bst algorithm can mine the relationship between fai and tp fai is the most commonly used index for detecting algal blooms hu et al 2010 as phytoplankton and tp have a close relationship fai has potential for estimating chla and tp when fai 0 06 fig 7 a b during the development of conventional algorithms when the fai exceeded 0 06 the algal bloom intensity exceeded the limit for characterizing water information therefore conventional algorithms cannot accurately mine the relationship between fai and chla in contrast the machine learning algorithm could mine the relationship between phytoplankton and tp the bst algorithm is an ensemble algorithm including multiple linear and non linear classifiers regarding the incmse index of fai bst provided the highest value and rf provided the second highest value table 3 also the relationship between f2 f3 and tp is not as close as that between fai and tp fig 7c which further explains the superior performance of bst over rf in terms of the incmse of lst bst ranked the third and temperature is an important factor affecting tp concentration in lakes wang et al 2019b with increases in temperature the solubility of p increases and the processes of biological disturbance and anaerobic transformation are accelerated resulting in the release of p from sediments jiang et al 2008 on the whole the bst algorithm could mine the impact of each index on tp in conclusion the optical properties and forms of tp in lake taihu are mainly affected by phytoplankton the conventional algorithm could not mine the relationship between remote sensing products and tp as a data mining algorithm bst could determine the relationships between tp fai and lst through which the lake taihu tp algorithm could be successfully developed 4 2 applicability of the lake taihu tp algorithm development framework to other lakes based on the synchronous sample data of all lakes in yh table 2 the yh tp algorithm was developed using the machine learning framework the accuracy of the algorithm reached 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 and the error was lower than that of the taihu tp algorithm however when tp 0 1 mg l the sample point error increased for lake chaohu indicating that the accuracy may widely vary among lakes the accuracy of the yh tp algorithm was found to depend on the sample discreteness of lake taihu therefore image testing was performed to analyze the generalizability of the algorithm fig 8 in the testing of the algorithm using synchronous image only the results of cloud free images were considered fig 9 the tp concentration in lake chaohu and lake gehu was significantly higher than that in other lakes which is consistent with previously reported results zhu et al 2019 the spatial variability of tp in lake chaohu was greater than that in other lakes in the images of august 23 2017 and july 14 2018 the tp concentration in areas covered by algal bloom was significantly higher than that in the surrounding areas it is worth noting that the distribution of sampling points will seriously affect the final results the tp concentrations in lake chaohu on april 28 2017 and august 23 2017 estimated using remote sensing data were lower than the average values measured for the samples this can be explained by the sampling points being mainly concentrated in the west of lake chaohu and the water quality of lake chaohu is significantly poorer in the west than that in other areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2017a therefore the average concentration of tp measured over the entire lake on july 14 2018 was 0 15 mg l which is consistent with the remote sensing estimation results fig 10 evident high value pixels were observed around lakes without algal blooms such as in lake shijiu lake nanyi and lake hongze because aquatic vegetation around the lake algal blooms and aquatic vegetation have similar spectral characteristics liang et al 2017 the algorithm overestimate the value of tp concentrations in addition the existence of paddy fields and net enclosure aquaculture around some lakes will also affect the tp estimation results such as in the west and north of lake hongze xiong et al 2019 moreover compared with lake chaohu and lake taihu seasonal changes in the water volume of lake hongze are more prominent due to which the marginal effect of the lake is also more pronounced cao et al 2017 the algorithm overestimates the tp concentration because of these high value pixels in lake shijiu lake nanyi lake gehu and lake hongze therefore when extending the yh tp algorithm to other lakes it is necessary to clarify the environment of each lake and control the pixel quality in order to completely utilize the algorithm in summary the bst algorithm can be used to develop a tp estimation algorithm for eutrophic waters when performing large scale and long term estimations it is necessary to strictly control the quality of pixels and investigate the environment of each lake especially the distinction between algae blooms and aquatic vegetation and net enclosure aquaculture 4 3 potential of the taihu tp algorithm to simulate long term tp changes in this study existing research results on tp in lake taihu were reviewed and relevant data from graphs or tables in literature were extracted table 4 most studies were found to focus on the three bays of lake taihu regarding zs the results of qin et al 2010 were significantly lower than those of other studies indicating the potential of large errors with field investigations because of the contingency of the sampling time and location the remote sensing estimation results and the survey results of xu et al 2019 showed that same tp concentration but the change trends were quite different which may be explained by the difference in sampling xu et al 2019 collected water samples from approximately one meter below the water surface whereas remote sensing techniques estimate the tp concentration on the surface of the lake due to the phototaxis of phytoplankton the concentration of phytoplankton in the surface water body will increase with tp concentration with increasing depth phytoplankton concentration will gradually decrease li et al 2017a qi et al 2018 accordingly the survey results of xu et al 2019 were also lower than the remote sensing estimation results in ml and gh in ml the remote sensing estimation results were basically consistent with the results of xu et al 2010 and paerl et al 2011 showing a trend of high in summer and autumn and low in winter and spring therefore the spatial unevenness and temporal contingency of sampling points are easy to lead to the deviation of researchers understanding of the real situation of the lake although the remote sensing algorithm has errors or uncertainties to a certain extent it can estimate the water quality index of each pixel in the entire plane moreover after excluding the images affected by cloud cover and flare a total of 1604 modis images were used for tp estimation of taihu lake from 2003 to 2019 with an average of 94 images per year therefore remote sensing estimationhas high potential for providing detailed information on the overall real situation of the lake in summary the results of the taihu tp algorithm can represent the long term tp changes in taihu lake and compared with field surveying it can reduce errors caused by the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of sampling points and reflect the actual water quality to a certain extent 5 conclusion in this study three frameworks of algorithm development were comparatively analysed in an extremely eutrophic large lake lake taihu and a machine learning framework was proposed for developing the taihu tp algorithm based on modis data and in situ data the machine learning algorithm especially bst could mine the relationship between fai and tp in lake taihu where the optical properties of the water body are dominated by phytoplankton the taihu tp algorithm derived using bst exhibited robust performance with an r2 value of 0 6 rmse 0 07 mg l mre 43 33 then the framework was tested in a large area the yh tp algorithm was developed using the proposed framework with an r2 value of 0 64 rmse 0 06 mg l mre 34 13 however the yh tp algorithm overestimated the tp concentration in areas of aquatic vegetation and enclosure aquaculture therefore it is necessary to identify and delete these pixels to improve the accuracy moreover for the first time the long term tp concentration estimated by machine learning was compared with that investigated in the field the algorithm results were found to be similar to some field survey results the algorithm may include certain errors but remote sensing estimation reduced errors attributable to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of sampling points and the actual water quality could be reflected to a certain

16139,natural biofilm can be a suitable medium for the monitoring of pollutants limited information is currently available regarding the occurrence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in periphytic biofilm and low trophic level organisms of freshwater ecosystems in this study surface water biofilm phytoplankton and freshwater snails were collected from taihu lake china and characterized for 16 pfas including legacy compounds pfsas pfcas and pfas of emerging concern fluorotelomer sulfonates and f 53b the colonized biofilms effectively bioaccumulated pfas from water with the total concentration pfas in the range of 1 96 20 1 ng g wet weight and the bioaccumulation factor increased with the pfas log k ow values as compared with phytoplankton the pfas in biofilms displayed a stronger correlation with those in water pfas distinctly biomagnified from the biofilm to freshwater snail with the biomagnification factor in the range of 3 09 2 03 17 8 10 2 implying the important role of biofilm in pfas transfer in aquatic environment extracellular proteins production in biofilm increased with the water pfas concentrations the total extracellular polymeric substances eps content increased with the water pfas concentration firstly and then declined to a steady level while the algal chlorophyll level exhibited a similar relationship with the pfas in biofilm high pfas levels were also associated with depressed alpha diversity of fungal community in biofilms biofilm appears as a relevant indicator to characterize the occurrence of pfas in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms pfas integrative sample bioaccumulation biomagnification extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a family of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used in industrial and household products for over 70 years because of their excellent surface activity thermal and chemical stability prevedouros et al 2006 many concerns have been raised on pfas because of their ubiquitous occurrence in global environment bioaccumulation and biomagnification in organisms and potential toxicities munoz et al 2017 pan et al 2018 since 2000 regulations and actions have been taken in many countries and regions to eliminate the production and usage of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and their salts as well as long chained pfas cousins et al 2019 however a variety of fluorinated alternatives of pfos and long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas including short chained pfas precursors of pfos or pfoa and some polyfluorinated substances are being largely manufactured to satisfy the market demand chen et al 2018 although the production of some pfas has decreased or been suspended pfas continue to be widely distributed and cycled in the environment through long range transport degradation of their precursors or remobilization from other media such as sediment ice or soil ahrens and bundschuh 2014 houde et al 2011 penland et al 2020 the aquatic system is an important sink for pfas due to their relatively higher water solubility a number of studies investigated the occurrence of pfas in aquatic environments including oceans liu et al 2017 rivers and lakes pan et al 2018 as well as drinking water zhang et al 2019 in addition several pfas of emerging concern like 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 fts and 6 2 chlorinated perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate 6 2 cl pfesa trade name f 53b as major alternatives of pfos have also been detected in surface water in different countries chen et al 2018 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2016 although 6 2 cl pfesa is only produced in china wang et al 2013 meanwhile many studies have demonstrated pfas could be bioaccumulated by various organisms and biomagnified in aquatic food webs munoz et al 2017 penland et al 2020 which may have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and ultimately human health however most field studies on the occurrence of pfas largely relied on instantaneous grab samples of water wang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 which could only stand for occasional pollution status with great contingency and uncertainty recently artificial passive sampling techniques such as microporous polyethylene tube material kaserzon et al 2019 polar organic passive sampler lai et al 2019 and diffusive gradients in thin films fang et al 2021 have been developed to measure pfas in water within a period of time however a typical shortcoming of these passive sampling techniques is the difficulty of sampler deployment and maintenance in field due to the complicated geographical environmental and human factors fang et al 2021 besides there are challenges associated with the calibration and implementation of passive sampling particular for pfas because of their unique physicochemical properties lai et al 2019 biofilm is one of the most widely distributed producers in aquatic environments flemming et al 2016 and has been used as natural sampling tool to monitor the spatial variability of anthropogenic contaminants including heavy metals e g copper zinc and cadmium hobbs et al 2019 hua et al 2019 and hydrophobic organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls hobbs et al 2019 pesticides mahler et al 2020 biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms composed of algae fungi bacteria protozoa metazoa and other micro biological and non biological matters in which cells are embedded within the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by themselves flemming et al 2016 as an important component of metabolic products eps is considered to be a typical self protection strategy against toxic compounds flemming and wingender 2010 biofilm usually colonizes on the surface of solid substrates in aquatic environments flemming et al 2016 and is responsible for nutrient cycling primary production and organic matter decomposition tlili et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that pollutants could be adsorbed by biofilms through multiple mechanisms including electrostatic cation exchange complexation hydrophobic and micropore filling interactions huang et al 2018 more importantly biofilms are food sources of many invertebrates thus making the associated contaminants trophically transferable to food chain lopez et al 2016 this suggests that biofilms play an important role in transferring contaminants in the environment flemming et al 2016 however little is known about the roles of biofilm in the fate of pfas in aquatic systems li et al 2021 munoz et al 2018 simonnet laprade et al 2019 in addition the microbial diversity and sensitivity of biofilms are commonly used to assess the adverse effects of toxic substances on aquatic ecosystem tlili et al 2020 given that pfas are ubiquitous in aquatic environments biofilms are supposed to be exposed to elevated concentrations of pfas nevertheless the interactions between them have not yet been studied systematically this study aimed to investigate the possibility of using biofilm as potential integrative sample to assess the contamination levels and profiles as well as the spatial distribution of pfas in surface water surface water biofilm phytoplankton and freshwater snail cipangopaludina chinensis gastropoda which is an invertebrate grazing on biofilm were collected from taihu lake china where previous studies indicated that contamination of pfas is prevalent yu et al 2022 the trophic transfer of pfas from biofilm to snails was evaluated to further understand the importance of biofilm in pfas transfer among the ecosystem in addition the impacts of pfas contamination on aquatic ecosystem were evaluated by assessing a variety of properties such as the content of eps and chlorophyll microbial diversities of the biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents pfcas c6 c13 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas c4 c6 c8 perfluorooctane

with bovine serum albumin bsa and commercial humic acid ha sigma aldrich for calibration respectively frolund et al 1995 the polysaccharide concentration was measured using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard frolund et al 1996 to evaluate the community compositions and diversities of biofilms high throughput sequencing of the 16s rdna 18s rdna and internal transcribed spacer 1 its1

purpose of statistical analysis a value equivalent to half of the mdls was designated for compounds lower than the mdls 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas in the surface water of taihu lake sixteen pfas were analyzed in the samples except perfluorotridecanoic acid pftrda 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pfesa other 13 pfas were detected in all the water samples the total concentration of the pfas pfas in the surface water ranged from 57 3 to 351 ng l table s4 which was comparable to the results of a previous study in which the samples were collected in 2015 chen et al 2018 the levels of pfoa pfos and perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa mean 25 4 9 69 11 7 ng l respectively table s4 were similar to those reported in taihu lake in 2009 2015 24 9 33 2 9 26 20 3 11 4 21 2 ng l respectively chen et al 2018 yu et al 2022 these suggested that the concentrations of pfas in taihu lake were relatively constant in recent years pfoa was the predominant homolog with a contribution of 28 4 4 1 to the pfas followed by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs 18 7 ng l 21 6 9 3 and pfhxa 13 0 4 0 fig 1 a the concentrations of the short chained pfas were much higher than the long chained ones which might partly be due to their higher solubility as compared to the longer counterparts c 7 zhao et al 2012 another reason might be that the production volume of short chained pfas which are replacing the longer ones is gradually increasing fang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 as the substitutes of pfos 6 2 fts mean 1 31 ng l and 6 2 cl pfesa 1 84 ng l were detected in all the water samples with contributions of 1 63 2 00 and 2 05 1 15 to the pfas 6 2 fts is used in certain types of industrial detergents and surfactants field and seow 2017 and is also a major transformation product related to 6 2 fluorotelomer precursors present in aqueous film forming foams afffs harding marjanovic et al 2015 mumtaz et al 2019 although 6 2 cl pfesa the major component of f 53b is only produced in china and used as a mist suppressant in the chrome plating industry wang et al 2013 it was frequently detected in some other countries gebbink et al 2016 pan et al 2018 however it was rarely reported in taihu lake before the significantly positive correlations between the unregulated pfas 6 2 cl pfesa 8 2 cl pfesa and pfos p 0 01 table s5 suggested their common sources and or similar environmental behaviors the results indicated that the application of these unregulated pfas is common and prevalent in the areas surrounding the lake fig 1b shows the spatial distribution of pfas in the lake water the highest level of pfas appeared at t6 351 ng l in the north of meiliang bay which was in line with the result of previous studies ma et al 2018 yu et al 2022 the pfas in the whole meiliang bay t4 t9 was much higher than other areas of taihu lake fig s1 meiliang bay is close to wuxi city where there are many manufacturers for textile plastic and electronics electroplating and semiconductor industries zhang et al 2010 besides an international airport is located about 20 km east of the meiliang bay where the afffs a potential source of pfas are supposed to be used for fire equipment testing and firefighter training chen et al 2020 mumtaz et al 2019 thus the higher pfas concentration in the northern part of taihu lake is likely attributed to the intensive industrial activities the international airport and other urban influences of wuxi yu et al 2022 3 2 bioaccumulation of pfas in phytoplankton and biofilm the pfas in phytoplankton ranged from 0 872 to 13 7 ng g ww wet weight fig s2 and table s6 there was no significantly linear correlation between the pfas in the phytoplankton and water p 0 05 as regards the biofilm samples the target pfas were detected in all the biofilm samples except 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pfesa with a detection frequency of 73 and 92 respectively the pfas in the biofilms ranging from 1 96 to 20 1 ng g ww fig s3a and table s7 was distinctly higher than in phytoplankton p 0 01 which was in line with a previous field study penland et al 2020 the profiles of pfas in the biofilms were quite different from the surface water pfos mean 1 77 ng g ww perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna 1 74 ng g ww and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda 1 51 ng g ww were predominant with a contribution of 18 3 5 4 17 0 7 2 14 7 4 4 respectively fig s3b and table s8 the contributions of pfoa 14 7 6 9 and pfbs 1 6 1 5 were much lower while the contributions of pfos and long chain pfcas c8 13 63 0 10 2 were much higher in the biofilms table s8 this was in line with a previous study on the distribution of pfas in biota samples from taihu lake fang et al 2014 the log baf values of the long chain pfas including pfos and c8 13pfcas in biofilm were significantly higher than that in phytoplankton p 0 05 while those of short chained were the opposite pfbs perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs and perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa table s9 this suggested that biofilm displayed much higher bioaccumulation potential to long chained pfas than phytoplankton leading to the higher level of pfas in biofilm than algae fig 2 a and b show that there were strong correlations between log baf in biofilm and log k ow estimated by the cosmotherm model table s10 for both pfcas r 2 0 98 p 0 01 and pfsas fts and cl pfesa were included r 2 0 84 p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic interaction played an important role in the bioaccumulation of pfas in biofilm li et al 2021 pi et al 2017 different from phytoplankton there were significant linear relationships between the pfas long chain pfas including pfos pfoa perfluorononanoic acid pfna pfda pfuna 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pesea in biofilms and water p 0 01 figs 2c and s4 this suggested effective bioaccumulation of biofilm to dissolved pfas in water under the protection of eps biofilms colonize on the submerged solid surfaces steadily and integrate contaminants over longer periods of time however phytoplankton usually floats on water surface and mobilizes frequently with water flow which may affect the equilibrium of pfas in phytoplankton and water this may partly explain the lack of correlation between pfas in phytoplankton and in water thus biofilm is more suitable than phytoplankton for characterizing the contamination of pfas in surface water although phytoplankton also plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems besides the substances sorbed of biofilm include both absorption in the water and adsorption on the eps and biofilm cells flemming et al 2016 the abundant functional groups such as amine carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in eps of biofilm provide many sorption sites for pfas li et al 2021 vu and wu 2020 there are a number of proteins in eps that could bind with pfas strongly fig s7b martin et al 2003 li et al 2021 also reported that sorption on eps made an important contribution to the bioaccumulation of pfas in biofilms yan et al 2021 revealed the crucial roles of eps proteins in the adsorption of pfoa specifically the aromatic and amide groups of proteins may interact with the c f chains and carboxylic head of pfoa via hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction respectively the eps content of biofilm is much higher than phytoplankton which might be one of the reasons accounting for the higher accumulation of pfas in biofilm than phytoplankton the overall results suggested that biofilm was not only an effective integrative monitoring tool for traditional organic pollutants and heavy metals hobbs et al 2019 mahler et al 2020 but also useful in indicating the contamination characteristic of pfas in aquatic environment 3 3 trophic transfer of pfas from biofilm to snails freshwater snail generally feeds on biofilm by scraping them on solid surfaces friesen et al 2017 the pfas concentrations in snails are shown in table s11 significant linear relationships were observed for the pfas p 0 01 fig 3 a pfos pfda pfuna and 6 2 cl pfesa p 0 05 fig s5 between the snails and biofilms but these correlations were absent between the snails and water p 0 05 these results magnified that diet was a dominant exposure route for snails to accumulate pfas biomagnification factor bmf is usually used to describe the biomagnification behavior between a predator and its prey gao et al 2020 the bmfs were in the range from 3 09 2 03 8 2 fts to 17 8 10 2 pfna fig 3b all greater than one suggesting distinct biomagnification of pfas from biofilm to snails as shown in figs 3b and s6 the bmfs of pfcas and pfsas showed a general trend of first rise and then decline with the carbon chain length increasing an exception is the bmf of pfhxs was higher than that of pfos similar to our study munoz et al 2017 reported that the trophic magnification factors tmfs of c8 c14 pfcas decreased with the increasing chain length and that of pfhxs was higher than pfos in an estuarine food web gao et al 2020 also observed higher bmf of pfhxs than pfos in the pair of predator neogastropoda and prey archaeogastropoda the decrease of bmfs for long chained pfas might be related to their lower bioavailability when transferring from biofilm to snail the variabilities of bmfs observed for pfos pfosa 6 2 fts and 6 2 cl pfesa which all have eight carbon chain length might be due to their different substitutional and functional groups it is interesting that the short chain pfas including pfbs mean bmf 8 32 pfhxs 16 1 pfhxa 5 55 and pfhpa 5 81 also displayed biomagnification from biofilm to snails as stated above the concentrations of these short chain pfas in water were much higher than the long chain ones besides preying on biofilms the snails might also absorb pfas from water thus the pfas accumulated in the snails also included that derived from absorption from water consequently the bmfs of the short chain pfas might be overestimated trophic transfer behaviors of pfas were investigated in complex food webs previously in which biofilm and invertebrates were seldom included and trophic magnification was only observed for long chain pfas fang et al 2014 loi et al 2011 however some field investigations including benthic invertebrates observed the biomagnification of short chain pfas such as pfbs in mollusks tmf 1 30 penland et al 2020 and pfhxs in benthic food web tmf 4 3 munoz et al 2017 higher levels of short chain pfas in invertebrates than fish were reported in previous studies naile et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 which might be due to that fish were more effective in eliminating short chain pfas than invertebrates simmonet laprade et al 2019 6 2 fts was considered as unlikely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organism because of the effective elimination in high trophic level fish hoke et al 2015 however it exhibited very high bmf 17 1 7 2 in this study which was in accordance with its considerable concentrations in marine invertebrates langberg et al 2019 this suggested that snail and other invertebrates might have lower efficiency in metabolizing and or excreting pfas miranda et al 2021 table s12 shows the variabilities of pfas biomagnification across various trophic web structures worldwide all these results suggest that the characteristics of the food webs would influence the trophic transfer of pfas miranda et al 2022 munoz et al 2017 the results further suggested that biofilm and snail played vital roles in transferring pfas in food webs and more studies are needed to get further insight into the variability of bmfs tmfs 3 4 responses of biofilms to pfas exposure biofilm displays versatile responses to various pollutants including the community structure function and production of eps bonet et al 2013 tang et al 2017 in this study eps content total chlorophyll content community composition and diversity of biofilms were selected as representative indicators to evaluate the impacts of pfas on biofilms 3 4 1 changes in eps content and total chlorophyll content the eps content increased rapidly with the increase of pfas in water and peaked at pfas of 70 5 ng l then decreased slowly and finally tended to be stable fig s7a a number of previous studies have reported that microorganisms in biofilms developed a mechanism to resist environmental pressure and maintained normal metabolic activities by increasing eps production flemming and wingender 2010 tang et al 2017 the increase of eps content suggested that the exposure of pfas induced pressures to the microorganisms in biofilms which responded to generate more eps to maintain normal activities as the concentration of pfas increased over 70 5 ng l the eps content decreased and then remained constant at a stable level implying that the local biofilms were acclimated and got used to the relatively high concentrations of pfas it is worth mentioning that the proportion of extracellular proteins in eps displayed a significantly linear relationship with the concentration of pfas in water r 2 0 42 p 0 01 fig s7b but not with pfas in biofilm p 0 05 this suggested that the pfas external exposure or another co correlated confounding factor promoted the production of extracellular proteins which was in line with the responses of biofilms to other kinds of contaminants stewart et al 2015 tang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 besides pfas biofilms were also exposed to other xenobiotics in water which might also affect the excretion of extracellular proteins but our results suggested that pfas might be one of the important environmental stimuli studies under controlled conditions should be performed to further test this hypothesis fig s7c illustrates that there was a distinct relationship between the total chlorophyll content and the pfas in biofilms which was similar to the relationship between the eps content and pfas in water however there was no correlation between the total chlorophyll content and the pfas in water eps located outside of the biofilms might serve as the first guard to protect the microorganisms comparatively algae are inside the biofilms and protected by eps and their responses were relevant to the gradual accumulation of pfas in the biofilms thus algal chlorophyll could be used as a biomarker to indicate the pfas internal exposure in biofilms 3 4 2 community compositions and diversity of biofilms the response differences of community compositions were analyzed in three biofilm samples with relatively higher pfas t17 t11 t13 and three with relatively lower pfas r9 t16 r7 the details for the selection of these samples are described in si the pcoa results showed significant differences in the community compositions among the two groups fig s8 dramatically different phylum level community compositions were also observed fig s9 and table 13 these results suggested that biofilm microorganisms were sensitive to pfas exposure biofilm is exposed to complex environments and the community compositions may be affected by many factors gessner et al 2016 it is reported that water chemistry conditions such as total nitrogen total phosphorus dissolved oxygen total organic carbon could affect the bacterial communities in taihu lake chang et al 2020 both t11 and t13 had high pfas in water and they happened to be geographically close to each other coincidentally their community compositions were also similar fig s8 however although t17 and t16 were also geographically close t17 had high level while t16 had low level of pfas and their community compositions were greatly different the distinct difference between them suggested that pfas exposure was an important factor affecting the biofilm community compositions regarding alpha diversity shannon simpson and chao1 indices fig s10 and table s14 exposure to higher concentrations of pfas had a significantly negative effect on the diversity of fungal community in biofilms fig s10a but not on bacterial diversity fig s10b the shannon and simpson indexes are affected by the richness and evenness of the community respectively for the fungal community the shannon index showed a greater decline than the simpson one indicating that high levels of exposure to pfas induced a more adverse effect on the richness of fungal community in biofilms while having a lighter influence on the evenness of community in contrast the eukaryotic diversity increased at higher pfas fig s10c that could be due to the adaptation of some microorganisms such as phylum intramacronucleata fig s9c at higher pfas resulting in a relative increase of community richness and the diversity 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that biofilms could effectively accumulate pfas and could well characterize the pfas levels profiles spatial trend in a water body and this is the first report of f 53b in periphytic biofilm biofilm could act as a potential integrative sample in which the pfas concentrations are more representative than grab samples the special equipment deployment and maintenance which are important for commercial passive samplers are not required for biofilms in addition the levels of eps extracellular protein algal chlorophyll and the community diversity of the biofilms responded sensitively to pfas which act as a potentially important environmental stimulus all these suggest that biofilm could be a relevant indicator to characterize the contamination of pfas in water and the potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16139,natural biofilm can be a suitable medium for the monitoring of pollutants limited information is currently available regarding the occurrence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in periphytic biofilm and low trophic level organisms of freshwater ecosystems in this study surface water biofilm phytoplankton and freshwater snails were collected from taihu lake china and characterized for 16 pfas including legacy compounds pfsas pfcas and pfas of emerging concern fluorotelomer sulfonates and f 53b the colonized biofilms effectively bioaccumulated pfas from water with the total concentration pfas in the range of 1 96 20 1 ng g wet weight and the bioaccumulation factor increased with the pfas log k ow values as compared with phytoplankton the pfas in biofilms displayed a stronger correlation with those in water pfas distinctly biomagnified from the biofilm to freshwater snail with the biomagnification factor in the range of 3 09 2 03 17 8 10 2 implying the important role of biofilm in pfas transfer in aquatic environment extracellular proteins production in biofilm increased with the water pfas concentrations the total extracellular polymeric substances eps content increased with the water pfas concentration firstly and then declined to a steady level while the algal chlorophyll level exhibited a similar relationship with the pfas in biofilm high pfas levels were also associated with depressed alpha diversity of fungal community in biofilms biofilm appears as a relevant indicator to characterize the occurrence of pfas in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms pfas integrative sample bioaccumulation biomagnification extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a family of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used in industrial and household products for over 70 years because of their excellent surface activity thermal and chemical stability prevedouros et al 2006 many concerns have been raised on pfas because of their ubiquitous occurrence in global environment bioaccumulation and biomagnification in organisms and potential toxicities munoz et al 2017 pan et al 2018 since 2000 regulations and actions have been taken in many countries and regions to eliminate the production and usage of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and their salts as well as long chained pfas cousins et al 2019 however a variety of fluorinated alternatives of pfos and long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas including short chained pfas precursors of pfos or pfoa and some polyfluorinated substances are being largely manufactured to satisfy the market demand chen et al 2018 although the production of some pfas has decreased or been suspended pfas continue to be widely distributed and cycled in the environment through long range transport degradation of their precursors or remobilization from other media such as sediment ice or soil ahrens and bundschuh 2014 houde et al 2011 penland et al 2020 the aquatic system is an important sink for pfas due to their relatively higher water solubility a number of studies investigated the occurrence of pfas in aquatic environments including oceans liu et al 2017 rivers and lakes pan et al 2018 as well as drinking water zhang et al 2019 in addition several pfas of emerging concern like 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 fts and 6 2 chlorinated perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate 6 2 cl pfesa trade name f 53b as major alternatives of pfos have also been detected in surface water in different countries chen et al 2018 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2016 although 6 2 cl pfesa is only produced in china wang et al 2013 meanwhile many studies have demonstrated pfas could be bioaccumulated by various organisms and biomagnified in aquatic food webs munoz et al 2017 penland et al 2020 which may have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and ultimately human health however most field studies on the occurrence of pfas largely relied on instantaneous grab samples of water wang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 which could only stand for occasional pollution status with great contingency and uncertainty recently artificial passive sampling techniques such as microporous polyethylene tube material kaserzon et al 2019 polar organic passive sampler lai et al 2019 and diffusive gradients in thin films fang et al 2021 have been developed to measure pfas in water within a period of time however a typical shortcoming of these passive sampling techniques is the difficulty of sampler deployment and maintenance in field due to the complicated geographical environmental and human factors fang et al 2021 besides there are challenges associated with the calibration and implementation of passive sampling particular for pfas because of their unique physicochemical properties lai et al 2019 biofilm is one of the most widely distributed producers in aquatic environments flemming et al 2016 and has been used as natural sampling tool to monitor the spatial variability of anthropogenic contaminants including heavy metals e g copper zinc and cadmium hobbs et al 2019 hua et al 2019 and hydrophobic organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls hobbs et al 2019 pesticides mahler et al 2020 biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms composed of algae fungi bacteria protozoa metazoa and other micro biological and non biological matters in which cells are embedded within the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by themselves flemming et al 2016 as an important component of metabolic products eps is considered to be a typical self protection strategy against toxic compounds flemming and wingender 2010 biofilm usually colonizes on the surface of solid substrates in aquatic environments flemming et al 2016 and is responsible for nutrient cycling primary production and organic matter decomposition tlili et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that pollutants could be adsorbed by biofilms through multiple mechanisms including electrostatic cation exchange complexation hydrophobic and micropore filling interactions huang et al 2018 more importantly biofilms are food sources of many invertebrates thus making the associated contaminants trophically transferable to food chain lopez et al 2016 this suggests that biofilms play an important role in transferring contaminants in the environment flemming et al 2016 however little is known about the roles of biofilm in the fate of pfas in aquatic systems li et al 2021 munoz et al 2018 simonnet laprade et al 2019 in addition the microbial diversity and sensitivity of biofilms are commonly used to assess the adverse effects of toxic substances on aquatic ecosystem tlili et al 2020 given that pfas are ubiquitous in aquatic environments biofilms are supposed to be exposed to elevated concentrations of pfas nevertheless the interactions between them have not yet been studied systematically this study aimed to investigate the possibility of using biofilm as potential integrative sample to assess the contamination levels and profiles as well as the spatial distribution of pfas in surface water surface water biofilm phytoplankton and freshwater snail cipangopaludina chinensis gastropoda which is an invertebrate grazing on biofilm were collected from taihu lake china where previous studies indicated that contamination of pfas is prevalent yu et al 2022 the trophic transfer of pfas from biofilm to snails was evaluated to further understand the importance of biofilm in pfas transfer among the ecosystem in addition the impacts of pfas contamination on aquatic ecosystem were evaluated by assessing a variety of properties such as the content of eps and chlorophyll microbial diversities of the biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents pfcas c6 c13 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas c4 c6 c8 perfluorooctane

table s3 2 5 eps total chlorophyll and community compositions of biofilms to evaluate the content of eps in the biofilms eps was extracted using an alkali extraction protocol based on previous report zhu et al 2019 the total eps concentration is the summed concentrations of protein polysaccharose and humic acid the protein and humic acid contents were determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa and commercial humic acid ha sigma aldrich for calibration respectively frolund et al 1995 the polysaccharide concentration was measured using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard frolund et al 1996 to evaluate the community compositions and diversities of biofilms high throughput sequencing of the 16s rdna 18s rdna and internal transcribed spacer 1 its1

qiime software version 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 2 6 data analysis and statistics bioaccumulation factors bafs of pfas in biofilms and phytoplankton were calculated as per eq 1 and biomagnification factors bmfs from biofilms to snails were calculated as per eq 2 1 baf cbiota 1000 cwater where cbiota is the concentration of a specific pfas in organisms biofilms and phytoplankton ng g wet weight while cwater is the corresponding concentration in water ng l 2 bmf cs cb cs is the pfas concentration in snails ng g wet weight cb is the pfas concentration in biofilm ng g wet weight principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed on the basis of the binary jaccard distance to evaluate the variation of the community structure of biofilms among different samples gower 1966 spearman s rank

purpose of statistical analysis a value equivalent to half of the mdls was designated for compounds lower than the mdls 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas in the surface water of taihu lake sixteen pfas were analyzed in the samples except perfluorotridecanoic acid pftrda 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pfesa other 13 pfas were detected in all the water samples the total concentration of the pfas pfas in the surface water ranged from 57 3 to 351 ng l table s4 which was comparable to the results of a previous study in which the samples were collected in 2015 chen et al 2018 the levels of pfoa pfos and perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa mean 25 4 9 69 11 7 ng l respectively table s4 were similar to those reported in taihu lake in 2009 2015 24 9 33 2 9 26 20 3 11 4 21 2 ng l respectively chen et al 2018 yu et al 2022 these suggested that the concentrations of pfas in taihu lake were relatively constant in recent years pfoa was the predominant homolog with a contribution of 28 4 4 1 to the pfas followed by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs 18 7 ng l 21 6 9 3 and pfhxa 13 0 4 0 fig 1 a the concentrations of the short chained pfas were much higher than the long chained ones which might partly be due to their higher solubility as compared to the longer counterparts c 7 zhao et al 2012 another reason might be that the production volume of short chained pfas which are replacing the longer ones is gradually increasing fang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 as the substitutes of pfos 6 2 fts mean 1 31 ng l and 6 2 cl pfesa 1 84 ng l were detected in all the water samples with contributions of 1 63 2 00 and 2 05 1 15 to the pfas 6 2 fts is used in certain types of industrial detergents and surfactants field and seow 2017 and is also a major transformation product related to 6 2 fluorotelomer precursors present in aqueous film forming foams afffs harding marjanovic et al 2015 mumtaz et al 2019 although 6 2 cl pfesa the major component of f 53b is only produced in china and used as a mist suppressant in the chrome plating industry wang et al 2013 it was frequently detected in some other countries gebbink et al 2016 pan et al 2018 however it was rarely reported in taihu lake before the significantly positive correlations between the unregulated pfas 6 2 cl pfesa 8 2 cl pfesa and pfos p 0 01 table s5 suggested their common sources and or similar environmental behaviors the results indicated that the application of these unregulated pfas is common and prevalent in the areas surrounding the lake fig 1b shows the spatial distribution of pfas in the lake water the highest level of pfas appeared at t6 351 ng l in the north of meiliang bay which was in line with the result of previous studies ma et al 2018 yu et al 2022 the pfas in the whole meiliang bay t4 t9 was much higher than other areas of taihu lake fig s1 meiliang bay is close to wuxi city where there are many manufacturers for textile plastic and electronics electroplating and semiconductor industries zhang et al 2010 besides an international airport is located about 20 km east of the meiliang bay where the afffs a potential source of pfas are supposed to be used for fire equipment testing and firefighter training chen et al 2020 mumtaz et al 2019 thus the higher pfas concentration in the northern part of taihu lake is likely attributed to the intensive industrial activities the international airport and other urban influences of wuxi yu et al 2022 3 2 bioaccumulation of pfas in phytoplankton and biofilm the pfas in phytoplankton ranged from 0 872 to 13 7 ng g ww wet weight fig s2 and table s6 there was no significantly linear correlation between the pfas in the phytoplankton and water p 0 05 as regards the biofilm samples the target pfas were detected in all the biofilm samples except 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pfesa with a detection frequency of 73 and 92 respectively the pfas in the biofilms ranging from 1 96 to 20 1 ng g ww fig s3a and table s7 was distinctly higher than in phytoplankton p 0 01 which was in line with a previous field study penland et al 2020 the profiles of pfas in the biofilms were quite different from the surface water pfos mean 1 77 ng g ww perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna 1 74 ng g ww and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda 1 51 ng g ww were predominant with a contribution of 18 3 5 4 17 0 7 2 14 7 4 4 respectively fig s3b and table s8 the contributions of pfoa 14 7 6 9 and pfbs 1 6 1 5 were much lower while the contributions of pfos and long chain pfcas c8 13 63 0 10 2 were much higher in the biofilms table s8 this was in line with a previous study on the distribution of pfas in biota samples from taihu lake fang et al 2014 the log baf values of the long chain pfas including pfos and c8 13pfcas in biofilm were significantly higher than that in phytoplankton p 0 05 while those of short chained were the opposite pfbs perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs and perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa table s9 this suggested that biofilm displayed much higher bioaccumulation potential to long chained pfas than phytoplankton leading to the higher level of pfas in biofilm than algae fig 2 a and b show that there were strong correlations between log baf in biofilm and log k ow estimated by the cosmotherm model table s10 for both pfcas r 2 0 98 p 0 01 and pfsas fts and cl pfesa were included r 2 0 84 p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic interaction played an important role in the bioaccumulation of pfas in biofilm li et al 2021 pi et al 2017 different from phytoplankton there were significant linear relationships between the pfas long chain pfas including pfos pfoa perfluorononanoic acid pfna pfda pfuna 6 2 fts and 8 2 cl pesea in biofilms and water p 0 01 figs 2c and s4 this suggested effective bioaccumulation of biofilm to dissolved pfas in water under the protection of eps biofilms colonize on the submerged solid surfaces steadily and integrate contaminants over longer periods of time however phytoplankton usually floats on water surface and mobilizes frequently with water flow which may affect the equilibrium of pfas in phytoplankton and water this may partly explain the lack of correlation between pfas in phytoplankton and in water thus biofilm is more suitable than phytoplankton for characterizing the contamination of pfas in surface water although phytoplankton also plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems besides the substances sorbed of biofilm include both absorption in the water and adsorption on the eps and biofilm cells flemming et al 2016 the abundant functional groups such as amine carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in eps of biofilm provide many sorption sites for pfas li et al 2021 vu and wu 2020 there are a number of proteins in eps that could bind with pfas strongly fig s7b martin et al 2003 li et al 2021 also reported that sorption on eps made an important contribution to the bioaccumulation of pfas in biofilms yan et al 2021 revealed the crucial roles of eps proteins in the adsorption of pfoa specifically the aromatic and amide groups of proteins may interact with the c f chains and carboxylic head of pfoa via hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction respectively the eps content of biofilm is much higher than phytoplankton which might be one of the reasons accounting for the higher accumulation of pfas in biofilm than phytoplankton the overall results suggested that biofilm was not only an effective integrative monitoring tool for traditional organic pollutants and heavy metals hobbs et al 2019 mahler et al 2020 but also useful in indicating the contamination characteristic of pfas in aquatic environment 3 3 trophic transfer of pfas from biofilm to snails freshwater snail generally feeds on biofilm by scraping them on solid surfaces friesen et al 2017 the pfas concentrations in snails are shown in table s11 significant linear relationships were observed for the pfas p 0 01 fig 3 a pfos pfda pfuna and 6 2 cl pfesa p 0 05 fig s5 between the snails and biofilms but these correlations were absent between the snails and water p 0 05 these results magnified that diet was a dominant exposure route for snails to accumulate pfas biomagnification factor bmf is usually used to describe the biomagnification behavior between a predator and its prey gao et al 2020 the bmfs were in the range from 3 09 2 03 8 2 fts to 17 8 10 2 pfna fig 3b all greater than one suggesting distinct biomagnification of pfas from biofilm to snails as shown in figs 3b and s6 the bmfs of pfcas and pfsas showed a general trend of first rise and then decline with the carbon chain length increasing an exception is the bmf of pfhxs was higher than that of pfos similar to our study munoz et al 2017 reported that the trophic magnification factors tmfs of c8 c14 pfcas decreased with the increasing chain length and that of pfhxs was higher than pfos in an estuarine food web gao et al 2020 also observed higher bmf of pfhxs than pfos in the pair of predator neogastropoda and prey archaeogastropoda the decrease of bmfs for long chained pfas might be related to their lower bioavailability when transferring from biofilm to snail the variabilities of bmfs observed for pfos pfosa 6 2 fts and 6 2 cl pfesa which all have eight carbon chain length might be due to their different substitutional and functional groups it is interesting that the short chain pfas including pfbs mean bmf 8 32 pfhxs 16 1 pfhxa 5 55 and pfhpa 5 81 also displayed biomagnification from biofilm to snails as stated above the concentrations of these short chain pfas in water were much higher than the long chain ones besides preying on biofilms the snails might also absorb pfas from water thus the pfas accumulated in the snails also included that derived from absorption from water consequently the bmfs of the short chain pfas might be overestimated trophic transfer behaviors of pfas were investigated in complex food webs previously in which biofilm and invertebrates were seldom included and trophic magnification was only observed for long chain pfas fang et al 2014 loi et al 2011 however some field investigations including benthic invertebrates observed the biomagnification of short chain pfas such as pfbs in mollusks tmf 1 30 penland et al 2020 and pfhxs in benthic food web tmf 4 3 munoz et al 2017 higher levels of short chain pfas in invertebrates than fish were reported in previous studies naile et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 which might be due to that fish were more effective in eliminating short chain pfas than invertebrates simmonet laprade et al 2019 6 2 fts was considered as unlikely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organism because of the effective elimination in high trophic level fish hoke et al 2015 however it exhibited very high bmf 17 1 7 2 in this study which was in accordance with its considerable concentrations in marine invertebrates langberg et al 2019 this suggested that snail and other invertebrates might have lower efficiency in metabolizing and or excreting pfas miranda et al 2021 table s12 shows the variabilities of pfas biomagnification across various trophic web structures worldwide all these results suggest that the characteristics of the food webs would influence the trophic transfer of pfas miranda et al 2022 munoz et al 2017 the results further suggested that biofilm and snail played vital roles in transferring pfas in food webs and more studies are needed to get further insight into the variability of bmfs tmfs 3 4 responses of biofilms to pfas exposure biofilm displays versatile responses to various pollutants including the community structure function and production of eps bonet et al 2013 tang et al 2017 in this study eps content total chlorophyll content community composition and diversity of biofilms were selected as representative indicators to evaluate the impacts of pfas on biofilms 3 4 1 changes in eps content and total chlorophyll content the eps content increased rapidly with the increase of pfas in water and peaked at pfas of 70 5 ng l then decreased slowly and finally tended to be stable fig s7a a number of previous studies have reported that microorganisms in biofilms developed a mechanism to resist environmental pressure and maintained normal metabolic activities by increasing eps production flemming and wingender 2010 tang et al 2017 the increase of eps content suggested that the exposure of pfas induced pressures to the microorganisms in biofilms which responded to generate more eps to maintain normal activities as the concentration of pfas increased over 70 5 ng l the eps content decreased and then remained constant at a stable level implying that the local biofilms were acclimated and got used to the relatively high concentrations of pfas it is worth mentioning that the proportion of extracellular proteins in eps displayed a significantly linear relationship with the concentration of pfas in water r 2 0 42 p 0 01 fig s7b but not with pfas in biofilm p 0 05 this suggested that the pfas external exposure or another co correlated confounding factor promoted the production of extracellular proteins which was in line with the responses of biofilms to other kinds of contaminants stewart et al 2015 tang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 besides pfas biofilms were also exposed to other xenobiotics in water which might also affect the excretion of extracellular proteins but our results suggested that pfas might be one of the important environmental stimuli studies under controlled conditions should be performed to further test this hypothesis fig s7c illustrates that there was a distinct relationship between the total chlorophyll content and the pfas in biofilms which was similar to the relationship between the eps content and pfas in water however there was no correlation between the total chlorophyll content and the pfas in water eps located outside of the biofilms might serve as the first guard to protect the microorganisms comparatively algae are inside the biofilms and protected by eps and their responses were relevant to the gradual accumulation of pfas in the biofilms thus algal chlorophyll could be used as a biomarker to indicate the pfas internal exposure in biofilms 3 4 2 community compositions and diversity of biofilms the response differences of community compositions were analyzed in three biofilm samples with relatively higher pfas t17 t11 t13 and three with relatively lower pfas r9 t16 r7 the details for the selection of these samples are described in si the pcoa results showed significant differences in the community compositions among the two groups fig s8 dramatically different phylum level community compositions were also observed fig s9 and table 13 these results suggested that biofilm microorganisms were sensitive to pfas exposure biofilm is exposed to complex environments and the community compositions may be affected by many factors gessner et al 2016 it is reported that water chemistry conditions such as total nitrogen total phosphorus dissolved oxygen total organic carbon could affect the bacterial communities in taihu lake chang et al 2020 both t11 and t13 had high pfas in water and they happened to be geographically close to each other coincidentally their community compositions were also similar fig s8 however although t17 and t16 were also geographically close t17 had high level while t16 had low level of pfas and their community compositions were greatly different the distinct difference between them suggested that pfas exposure was an important factor affecting the biofilm community compositions regarding alpha diversity shannon simpson and chao1 indices fig s10 and table s14 exposure to higher concentrations of pfas had a significantly negative effect on the diversity of fungal community in biofilms fig s10a but not on bacterial diversity fig s10b the shannon and simpson indexes are affected by the richness and evenness of the community respectively for the fungal community the shannon index showed a greater decline than the simpson one indicating that high levels of exposure to pfas induced a more adverse effect on the richness of fungal community in biofilms while having a lighter influence on the evenness of community in contrast the eukaryotic diversity increased at higher pfas fig s10c that could be due to the adaptation of some microorganisms such as phylum intramacronucleata fig s9c at higher pfas resulting in a relative increase of community richness and the diversity 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate that biofilms could effectively accumulate pfas and could well characterize the pfas levels profiles spatial trend in a water body and this is the first report of f 53b in periphytic biofilm biofilm could act as a potential integrative sample in which the pfas concentrations are more representative than grab samples the special equipment deployment and maintenance which are important for commercial passive samplers are not required for biofilms in addition the levels of eps extracellular protein algal chlorophyll and the community diversity of the biofilms responded sensitively to pfas which act as a potentially important environmental stimulus all these suggest that biofilm could be a relevant indicator to characterize the contamination of pfas in water and the potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
