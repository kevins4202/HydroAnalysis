15305,nowadays metal free persulfate based advanced oxidation processes aops have been intensively investigated however the catalysts are often too complex to fully consider their application potential conventional aops usually suffer from severe interference in real water matrix thus selective oxidation is practically and scientifically challenging as it could avoid unnecessary inputs of energy and possible secondary pollutants in this study a remarkably synergistic effect was achieved when conventional amorphous boron peroxymonosulfate boron pms 0 67 10 2 min 1 system was combined with electrolysis e boron pms 1 54 10 2 min 1 to degrade sulfamethoxazole smx evidenced by selectively quenching tests with kinetic evaluation electron paramagnetic resonance epr solvent exchange experiment and electrochemical analysis the dominated reactive oxygen species in e boron pms system tended to be 1o2 instead of the oh and so 4 mechanistic study unveiled that 1o2 was generated via accelerated pms self decomposition triggered by interface alkalization and hydroxyl radicals transfer at the cathode interface 1o2 is considered to be selective to the electron rich organic compounds thus e boron pms system was superior to conventional radical dominated system boron pms for smx removal in the co presence of common inorganic anions showing the great merits of selective oxidation in nonradical system these findings provided new insights into effective and selective oxidation of smx via e boron pms system which shed new light on the development of nonradical system graphical

introduction in recent decades the challenge for environmental remediation has been gradually shifted to the removal of contaminants with emerging concerns bourgin et al 2018 seibert et al 2020 with a recent surge in scientific publication persulfate based advanced oxidation processes aops are rapidly progressing toward a mature research topic reflecting the optimism currently prevailing in academic research feng et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical oh and so 4 have been long recognized as the dominant species in persulfate based aops zong et al 2020 conventional reactive radicals in aops with rather limited selectivity if any would inevitably be consumed by the coexisting ions that negatively affect target pollutants removal in real water matrix li et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 therefore the effective destruction of target pollutants would require intensive input of regents and energy which notably increases treatment costs over oxidation may also result in secondary pollution and elevates environmental risks sun et al 2022 nonradical pathways such as coordination mediated intramolecular electron transfer interfacial electron transfer and nonradical species production duan et al 2018 xu et al 2015 ye et al 2017 have been demonstrated to exhibit highly selective oxidation among nonradical dominated processes singlet oxygen 1o2 a high energy form of oxygen has been considered as the most probably pathway for pollutant oxidation in some past researches cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 1o2 may add to the c c bond through 1 2 addition ene reaction or 1 4 cycloaddition analogous to diels alder reaction barrios et al 2021 li et al 2020 which is sensitive to electron rich c n and s sites and therefore more selective for organic pollutants oxidation duan et al 2018 herein selectivity was considered to be selective preferential oxidation of target compounds with the interference of complicated composition in aqueous system yang et al 2021 both metal and metal free activator of persulfate aops have been demonstrated to exhibit nonradical dominated oxidation processes du et al 2016 gao et al 2019 li et al 2017 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2016 yang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 metal free persulfate based aops have been intensively investigated due to their elemental abundance high efficiency and environmental friendliness chen et al 2018 addressing the demerits of metal persulfate aops including toxicity scarcity poor stability high cost and potential secondary contamination the current researches on metal free catalytic systems mostly focus on carbon based catalysis carbon based catalysts mainly involve nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes which can efficiently degrade organic compounds by generating 1o2 at the defects of carbon nanotubes cheng et al 2019 2017 li et al 2017 however carbon based activated persulfate based aops researches often involve overly complex and highly toxic catalyst materials without careful consideration of their application potential hodges et al 2018 besides the high energy consumption and extensive pollution of the preparation process defeats the original purpose of using metal free catalysts to activate persulfate in an environmental friendly manner among metal free activators boron is a light metallic element located in the periodic table between beryllium metal element and carbon metal free element which possess 5 electrons in its ground state configuration of 1s22s22p1 the single electron in the 2p orbital endows boron with metallic properties to bind with most metal nonmetal elements it has been shown that unmodified amorphous boron could be applied as an activator to decompose pms to degrade organic pollutants duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b however since unmodified boron is a light metal element rather than a metal element it has relatively weak ability to directly activate persulfate compared to metal elements the present studies have focused on modifying boron to boron doped diamond bdd for activation which is too expensive for large scale application de oliveira silva et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge except bdd activation process very little attention has been paid to strengthening amorphous boron activated persulfate process to overcome the drawbacks to sum up boron could show great performance in persulfate activation though an efficient and clean enhancement method is required electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have attracted growing attention as a promising category of aops for enhancing degradation of antibiotics pharmaceuticals and other targeted pollutant an et al 2020 antonin et al 2015 matzek et al 2018 the main advantages of eaops can be cited as limited reagents input great potential for combination with other technologies seibert et al 2020 and accelerating the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor these advantages compensate well for the following shortcomings of advanced oxidation systems firstly many aops face significant barriers in purification of organic contaminants in water especially including requiring additional reagents yuan et al 2022 environmental footprint associated to their high energy consumption can be compensated by using renewable sources integration with other technologies is feasible and often enhances process efficiency feijoo et al 2022 secondly electric fields have been widely praised as a viable and green enhancement method for coupling with a variety of advanced oxidation processes ren et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 finally the electric field remarkably promoted electrochemical activation of persulfate to be specific accelerating the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor so as to produce more radical species electrochemically activated peroxymonosulfate pms tends to have better pollutant removal performance than peroxydisulfate pds due to the asymmetrical peroxide bond in pms with a partial positive charge govindan et al 2014 liu et al 2019 2018 in terms of electric field enhanced non metal activated persulfate system it is reported that the combination of pms and electrolysis with activated carbon fiber as the cathode offered high contaminants removal efficiency in which 1o2 played a major role ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019 the presence of 1o2 was also confirmed to contribute to small organics removal in a novel electro filtration activated pds system xu et al 2022 however the performance and mechanism of electric field enhanced amorphous boron activated peroxymonosulfate system have never been reported therefore it is worth investigating whether electric field can improve the performance of the boron activated pms process and change the oxidation pathway without introducing metal ions while maintaining low energy consumption herein we demonstrated the e boron pms system exhibited high efficiency and selective oxidation towards pollutions removal sulfamethoxazole a typical antibiotic was selected as the target contaminant the mechanism of the selective oxidation process was explored systematically quenching experiments kinetics calculation electrochemical analysis and epr were applied to determine reactive species and estimate the relative contribution of various process characterization of boron after reaction was applied to unveil electron transfer between boron and pms the superiority of pms in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes was investigated in comparison with other stable precursors i e e boron pds e boron h2o2 moreover the selectivity of e boron pms was evaluated in the co presence of various inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom 2 material and

identification of intermediate oxidants or reactive radical species from e boron pms system and boron pms system 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp or 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo were used as trapping agents 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergistic effects between electrolysis and boron pms after optimizing the conditions including pms dose boron dosage current density distance between electrodes and initial ph ph0 in fig 1 the following experimental conditions were chosen initial concentrations for boron and pms were determined as 0 2 g l and 0 5 mm respectively the ph0 is 4 3 unadjusted the distance between electrodes is 2 cm and current density is 40 a m 2 the removal efficiency of smx was 80 after 90 min under the tested reaction conditions as shown in the fig s1 the leaching concentration of boron at the end of the reaction was 2 2 mg l according to previous study ren et al 2020b the boron leaching concentration of limited value in drinking water is 2 4 mg l therefore it is considered that e boron pms system is a new technique to eliminate smx efficiently without inducing secondary contamination the removal ratio and reaction kinetics of the various processes in e boron pms were compared in fig 2 and fig s2 as shown in fig s2 inconspicuous removal of smx was observed with the sole presence of boron in addition the removal ratio by electrolysis was 25 3 and the removal efficiency by pms alone was 16 7 indicating that smx elimination by boron adsorption electrolysis and pms direct oxidation was negligible boron pms exhibited better performance with a removal efficiency of 46 2 which could be contributed to oh and so 4 duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b however the removal efficiency was insignificant the removal efficiency of smx was dramatically increased to 80 once electric field was introduced suggesting that more effective reactive oxygen species were generated as mentioned above the results indicated that a remarkable synergistic effect was achieved when traditional boron pms system was combined with electrolysis the reaction kinetics were shown in fig 2 removal ratio of smx in all processes followed pseudo first order kinetic model the k obs of electrolysis pms alone boron boron pms and e boron pms processes were 0 3 10 2 min 1 0 19 10 2 min 1 0 02 10 2 min 1 0 67 10 2 min 1 1 54 10 2 min 1 respectively it was clear that the k obs of e boron pms system was significantly higher than that of other systems and it was worth mentioning that the k obs of the e boron pms system was 2 3 times higher than that of conventional boron pms system 3 2 mechanism study 3 2 1 estimation of the relative contribution in e boron pms system the removal of smx can occur in three main pathways direct electron transfer pms oxidation reactive oxygen species ros oxidation including electrolysis alone reactive oxygen species and catalytic reactive oxygen species according to table s2 and table s3 song et al 2017 yang et al 2018b 2017a yao et al 2021 the reaction rate constants of 1 m methanol with all the ros were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those with 50 μm smx therefore we assumed that adding 1 m methanol into pms activated process could scavenge all available ros completely we calculated the contribution of each reaction according to k obs as shown in table 1 and fig 3 the relative contribution of direct electron transfer and pms oxidation alone were only 18 18 and 12 33 respectively ros oxidation accounted for the largest proportion 69 49 there are two kinds of ros oxidation in e boron pms system including electrolysis alone ros eq s1 and eq s2 and ros generated by the activation process liu et al 2019 ros produced by electrolysis alone accounted for only 0 69 while those from electrolysis boron activated pms accounted for 68 8 apparently ros generated by activation process played the dominant role in smx removal 3 2 2 determining the reactive species in general oh and so 4 played significant roles in conventional persulfate aops in order to investigate the involved ros in e boron pms system quenching experiments with tba meoh and ffa were conducted the apparent pseudo first order kinetic constants of various quenching agents with different kinds of reactive oxygen species are shown in table s3 song et al 2017 yao et al 2021 which suggest that meoh has strong inhibitory effect on oh and so 4 the inhibitory effect between tba and oh was much stronger than that between tba and so 4 thus the same dosage of meoh and tba 100 mm was employed to evaluate the contribution of oh and so 4 on smx degradation as illustrated in figs 4 a s3 s4 and table 2 we compared the effects of meoh and tba on e boron pms system and boron pms system in e boron pms system it was demonstrated that smx removal efficiency decreased from 80 to 68 in the present of tba while the k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 21 10 2 min 1 after reaction for 90 min the smx removal efficiency decreased from 80 to 61 2 in the present of meoh while the k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 0 96 10 2 min 1 these results indicated that both oh and so 4 were involved in e boron pms system but the contribution of both radicals was limited however in boron pms system fig s4 smx degradation efficiency in present of meoh dropped dramatically after reaction for 90 min the k obs dropped from 0 67 10 2 min 1 to 0 32 10 2 min 1 which indicated radicals played vital role in conventional boron pms system the epr spectra shown in fig 4 b indicated that much stronger peak of dmpo oh was observed in boron pms system than that of e boron pms system the faint dmpo so 4 signal might be due to the quick transformation from dmpo so 4 to dmpo oh ding et al 2020 liang et al 2021 the possible pathways of reactive radical species production were shown in eq 1 2 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 however as shown in fig 2 smx removal efficiency in e boron pms was much higher than that of boron pms thus from what has been mentioned above it was speculated that the reactive radical species might no longer play a dominant role in persistent organic pollutants degradation when electric field was introduced 1 hso 5 e o h so 4 or oh so 4 2 2 so 4 h 2 o hso 4 oh numerous studies claim that nonradical pathways such as 1o2 might dominate elimination of organic contaminations lou et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 due to its electrophilic property 1o2 has been widely used for the degradation of refractory contaminants al nu airat et al 2021 however the possibility of 1o2 being produced in e boron pms system was unclear yet thus we assumed that the dominant ros in e boron pms system was 1o2 in order to verify the assumption the presence of 1o2 was estimated using a probe compound such as ffa liang et al 2017 as show in table s2 the k obs of 1o2 with ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 was about 5 orders of magnitude higher than that with meoh 3 103 m 1 s 1 and tba 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 thus it is reasonable to choose ffa as 1o2 scavenger the k obs of ffa with 1o2 and oh were 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively song et al 2017 yao et al 2021 therefore we chose 6 mm ffa and 100 mm meoh to ensure the similar order for oh scavenge effect it is illustrated that 6 mm ffa had strong inhibition on smx removal the removal efficiency decreased sharply from 80 to 52 76 and k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 0 76 10 2 min 1 in figs s3 and 4 a in addition a strong three line epr spectrum signal with equal intensities was observed in e boron pms system in fig 4 c suggesting that 1o2 might be an important ros promoting smx degradation in addition to the above methods solvent exchange experiment h2o to d2o was applied to assess the contribution of 1o2 because 1o2 possesses a longer lifetime in d2o gao et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 d smx removal ratio was 94 after reaction for 90 min in d2o media compared to 80 in h2o and k obs in d2o 3 01 10 2 min 1 is twice as high as that in h2o 1 54 10 2 min 1 thus in conclusion it is 1o2 rather than those traditional reactive radical species that played a crucial role in the e boron pms system 3 2 3 mechanism it is reported that 1o2 forms via self decay of pms eq 3 however 1o2 production through uncatalyzed pms self decomposition is relatively inefficient zhou et al 2017 moreover superoxide radical production through a chain reaction of hydrogen peroxide production and then react with hydroxyl radicals yan et al 2017 oxygen activation huang et al 2018 and oh react with pms zhou et al 2015 all of the above reactions might involve the production of 1o2 eqs 4 8 3 hso 5 s o 5 2 hso 4 so 4 1 o 2 4 hso 5 h 2 o hso 4 h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 6 ho 2 h o 2 7 o 2 oh o h 1 o 2 8 o 2 energy 1 o 2 to further probe 1o2 generation path in the e boron pms system we firstly detected h2o2 production during the 90 min reaction fig s5 suggested that no obvious h2o2 was produced thus eqs 4 7 did not play significant role in 1o2 generation path continuous n2 was pumped into e boron pms system to exclusive oxygen gas dissolved or produced during the reaction as shown in fig s6 it is suggested that the contribution of eq 8 could be ignored it has been confirmed that 1o2 may be generated at both the anode and cathode but mainly produced at the cathode liu et al 2019 as eq 9 showed moreover alkaline conditions initiate nucleophilic attack of pms accelerating self decomposition of pms and the associated 1o2 production adam et al 2005 eq 10 the results in fig 4 e illustrated that when buffered with 20 mm phosphate smx removal efficiency in alkaline environment ph 9 was much faster than that in acid environment ph 3 or 5 which proved that oh contributed to 1o2 production the conclusion here was different from that in fig 1 in fig 1 we only controlled the initial ph no buffer was added to maintain the ph stability as shown in fig s7 the ph shifted to acidic in all systems and the ph difference was not very large during the reaction which was distinct from the that of the constant ph experimental group the last but not least the faradic reaction near the cathode would lead to interface alkalization xu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 favoring the production of 1o2 eq 11 9 hso 5 s o 5 2 oh e 2 so 4 h 2 o 1 o 2 10 hso 5 s o 5 2 o h 2 so 4 h 2 o 1 o 2 11 o 2 4 e 4 h 2 h 2 o the result of linear sweep voltammetry lsv was depicted in fig 2 f the current response decreased slightly with the addition of 0 5 mm pms indicating that electrolysis of water is inhibited by the addition of pms and there was an obvious signal peak after simultaneously induced pms boron and smx so it could be speculated that there was a significant electron transfer in the reaction it is reported that the ho oso3 in pms was likely to accept an electron from boron to generate reactive radical species in the meantime boron lost one electron to convert to boron oxide duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b fig 5 a c depicted xps surface scan for the detection of boron surface elements in raw boron boron after reaction in boron pms system and boron after reaction in e boron pms system the b1s peak could be deconvoluted into the following bands 187 3 ev 188 6 ev and 190 ev attributed to b b boride and b2o3 respectively duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b a new peak of b2o3 was observed after reaction suggesting that b2o3 was the oxidative product of boron during pms activation the lattice spacings of amorphous boron is 0 86 nm while the lattice spacings of b2o3 is 0 42 nm in tem images fig 5 d f clearly illustrated that boron presented some crystalline domains with different lattice spacings suggesting that raw boron exhibits crystal structure with clear lattice spacings while some new layers b2o3 occurred and covered on the surface of the boron after reaction the purple part in mapping fig 5 g i represented the distribution of oxygen elements and the purple part became darker and wider after the reaction representing the increase of oxygen elements on the boron surface after the reaction xps analysis mapping tem imagines and raman analysis fig s8 all depicted that more oxides were produced on the surface after the reaction of boron in the e boron pms system than in the boron pms system which indicated that the electrolysis process could accelerate electron transfer between boron and pms meanwhile the discrepancy of pms consumption under e boron pms system and boron pms system could also verify it as shown in fig s9 the consumption of pms was accelerated by electrolysis process to sum up the generation of 1o2 in the system came from the accelerated self decomposition behavior of pms triggered by the alkalinization of the faradic reaction near interface of cathode the combination of electron loss from pms near cathode with hydroxyl radicals also contributed to 1o2 generation the introduction of electric field accelerated the electron gaining efficiency of pms i e the electric field accelerated the electron transfer between boron pms and between cathode pms which promoted cleavage of pms into reactive oxygen species 3 3 superiority of e boron pms system 3 3 1 comparison with pds and h2o2 pms pds and h2o2 are all precursors of ros but they exhibit different properties due to their molecular structure pms is asymmetrical with a partial positive charge induced on the peroxide oxygen attached to the hydrogen while the peroxide bond in pds and h2o2 are symmetrical in charge distribution as shown in fig 6 the removal ratio of smx was 80 53 8 and 60 9 in e boron pms system e boron pds system and e boron h2o2 system respectively indicating e boron pms system exhibited highest degradation ratio non polar pms are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by various nucleophilic reagents compared with symmetric structures of pds 3os o o so3 and h2o2 hooh the asymmetric molecular structures of pms ho o so3 was more susceptible to cleavage in catalytic reactions leading to an imbalance in electron distribution through redox processes ren et al 2020a therefore pms was more likely to be activated to generate more ros for organic degradation 3 3 2 removal efficiency of other persistent organic pollutants the e boron pms system was applied for the degradation of a variety of persistent organic pollutants fig 7 a depicted the removal ratio of a variety of persistent organic pollutants in e boron pms system after reaction for 90 min while fig 7 b described the removal ratio in boron pms system after reaction the degradation ratio of smx sdz act cip and ttc in the e boron pms system were 78 67 3 91 7 60 34 and 99 4 after 90 min reaction which were much faster than those in boron pms system 46 24 57 12 88 2 16 5 89 2 respectively all these results confirmed that e boron pms process could effectively degrade various common antibiotics and the introduction of electric field should be responsible for the improved removal efficiency in conclusion the e boron pms system was an effective technology for common persistent organic pollutants degradation 3 4 selective oxidation competition reaction with coexisting substrates in real water matrix most conventional radical species lacking selectivity would inevitably be consumed by coexisting dissolved organic and common inorganic ions in this work selectivity was considered to be selective preferential oxidation of target compounds with the interference of complicated composition in aqueous system yang et al 2021 selective oxidation is practically and scientifically challenging as it could avoid unnecessary inputs of reagents and energy herein we investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions such as cl hco3 hpo4 2 as well as natural organic matters nom on reactive radical species dominated system boron pms and nonradical dominated system e boron pms in fig s10 s13 we explored the effects of different ions on the degradation efficiency of e boron pms system as shown in table s4 it was revealed that cl and nom slightly affected smx removal efficiency in which cl played a facilitating role while nom played an inhibiting role hco3 and hpo4 2 inhibited the degradation process the k obs moderately decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 02 10 2 min 1 and 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 09 10 2 min 1 respectively comparing the effects of the above ions on nonradical dominated process e boron pms and radical dominated process boron pms the results were shown in fig 8 it has been revealed chung et al 2016 soufan et al 2013 that during the anodic electrolysis cl in the solution would be oxidized to cl2 on the electrode surface and the reaction of cl2 with water would produce clo which could help to degrade organic matters on the other hand eqs 12 13 suggest that cl could react with oh and so 4 to form less oxidative species lee et al 2020 hence the present of cl slightly increased the activity of both processes fig 8 while the effect on reactive radical species dominated processes boron pms was more pronounced moreover as illustrated in fig 8 the inhibited oxidation by hco3 and hpo4 2 were due to the quenching effect on radicals shown in eqs 14 16 likewise all ions had stronger inhibitory effects on reactive radical species dominated processes boron pms nom might quench reactive radicals ribeiro et al 2019 but had little impact on 1o2 the low concentration of nom 0 5 mg l did not affect the smx degradation rate in e boron pms system while strong inhibition of smx degradation was observed in boron pms system 12 c l oh clo h 13 c l so 4 cl so 4 2 h 2 o 14 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 15 hco 3 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 h 16 hpo 4 2 oh hpo 4 o h 17 hpo 4 2 so 4 hpo 4 so 4 2 the same results were found in fig s14 e boron pms system was applied in ultrapure water tap water and surface water compared to the efficiency of smx removal in ultrapure water 80 the removal ratio in lake water matrix 67 8 and tap water matrix 80 3 were only slightly affected encouragingly as mentioned above e boron pms system exhibited a superiority resistance to the common substrates in aqueous system confirming the selective oxidation of nonradical process 4 conclusion in summary a remarkable synergistic effect was achieved when conventional boron pms system was combined with electrolysis process to be specific the removal efficiency of common antibiotics in low dosage system can be greatly enhanced under low current density compared to the boron pms system it was worth mentioning that the e boron pms system has proven to be a nonradical dominated process 1o2 was originated from the accelerated self decomposition behavior of pms near the cathode interface the introduction of electric field could accelerate the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor so as to produce more ros more importantly improving efficiency of ros utilization is essential for enhanced eaops performance in this study 1o2 could be selectively reacted with the target pollutants without being quenched by inorganic ions which overcame the drawback of non selective oxidation of conventional radical dominated process although it is still far from the ideality to fulfill selectivity this study provided a new insight into developing selective oxidation technology for water decontamination particularly toward application in real scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

recent surge in scientific publication persulfate based advanced oxidation processes aops are rapidly progressing toward a mature research topic reflecting the optimism currently prevailing in academic research feng et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical oh and so 4 have been long recognized as the dominant species in persulfate based aops zong et al 2020 conventional reactive radicals in aops with rather limited selectivity if any would inevitably be consumed by the coexisting ions that negatively affect target pollutants removal in real water matrix li et al 2021 miklos et al 2018 therefore the effective destruction of target pollutants would require intensive input of regents and energy which notably increases treatment costs over oxidation may also result in secondary pollution and elevates environmental risks sun et al 2022 nonradical pathways such as coordination mediated intramolecular electron transfer interfacial electron transfer and nonradical species production duan et al 2018 xu et al 2015 ye et al 2017 have been demonstrated to exhibit highly selective oxidation among nonradical dominated processes singlet oxygen 1o2 a high energy form of oxygen has been considered as the most probably pathway for pollutant oxidation in some past researches cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 1o2 may add to the c c bond through 1 2 addition ene reaction or 1 4 cycloaddition analogous to diels alder reaction barrios et al 2021 li et al 2020 which is sensitive to electron rich c n and s sites and therefore more selective for organic pollutants oxidation duan et al 2018 herein selectivity was considered to be selective preferential oxidation of target compounds with the interference of complicated composition in aqueous system yang et al 2021 both metal and metal free activator of persulfate aops have been demonstrated to exhibit nonradical dominated oxidation processes du et al 2016 gao et al 2019 li et al 2017 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2016 yang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 metal free persulfate based aops have been intensively investigated due to their elemental abundance high efficiency and environmental friendliness chen et al 2018 addressing the demerits of metal persulfate aops including toxicity scarcity poor stability high cost and potential secondary contamination the current researches on metal free catalytic systems mostly focus on carbon based catalysis carbon based catalysts mainly involve nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes which can efficiently degrade organic compounds by generating 1o2 at the defects of carbon nanotubes cheng et al 2019 2017 li et al 2017 however carbon based activated persulfate based aops researches often involve overly complex and highly toxic catalyst materials without careful consideration of their application potential hodges et al 2018 besides the high energy consumption and extensive pollution of the preparation process defeats the original purpose of using metal free catalysts to activate persulfate in an environmental friendly manner among metal free activators boron is a light metallic element located in the periodic table between beryllium metal element and carbon metal free element which possess 5 electrons in its ground state configuration of 1s22s22p1 the single electron in the 2p orbital endows boron with metallic properties to bind with most metal nonmetal elements it has been shown that unmodified amorphous boron could be applied as an activator to decompose pms to degrade organic pollutants duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b however since unmodified boron is a light metal element rather than a metal element it has relatively weak ability to directly activate persulfate compared to metal elements the present studies have focused on modifying boron to boron doped diamond bdd for activation which is too expensive for large scale application de oliveira silva et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge except bdd activation process very little attention has been paid to strengthening amorphous boron activated persulfate process to overcome the drawbacks to sum up boron could show great performance in persulfate activation though an efficient and clean enhancement method is required electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have attracted growing attention as a promising category of aops for enhancing degradation of antibiotics pharmaceuticals and other targeted pollutant an et al 2020 antonin et al 2015 matzek et al 2018 the main advantages of eaops can be cited as limited reagents input great potential for combination with other technologies seibert et al 2020 and accelerating the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor these advantages compensate well for the following shortcomings of advanced oxidation systems firstly many aops face significant barriers in purification of organic contaminants in water especially including requiring additional reagents yuan et al 2022 environmental footprint associated to their high energy consumption can be compensated by using renewable sources integration with other technologies is feasible and often enhances process efficiency feijoo et al 2022 secondly electric fields have been widely praised as a viable and green enhancement method for coupling with a variety of advanced oxidation processes ren et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 finally the electric field remarkably promoted electrochemical activation of persulfate to be specific accelerating the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor so as to produce more radical species electrochemically activated peroxymonosulfate pms tends to have better pollutant removal performance than peroxydisulfate pds due to the asymmetrical peroxide bond in pms with a partial positive charge govindan et al 2014 liu et al 2019 2018 in terms of electric field enhanced non metal activated persulfate system it is reported that the combination of pms and electrolysis with activated carbon fiber as the cathode offered high contaminants removal efficiency in which 1o2 played a major role ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019 the presence of 1o2 was also confirmed to contribute to small organics removal in a novel electro filtration activated pds system xu et al 2022 however the performance and mechanism of electric field enhanced amorphous boron activated peroxymonosulfate system have never been reported therefore it is worth investigating whether electric field can improve the performance of the boron activated pms process and change the oxidation pathway without introducing metal ions while maintaining low energy consumption herein we demonstrated the e boron pms system exhibited high efficiency and selective oxidation towards pollutions removal sulfamethoxazole a typical antibiotic was selected as the target contaminant the mechanism of the selective oxidation process was explored systematically quenching experiments kinetics calculation electrochemical analysis and epr were applied to determine reactive species and estimate the relative contribution of various process characterization of boron after reaction was applied to unveil electron transfer between boron and pms the superiority of pms in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes was investigated in comparison with other stable precursors i e e boron pds e boron h2o2 moreover the selectivity of e boron pms was evaluated in the co presence of various inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom 2 material and

as trapping agents 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergistic effects between electrolysis and boron pms after optimizing the conditions including pms dose boron dosage current density distance between electrodes and initial ph ph0 in fig 1 the following experimental conditions were chosen initial concentrations for boron and pms were determined as 0 2 g l and 0 5 mm respectively the ph0 is 4 3 unadjusted the distance between electrodes is 2 cm and current density is 40 a m 2 the removal efficiency of smx was 80 after 90 min under the tested reaction conditions as shown in the fig s1 the leaching concentration of boron at the end of the reaction was 2 2 mg l according to previous study ren et al 2020b the boron leaching concentration of limited value in drinking water is 2 4 mg l therefore it is considered that e boron pms system is a new technique to eliminate smx efficiently without inducing secondary contamination the removal ratio and reaction kinetics of the various processes in e boron pms were compared in fig 2 and fig s2 as shown in fig s2 inconspicuous removal of smx was observed with the sole presence of boron in addition the removal ratio by electrolysis was 25 3 and the removal efficiency by pms alone was 16 7 indicating that smx elimination by boron adsorption electrolysis and pms direct oxidation was negligible boron pms exhibited better performance with a removal efficiency of 46 2 which could be contributed to oh and so 4 duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b however the removal efficiency was insignificant the removal efficiency of smx was dramatically increased to 80 once electric field was introduced suggesting that more effective reactive oxygen species were generated as mentioned above the results indicated that a remarkable synergistic effect was achieved when traditional boron pms system was combined with electrolysis the reaction kinetics were shown in fig 2 removal ratio of smx in all processes followed pseudo first order kinetic model the k obs of electrolysis pms alone boron boron pms and e boron pms processes were 0 3 10 2 min 1 0 19 10 2 min 1 0 02 10 2 min 1 0 67 10 2 min 1 1 54 10 2 min 1 respectively it was clear that the k obs of e boron pms system was significantly higher than that of other systems and it was worth mentioning that the k obs of the e boron pms system was 2 3 times higher than that of conventional boron pms system 3 2 mechanism study 3 2 1 estimation of the relative contribution in e boron pms system the removal of smx can occur in three main pathways direct electron transfer pms oxidation reactive oxygen species ros oxidation including electrolysis alone reactive oxygen species and catalytic reactive oxygen species according to table s2 and table s3 song et al 2017 yang et al 2018b 2017a yao et al 2021 the reaction rate constants of 1 m methanol with all the ros were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those with 50 μm smx therefore we assumed that adding 1 m methanol into pms activated process could scavenge all available ros completely we calculated the contribution of each reaction according to k obs as shown in table 1 and fig 3 the relative contribution of direct electron transfer and pms oxidation alone were only 18 18 and 12 33 respectively ros oxidation accounted for the largest proportion 69 49 there are two kinds of ros oxidation in e boron pms system including electrolysis alone ros eq s1 and eq s2 and ros generated by the activation process liu et al 2019 ros produced by electrolysis alone accounted for only 0 69 while those from electrolysis boron activated pms accounted for 68 8 apparently ros generated by activation process played the dominant role in smx removal 3 2 2 determining the reactive species in general oh and so 4 played significant roles in conventional persulfate aops in order to investigate the involved ros in e boron pms system quenching experiments with tba meoh and ffa were conducted the apparent pseudo first order kinetic constants of various quenching agents with different kinds of reactive oxygen species are shown in table s3 song et al 2017 yao et al 2021 which suggest that meoh has strong inhibitory effect on oh and so 4 the inhibitory effect between tba and oh was much stronger than that between tba and so 4 thus the same dosage of meoh and tba 100 mm was employed to evaluate the contribution of oh and so 4 on smx degradation as illustrated in figs 4 a s3 s4 and table 2 we compared the effects of meoh and tba on e boron pms system and boron pms system in e boron pms system it was demonstrated that smx removal efficiency decreased from 80 to 68 in the present of tba while the k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 21 10 2 min 1 after reaction for 90 min the smx removal efficiency decreased from 80 to 61 2 in the present of meoh while the k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 0 96 10 2 min 1 these results indicated that both oh and so 4 were involved in e boron pms system but the contribution of both radicals was limited however in boron pms system fig s4 smx degradation efficiency in present of meoh dropped dramatically after reaction for 90 min the k obs dropped from 0 67 10 2 min 1 to 0 32 10 2 min 1 which indicated radicals played vital role in conventional boron pms system the epr spectra shown in fig 4 b indicated that much stronger peak of dmpo oh was observed in boron pms system than that of e boron pms system the faint dmpo so 4 signal might be due to the quick transformation from dmpo so 4 to dmpo oh ding et al 2020 liang et al 2021 the possible pathways of reactive radical species production were shown in eq 1 2 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 however as shown in fig 2 smx removal efficiency in e boron pms was much higher than that of boron pms thus from what has been mentioned above it was speculated that the reactive radical species might no longer play a dominant role in persistent organic pollutants degradation when electric field was introduced 1 hso 5 e o h so 4 or oh so 4 2 2 so 4 h 2 o hso 4 oh numerous studies claim that nonradical pathways such as 1o2 might dominate elimination of organic contaminations lou et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 due to its electrophilic property 1o2 has been widely used for the degradation of refractory contaminants al nu airat et al 2021 however the possibility of 1o2 being produced in e boron pms system was unclear yet thus we assumed that the dominant ros in e boron pms system was 1o2 in order to verify the assumption the presence of 1o2 was estimated using a probe compound such as ffa liang et al 2017 as show in table s2 the k obs of 1o2 with ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 was about 5 orders of magnitude higher than that with meoh 3 103 m 1 s 1 and tba 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 thus it is reasonable to choose ffa as 1o2 scavenger the k obs of ffa with 1o2 and oh were 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively song et al 2017 yao et al 2021 therefore we chose 6 mm ffa and 100 mm meoh to ensure the similar order for oh scavenge effect it is illustrated that 6 mm ffa had strong inhibition on smx removal the removal efficiency decreased sharply from 80 to 52 76 and k obs decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 0 76 10 2 min 1 in figs s3 and 4 a in addition a strong three line epr spectrum signal with equal intensities was observed in e boron pms system in fig 4 c suggesting that 1o2 might be an important ros promoting smx degradation in addition to the above methods solvent exchange experiment h2o to d2o was applied to assess the contribution of 1o2 because 1o2 possesses a longer lifetime in d2o gao et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 d smx removal ratio was 94 after reaction for 90 min in d2o media compared to 80 in h2o and k obs in d2o 3 01 10 2 min 1 is twice as high as that in h2o 1 54 10 2 min 1 thus in conclusion it is 1o2 rather than those traditional reactive radical species that played a crucial role in the e boron pms system 3 2 3 mechanism it is reported that 1o2 forms via self decay of pms eq 3 however 1o2 production through uncatalyzed pms self decomposition is relatively inefficient zhou et al 2017 moreover superoxide radical production through a chain reaction of hydrogen peroxide production and then react with hydroxyl radicals yan et al 2017 oxygen activation huang et al 2018 and oh react with pms zhou et al 2015 all of the above reactions might involve the production of 1o2 eqs 4 8 3 hso 5 s o 5 2 hso 4 so 4 1 o 2 4 hso 5 h 2 o hso 4 h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 6 ho 2 h o 2 7 o 2 oh o h 1 o 2 8 o 2 energy 1 o 2 to further probe 1o2 generation path in the e boron pms system we firstly detected h2o2 production during the 90 min reaction fig s5 suggested that no obvious h2o2 was produced thus eqs 4 7 did not play significant role in 1o2 generation path continuous n2 was pumped into e boron pms system to exclusive oxygen gas dissolved or produced during the reaction as shown in fig s6 it is suggested that the contribution of eq 8 could be ignored it has been confirmed that 1o2 may be generated at both the anode and cathode but mainly produced at the cathode liu et al 2019 as eq 9 showed moreover alkaline conditions initiate nucleophilic attack of pms accelerating self decomposition of pms and the associated 1o2 production adam et al 2005 eq 10 the results in fig 4 e illustrated that when buffered with 20 mm phosphate smx removal efficiency in alkaline environment ph 9 was much faster than that in acid environment ph 3 or 5 which proved that oh contributed to 1o2 production the conclusion here was different from that in fig 1 in fig 1 we only controlled the initial ph no buffer was added to maintain the ph stability as shown in fig s7 the ph shifted to acidic in all systems and the ph difference was not very large during the reaction which was distinct from the that of the constant ph experimental group the last but not least the faradic reaction near the cathode would lead to interface alkalization xu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 favoring the production of 1o2 eq 11 9 hso 5 s o 5 2 oh e 2 so 4 h 2 o 1 o 2 10 hso 5 s o 5 2 o h 2 so 4 h 2 o 1 o 2 11 o 2 4 e 4 h 2 h 2 o the result of linear sweep voltammetry lsv was depicted in fig 2 f the current response decreased slightly with the addition of 0 5 mm pms indicating that electrolysis of water is inhibited by the addition of pms and there was an obvious signal peak after simultaneously induced pms boron and smx so it could be speculated that there was a significant electron transfer in the reaction it is reported that the ho oso3 in pms was likely to accept an electron from boron to generate reactive radical species in the meantime boron lost one electron to convert to boron oxide duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b fig 5 a c depicted xps surface scan for the detection of boron surface elements in raw boron boron after reaction in boron pms system and boron after reaction in e boron pms system the b1s peak could be deconvoluted into the following bands 187 3 ev 188 6 ev and 190 ev attributed to b b boride and b2o3 respectively duan et al 2019 ren et al 2020b a new peak of b2o3 was observed after reaction suggesting that b2o3 was the oxidative product of boron during pms activation the lattice spacings of amorphous boron is 0 86 nm while the lattice spacings of b2o3 is 0 42 nm in tem images fig 5 d f clearly illustrated that boron presented some crystalline domains with different lattice spacings suggesting that raw boron exhibits crystal structure with clear lattice spacings while some new layers b2o3 occurred and covered on the surface of the boron after reaction the purple part in mapping fig 5 g i represented the distribution of oxygen elements and the purple part became darker and wider after the reaction representing the increase of oxygen elements on the boron surface after the reaction xps analysis mapping tem imagines and raman analysis fig s8 all depicted that more oxides were produced on the surface after the reaction of boron in the e boron pms system than in the boron pms system which indicated that the electrolysis process could accelerate electron transfer between boron and pms meanwhile the discrepancy of pms consumption under e boron pms system and boron pms system could also verify it as shown in fig s9 the consumption of pms was accelerated by electrolysis process to sum up the generation of 1o2 in the system came from the accelerated self decomposition behavior of pms triggered by the alkalinization of the faradic reaction near interface of cathode the combination of electron loss from pms near cathode with hydroxyl radicals also contributed to 1o2 generation the introduction of electric field accelerated the electron gaining efficiency of pms i e the electric field accelerated the electron transfer between boron pms and between cathode pms which promoted cleavage of pms into reactive oxygen species 3 3 superiority of e boron pms system 3 3 1 comparison with pds and h2o2 pms pds and h2o2 are all precursors of ros but they exhibit different properties due to their molecular structure pms is asymmetrical with a partial positive charge induced on the peroxide oxygen attached to the hydrogen while the peroxide bond in pds and h2o2 are symmetrical in charge distribution as shown in fig 6 the removal ratio of smx was 80 53 8 and 60 9 in e boron pms system e boron pds system and e boron h2o2 system respectively indicating e boron pms system exhibited highest degradation ratio non polar pms are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by various nucleophilic reagents compared with symmetric structures of pds 3os o o so3 and h2o2 hooh the asymmetric molecular structures of pms ho o so3 was more susceptible to cleavage in catalytic reactions leading to an imbalance in electron distribution through redox processes ren et al 2020a therefore pms was more likely to be activated to generate more ros for organic degradation 3 3 2 removal efficiency of other persistent organic pollutants the e boron pms system was applied for the degradation of a variety of persistent organic pollutants fig 7 a depicted the removal ratio of a variety of persistent organic pollutants in e boron pms system after reaction for 90 min while fig 7 b described the removal ratio in boron pms system after reaction the degradation ratio of smx sdz act cip and ttc in the e boron pms system were 78 67 3 91 7 60 34 and 99 4 after 90 min reaction which were much faster than those in boron pms system 46 24 57 12 88 2 16 5 89 2 respectively all these results confirmed that e boron pms process could effectively degrade various common antibiotics and the introduction of electric field should be responsible for the improved removal efficiency in conclusion the e boron pms system was an effective technology for common persistent organic pollutants degradation 3 4 selective oxidation competition reaction with coexisting substrates in real water matrix most conventional radical species lacking selectivity would inevitably be consumed by coexisting dissolved organic and common inorganic ions in this work selectivity was considered to be selective preferential oxidation of target compounds with the interference of complicated composition in aqueous system yang et al 2021 selective oxidation is practically and scientifically challenging as it could avoid unnecessary inputs of reagents and energy herein we investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions such as cl hco3 hpo4 2 as well as natural organic matters nom on reactive radical species dominated system boron pms and nonradical dominated system e boron pms in fig s10 s13 we explored the effects of different ions on the degradation efficiency of e boron pms system as shown in table s4 it was revealed that cl and nom slightly affected smx removal efficiency in which cl played a facilitating role while nom played an inhibiting role hco3 and hpo4 2 inhibited the degradation process the k obs moderately decreased from 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 02 10 2 min 1 and 1 54 10 2 min 1 to 1 09 10 2 min 1 respectively comparing the effects of the above ions on nonradical dominated process e boron pms and radical dominated process boron pms the results were shown in fig 8 it has been revealed chung et al 2016 soufan et al 2013 that during the anodic electrolysis cl in the solution would be oxidized to cl2 on the electrode surface and the reaction of cl2 with water would produce clo which could help to degrade organic matters on the other hand eqs 12 13 suggest that cl could react with oh and so 4 to form less oxidative species lee et al 2020 hence the present of cl slightly increased the activity of both processes fig 8 while the effect on reactive radical species dominated processes boron pms was more pronounced moreover as illustrated in fig 8 the inhibited oxidation by hco3 and hpo4 2 were due to the quenching effect on radicals shown in eqs 14 16 likewise all ions had stronger inhibitory effects on reactive radical species dominated processes boron pms nom might quench reactive radicals ribeiro et al 2019 but had little impact on 1o2 the low concentration of nom 0 5 mg l did not affect the smx degradation rate in e boron pms system while strong inhibition of smx degradation was observed in boron pms system 12 c l oh clo h 13 c l so 4 cl so 4 2 h 2 o 14 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 15 hco 3 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 h 16 hpo 4 2 oh hpo 4 o h 17 hpo 4 2 so 4 hpo 4 so 4 2 the same results were found in fig s14 e boron pms system was applied in ultrapure water tap water and surface water compared to the efficiency of smx removal in ultrapure water 80 the removal ratio in lake water matrix 67 8 and tap water matrix 80 3 were only slightly affected encouragingly as mentioned above e boron pms system exhibited a superiority resistance to the common substrates in aqueous system confirming the selective oxidation of nonradical process 4 conclusion in summary a remarkable synergistic effect was achieved when conventional boron pms system was combined with electrolysis process to be specific the removal efficiency of common antibiotics in low dosage system can be greatly enhanced under low current density compared to the boron pms system it was worth mentioning that the e boron pms system has proven to be a nonradical dominated process 1o2 was originated from the accelerated self decomposition behavior of pms near the cathode interface the introduction of electric field could accelerate the electron transfer between electron donor and acceptor so as to produce more ros more importantly improving efficiency of ros utilization is essential for enhanced eaops performance in this study 1o2 could be selectively reacted with the target pollutants without being quenched by inorganic ions which overcame the drawback of non selective oxidation of conventional radical dominated process although it is still far from the ideality to fulfill selectivity this study provided a new insight into developing selective oxidation technology for water decontamination particularly toward application in real

15306,phosphorus p harvesting from source separated urine to optimize the overall nutrient loop is one of the most appealing benefits and is a global research interest in wastewater management and treatment however current p precipitation is mainly oriented to struvite which is limited by the issues such as relatively low product purity and high cost of mg source distinguished from previous conventional struvite precipitation the strategy of precisely harvesting p from fresh human urine as high purity calcium phosphate was first proposed in this study this enhanced strategy can optimize p harvesting performance and product purity by simply regulating the consumption of calcium based materials via model simulation and experimental validation the thermodynamic model was constructed to probe the precipitation conversion mechanism and visually predict the component and yield for products under various operating conditions batch experiments were conducted to investigate p recovery performance as a function of initial mg2 concentration initial ph level as well as degree of urine hydrolysis moreover the alternative dosing scheme with different calcium salts and alkali was presented diversifying the options for efficient p recovery the results showed that from the perspective of acidic storage for fresh urine p recovery can be boosted along with eliminating urine hydrolysis in urine with an initial ph 2 0 p can be completely recovered and purity for calcium phosphate can be optimized to 100 within a ca p ratio range of 1 67 2 3 overall this work is of great significance for precisely and efficiently harvesting p from urine and provides an integrated strategy for p resource recovery from urine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fresh

et al 2014 molinos senante et al 2011 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation for p recovery from source separated urine is generally focused on and extensively operated since struvite is a phosphate mineral and a potential slow release fertilizer hao et al 2013 li et al 2019 however some drawbacks hamper the production and utilization of struvite one of the most challenging aspects is the inferior purity of the actual struvite exaction 30 50 due to the simultaneous crystallization of ca p and caco3 during the recovery process the production of p minerals with a high content of struvite from real wastewater is a difficult and costly process hao et al 2013 2008 from the practical application viewpoint struvite is not as superior to other p based compounds in terms of fertilizer application efficiency nor is it the exclusive form of raw materials favored by the fertilizer industry hao et al 2013 hence it is imperative to diversify the precipitation technologies based on other high purity p based products it is also of great significance to harvest p from urine as calcium phosphate for fertilization efficiency calcium phosphate products such as ca h2po4 2 h2o and cahpo4 2h2o were illustrated to be roughly equivalent to struvite in agriculture johnston and richards 2003 meyer et al 2018 however calcium salts as additive agents are highly accessible and economically affordable relative to magnesium salts in addition calcium phosphate is widely favored as it is the main component of phosphate rock cornel and schaum 2009 and it has diverse applications in manufacturing such as bioceramics lei et al 2019 song et al 2006 tervahauta et al 2014 pradhan et al 2017 used ca oh 2 to simultaneously recover n and p from hydrolyzed source separated urine while the p content of the products was less than 1 5 due to the coprecipitation of caco3 in the long term stabilization of fresh source separated urine by ca oh 2 randall et al 2016 obtained a product with a complex composition and low p proportion despite these studies applying calcium based materials to obtain p containing sediment products for source separated urine treatment the recovery of calcium phosphate was not regarded as a prime goal nor multiple factors were considered including chemical input product purity and economic efficiency to the best of our knowledge little information is available concerning the p reclaimed as a high purity calcium phosphate product from human urine hao et al 2013 the relevant recovery scheme has not yet been well established to address the aforementioned research gaps this study proposed a strategy for p harvesting as high purity calcium phosphate from fresh source separated urine achieving simultaneous nutrient recovery and high purity fertilizer production the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the effects of the composition and storage conditions for urine on the p harvesting process 2 to explore the conversion mechanism of precipitation in the recovery process by thermodynamic model and to validate the simulation by conducting equilibrium experiments and 3 to precisely control the purity and yield for calcium phosphate product by regulating the ca p dosing ratio in this study in view of the prospective application of source separated urine we advance the knowledge for better insights into enriching the means of p nutrient recovery as well as providing guidance for the exaction of high purity calcium phosphate from fresh urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals all chemical

antimony potassium tartrate hydrate c8h4k2o12sb2 h2o and ammonium molybdate para tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o2 4h2o were purchased from sinopharm reagent co ltd dissolution reagents including hclo4 and hno3 were also obtained from sinopharm reagent co ltd hydroxyapatite hap was applied by aladdin 2 2 synthetic urine solutions synthetic urine without organic complexes was employed for precipitation thermodynamics previous studies stated that organic agents such as citrate and oxalate have a negligible effect on precipitation simulation in urine xu et al 2015 udert et al 2003 ronteltap et al further pointed out that organic complexes showed no substantial effect on the solubility products and thus performed no quantitative role in struvite precipitation in urine ronteltap et al 2007 herein the effect of organic complexation on precipitation was neglected for the thermodynamic simulation in source separated urine the composition of real fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine samples is measured and presented in table s1 based on the composition of real urine the recipe for the synthetic urine is established and included in tables s2 s4 2 3 batch experiments all the experiments were conducted at 20 200 ml of synthetic urine was added to a 250 ml flask and magnetically stirred at an appropriate rate then ca based material was introduced to the solution based on the set value of ca p ratio after the reaction proceeded for 6 h the equilibrium ph level was determined the supernatant was sampled for 2 ml and filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes to measure the residual phosphate concentration the precipitate products were collected by freeze drying vacuum freeze dryer scientz 10n for 24 h and further analyzed for its composition p k mg ca the optimal reaction time was determined by tracking the variations in the p concentration and ph level over time during the precipitation experiments and the speciation of calcium phosphate at precipitation equilibrium was investigated additionally the p harvesting behaviors from synthetic fresh urine with various initial mg2 levels 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l were studied to investigate the effect of the initial ph level of synthetic urine on p harvesting the initial ph values were adjusted to 2 4 and 6 5 by 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions to explore the effect of the degree of hydrolysis dh of urine on p recovery using calcium based materials the dhs for synthetic urine were set as 0 5 15 30 60 and 100 details can be seen in text s1 and table s4 moreover an alternative strategy for p harvesting at a constant ca p dosing ratio was proposed the experimental details are presented in text s1 and table s5 s9 nh4 n ammonium n was determined via nessler s reagent colorimetric method the residual phosphate concentration was measured using a uv 1780 spectrophotometer shimadzu corporation japan at a wavelength of 700 nm via the ammonium molybdate method the p recovery efficiency η was calculated by the following equation η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce mg p l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of phosphate respectively all batch experiments were carried out in duplicate and each experiment was performed with three parallel sets of flasks 6 experiments were conducted for each condition the experimental conditions are noted in corresponding captions of tables and figures 2 4 simulation of chemical speciation and validation to better visualize the precipitation process and optimize the recovery conditions the simulation of chemical compound speciation at thermodynamic equilibrium was performed by phreeqci 3 3 12 12704 modeling software the thermodynamic model was formulated with the definition of initial solution conditions precipitation parameters and potential precipitation equilibria and then solved by the software s built in newtonian iterative algorithm the simulation output results include the equilibrium levels for various ions in the system and the yield for potential precipitation which is also feasible to predict the composition and mass concentration of the precipitated phase udert et al 2003 the simulation results are validated by carrying out equilibrium experiments and measuring products via icp xrd and sem at the laboratory scale 2 5 analytical methods the crystallographic phases of the harvested phosphorus compounds sediment were determined and recorded on an x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 advance with cu kα radiation 40 kv 40 ma in the 2θ range of 10 to 70 and analyzed with jade 6 0 the surface morphologies and surface elements of sediments were detected by scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl30 equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis eds oxford for precipitate products the elemental composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer agilent vista mpx 3 results and discussion 3 1 equilibrium of precipitation reactions the optimal reaction time and the speciation of calcium phosphate fig s1 shows the variation in the p concentration and ph level over time during the precipitation process of calcium phosphate in solution under various initial ph values fig s2 presents the ph variation during the crystallization process for calcium phosphate within 10 h considering that no specific speciation of calcium phosphate crystalline was required for p recovery from source separated urine chen et al 2014 ofir et al 2004 xie et al 2014 6 h was set as the reaction time in this study when p and ph levels basically remained stable fig s3 exhibits the xrd spectra of the precipitates obtained at predetermined interval times the products are further analyzed using sem and tem in fig 1 the products presented as mostly porous spherical clusters with a few rod like crystals which could be ascribed to acp and hap respectively lei et al 2017 in tem images the particles are unevenly distributed and observed as track like shapes under further magnification which is considered as a typical transition state for the conversion from spherical amorphous calcium phosphate acp to needle shaped hydroxyapatite hap marković et al 2011 these characterization results indicated that the sediment collected after 6 h consisted of acp and hap details can be seen in text s2 hence both acp and hap were employed as parameters in thermodynamic modeling construction and simulation 3 2 p harvesting from hydrolyzed urine and fresh urine the p recovery behaviors are shown in fig s4 and fig s5 respectively in fig s4 a cacl2 and caco3 barely show any p recovery from hydrolyzed urine while ca oh 2 is relatively effective and harvested 18 9 of p at ca p 1 67 however with the ca p dosing ratio further increasing to 3 the p recovery efficiency by ca oh 2 could only be elevated to 36 8 fig s4 b shows that cacl2 and caco3 are unable to alter the ph of the hydrolyzed urine while increasing ca oh 2 input to a ca p dosing ratio of 3 raises the ph level to 9 6 since the strong buffering system in hydrolyzed urine contained large amounts of ammonium bicarbonate and free ammonia minor reagent dosing will not significantly inflate the urine ph level referring to fig s5 a ca oh 2 can perform better p harvesting with a recovery efficiency of 93 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 67 while the p recovery efficiency by cacl2 is only 27 6 at the same input ratio and does not improve noticeably as the dosing ratio further increases to 3 caco3 can barely harvest p from fresh urine the variation in ph during the p harvesting process is recorded in fig s5 b the high ca oh 2 dosage can raise the ph level when ca oh 2 was administered at ca p ratios of 1 67 and 3 the ph level was pumped to 10 12 and 12 05 respectively however the addition of cacl2 induced a drop in ph level this was because cacl2 was not capable of providing alkali which was essentially consumed during the generation of a calcium phosphate precipitate ca oh 2 could efficiently harvest p from fresh urine owing to its ability to supply both ca2 and alkalinity furthermore the composition of the sediment products collected from hydrolyzed and fresh urine are characterized by xrd presented in figs s6 and s7 and clarified in text s4 due to the discrepancy between the physicochemical properties of fresh and hydrolyzed urine their p recovery performances are quite different spiking calcium salts into hydrolyzed urine without any pretreatment can barely yield efficient p recovery whereas harvesting p from fresh urine can be effectively achieved by simply adjusting ca p dosing ratio details can be seen in text s5 fresh urine exhibits great prospects and potential for p harvesting therefore in this study p recovery from fresh urine was investigated by ca oh 2 and cacl2 as a control when necessary 3 3 p harvesting from fresh urine with various initial mg2 levels 3 3 1 variation in p concentration and ph level during the p harvesting process fig s8 demonstrates that the p recovery efficiency increases as the initial mg2 concentration rises at a constant ca p dosing ratio at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 the p recovery efficiency in urine systems with various initial mg2 concentrations 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l reached to 80 2 86 3 and 96 8 respectively this result indicated that p recovery was the joint effect of mg p and ca p precipitates at low dosing ratios moreover experimental ph values varied insignificantly in urine with different initial mg2 levels the model simulation results showed that at ca p dosing ratios greater than 1 5 the ph increment in urine with a high initial mg2 level was slightly lower than that in urine with a low initial mg2 level this was because in urine with higher initial mg2 levels at a dosing ratio greater than 1 5 the precipitation of mg oh 2 would consume more oh thus delaying the rise in ph levels see section 3 3 2 for more details 3 3 2 thermodynamic simulation for precipitation conversion and validation the formation and evolution of the precipitates during p harvesting from urine systems with various initial mg2 levels are visualized in fig 2 the result shows that the generation of mg containing precipitates significantly affects p recovery the maximum yield of struvite from urine with initial mg2 concentrations of 100 150 and 200 mg l reached 0 967 1 39 and 1 69 g l at ca p dosing ratios of 0 89 0 85 and 0 82 respectively to further verify the model simulation the concentration variations for ca2 mg2 and nh4 n in urine are displayed in fig s9 the mg2 concentration decreased significantly within a ca p dosing ratio range of 0 1 due to its consumption to form struvite which was consistent with the modeling results meanwhile the nh4 n level also decreased indicating that nh4 participated in the nonliquid phase as a reaction substance however when the ca p ratio exceeded 1 struvite began to dissolve accompanied by the production of kmgpo4 6h2o the verification can be seen in si fig s10 as the ca p ratio further increased to 1 3 the dissolution of kmgpo4 6h2o started then as the dosing ratio rose up to 1 5 mg oh 2 appeared the ph dependent deposition of mg oh 2 continuously increased with increasing dosing until mg2 ions were completely precipitated ca2 ions were introduced by dosing ca oh 2 to combine with phosphate to form calcium phosphate thus the ca2 concentration increased slowly when the ca p ratio was below 1 67 once the ca oh 2 dosage was in excess of the ca p stoichiometric ratio of calcium phosphate ca2 was present in the ionic state until the system reached the supersaturation of ca oh 2 unfortunately the effect of other urine compositions was not simulated here further study is needed to address this issue 3 3 3 simulation and elemental analysis for sediment composition the sediment composition was evaluated via a thermodynamic model and is illustrated in fig 3 in fig 3 a c the precipitate from urine with initial mg2 levels of 100 150 and 200 mg l is simulated to contain 2 3 4 5 and 6 7 mg containing impurities respectively this result indicated that the recovery product at any ca p dosing ratio would be adulterated with mg containing impurities whose content was positively related to the initial mg2 level the calcium phosphate purity was further simulated and analyzed as shown in fig 3 d f clearly the precipitate was doped with a large amount of struvite as the ca p dosing ratio was lower than 1 67 and the struvite content increased with increasing initial mg2 concentration once the dosing ratio was uprated above 1 67 mg oh 2 formed and degraded the purity for calcium phosphate when the ca p dosing ratio was set as 1 67 in urine with 100 150 and 200 mg l initial mg2 levels the proportion of ca p product in the precipitate reached up to 97 5 95 5 and 93 8 respectively although it was difficult to avoid coprecipitation of mg containing impurities such as struvite during the nutrient harvesting process more refined calcium phosphate product could be reclaimed by precisely controlling the ca p dosing ratio to further clarify the elemental composition of the harvested products the precipitates were dissolved to determine k ca mg and p elements the results are recorded in figs 3 g i and s11 at the same initial mg2 concentration p enrichment in the precipitate was higher at a ca p dosing ratio 1 67 than at a dosing ratio 2 this was because at a ca p dosing ratio greater than 2 mg2 in the urine tended to form coprecipitation as mg oh 2 as illustrated in fig 2 additionally it is worth mentioning that the urine at a high ca p dosing ratio would present as an alkaline system the introduced co2 from the ambient air can form carbonate ions and react with the added ca2 ions to promote the formation of caco3 pradhan et al 2017 courtney et al 2021 further increasing the ca p dosing ratio also might provide an environment where ca oh 2 will become highly supersaturated randall et al 2016 consequently the purity of calcium phosphate and the p content decreased at high ca p dosing ratios at the same ca p dosing ratio as the initial mg2 concentration increased the enrichment of ca and p for products was reduced and the content for mg was elevated instead theoretically struvite was mainly in the form of mgnh4po4 6h2o with a p content of 12 65 while the p component in acp and hcp was up to 20 and 18 5 respectively a ca p dosing ratio below 1 67 could allow the struvite crystallization and urine with higher initial mg2 level could yield a greater proportion of struvite in precipitates thus reducing the p enrichment in products further increasing the ca p dosing ratio would promote the formation of mg oh 2 and the possible precipitation of caco3 pradhan et al 2017 therefore the p content for precipitates would be also lowered in urine with higher initial mg2 level it can be demonstrated that the high mg2 level in urine could degrade the purity and also the p content for the harvested products 3 4 effect of initial ph level for fresh urine on p harvesting the effect of acidic storage of urine on p recovery was investigated by regulating the urine initial ph to 2 4 and 6 5 table s8 note that although the initial ph of the synthetic urine was set the ph level was allowed to vary during p recovery process 3 4 1 variation in p concentration and ph level by dosing ca oh 2 in fig 4 the urine system at an initial ph 2 0 clearly exhibits a rather significant hysteresis effect for p harvesting relative to the systems with initial ph levels of 4 0 and 6 5 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the weak buffering capacity of the synthetic fresh urine which originated from its nh4 and phosphate therefore it was comparatively difficult to form precipitation for the lower ph system at the same dosing ratio unfortunately the effect of the buffering capacities derived from organics in real urine on p harvesting was not analyzed here further study is needed to address this issue concurrently the ca oh 2 dosage for complete p recovery from urine with lower initial ph values also increased in demand based on the experimental data a dosing ratio of 1 67 enabled complete p recovery from urine with initial ph values of 4 and 6 5 the identical dosing ratio harvested only 86 8 p in the urine with an initial ph 2 0 where the complete p recovery could be achieved at a ca p ratio of 2 however the simulation results suggested that the complete recovery of p from urine with initial ph levels of 4 and 6 5 could be achieved at ca p dosing ratios less than 1 3 while the urine system with initial ph 2 0 required a dosing ratio of 1 8 note that the formation of ca p precipitates such as acp ocp ca8h2 po4 6 5h2o and hap required constant binding with oh thus the urine systems with low initial ph value cannot provide an environment where ca p will become highly supersaturated and they required more chemical dosing to completely recover p the variation in ph after dosing with ca oh 2 is shown in fig 4 b the ph of these systems increased synchronously with a relatively gentle rise due to the buffer capacity of urine however as the ca p ratio was greater than 3 all ph levels rose beyond 11 which might lead to the precipitation of mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 therefore a refined scheme for p recovery is still needed 3 4 2 characterization of the sediment products xrd spectra for the sediments are presented in figs 5 and s7 it was necessary to note that in contrast to the initial ph 4 0 and 6 5 systems there was no sediment formation in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 at a ca p dosing ratio of 0 5 for the xrd spectra of products harvested from urine with initial ph 2 0 at ca p dosing ratio of 1 and with initial ph 4 0 at dosing ratio of 0 5 their similar diffraction peaks corresponded to cahpo4 2h2o crystal facets jcpds 72 1240 quite distinct from the product harvested from initial ph 6 5 urine at a dosing ratio of 0 5 additionally in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 xrd patterns of sediments in a dosing ratio range of 1 67 3 0 consistently revealed the presence of acp and minor caco3 as mentioned before the formation of caco3 was mainly due to the introduction of co2 from the ambient air in urine with an initial ph of 4 the product was confirmed to contain struvite acp and caco3 at a dosing ratio of 1 however at dosing ratios of 1 0 and 1 67 the peak intensity of struvite was lower than that of the sediment from urine with an initial ph 6 5 indicative of its relatively lower struvite content as the ca p dosing ratio exceeded 2 0 the compounds were verified to consist of acp and hcp these results suggested that the low initial ph level for urine might favor the formation of high purity ca p product with less mg p precipitation 3 4 3 thermodynamic simulation for precipitation conversion and validation in fig 6 a c various initial ph levels could make a significant difference in the composition of the harvested product at a ca p dosing ratio below 4 the numbers of species for potential sediments during the harvesting process were 7 7 and 3 for urine systems with initial ph levels of 6 5 4 and 2 respectively the maximum precipitation potential of struvite kmgpo4 6h2o and mghpo4 3h2o drastically decreased for products harvested from urine with an initial ph of 4 relative to those from the system with an initial ph 6 5 moreover no mg p precipitation was predicted in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 within a ca p ratio range of 0 4 0 which was consistent with the xrd spectra in general low initial ph values tended to inhibit the formation or lower the yield of impurities furthermore the model simulation verified that cahpo4 2h2o could be reclaimed from urine with an initial ph 2 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 and urine with an initial ph 4 at a dosing ratio of 0 5 in urine with an initial ph of 2 ca p sediments were only present as cahpo4 2h2o and acp hap specifically the predominant sediment was assigned to cahpo4 2h2o with a ca p dosing ratio below 1 23 and then gradually transformed to acp hap as the ca p dosing ratio increased thus it facilitated the stepwise extraction of various ca p precipitates however in urine with an initial ph 4 it was quite challenging to avoid struvite coprecipitation for cahpo4 2h2o recovered at a ca p dosing ratio of 0 5 as well as mg containing impurities in the recovery for acp hap for further validation the variations in ca2 mg2 and nh4 n levels are presented in fig 6 d f a similar trend was observed for mg2 concentration in urine with initial ph 4 and 6 5 which both showed a notable drop followed by a rise and then a decrease again this was because the mg p sediments including struvite tended to coprecipitate when the ca oh 2 input was inadequate and then slowly converted to calcium phosphate as the dosing ratio increased moreover the nh4 n level decreased and then increased which was in good agreement with the simulation results in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 the mg2 concentration basically remained steady with a ca p dosing ratio less than 1 and then notably decreased with increasing dosing in combination with the simulation this result suggested that no mg p sediment was formed in the ph 2 0 urine system and only the precipitation of mg oh 2 led to a decrease in the mg2 concentration concurrently no obvious change was identified for nh4 n in this system the ca2 concentration in initial ph 2 0 system increased substantially as the ca p dosing ratio rose to 0 5 due to no precipitation while it decreased considerably as the dosing ratio ranged from 1 to 1 67 and then rose up as the dosing ratio was greater than 2 0 this was supported by the modeling simulation which showed that cahpo4 2h2o greatly precipitated within a dosing ratio range of 1 1 67 for ca2 in urine with initial ph levels of 4 0 and 6 5 its concentration increased slowly with a ca oh 2 addition ratio less than 2 0 followed by a rapid increase 3 4 4 simulation and elemental analysis for sediment composition as depicted in fig 3 b e in urine with an initial ph 6 5 the random dosage of ca oh 2 enables the formation of precipitates yet fig 7 a b illustrates that in urine with initial ph levels of 2 and 4 sediment can only be observed until the ca p ratio reaches 0 73 and 0 1 respectively as illustrated before low ph levels inhibited mg p precipitation accordingly in urine with an initial ph 2 mg adulteration was not available within a dosing ratio below 2 4 ca2 was alternately precipitated as cahpo4 2h2o and hap acp under various dosing ratios thus its content for the sediment product was expected to fluctuate however in urine with an initial ph 4 fig 7 a one or more mg p impurities may be present the results suggested that mg content could be reduced with a ca p ratio lower than 0 4 or approximately 1 67 fig 7 c d shows the component proportion of the products in initial ph 2 urine the targeted recovery for mono component sediment products such as acp hap cahpo4 2h2o and mg oh 2 could be implemented by quantitatively adjusting the ca p dosing ratio the feasibility for the stepwise recovery of these precipitates was ensured by the large ca oh 2 dosing interval however in the urine system with an initial ph of 4 the product was composed of 28 struvite and 72 acp hap at a ca p dosing ratio achieved complete p recovery recovery of the mono component product as acp hap in this system could only be achieved at a ca p ratio of 1 67 the elemental compositions of the sediment products were also determined fig s12 depicts that the contents of mg and k in sediment were positively correlated with the initial ph level at the same ca p dosing ratio the mg content for sediment at initial ph 2 was greatly reduced compared to those at higher initial ph conditions the fact that the fresh urine itself had a certain amount of mg2 made it difficult to completely exclude the presence of mg in the sediment although the model simulation indicated that the coprecipitation of mg p product could be avoided at a dosing ratio less than 2 in urine with initial ph 2 trace mg2 was still available in elemental composition analysis the existence of mg in the precipitates may be attributed to the following aspects at a low ca p dosing ratio the low supersaturation of acp allowed mg2 to compete with ca2 for p to form struvite due to the higher kinetic rate of precipitation for struvite than for acp kazadi mbamba et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 musvoto et al 2000 the coprecipitation of struvite and acp might form during the reaction of 6 h when the calcium phosphate precipitates have not fully transformed to the thermodynamically most stable phase hap lei et al 2017 additionally a minor amount of mg2 could be adsorbed on the surface of the ca p precipitates moreover as the ca p dosing ratio increased above 2 5 the precipitation of mg oh 2 appeared in all these urine systems then with the increase of ca p ratio mg2 gradually and completely precipitated as mg oh 2 resulting in an increase of mg content in precipitates therefore it is feasible to stabilize the urine and guarantee highly efficient p recovery by adjusting urine to be acidic in the stabilized urine with an initial ph of 2 there is an excellent potential to fully harvest p with less ca oh 2 consumption and reap high purity cahpo4 2h2o and hap acp the obtained p rich products can have extensive applications thus effectively eliminating the drawbacks of struvite as fertilizer 3 5 effect of the degree of hydrolysis dh of urine on p recovery 3 5 1 variation in p and ph levels during the p harvesting process fig s13 depicts the variation in p and ph levels for urine systems with different dhs for p recovery by ca oh 2 in fig s13 a b the residual p concentration was observed to increase as the initial dh increased indicating that the efficacy for p recovery at the same ca p dosing ratio decreased with the increasing dh this phenomenon was mainly because that the massive hco3 derived from urine hydrolysis competed with phosphate to bind ca2 ions in this situation caco3 dominated the precipitate thus reducing the p content of the sediment products it was also noted that p recovery by ca oh 2 was efficient at lower hydrolysis levels in urine with 5 dh initial ph 7 34 the p recovery efficiency was superior to 99 at ca p ratios greater than 1 67 even in the 15 dh system initial ph 9 35 the p recovery efficiency was still maintained at 89 4 93 2 95 6 and 97 2 at dosing ratios of 1 67 3 4 and 5 respectively however in 30 dh urine the p recovery efficiency fell to 68 at a ca p ratio of 1 67 although 90 6 recovery efficiency could be acquired at a dosing ratio of 5 the p content for the obtained sediment would be substantially weakened with this ca p dosing ratio beyond the stoichiometric ratio of capo4 typically urine hydrolysis elevated the ph level which facilitated p recovery by cacl2 and minimized the additional alkali consumption fig s13 c d illustrates the recovery of p by cacl2 from urine with various dh levels p harvesting performance for cacl2 was strongly impacted by the dh of urine the p recovery efficiency was promoted with the increase in the ca p dosing ratio at the same dh however dosing cacl2 was unsatisfactory for p recovery considering unfavorable factors such as the weak buffer capacity and low initial ph in urine with low dh and massive hco3 derived from high dh the maximum p recovery efficiency by cacl2 only reached to 65 2 at a ca p dosing ratio of 5 3 5 2 analysis of p content for products to further monitor the effect of dh on p recovery by ca oh 2 the elemental composition of sediment reclaimed by dosing ca oh 2 was measured and is demonstrated in fig s14 the p proportion in the product decreased with increasing dh at a fixed ca p ratio at a low dosing ratio the products possessed high p contents for instance the p content for products recovered from urine with different dhs was greater than 10 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 67 which could reach 17 for a dh below 15 instead the p content would be reduced by raising the ca p ratio this was because in urine without hydrolysis elevated ph induced by a high dosing ratio may trigger the coprecipitate of mg oh 2 degrading the p content as the dh increased not only mg oh 2 but also a considerable coprecipitation of caco3 was present the p proportion in the collected product from urine with 60 dh was drastically reduced below 5 at high ca p dosing ratios a previous study demonstrated that the p content was only 1 5 for the product in a completely hydrolyzed urine by using ca oh 2 to completely recover p hao et al 2013 highly hydrolyzed urine was not conducive to the efficient p recovery by ca oh 2 which would require a great chemical consumption to bind with hco3 from hydrolysis and substantially reduce the p content for the product hence excessive dh for urine should be inhibited for efficient p recovery using calcium based materials urine stabilization would facilitate subsequent p recovery 3 6 an alternative strategy at a constant ca p dosing ratio ca oh 2 for p recovery can supply ca2 and oh both of which are the key components of hap nucleation and crystallization and thus the utilization of material can be maximized however the molar ratio of ca2 and oh for ca oh 2 was fixed generally the optimal dosing ratio for p recovery varied and was affected by factors including initial ph and initial p levels for real fresh urine in actual application thereby p harvesting from urine was implemented by dosing cacl2 at a ca p ratio of 1 67 and supplementing naoh as an alkali source and the corresponding precipitation evolution was probed 3 6 1 p and ph changes during alkali supplementation fig 8 a c demonstrates the p and ph variation in urine with different alkali supplies at a constant ca p dosing ratio the experimental data indicated that the required naoh dosage to achieve the complete p recovery was 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 mol l with a gradual decrease in the initial ph and the corresponding equilibrium ph was 9 28 9 87 and 9 7 respectively given that the ca p stoichiometry ratio for acp and hap was 1 5 and 1 67 respectively the complete recovery of p could be achieved without introducing interfering ions such as co3 2 and so4 2 by solely adjusting the ph and guaranteeing the ca p dosing ratio to be greater than 1 67 3 6 2 thermodynamic model simulation of the precipitation conversion fig 8 d f illustrates the sediment evolution via model simulation in urine with various alkali inputs at a fixed ca p dosing ratio only four precipitates were observed in all sets namely cahpo4 2h2o capo4 struvite and mg oh 2 it was noteworthy that sediment emerged without any alkali addition in initial the ph 6 5 system while no similar observation was noted in other systems which was consistent with the experimental data at an initial ph of 6 5 cahpo4 2h2o appeared without additional alkali input while at an initial ph 4 and ph 2 supplemental alkali was required to supersaturate cahpo4 2h2o further augmenting the alkalinity boosted the oh level in solution whereby cahpo4 2h2o progressively converted to acp hap moreover no formation of kmgpo4 6h2o or mghpo4 6h2o was present throughout the whole alkali input process this alternative approach can drastically diminish mg p coprecipitation compared with the method of exclusively using ca oh 2 nevertheless the coprecipitation of mg oh 2 could inevitably occur with increasing ph the potential maximum precipitation for mg oh 2 was 0 44 0 3 and 0 27 g l respectively constituting less than 2 of the total sediment mass based on the simulation results by applying a constant ca p dosing ratio and supplementing alkalinity to increase the ph to approximately 8 it is feasible to yield high purity calcium phosphate and obviate the impurities such as struvite and mg oh 2 3 7 potential targeted recovery of mg oh 2 the prospective to exact high purity cahpo4 2h2o acp hap and mg oh 2 at initial ph 2 is indicated in fig 6 a to further validate this proposal the acp hap deposit was retrieved by dosing ca oh 2 at a ca p ratio of 2 followed by further dosing naoh to elevate the ph level to 12 then the collected products were examined by xrd fig s15 presents the well crystallized characteristic peaks of mg oh 2 demonstrating the successful separation and recovery of the highly pure mg oh 2 precipitate the observed trace amount of caco3 impurity might be due to the introduction of co2 from air for mg oh 2 recovery the dosage of ca oh 2 as a ph elevating source required precise control since coprecipitation of ca oh 2 tended to form at a ph higher than 12 however it is not a concern for naoh as an alkaline supplement the stepwise harvesting of high purity ca p compounds and crystalline mg oh 2 can be effectuated by regulating the initial ph of fresh urine this approach can advance the knowledge of the design scheme and alternative methods for nutrient harvesting in source separated urine the practicality of the proposed strategy for p harvesting is discussed in text s5 4 conclusions in this study the strategy of precisely harvesting p from fresh human urine as high purity calcium phosphate was first proposed the p recovery performance was investigated as a function of key factors including chemical consumption initial p concentration initial mg2 concentration initial ph level and dh the thermodynamic model performed on phreeqc served as a great simulation and the theoretical results agreed with the experimental validation results further simulation provided the basis for better yielding insights into the precipitation mechanism the combination of model simulation and experimental validation explored the precise optimization of p harvesting performance the results revealed that a lower ph level acidic condition could avoid fresh urine hydrolysis and thus facilitate urine storage meanwhile the coprecipitation of struvite and mg oh 2 could be excluded by regulating the ca p dosing ratio to further improve p harvesting from urine in urine with an initial ph of 2 in a ca p dosing ratio range of 1 67 2 3 the purity of the calcium phosphate products could reach to 100 and the products mainly consisted of acp hap moreover the alternative dosing regimen of loading cacl2 and supplementing alkali at a constant ca p ratio was advanced and its effects on p harvesting and product composition were probed this option allowed for 100 p recovery and high purity calcium phosphate product furthermore calcium phosphate and mg oh 2 can be stepwise recovered by regulating the initial urine ph level in general for the precise and quantitative recovery of high purity calcium phosphate product from fresh source separated urine the integrated and developed technical treatment scheme we proposed would advance the knowledge of p harvesting and offer

15306,phosphorus p harvesting from source separated urine to optimize the overall nutrient loop is one of the most appealing benefits and is a global research interest in wastewater management and treatment however current p precipitation is mainly oriented to struvite which is limited by the issues such as relatively low product purity and high cost of mg source distinguished from previous conventional struvite precipitation the strategy of precisely harvesting p from fresh human urine as high purity calcium phosphate was first proposed in this study this enhanced strategy can optimize p harvesting performance and product purity by simply regulating the consumption of calcium based materials via model simulation and experimental validation the thermodynamic model was constructed to probe the precipitation conversion mechanism and visually predict the component and yield for products under various operating conditions batch experiments were conducted to investigate p recovery performance as a function of initial mg2 concentration initial ph level as well as degree of urine hydrolysis moreover the alternative dosing scheme with different calcium salts and alkali was presented diversifying the options for efficient p recovery the results showed that from the perspective of acidic storage for fresh urine p recovery can be boosted along with eliminating urine hydrolysis in urine with an initial ph 2 0 p can be completely recovered and purity for calcium phosphate can be optimized to 100 within a ca p ratio range of 1 67 2 3 overall this work is of great significance for precisely and efficiently harvesting p from urine and provides an integrated strategy for p resource recovery from urine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fresh

p recycling is especially crucial for environmental concern and sustainable importance mayer et al 2016 harvesting p from source separated urine as a valuable resource attracts more research interest and agricultural applications wald 2017 various mainstream technologies for p recovery have been developed adsorption electrochemistry and ion exchange methods are suitable for systems with low p levels and no sedimentary impurities but not for urine due to several issues such as high reagent dosing and membrane blockage dong et al 2017 sendrowski and boyer 2013 thompson brewster et al 2016 yu et al 2019 precipitation in contrast is generally deemed to be promising for p removal and recovery from urine due to its advantages of high cost efficiency operational flexibility and scalability dai et al 2014 molinos senante et al 2011 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation for p recovery from source separated urine is generally focused on and extensively operated since struvite is a phosphate mineral and a potential slow release fertilizer hao et al 2013 li et al 2019 however some drawbacks hamper the production and utilization of struvite one of the most challenging aspects is the inferior purity of the actual struvite exaction 30 50 due to the simultaneous crystallization of ca p and caco3 during the recovery process the production of p minerals with a high content of struvite from real wastewater is a difficult and costly process hao et al 2013 2008 from the practical application viewpoint struvite is not as superior to other p based compounds in terms of fertilizer application efficiency nor is it the exclusive form of raw materials favored by the fertilizer industry hao et al 2013 hence it is imperative to diversify the precipitation technologies based on other high purity p based products it is also of great significance to harvest p from urine as calcium phosphate for fertilization efficiency calcium phosphate products such as ca h2po4 2 h2o and cahpo4 2h2o were illustrated to be roughly equivalent to struvite in agriculture johnston and richards 2003 meyer et al 2018 however calcium salts as additive agents are highly accessible and economically affordable relative to magnesium salts in addition calcium phosphate is widely favored as it is the main component of phosphate rock cornel and schaum 2009 and it has diverse applications in manufacturing such as bioceramics lei et al 2019 song et al 2006 tervahauta et al 2014 pradhan et al 2017 used ca oh 2 to simultaneously recover n and p from hydrolyzed source separated urine while the p content of the products was less than 1 5 due to the coprecipitation of caco3 in the long term stabilization of fresh source separated urine by ca oh 2 randall et al 2016 obtained a product with a complex composition and low p proportion despite these studies applying calcium based materials to obtain p containing sediment products for source separated urine treatment the recovery of calcium phosphate was not regarded as a prime goal nor multiple factors were considered including chemical input product purity and economic efficiency to the best of our knowledge little information is available concerning the p reclaimed as a high purity calcium phosphate product from human urine hao et al 2013 the relevant recovery scheme has not yet been well established to address the aforementioned research gaps this study proposed a strategy for p harvesting as high purity calcium phosphate from fresh source separated urine achieving simultaneous nutrient recovery and high purity fertilizer production the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the effects of the composition and storage conditions for urine on the p harvesting process 2 to explore the conversion mechanism of precipitation in the recovery process by thermodynamic model and to validate the simulation by conducting equilibrium experiments and 3 to precisely control the purity and yield for calcium phosphate product by regulating the ca p dosing ratio in this study in view of the prospective application of source separated urine we advance the knowledge for better insights into enriching the means of p nutrient recovery as well as providing guidance for the exaction of high purity calcium phosphate from fresh urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals all chemical

antimony potassium tartrate hydrate c8h4k2o12sb2 h2o and ammonium molybdate para tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o2 4h2o were purchased from sinopharm reagent co ltd dissolution reagents including hclo4 and hno3 were also obtained from sinopharm reagent co ltd hydroxyapatite hap was applied by aladdin 2 2 synthetic urine solutions synthetic urine without organic complexes was employed for precipitation thermodynamics previous studies stated that organic agents such as citrate and oxalate have a negligible effect on precipitation simulation in urine xu et al 2015 udert et al 2003 ronteltap et al further pointed out that organic complexes showed no substantial effect on the solubility products and thus performed no quantitative role in struvite precipitation in urine ronteltap et al 2007 herein the effect of organic complexation on precipitation was neglected for the thermodynamic simulation in source separated urine the composition of real fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine samples is measured and presented in table s1 based on the composition of real urine the recipe for the synthetic urine is established and included in tables s2 s4 2 3 batch experiments all the experiments were conducted at 20 200 ml of synthetic urine was added to a 250 ml flask and magnetically stirred at an appropriate rate then ca based material was introduced to the solution based on the set value of ca p ratio after the reaction proceeded for 6 h the equilibrium ph level was determined the supernatant was sampled for 2 ml and filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes to measure the residual phosphate concentration the precipitate products were collected by freeze drying vacuum freeze dryer scientz 10n for 24 h and further analyzed for its composition p k mg ca the optimal reaction time was determined by tracking the variations in the p concentration and ph level over time during the precipitation experiments and the speciation of calcium phosphate at precipitation equilibrium was investigated additionally the p harvesting behaviors from synthetic fresh urine with various initial mg2 levels 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l were studied to investigate the effect of the initial ph level of synthetic urine on p harvesting the initial ph values were adjusted to 2 4 and 6 5 by 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions to explore the effect of the degree of hydrolysis dh of urine on p recovery using calcium based materials the dhs for synthetic urine were set as 0 5 15 30 60 and 100 details can be seen in text s1 and table s4 moreover an alternative strategy for p harvesting at a constant ca p dosing ratio was proposed the experimental details are presented in text s1 and table s5 s9 nh4 n ammonium n was determined via nessler s reagent colorimetric method the residual phosphate concentration was measured using a uv 1780 spectrophotometer shimadzu corporation japan at a wavelength of 700 nm via the ammonium molybdate method the p recovery efficiency η was calculated by the following equation η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce mg p l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of phosphate respectively all batch experiments were carried out in duplicate and each experiment was performed with three parallel sets of flasks 6 experiments were conducted for each condition the experimental conditions are noted in corresponding captions of tables and figures 2 4 simulation of chemical speciation and validation to better visualize the precipitation process and optimize the recovery conditions the simulation of chemical compound speciation at thermodynamic equilibrium was performed by phreeqci 3 3 12 12704 modeling software the thermodynamic model was formulated with the definition of initial solution conditions precipitation parameters and potential precipitation equilibria and then solved by the software s built in newtonian iterative algorithm the simulation output results include the equilibrium levels for various ions in the system and the yield for potential precipitation which is also feasible to predict the composition and mass concentration of the precipitated phase udert et al 2003 the simulation results are validated by carrying out equilibrium experiments and measuring products via icp xrd and sem at the laboratory scale 2 5 analytical methods the crystallographic phases of the harvested phosphorus compounds sediment were determined and recorded on an x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 advance with cu kα radiation 40 kv 40 ma in the 2θ range of 10 to 70 and analyzed with jade 6 0 the surface morphologies and surface elements of sediments were detected by scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl30 equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis eds oxford for precipitate products the elemental composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer agilent vista mpx 3 results and discussion 3 1 equilibrium of precipitation reactions the optimal reaction time and the speciation of calcium phosphate fig s1 shows the variation in the p concentration and ph level over time during the precipitation process of calcium phosphate in solution under various initial ph values fig s2 presents the ph variation during the crystallization process for calcium phosphate within 10 h considering that no specific speciation of calcium phosphate crystalline was required for p recovery from source separated urine chen et al 2014 ofir et al 2004 xie et al 2014 6 h was set as the reaction time in this study when p and ph levels basically remained stable fig s3 exhibits the xrd spectra of the precipitates obtained at predetermined interval times the products are further analyzed using sem and tem in fig 1 the products presented as mostly porous spherical clusters with a few rod like crystals which could be ascribed to acp and hap respectively lei et al 2017 in tem images the particles are unevenly distributed and observed as track like shapes under further magnification which is considered as a typical transition state for the conversion from spherical amorphous calcium phosphate acp to needle shaped hydroxyapatite hap marković et al 2011 these characterization results indicated that the sediment collected after 6 h consisted of acp and hap details can be seen in text s2 hence both acp and hap were employed as parameters in thermodynamic modeling construction and simulation 3 2 p harvesting from hydrolyzed urine and fresh urine the p recovery behaviors are shown in fig s4 and fig s5 respectively in fig s4 a cacl2 and caco3 barely show any p recovery from hydrolyzed urine while ca oh 2 is relatively effective and harvested 18 9 of p at ca p 1 67 however with the ca p dosing ratio further increasing to 3 the p recovery efficiency by ca oh 2 could only be elevated to 36 8 fig s4 b shows that cacl2 and caco3 are unable to alter the ph of the hydrolyzed urine while increasing ca oh 2 input to a ca p dosing ratio of 3 raises the ph level to 9 6 since the strong buffering system in hydrolyzed urine contained large amounts of ammonium bicarbonate and free ammonia minor reagent dosing will not significantly inflate the urine ph level referring to fig s5 a ca oh 2 can perform better p harvesting with a recovery efficiency of 93 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 67 while the p recovery efficiency by cacl2 is only 27 6 at the same input ratio and does not improve noticeably as the dosing ratio further increases to 3 caco3 can barely harvest p from fresh urine the variation in ph during the p harvesting process is recorded in fig s5 b the high ca oh 2 dosage can raise the ph level when ca oh 2 was administered at ca p ratios of 1 67 and 3 the ph level was pumped to 10 12 and 12 05 respectively however the addition of cacl2 induced a drop in ph level this was because cacl2 was not capable of providing alkali which was essentially consumed during the generation of a calcium phosphate precipitate ca oh 2 could efficiently harvest p from fresh urine owing to its ability to supply both ca2 and alkalinity furthermore the composition of the sediment products collected from hydrolyzed and fresh urine are characterized by xrd presented in figs s6 and s7 and clarified in text s4 due to the discrepancy between the physicochemical properties of fresh and hydrolyzed urine their p recovery performances are quite different spiking calcium salts into hydrolyzed urine without any pretreatment can barely yield efficient p recovery whereas harvesting p from fresh urine can be effectively achieved by simply adjusting ca p dosing ratio details can be seen in text s5 fresh urine exhibits great prospects and potential for p harvesting therefore in this study p recovery from fresh urine was investigated by ca oh 2 and cacl2 as a control when necessary 3 3 p harvesting from fresh urine with various initial mg2 levels 3 3 1 variation in p concentration and ph level during the p harvesting process fig s8 demonstrates that the p recovery efficiency increases as the initial mg2 concentration rises at a constant ca p dosing ratio at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 the p recovery efficiency in urine systems with various initial mg2 concentrations 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l reached to 80 2 86 3 and 96 8 respectively this result indicated that p recovery was the joint effect of mg p and ca p precipitates at low dosing ratios moreover experimental ph values varied insignificantly in urine with different initial mg2 levels the model simulation results showed that at ca p dosing ratios greater than 1 5 the ph increment in urine with a high initial mg2 level was slightly lower than that in urine with a low initial mg2 level this was because in urine with higher initial mg2 levels at a dosing ratio greater than 1 5 the precipitation of mg oh 2 would consume more oh thus delaying the rise in ph levels see section 3 3 2 for more details 3 3 2 thermodynamic simulation for precipitation conversion and validation the formation and evolution of the precipitates during p harvesting from urine systems with various initial mg2 levels are visualized in fig 2 the result shows that the generation of mg containing precipitates significantly affects p recovery the maximum yield of struvite from urine with initial mg2 concentrations of 100 150 and 200 mg l reached 0 967 1 39 and 1 69 g l at ca p dosing ratios of 0 89 0 85 and 0 82 respectively to further verify the model simulation the concentration variations for ca2 mg2 and nh4 n in urine are displayed in fig s9 the mg2 concentration decreased significantly within a ca p dosing ratio range of 0 1 due to its consumption to form struvite which was consistent with the modeling results meanwhile the nh4 n level also decreased indicating that nh4 participated in the nonliquid phase as a reaction substance however when the ca p ratio exceeded 1 struvite began to dissolve accompanied by the production of kmgpo4 6h2o the verification can be seen in si fig s10 as the ca p ratio further increased to 1 3 the dissolution of kmgpo4 6h2o started then as the dosing ratio rose up to 1 5 mg oh 2 appeared the ph dependent deposition of mg oh 2 continuously increased with increasing dosing until mg2 ions were completely precipitated ca2 ions were introduced by dosing ca oh 2 to combine with phosphate to form calcium phosphate thus the ca2 concentration increased slowly when the ca p ratio was below 1 67 once the ca oh 2 dosage was in excess of the ca p stoichiometric ratio of calcium phosphate ca2 was present in the ionic state until the system reached the supersaturation of ca oh 2 unfortunately the effect of other urine compositions was not simulated here further study is needed to address this issue 3 3 3 simulation and elemental analysis for sediment composition the sediment composition was evaluated via a thermodynamic model and is illustrated in fig 3 in fig 3 a c the precipitate from urine with initial mg2 levels of 100 150 and 200 mg l is simulated to contain 2 3 4 5 and 6 7 mg containing impurities respectively this result indicated that the recovery product at any ca p dosing ratio would be adulterated with mg containing impurities whose content was positively related to the initial mg2 level the calcium phosphate purity was further simulated and analyzed as shown in fig 3 d f clearly the precipitate was doped with a large amount of struvite as the ca p dosing ratio was lower than 1 67 and the struvite content increased with increasing initial mg2 concentration once the dosing ratio was uprated above 1 67 mg oh 2 formed and degraded the purity for calcium phosphate when the ca p dosing ratio was set as 1 67 in urine with 100 150 and 200 mg l initial mg2 levels the proportion of ca p product in the precipitate reached up to 97 5 95 5 and 93 8 respectively although it was difficult to avoid coprecipitation of mg containing impurities such as struvite during the nutrient harvesting process more refined calcium phosphate product could be reclaimed by precisely controlling the ca p dosing ratio to further clarify the elemental composition of the harvested products the precipitates were dissolved to determine k ca mg and p elements the results are recorded in figs 3 g i and s11 at the same initial mg2 concentration p enrichment in the precipitate was higher at a ca p dosing ratio 1 67 than at a dosing ratio 2 this was because at a ca p dosing ratio greater than 2 mg2 in the urine tended to form coprecipitation as mg oh 2 as illustrated in fig 2 additionally it is worth mentioning that the urine at a high ca p dosing ratio would present as an alkaline system the introduced co2 from the ambient air can form carbonate ions and react with the added ca2 ions to promote the formation of caco3 pradhan et al 2017 courtney et al 2021 further increasing the ca p dosing ratio also might provide an environment where ca oh 2 will become highly supersaturated randall et al 2016 consequently the purity of calcium phosphate and the p content decreased at high ca p dosing ratios at the same ca p dosing ratio as the initial mg2 concentration increased the enrichment of ca and p for products was reduced and the content for mg was elevated instead theoretically struvite was mainly in the form of mgnh4po4 6h2o with a p content of 12 65 while the p component in acp and hcp was up to 20 and 18 5 respectively a ca p dosing ratio below 1 67 could allow the struvite crystallization and urine with higher initial mg2 level could yield a greater proportion of struvite in precipitates thus reducing the p enrichment in products further increasing the ca p dosing ratio would promote the formation of mg oh 2 and the possible precipitation of caco3 pradhan et al 2017 therefore the p content for precipitates would be also lowered in urine with higher initial mg2 level it can be demonstrated that the high mg2 level in urine could degrade the purity and also the p content for the harvested products 3 4 effect of initial ph level for fresh urine on p harvesting the effect of acidic storage of urine on p recovery was investigated by regulating the urine initial ph to 2 4 and 6 5 table s8 note that although the initial ph of the synthetic urine was set the ph level was allowed to vary during p recovery process 3 4 1 variation in p concentration and ph level by dosing ca oh 2 in fig 4 the urine system at an initial ph 2 0 clearly exhibits a rather significant hysteresis effect for p harvesting relative to the systems with initial ph levels of 4 0 and 6 5 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the weak buffering capacity of the synthetic fresh urine which originated from its nh4 and phosphate therefore it was comparatively difficult to form precipitation for the lower ph system at the same dosing ratio unfortunately the effect of the buffering capacities derived from organics in real urine on p harvesting was not analyzed here further study is needed to address this issue concurrently the ca oh 2 dosage for complete p recovery from urine with lower initial ph values also increased in demand based on the experimental data a dosing ratio of 1 67 enabled complete p recovery from urine with initial ph values of 4 and 6 5 the identical dosing ratio harvested only 86 8 p in the urine with an initial ph 2 0 where the complete p recovery could be achieved at a ca p ratio of 2 however the simulation results suggested that the complete recovery of p from urine with initial ph levels of 4 and 6 5 could be achieved at ca p dosing ratios less than 1 3 while the urine system with initial ph 2 0 required a dosing ratio of 1 8 note that the formation of ca p precipitates such as acp ocp ca8h2 po4 6 5h2o and hap required constant binding with oh thus the urine systems with low initial ph value cannot provide an environment where ca p will become highly supersaturated and they required more chemical dosing to completely recover p the variation in ph after dosing with ca oh 2 is shown in fig 4 b the ph of these systems increased synchronously with a relatively gentle rise due to the buffer capacity of urine however as the ca p ratio was greater than 3 all ph levels rose beyond 11 which might lead to the precipitation of mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 therefore a refined scheme for p recovery is still needed 3 4 2 characterization of the sediment products xrd spectra for the sediments are presented in figs 5 and s7 it was necessary to note that in contrast to the initial ph 4 0 and 6 5 systems there was no sediment formation in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 at a ca p dosing ratio of 0 5 for the xrd spectra of products harvested from urine with initial ph 2 0 at ca p dosing ratio of 1 and with initial ph 4 0 at dosing ratio of 0 5 their similar diffraction peaks corresponded to cahpo4 2h2o crystal facets jcpds 72 1240 quite distinct from the product harvested from initial ph 6 5 urine at a dosing ratio of 0 5 additionally in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 xrd patterns of sediments in a dosing ratio range of 1 67 3 0 consistently revealed the presence of acp and minor caco3 as mentioned before the formation of caco3 was mainly due to the introduction of co2 from the ambient air in urine with an initial ph of 4 the product was confirmed to contain struvite acp and caco3 at a dosing ratio of 1 however at dosing ratios of 1 0 and 1 67 the peak intensity of struvite was lower than that of the sediment from urine with an initial ph 6 5 indicative of its relatively lower struvite content as the ca p dosing ratio exceeded 2 0 the compounds were verified to consist of acp and hcp these results suggested that the low initial ph level for urine might favor the formation of high purity ca p product with less mg p precipitation 3 4 3 thermodynamic simulation for precipitation conversion and validation in fig 6 a c various initial ph levels could make a significant difference in the composition of the harvested product at a ca p dosing ratio below 4 the numbers of species for potential sediments during the harvesting process were 7 7 and 3 for urine systems with initial ph levels of 6 5 4 and 2 respectively the maximum precipitation potential of struvite kmgpo4 6h2o and mghpo4 3h2o drastically decreased for products harvested from urine with an initial ph of 4 relative to those from the system with an initial ph 6 5 moreover no mg p precipitation was predicted in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 within a ca p ratio range of 0 4 0 which was consistent with the xrd spectra in general low initial ph values tended to inhibit the formation or lower the yield of impurities furthermore the model simulation verified that cahpo4 2h2o could be reclaimed from urine with an initial ph 2 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 and urine with an initial ph 4 at a dosing ratio of 0 5 in urine with an initial ph of 2 ca p sediments were only present as cahpo4 2h2o and acp hap specifically the predominant sediment was assigned to cahpo4 2h2o with a ca p dosing ratio below 1 23 and then gradually transformed to acp hap as the ca p dosing ratio increased thus it facilitated the stepwise extraction of various ca p precipitates however in urine with an initial ph 4 it was quite challenging to avoid struvite coprecipitation for cahpo4 2h2o recovered at a ca p dosing ratio of 0 5 as well as mg containing impurities in the recovery for acp hap for further validation the variations in ca2 mg2 and nh4 n levels are presented in fig 6 d f a similar trend was observed for mg2 concentration in urine with initial ph 4 and 6 5 which both showed a notable drop followed by a rise and then a decrease again this was because the mg p sediments including struvite tended to coprecipitate when the ca oh 2 input was inadequate and then slowly converted to calcium phosphate as the dosing ratio increased moreover the nh4 n level decreased and then increased which was in good agreement with the simulation results in urine with an initial ph of 2 0 the mg2 concentration basically remained steady with a ca p dosing ratio less than 1 and then notably decreased with increasing dosing in combination with the simulation this result suggested that no mg p sediment was formed in the ph 2 0 urine system and only the precipitation of mg oh 2 led to a decrease in the mg2 concentration concurrently no obvious change was identified for nh4 n in this system the ca2 concentration in initial ph 2 0 system increased substantially as the ca p dosing ratio rose to 0 5 due to no precipitation while it decreased considerably as the dosing ratio ranged from 1 to 1 67 and then rose up as the dosing ratio was greater than 2 0 this was supported by the modeling simulation which showed that cahpo4 2h2o greatly precipitated within a dosing ratio range of 1 1 67 for ca2 in urine with initial ph levels of 4 0 and 6 5 its concentration increased slowly with a ca oh 2 addition ratio less than 2 0 followed by a rapid increase 3 4 4 simulation and elemental analysis for sediment composition as depicted in fig 3 b e in urine with an initial ph 6 5 the random dosage of ca oh 2 enables the formation of precipitates yet fig 7 a b illustrates that in urine with initial ph levels of 2 and 4 sediment can only be observed until the ca p ratio reaches 0 73 and 0 1 respectively as illustrated before low ph levels inhibited mg p precipitation accordingly in urine with an initial ph 2 mg adulteration was not available within a dosing ratio below 2 4 ca2 was alternately precipitated as cahpo4 2h2o and hap acp under various dosing ratios thus its content for the sediment product was expected to fluctuate however in urine with an initial ph 4 fig 7 a one or more mg p impurities may be present the results suggested that mg content could be reduced with a ca p ratio lower than 0 4 or approximately 1 67 fig 7 c d shows the component proportion of the products in initial ph 2 urine the targeted recovery for mono component sediment products such as acp hap cahpo4 2h2o and mg oh 2 could be implemented by quantitatively adjusting the ca p dosing ratio the feasibility for the stepwise recovery of these precipitates was ensured by the large ca oh 2 dosing interval however in the urine system with an initial ph of 4 the product was composed of 28 struvite and 72 acp hap at a ca p dosing ratio achieved complete p recovery recovery of the mono component product as acp hap in this system could only be achieved at a ca p ratio of 1 67 the elemental compositions of the sediment products were also determined fig s12 depicts that the contents of mg and k in sediment were positively correlated with the initial ph level at the same ca p dosing ratio the mg content for sediment at initial ph 2 was greatly reduced compared to those at higher initial ph conditions the fact that the fresh urine itself had a certain amount of mg2 made it difficult to completely exclude the presence of mg in the sediment although the model simulation indicated that the coprecipitation of mg p product could be avoided at a dosing ratio less than 2 in urine with initial ph 2 trace mg2 was still available in elemental composition analysis the existence of mg in the precipitates may be attributed to the following aspects at a low ca p dosing ratio the low supersaturation of acp allowed mg2 to compete with ca2 for p to form struvite due to the higher kinetic rate of precipitation for struvite than for acp kazadi mbamba et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 musvoto et al 2000 the coprecipitation of struvite and acp might form during the reaction of 6 h when the calcium phosphate precipitates have not fully transformed to the thermodynamically most stable phase hap lei et al 2017 additionally a minor amount of mg2 could be adsorbed on the surface of the ca p precipitates moreover as the ca p dosing ratio increased above 2 5 the precipitation of mg oh 2 appeared in all these urine systems then with the increase of ca p ratio mg2 gradually and completely precipitated as mg oh 2 resulting in an increase of mg content in precipitates therefore it is feasible to stabilize the urine and guarantee highly efficient p recovery by adjusting urine to be acidic in the stabilized urine with an initial ph of 2 there is an excellent potential to fully harvest p with less ca oh 2 consumption and reap high purity cahpo4 2h2o and hap acp the obtained p rich products can have extensive applications thus effectively eliminating the drawbacks of struvite as fertilizer 3 5 effect of the degree of hydrolysis dh of urine on p recovery 3 5 1 variation in p and ph levels during the p harvesting process fig s13 depicts the variation in p and ph levels for urine systems with different dhs for p recovery by ca oh 2 in fig s13 a b the residual p concentration was observed to increase as the initial dh increased indicating that the efficacy for p recovery at the same ca p dosing ratio decreased with the increasing dh this phenomenon was mainly because that the massive hco3 derived from urine hydrolysis competed with phosphate to bind ca2 ions in this situation caco3 dominated the precipitate thus reducing the p content of the sediment products it was also noted that p recovery by ca oh 2 was efficient at lower hydrolysis levels in urine with 5 dh initial ph 7 34 the p recovery efficiency was superior to 99 at ca p ratios greater than 1 67 even in the 15 dh system initial ph 9 35 the p recovery efficiency was still maintained at 89 4 93 2 95 6 and 97 2 at dosing ratios of 1 67 3 4 and 5 respectively however in 30 dh urine the p recovery efficiency fell to 68 at a ca p ratio of 1 67 although 90 6 recovery efficiency could be acquired at a dosing ratio of 5 the p content for the obtained sediment would be substantially weakened with this ca p dosing ratio beyond the stoichiometric ratio of capo4 typically urine hydrolysis elevated the ph level which facilitated p recovery by cacl2 and minimized the additional alkali consumption fig s13 c d illustrates the recovery of p by cacl2 from urine with various dh levels p harvesting performance for cacl2 was strongly impacted by the dh of urine the p recovery efficiency was promoted with the increase in the ca p dosing ratio at the same dh however dosing cacl2 was unsatisfactory for p recovery considering unfavorable factors such as the weak buffer capacity and low initial ph in urine with low dh and massive hco3 derived from high dh the maximum p recovery efficiency by cacl2 only reached to 65 2 at a ca p dosing ratio of 5 3 5 2 analysis of p content for products to further monitor the effect of dh on p recovery by ca oh 2 the elemental composition of sediment reclaimed by dosing ca oh 2 was measured and is demonstrated in fig s14 the p proportion in the product decreased with increasing dh at a fixed ca p ratio at a low dosing ratio the products possessed high p contents for instance the p content for products recovered from urine with different dhs was greater than 10 at a ca p dosing ratio of 1 67 which could reach 17 for a dh below 15 instead the p content would be reduced by raising the ca p ratio this was because in urine without hydrolysis elevated ph induced by a high dosing ratio may trigger the coprecipitate of mg oh 2 degrading the p content as the dh increased not only mg oh 2 but also a considerable coprecipitation of caco3 was present the p proportion in the collected product from urine with 60 dh was drastically reduced below 5 at high ca p dosing ratios a previous study demonstrated that the p content was only 1 5 for the product in a completely hydrolyzed urine by using ca oh 2 to completely recover p hao et al 2013 highly hydrolyzed urine was not conducive to the efficient p recovery by ca oh 2 which would require a great chemical consumption to bind with hco3 from hydrolysis and substantially reduce the p content for the product hence excessive dh for urine should be inhibited for efficient p recovery using calcium based materials urine stabilization would facilitate subsequent p recovery 3 6 an alternative strategy at a constant ca p dosing ratio ca oh 2 for p recovery can supply ca2 and oh both of which are the key components of hap nucleation and crystallization and thus the utilization of material can be maximized however the molar ratio of ca2 and oh for ca oh 2 was fixed generally the optimal dosing ratio for p recovery varied and was affected by factors including initial ph and initial p levels for real fresh urine in actual application thereby p harvesting from urine was implemented by dosing cacl2 at a ca p ratio of 1 67 and supplementing naoh as an alkali source and the corresponding precipitation evolution was probed 3 6 1 p and ph changes during alkali supplementation fig 8 a c demonstrates the p and ph variation in urine with different alkali supplies at a constant ca p dosing ratio the experimental data indicated that the required naoh dosage to achieve the complete p recovery was 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 mol l with a gradual decrease in the initial ph and the corresponding equilibrium ph was 9 28 9 87 and 9 7 respectively given that the ca p stoichiometry ratio for acp and hap was 1 5 and 1 67 respectively the complete recovery of p could be achieved without introducing interfering ions such as co3 2 and so4 2 by solely adjusting the ph and guaranteeing the ca p dosing ratio to be greater than 1 67 3 6 2 thermodynamic model simulation of the precipitation conversion fig 8 d f illustrates the sediment evolution via model simulation in urine with various alkali inputs at a fixed ca p dosing ratio only four precipitates were observed in all sets namely cahpo4 2h2o capo4 struvite and mg oh 2 it was noteworthy that sediment emerged without any alkali addition in initial the ph 6 5 system while no similar observation was noted in other systems which was consistent with the experimental data at an initial ph of 6 5 cahpo4 2h2o appeared without additional alkali input while at an initial ph 4 and ph 2 supplemental alkali was required to supersaturate cahpo4 2h2o further augmenting the alkalinity boosted the oh level in solution whereby cahpo4 2h2o progressively converted to acp hap moreover no formation of kmgpo4 6h2o or mghpo4 6h2o was present throughout the whole alkali input process this alternative approach can drastically diminish mg p coprecipitation compared with the method of exclusively using ca oh 2 nevertheless the coprecipitation of mg oh 2 could inevitably occur with increasing ph the potential maximum precipitation for mg oh 2 was 0 44 0 3 and 0 27 g l respectively constituting less than 2 of the total sediment mass based on the simulation results by applying a constant ca p dosing ratio and supplementing alkalinity to increase the ph to approximately 8 it is feasible to yield high purity calcium phosphate and obviate the impurities such as struvite and mg oh 2 3 7 potential targeted recovery of mg oh 2 the prospective to exact high purity cahpo4 2h2o acp hap and mg oh 2 at initial ph 2 is indicated in fig 6 a to further validate this proposal the acp hap deposit was retrieved by dosing ca oh 2 at a ca p ratio of 2 followed by further dosing naoh to elevate the ph level to 12 then the collected products were examined by xrd fig s15 presents the well crystallized characteristic peaks of mg oh 2 demonstrating the successful separation and recovery of the highly pure mg oh 2 precipitate the observed trace amount of caco3 impurity might be due to the introduction of co2 from air for mg oh 2 recovery the dosage of ca oh 2 as a ph elevating source required precise control since coprecipitation of ca oh 2 tended to form at a ph higher than 12 however it is not a concern for naoh as an alkaline supplement the stepwise harvesting of high purity ca p compounds and crystalline mg oh 2 can be effectuated by regulating the initial ph of fresh urine this approach can advance the knowledge of the design scheme and alternative methods for nutrient harvesting in source separated urine the practicality of the proposed strategy for p harvesting is discussed in text s5 4 conclusions in this study the strategy of precisely harvesting p from fresh human urine as high purity calcium phosphate was first proposed the p recovery performance was investigated as a function of key factors including chemical consumption initial p concentration initial mg2 concentration initial ph level and dh the thermodynamic model performed on phreeqc served as a great simulation and the theoretical results agreed with the experimental validation results further simulation provided the basis for better yielding insights into the precipitation mechanism the combination of model simulation and experimental validation explored the precise optimization of p harvesting performance the results revealed that a lower ph level acidic condition could avoid fresh urine hydrolysis and thus facilitate urine storage meanwhile the coprecipitation of struvite and mg oh 2 could be excluded by regulating the ca p dosing ratio to further improve p harvesting from urine in urine with an initial ph of 2 in a ca p dosing ratio range of 1 67 2 3 the purity of the calcium phosphate products could reach to 100 and the products mainly consisted of acp hap moreover the alternative dosing regimen of loading cacl2 and supplementing alkali at a constant ca p ratio was advanced and its effects on p harvesting and product composition were probed this option allowed for 100 p recovery and high purity calcium phosphate product furthermore calcium phosphate and mg oh 2 can be stepwise recovered by regulating the initial urine ph level in general for the precise and quantitative recovery of high purity calcium phosphate product from fresh source separated urine the integrated and developed technical treatment scheme we proposed would advance the knowledge of p harvesting and offer

15307,capacitive deionization cdi is an alternative desalination technology that uses electrochemical ion separation although several attempts have been made to maximize the energy efficiency and productivity of cdi with conventional control methods it is difficult to optimize the cdi processes because of the complex correlation between the operational conditions and the composition of feed water to address these challenges we applied deep reinforcement learning drl to automatically control the membrane capacitive deionization mcdi process which is one of the representative cdi processes to accomplish high energy efficiency while desalinating water in the drl model the numerical model is combined as the environment that provides states according to the actions the feed water conditions that is the input state of the drl were assumed to have a random salt concentration and constant foulant concentration the model was constructed to minimize energy consumption and maximize desalted water volume per cycle after training of 1 000 episodes the drl model achieved a 22 07 reduction in specific energy consumption from 0 054 to 0 042 kwh m 3 and 11 60 increase in water desalted water volume per cycle from 1 96 10 5 to 2 19 10 5 m3 achieving the desired degree of desalination compared to the first episode this improved performance was because the trained model selected the optimized operating conditions of current voltage and the number and intensity of flushing furthermore it was possible to train the model depending on demand by modifying the reward function of the drl model the fundamental principle described in this study for applying the drl model in mcdi operations can be the cornerstone of a fully automated water desalination process keywords membrane capacitive deionization deep reinforcement learning automation optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an alternative technology with great potential for brackish water desalination as it is chemical free and compact in operation xing et al 2020 unlike pressure or thermal based desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis and multiple effect distillation cdi is an electro driven technique operated at a low electric potential difference zhang et al 2020 cdi adsorbs ions from solutions to the electrode during the charging step and the electrodes are regenerated by desorbing the adsorbed ions during the discharging step various developments have been attempted to improve the efficiency of the cdi performance and expand its applicability shim et al 2021 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is one of the representative modifications of the conventional cdi which introduces ion exchange membranes on the electrode surface to improve ion selectivity electrosorption capacity and charge efficiency li and zou 2011 considerable research has been devoted to developing the desalination performance of mcdi for example several studies have investigated structural conditions such as flow mode electrode material and design to enhance the desalination performance of mcdi cheng et al 2019 kim et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in addition because the electrochemical processes are sensitive to operational conditions such as voltage current and flow rate a few experimental studies have investigated the effect of the operational conditions ha et al 2021 han et al 2015 seo et al 2010 despite the progress in multiple aspects the application of mcdi has still been limited to actual implementation folaranmi et al 2020 for example previous studies have been carried out under fixed feed water conditions throughout the entire operation period lu et al 2017 shin et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 in contrast in the real environment the composition and concentration of inflow water dynamically change affecting the salt removal efficiency and energy consumption biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 for example when the mcdi process is operated for multiple cycles electrode fouling occurs in contaminants in which the influent accumulate on the electrode surface this fouling often decreases the salt adsorption capacity while consuming more energy thus physical or chemical flushing is required to remove the fouling layer to recover desalination performance but only a few studies have been independently conducted on the fouling issue shim et al 2021 yoon et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to devise a strategy to optimize the operation by comprehensively considering various environmental parameters for the practical application of mcdi such as desalination or water treatment physical and numerical modeling approaches have attempted to provide optimized decisions to improve the cost effectivity of the process by simulating ion transport and adsorption hawks et al 2018 liu et al 2022a ramachandran et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 physical and numerical models have shown superior accuracy for mcdi or cdi process prediction as interpretable models based on equations representing the physical and chemical interactions of mcdi or cdi processes nordstrand and dutta 2021 yoon et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2012 however as mentioned above mcdi technology is difficult to control with the classical method as there are many operating conditions and water quality factors that affect water treatment performance beyond the range that can be simulated by physical and numerical modeling syafiie et al 2011 recently a few studies utilized the deep learning algorithm to predict the desalination performance of mcdi or cdi by only considering the relationship between parameters saffarimiandoab et al 2021 son et al 2021 although those data driven models showed remarkably increased prediction accuracies compared to the theoretical modeling such approaches have not progressed to control the process likely due to the lack of sequential control according to demands reinforcement learning rl an artificial intelligence method based on rewarding desired behaviors and or punishing undesired ones is an emerging tool that can address this challenge of the existing optimization techniques garrison et al 2013 one of the greatest advantages of rl is that the algorithm does not require the understanding of all complex processes because it learns the optimum control methods through trial and error interactions between the environment and agent zhu et al 2020 thus unlike other ai techniques such as deep learning the training dataset is not necessary to train the rl model owing to this advantage several studies have considered the application of rl algorithms to optimize wastewater treatment processes while minimizing environmental issues hernández del olmo et al 2018 hernandez del olmo et al 2011 syafiie et al 2011 although rl has the potential to address complex interactions between operational conditions and process performance to the best of our knowledge studies that employ rl to optimize cdi systems have not been reported yet in this study deep reinforcement learning drl was used to develop the automatic control model which optimizes the desalination performance of mcdi specifically the objective of the control is to minimize energy consumption and maximize desalted water volume per cycle under conditions similar to the real environment various salt concentrations in the presence of foulants while desalinating the desired amount of salt and implementing the proper number and intensity of flushing to accomplish this purpose we aimed to 1 introduce an optimization framework for the mcdi system that is valid in the real environment by combining one of the state of the art numerical models for the mcdi process that contains single multi ion adsorption as well as electrode fouling with the rl algorithm yoon et al 2022 2 identify the optimal settings of rl that allow the mcdi system to be controlled effectively by comparing three agents and tuning the hyper parameters and 3 investigate the improvements of the mcdi process through the drl model and the adaptability of the trained drl model 2 materials and methods 2 1 mcdi system 2 1 1 mcdi module in this study the mcdi system employed a customized mcdi module consisting of an electrode current collector and spacer the carbon electrodes were separated from a commercial mcdi module e 100 siontech inc korea modifying the size to 4 4 cm for the bottom cdi and 4 3 cm for the top cdi the size of the top cdi was smaller than that of the bottom cdi to secure space for water to flow in and out the two kinds of the ion exchange polymer were separately sprayed on the electrodes cation polymer solution so3h ion exchange capacity of 1 7 1 8 meq g 1 for cation exchange membrane and anion polymer solution nr4br ion exchange capacity of 1 4 1 5 meq g 1 for anion exchange membrane the graphite foil 99 8 purity ls538884 goodfellow cambridge ltd uk was used as the current collector by attaching to the back of the carbon electrodes to separate the electrodes and allow the feed water to flow a spacer made of polyamide 12 was placed between the electrodes the spacer has a 4 4 cm area the same size as the bottom cdi and 0 5 mm thickness 2 1 2 operation and evaluation the battery cycler wbcs3000 wonatech co ltd korea supplied current while recording electrical data such as voltage resistance and energy a constant current was applied to the mcdi cell for one cycle which consisted of a set of adsorption and desorption steps the adsorption step was continued until the cell voltage rose to 1 2 v the applied current was reversed after the adsorption step to desorb the ions from the electrodes until the cell voltage decreased to 0 v a gear pump emp 600 a ems tech korea controlled the flow rate of the feed water to constantly circulate water through the mcdi module the performance of the mcdi process was evaluated per cycle based on the specific energy consumption sec and the desalted water volume per cycle sec and desalted water volume per cycle were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 son et al 2020 1 sec kwh m 3 i a d s 0 t a d s v a d s d t t a d s 2 desalted water volume per cycle m 3 t a d s where r is the ideal gas constant t is the absolute temperature k c 0 is the salt concentration of the feed water mm c d is the salt concentration of the product water mm γ is the water recovery i a d s and v a d s are the applied current a and voltage v during adsorption respectively is the flow rate m3 s 1 and t a d s is the time of adsorption s note that both sec and desalted water volume per cycle are greatly affected by various operations which is likely due to the presence of the tads for example when the flow rate is increased the adsorption time decreases owing to increased resistance causing a reduction in desalted water volume the adsorption time can be increased by dropping the current but this could also increase the sec 2 2 deep reinforcement learning this study proposes a drl method involving the mcdi transport model as an environment in which a deep neural network agent learns to control operational conditions along the state of the mcdi process fig 1 the key elements of rl are the environment agent state action and reward qiang and zhongli 2011 the interaction between the elements of rl plays an important role in controlling the target system based on the purpose qiang and zhongli 2011 the adequate setting of elements is necessary for applying rl to the mcdi system xu et al 2020 this is described in this section of the drl algorithm the learning progressed in the rl algorithm used in this study as stated in this procedure a step 0 initialization of the rl setting the mcdi transport model was validated in a specific range for utilization in the environment first the agent randomly chooses actions within the action range b step 1 interactions between elements of rl the agent provides the selected actions to the environment and estimates the state and reward c step 2 training to find the optimized policy the agent repeats step 1 to increase the reward by developing a policy based on the precious states and rewards results the reinforcement algorithm was coded in python 3 6 the actions and states were collected in a space box and the environment was constructed using a gym developed by openai brockman et al 2016 2 2 1 environment mcdi numerical model the environmental setting determines the target system of rl the recently developed mcdi transport model yoon et al 2022 which is an expansion of the modified donnan model was used in this study as the drl environment this mcdi model is a state of the art numerical model because it can predict mono and divalent ions under both pure salt and fouling conditions the model simulated the mcdi system in terms of the applied current voltage sec etc with high accuracy and the simulated data were collected at 1 s interval since the structure of the mcdi cell used in this study is the same as the previous one model parameters such as the size of the mcdi compartments electrodes and spacer porosity of the electrode and diffusion coefficients of ions in the membrane and spacer were adopted from a previous study yoon et al 2022 for rl the mcdi transport model was converted into a function form which has 6 inputs influent salt concentration inflow foulant concentration current flow rate fouling thickness and operation time and four outputs effluent salt concentration adsorption time sec and desalted water volume per cycle the mcdi transport model considers humic acid as a representative natural organic matter and assumes that the feed water contained nacl and cacl2 in a ratio of 5 5 the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation derived from the experimental data of the previous data the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation derived from the experimental data of the previous data although electrode fouling is a complex phenomenon fouling thickness was selected as a representative factor because the linear correlation between fouling thickness and sac reduction was verified in a previous study yoon et al 2022 in the future studies the drl model could consider more complex fouling phenomena by utilizing advanced models that contained various fouling mechanisms through this model the environment yielded the states of the next step and the reward in response to the actions of the states of the previous step 2 2 2 agents a2c td3 and ppo2 the agent acts as the operator of the actual process control which determines actions by observing the state of the environment the agent of the drl model utilizes neural networks that help the model efficiently find optimized actions by simplifying the complex relationship between the reward state and action the agent learns a policy that maximizes the reward to achieve the process objectives arulkumaran et al 2017 our framework combined python and matlab programs to calculate the action and state from the environment the following three representative agents were investigated the advantage actor critic a2c is based on the actor critic algorithm which uses two interacting networks to combine policy and value based algorithms the actor network determines actions based on the given states by returning the probability of each action to learn the optimal policy the critic network evaluates and adjusts the policy by calculating the value function required to maximize future rewards bekkouch et al 2022 the a2c algorithm adopts the advantage function with the state value function as the value function of the critic network to determine a better action compared to the other actions of the specific state this value function decreases the variance of the policy network and stabilizes the model kuutti et al 2019 owing to these advantages of the a2c many studies have applied the a2c to complex environments in this study multiple a2c agents were asynchronously used to prevent the use of a replay buffer as described by mnih et al 2016 that is technically we used a3c to utilize various new updated data from various environments twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient td3 is an approach developed from the deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg ddpg was regarded as an effective algorithm to handle the continuous action space by linking the q learning and policy gradient method however it is sensitive to the hyper parameter tuning and overestimates the q values at initial learning silver et al 2014 yang et al 2020 to address these issues td3 introduced three techniques the clipped double q learning twin the delayed policy update delayed and target policy smoothing fujimoto et al 2018 compared to ddpg tds highly improves the learning speed and performance during the continuous control process therefore td3 has recently shown prominent achievements in the high dimensional continuous optimization problems dankwa and zheng 2019 proximal policy optimization ppo is an algorithm that combines the concepts of the actor critic algorithm a2c and trust region policy optimization algorithm trpo thus it has multiple workers for actors and critics and uses a trust region to improve the actor instead of mixing new and old policies schulman et al 2015 2017 ppo contains a simplified objective function but it optimizes policy through repeated learning during several epochs ppo2 which is a version of ppo runs on graphics processing units gpu and utilizes vectorized environments for multiprocessing ppo2 has two main advantages first ppo2 solves complex problems with high performance and low computational complexity this is the reason ppo2 is one of the most popular model free rl agents bøhn et al 2019 second ppo2 is an on policy algorithm that converges to the optimal points faster than off policy algorithm liu et al 2022b the on policy algorithm updates the policy through the latest policy experiences and reduces the number of samples for agent training therefore ppo2 shows a more stable and faster policy convergence 2 2 3 state description the states were derived when the agent entered the environment showing the results of the rl trial the agent determines the next actions by considering the state to reflect previously trained information syafiie et al 2011 in process control which is a continuous operation it is important to configure the state by reflecting the time information since the state and action have a reciprocal relationship the state should include information on which the action is based and the result is derived by action through the environment thus the states of rl for mcdi system control are defined based on the characteristics of the feed water concentration operation time charging discharging time and control objectives that are factors measured and observed to control actual processes the state in our rl structure consists of four variables inflow salt concentration inflow foulant concentration operation time and fouling thickness blue box in fig 1 to assume that water continued to flow into the mcdi module at different salt concentrations the inflow salt concentration state was randomly set to values in the range of 16 30 mm the inflow foulant concentration state was fixed at 10 ppm to represent the continuous flow of the foulant into the module the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation approximated by the experimental data of the previous study equation s1 yoon et al 2022 sec and desalted water volume per cycle were calculated after the effluent salt concentration voltage and time were simulated using the mcdi transport model 2 2 4 action description the agent performs actions by reflecting on the state of the environment and rewards to achieve operational goals the operational conditions of the mcdi system such as the current feed flow rate and flushing which affect the mcdi performance were selected as actions performance and are used in actual process control were selected as actions green box in fig 1 the salt concentration of the produced water and energy consumption were determined by tuning the current and feed flow rate which are direct control parameters the ranges of the current and flow rate were selected as suggested in table 1 the mcdi transport model was validated for these ranges table 2 the current and flow rate actions generated by the agent acted as the input variables of the mcdi transport model in a real environment there are various contaminants that cause fouling on the electrode surface of mcdi shim et al 2021 the surface cleaning of the electrode through flushing is required to maintain mcdi performance during long term operation huang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the previous studies verified the necessity of flushing by investigating the fouling reduction of 16 24 in the mcdi desalination performance shim et al 2021 yoon et al 2022 the value of the flushing action was expressed as the removal rate of the fouling thickness eq 3 describes how the flushing action decreases the fouling thickness 3 t h i c k f a f t e r μ m t h i c k f 1 a f where t h i c k f a f t e r is the fouling thickness after flushing implementation and a f is the flushing intensity which is determined by the action the range of the flushing action 1 a f started from 0 4 because the complete removal of fouling is impossible owing to irreversible fouling kimura et al 2004 remize et al 2010 the flushing action indirectly affected the model by changing the state of fouling thickness which is the input of the mcdi transport model 2 2 5 reward and penalty the reward function is a factor leading the training process of rl to satisfy the operation purposes pan et al 2020 the reward function calculates the rewards and penalties by obtaining the changed states from the environment to evaluate the actions of the agent the agent develops a strategy for controlling the process by rewarding and punishing the values for each step the goal of control with rl is to maximize sec and desalted water volume per cycle in the presence of naturally driven foulants by desalinating a specific amount of salt yellow box in fig 1 eq 4 shows that the range of desalinated salt acts as a constraint to determine the optimal operating conditions the reward function employed a linear equation that included the sec and the desalted water volume per cycle states the reward was penalized by the implementation of the flushing action which required additional operational costs the reward and penalty are expressed by eqs 4 and 5 respectively i f d c 0 9 mm i f desalted water volume per cycle 1 3 10 5 m 3 r a r 1 desalted water volume per cycle a r 2 sec e l s e r a r 2 desalted water volume per cycle e l s e 4 r a r 1 desalted water volume per cycle a r 2 sec 5 p a p f l u s h i n g where r is the reward a r 1 is the constant for adjusting the unit and importance of desalted water volume per cycle a r 2 is a constant to adjust the unit and importance of sec p is the penalty and a p is the constant to adjust the unit and importance of the flushing intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction and optimization of drl model this section describes the drl model setup which includes framework construction optimization and training fig 2 the procedure initially progressed with the setting of the action state and environment the parameters and equations of the reward function were determined based on the simulation results of the environment numerical model to identify the agent that best fits our model framework the performances of the three agents were compared after the key compositions of the drl model were finalized the hyperparameters were tuned and the optimal drl model was constructed fig 2a the model training was continued until the reward sum converged to the maximum value fig 2b 3 1 1 analysis of the numerical simulation results the adsorption time and effluent salt concentration can be tuned by controlling the current and flow rate which are easily adjustable parameters during the operation fig 3 a and b depicts the effluent salt concentration profile as a function of the current and flow rate we can explicitly observe that higher applied currents and lower flow rates show a greater reduction in the salinity of the produced water because the constant high current strongly adsorbs the salt ions from the water by increasing the total charge per unit water volume treated in a cycle fig 3c and table 2a zhao et al 2012 also the small amount of salt ions adsorbed under the high flow rate is attributed to insufficient contact time between the salt ions in the feed water and carbon electrode kim et al 2019 a similar trend was observed for sec fig 3d and table 2b for example for a feed water salt concentration of 20 mm the maximum sec among the simulated data was 0 133 kwh m 3 4 ml min 1 flow rate and 45 ma current and the minimum sec among the simulated data was 0 025 kwh m 3 11 ml min 1 flow rate and 25 ma current the correlation between the amount of salt removed and sec suggests that more energy is consumed to adsorb more salt ions as anticipated when the flow rate is relatively slow local resistance growth which occurs throughout the solution as the residence time increases causes an increase in the electric potential difference between the carbon electrodes he et al 2021 shim et al 2021 consequently this leads to an increase in the consumption of energy to remove salt ions from the feed water in contrast the desalted water volume per cycle as a function of flow rate showed an inverse trend compared to that of desalinated salt and sec fig 3e and table 2c for example when the flow rate increased from 4 ml min 1 to 6 ml min 1 under feed water with a 20 mm salt concentration condition the desalted water volume per cycle rate was also linearly increased by 1 48 times from 1 3 10 5 to 2 0 10 5 m 3 conversely when the applied current was increased by 1 5 times from 30 ma to 45 ma the desalted water volume per cycle rate decreased by 1 78 times the linear relationship between the flow rate and desalted water volume per cycle can be explained by the shorter adsorption time fig 3a and eq 2 in the voltage cut off operation the faster the voltage reaches a limited value 1 2 v during the adsorption step when a higher current is applied which causes a reduction in the adsorption time for example the adsorption cycle time decreased with an increase in the applied current which was 106 s at 25 ma and 257 s at 45 ma 3 1 2 reward function the optimized mcdi system should produce more desalinated water at a low energy demand thus to optimize sec and desalted water volume per cycle simultaneously a reward function of the drl contained these two performance indicators together by referring to the simulation results in section 3 1 1 in eq 4 the differences in units and importance between sec and desalted water volume per cycle were balanced by implementing the constants ar1 and ar2 which factorized the two values furthermore to achieve a certain degree of desalination we adopted the desalinated salt amount as the constraint of the reward function fig 2c not only do constraints regulate the optimization process but they also encourage the agent to quickly determine the shortest path of control thereby minimizing the computational time of the algorithm during training adams et al 2021 thus an additional constraint related to desalted water volume per cycle was introduced to decrease the computational time of the drl model 3 1 3 agent selection there are various drl agents available depending on the features of the target problem such as the dimension data type and complexity bagherzadeh et al 2021 to figure out the best performing agent for the mcdi process optimization we evaluated the performance of agents in terms of stability and performance a2c td3 and ppo2 were trained separately with the default hyperparameters and networks which were provided by openai fujimoto et al 2018 mnih et al 2016 schulman et al 2017 the training was implemented during 1000 episodes which is sufficient to make the reward sum converge to a particular range the initial reward sum of each agent has a similar value 249 by setting a specific seed number 433 that adjusts the first trial of the agent identically fig 4 a as shown in the results of the last episode ppo2 showed the highest improvement in the reward sum from the initial value compared with a2c and td3 table 3 in addition ppo2 converged stably to its optimal state in contrast a2c fluctuated the reward sum largely after the 500th episode reducing the reliability of the training td3 showed no variation during the entire training episode because the actions and states were constant regardless of the inflow salt concentration yellow line in fig 4a it is evident that the td3 agent does not produce a feasible solution to the mcdi process optimization problem moreover when comparing the computational times for each agent table 3 and fig s1 ppo2 exhibited the lowest computational time in the last episode therefore considering both performance and efficiency we selected ppo2 as the agent of the drl model in this study 3 1 4 hyper parameter optimization as ppo2 is an algorithm that updates the policy using a surrogate loss function to prevent the degradation of the rl performance the initial hyperparameters of ppo2 have less of an effect on performance despite this advantage hyperparameter tuning remains essential for improving the training speed and efficiency of the drl model by determining the best hyperparameters for the drl model alves and mateus 2022 four hyperparameters were manually selected by considering other studies and set differently from the default value policy number of training mini batches per update number of epochs when optimizing the surrogate and the number of total episodes the input dataset used in our study is 1 d which does not require a complex network that requires more computational time thus the multilayer perceptron mlp was adopted as policy during the policy update process the experiences of the agent such as the state and action were collected to improve the policy the number of training mini batches per update and number of epochs when optimizing the surrogate are important parameters for setting the number of gathered experiences before changing from the old policy to the new policy the number of episodes should be set sufficiently to continue the rl training until the reward converges to a specific number the selected hyperparameters are summarized in table 4 after optimizing the hyperparameters the drl model showed improved performance expressed as the reward sum fig 4b tuning the hyperparameters increased the reward sum of the last episode from 1 45 default to 44 25 optimized the main reason for the improvement in performance is the increased deviation of actions despite the states being changed during the episode the current actions in the last episode which were trained with the default hyperparameters almost converged to 45 ma fig s2a this indicates that the agent did not react properly to the state furthermore flushing was implemented only once throughout the process red arrow in fig s2b the changes in hyperparameters solved this issue by increasing the number of training mini batches per update and the number of epochs that determine the amount of trial and error experience more detailed control was conducted based on the increased amount of collected data which enhanced the process optimization performance it also markedly accelerates the speed of convergence to optimal performance in the default hyper parameter case the agent caused a negative reward sum until the 500th episode followed by a slightly steep increment orange line in fig 4a and b however after tuning the hyperparameters the reward sum reached the positive reward sum in the 100th episode and fine changes occurred during the remaining episodes blue line in fig 4b 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 drl model training for each episode the drl model was trained with 100 datasets in one episode and tested using 20 datasets the states in one episode were chronologically continuous the reward sum is the total reward in one training episode and the maximum reward sum indicates that the mcdi performance reaches the optimal state while satisfying constraints fig 4b the hyper parameters and factors used in the reward sum were chosen based on the results in section 3 1 results table 4 the reward sum increased continuously as the number of episodes increased the initial training episodes show a drastic increase from 248 99 to 20 13 in the reward sum within the 380th episode blue line in fig 4b at the beginning of training the penalty values were higher than the reward values which caused a negative reward sum the agent tried to understand the environment through a trial and error search thus incorrect controls occurred which caused a penalty and required more computational time to prevent a reduction in the reward due to the penalty perolat et al 2017 after the policy was developed through the training the reward sum converged into the specific range containing the maximum reward sum which shows that drl achieves the purpose the detailed results of the drl application for the mcdi process show that the agent learns how to control the mcdi process to achieve the desired sec and desalted water volume per cycle while satisfying the desalinated salt amount constraint it should be noted that the variables used in the first episode were randomly selected implying that the performance comparisons described later indicate that there are improvements over this first episode fig 5 first the agent did not satisfy the constraints of the reward function in most steps of one episode and increased the reward sum by reducing the number of flushing implementations green box i in fig 5a thus the reward was not calculated through the main equation that contains our purpose maximize desalted water volume per cycle and minimize sec causing sec and desalted water volume per cycle to be changed to the opposite of our purpose green box i in fig 5b after the 37th episode the number of steps that satisfied the constraints started increasing which indicates that drl recognized how to overcome the hurdles to accomplish the main control purposes orange box ii in fig 5a the average value of sec and desalted water volume per cycle in one episode steeply decreased and increased simultaneously to improve the reward sum orange box ii in fig 5b however the number of flushing implementations reached almost zero at the 127th episode orange box ii in fig 5a and remained until the 473th yellow box ii in fig 5a this means that the drl was still focused on excluding the penalty and not optimizing the flushing action by considering the influence of the fouling thickness state on the mcdi performance flushing also began to adjust as the model satisfied the constraints in all steps to determine the appropriate number of flushing cycles the fluctuation continually occurred after approximately the 500th episode white box iii in fig 5a this clearly shows that the agent was able to determine a balanced way for mcdi operation by receiving fewer penalties finally the model controlled the mcdi process so that the sec decreased by 22 07 from 0 054 to 0 042 kwh m 3 and the desalted water volume per cycle increased by 11 60 from 1 96 10 5 to 2 19 10 5 m3 compared to the first episode with 28 numbers of flushing under all steps satisfied constraints fig 5b specifically the actions changed as the agent learned to control the mcdi process the range of action in the applied current was reduced to the range that satisfied the constraint which was the first hurdle for increasing the reward fig 6 a and b unlike the action of the applied current which varies according to the input state the action of the flow rate was changed to a fixed value of 11 ml min 1 fig 6a and c because the applied current is a more sensitive operational variable to the desalinated salt amount than the flow rate under the given condition fig s3 within the designated ranges of the current and flow rate the control of the current value affected the effluent salt concentration desalted water volume per cycle and sec fig s3 for example to desalinate 20 more 20 mm 7 ml min 1 and 5 ma 20 more applied current is required which is less than that of the flow rate 31 therefore the agent determines an effective control method while reducing the computational time by focusing on the current action as stated previously the fouling thickness which directly and indirectly affects the mcdi performance was reduced by the flushing action flushing requires energy and a temporary pause in the process thus the execution of flushing was applied as the penalty after being balanced by the factor ap in eq 5 the bar graphs in fig 6d describe the timing and intensity of flushing after training the number and intensity of the flushing implementation were controlled only to keep the fouling thickness below the proper range middle bar graph in fig 6d whereas frequent high intensity flushing was applied during the first episode top bar graph in fig 6d consequently as the training continued the sec range narrowed until the value which was initially in the wide range of 0 025 0 105 kwh m 3 converged to 0 042 kwh m 3 fig 6e similarly the wide range of desalted water volume per cycle values decreased until they converged to a certain range fig 6f in terms of the extent of desalination the trained model exhibited a similar value in the last episode compared with that of the first episode fig s4 for example when a feed salt concentration of 35 8 mm is used fig s4a an effluent salt concentration of 34 8 mm was found after training whereas that of 34 9 mm was found before training when a low feed salt concentration of 18 mm was used fig s4b an even lower effluent salt concentration of 17 mm was found after training whereas that of 17 3 mm was found before training collectively the rl model exhibited better performance in terms of low energy consumption and greater desalted water volume per cycle at a similar degree of water desalination therefore it can be concluded that it is possible to adjust the optimal constant value by considering the inflow feed water conditions and implementing the appropriate action 3 2 2 apply the optimized drl model to test practical application the test was implemented to verify the trained dpl model for 20 steps orange boxes in fig 6a and d which was completely separated from the trained dataset to evaluate the generalizability and flexibility of the drl model unlike training that started in pristine fouling conditions the test had an initial fouling thickness of 250 μm to ensure that proper action was taken to reduce the fouling thickness even under conditions where the fouling was already stacked on the carbon electrode pink box in fig 6d an average reward of 0 4830 was obtained in the test step which was similar to that in the training step 0 5905 table 5 specifically the test of the trained drl model exhibited sec values of 0 043 kwh m 3 and desalted water volume per cycle values of 2 1 10 5 m 3 pink boxes in fig 6e and f simultaneously the constraints were satisfied in all steps in the test sets thus the amount of desalinated salt in all steps was higher than 0 9 mm this demonstrates that the trained drl model can consistently control the process to accomplish optimization even with unfamiliar data 3 3 adaptability and future improvements in real world processes operations have different control strategies depending on the environment being implemented or the applied industry to discuss the extended application of the proposed drl model we further investigated the control results with different factors the sec adjusted factor ar2 in eq 4 in the reward sum represents the inverse importance of sec during optimization for example the higher the sec adjusted factor the lower the importance of the sec value i e the higher the importance of desalted water volume per cycle this is likely because when a higher sec adjusted factor is used small changes in sec are largely reflected thus in order to assume a situation in which the sec is more important than desalted water volume per cycle the factor was normalized by taking the value of 2 compared to the value used in section 3 1 value of 38 as a standard number the reduction in sec of each control result shows a linear relationship with the factor when the normalized ar2 factor of 2 was used the sec was increased by 15 75 whereas the sec was decreased by 3 06 when the normalized ar2 factor of 2 was used fig 7 a during the test step the same pattern of decreased sec with increased desalted water volume per cycle was observed when a higher ar2 factor was used fig 7b therefore the control results can be easily managed depending on the operational preference according to the setting of the reward equations in the drl model although the proposed drl model showed excellent ability to control the mcdi process with great flexibility depending on demand for in field applications several issues still need to be addressed first the variety of feed compositions should be considered the drl model used in this study consisted of a numerical mcdi model that only considered two representative ions nacl and cacl2 and one representative foulant humic acid in contrast in a real environment various contaminants and ions are present in feed water additionally because the numerical mcdi model simulated the experimental results conducted with a wide spacer 0 5 mm that was utilized to observe the fouling thickness by optical coherence tomography the simulation results showed a low salt removal rate 3 12 at 20 mm table 2a even under the same salt removal capacity of the electrodes owing to the increased water volume between the electrodes yoon et al 2022 from our perspective it seems practically impossible to build a numerical model that can reflect every aspect of the real environment thus applying a deep learning model to the drl as an environment could be a great option to reflect the physicochemical interactions as much as possible second the drl model should include the characteristics of more diverse operation conditions such as zero voltage desorption and constant voltage operation and more various cdi constructions such as flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi and inverted capacitive deionization icdi to improve the versatility of the model the mcdi process was chosen as a representative of cdi in this study owing to its structural similarity with superior desalination performance when compared to cdi and an mcdi model contained fouling indexes has recently been developed yoon et al 2022 additionally the drl model is sufficiently able to adapt to other processes by changing the settings of the model such as the environment state action and reward the use of thermodynamic energy efficiency tee or productivity is a reasonable strategy for comparing different processes alkhadra et al 2022 hawks et al 2019 son et al 2020 wang et al 2019 when building a drl model containing a single reward function by considering tee or productivity it is necessary to be cautious when setting an appropriate constraint because there is a possibility that the actions of the agent converge to an extremely low flow rate or a high current to maximize the tee in a simple manner additionally it is necessary to consider the combination with numerical and physical models that show superior performances in simulating ion selectivity in order to utilize drl for ion selectivity control which has been considered one of the promising applications of cdi technology gamaethiralalage et al 2021 guyes et al 2021 liu et al 2020 qin et al 2019a b ramachandran et al 2019 shocron et al 2022 for example the drl model can suggest an appropriate applied current or pulsed current upon charging based on the desired removal of a certain ion and monitoring data finally an actual desalination system that is linked to the drl model should be built and demonstrated in the field to verify the feasibility of the automation tool proposed in this study this demonstration is a very important step as it not only avoids test measurement errors regulations for safety and equipment failures but also trains the drl model with more practical data one essential consideration when linking the actual system with the drl model is improving the training speed of the drl model because the drl model develops the control strategy through trial and error training the process optimization using the drl model could spend more time compared to those of physical and numerical models which can easily ignore simulation in the extreme range collectively this study provides the fundamental principle based on the data simulated by numerical models for applying the drl model to actual operation which will be the cornerstone of the fully automated electrochemical desalination process 4 conclusions this study aimed to automatically control the operational parameters of the mcdi process such as the applied current flow rate and flushing to optimize the process under various feed water concentrations the drl algorithm which uses state of the art numerical mcdi models as the environment was developed to accomplish this objective we evaluated the performance of drl by sec and desalted water volume per cycle while considering the desalinated concentration as a constraint the major conclusions are summarized as follows the fundamental elements of the drl were established by considering its performance and stability the reward function was determined based on simulation data with adjusted factors among the three agents ppo2 a2c and td3 ppo2 was selected with manually tuned hyperparameters because of its superior stability and control performance the performance of drl was improved after training demonstrating a 22 of reduction in sec and an 11 increase in desalted water volume per cycle the drl automatically controlled the mcdi process along with the influent salt concentration maintaining a fouling thickness of 86 μm 0 042 kwh m 3 sec and 2 2 10 5 m3 desalted water volume per cycle during the training step the test results of the trained drl model showed a similar performance to the training results indicating that the model was successfully constructed for global applications the drl can weigh sec differently by changing a number of factors that represent the importance based on the main operation purpose the sec increased by 20 by reducing the a2 factor from 40 2 to 36 2 thus it has the flexibility to be applied to various industries depending on local demands declaration of

15307,capacitive deionization cdi is an alternative desalination technology that uses electrochemical ion separation although several attempts have been made to maximize the energy efficiency and productivity of cdi with conventional control methods it is difficult to optimize the cdi processes because of the complex correlation between the operational conditions and the composition of feed water to address these challenges we applied deep reinforcement learning drl to automatically control the membrane capacitive deionization mcdi process which is one of the representative cdi processes to accomplish high energy efficiency while desalinating water in the drl model the numerical model is combined as the environment that provides states according to the actions the feed water conditions that is the input state of the drl were assumed to have a random salt concentration and constant foulant concentration the model was constructed to minimize energy consumption and maximize desalted water volume per cycle after training of 1 000 episodes the drl model achieved a 22 07 reduction in specific energy consumption from 0 054 to 0 042 kwh m 3 and 11 60 increase in water desalted water volume per cycle from 1 96 10 5 to 2 19 10 5 m3 achieving the desired degree of desalination compared to the first episode this improved performance was because the trained model selected the optimized operating conditions of current voltage and the number and intensity of flushing furthermore it was possible to train the model depending on demand by modifying the reward function of the drl model the fundamental principle described in this study for applying the drl model in mcdi operations can be the cornerstone of a fully automated water desalination process keywords membrane capacitive deionization deep reinforcement learning automation optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an alternative technology with great potential for brackish water desalination as it is chemical free and compact in operation xing et al 2020 unlike pressure or thermal based desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis and multiple effect distillation cdi is an electro driven technique operated at a low electric potential difference zhang et al 2020 cdi adsorbs ions from solutions to the electrode during the charging step and the electrodes are regenerated by desorbing the adsorbed ions during the discharging step various developments have been attempted to improve the efficiency of the cdi performance and expand its applicability shim et al 2021 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is one of the representative modifications of the conventional cdi which introduces ion exchange membranes on the electrode surface to improve ion selectivity electrosorption capacity and charge efficiency li and zou 2011 considerable research has been devoted to developing the desalination performance of mcdi for example several studies have investigated structural conditions such as flow mode electrode material and design to enhance the desalination performance of mcdi cheng et al 2019 kim et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in addition because the electrochemical processes are sensitive to operational conditions such as voltage current and flow rate a few experimental studies have investigated the effect of the operational conditions ha et al 2021 han et al 2015 seo et al 2010 despite the progress in multiple aspects the application of mcdi has still been limited to actual implementation folaranmi et al 2020 for example previous studies have been carried out under fixed feed water conditions throughout the entire operation period lu et al 2017 shin et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 in contrast in the real environment the composition and concentration of inflow water dynamically change affecting the salt removal efficiency and energy consumption biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 for example when the mcdi process is operated for multiple cycles electrode fouling occurs in contaminants in which the influent accumulate on the electrode surface this fouling often decreases the salt adsorption capacity while consuming more energy thus physical or chemical flushing is required to remove the fouling layer to recover desalination performance but only a few studies have been independently conducted on the fouling issue shim et al 2021 yoon et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to devise a strategy to optimize the operation by comprehensively considering various environmental parameters for the practical application of mcdi such as desalination or water treatment physical and numerical modeling approaches have attempted to provide optimized decisions to improve the cost effectivity of the process by simulating ion transport and adsorption hawks et al 2018 liu et al 2022a ramachandran et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 physical and numerical models have shown superior accuracy for mcdi or cdi process prediction as interpretable models based on equations representing the physical and chemical interactions of mcdi or cdi processes nordstrand and dutta 2021 yoon et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2012 however as mentioned above mcdi technology is difficult to control with the classical method as there are many operating conditions and water quality factors that affect water treatment performance beyond the range that can be simulated by physical and numerical modeling syafiie et al 2011 recently a few studies utilized the deep learning algorithm to predict the desalination performance of mcdi or cdi by only considering the relationship between parameters saffarimiandoab et al 2021 son et al 2021 although those data driven models showed remarkably increased prediction accuracies compared to the theoretical modeling such approaches have not progressed to control the process likely due to the lack of sequential control according to demands reinforcement learning rl an artificial intelligence method based on rewarding desired behaviors and or punishing undesired ones is an emerging tool that can address this challenge of the existing optimization techniques garrison et al 2013 one of the greatest advantages of rl is that the algorithm does not require the understanding of all complex processes because it learns the optimum control methods through trial and error interactions between the environment and agent zhu et al 2020 thus unlike other ai techniques such as deep learning the training dataset is not necessary to train the rl model owing to this advantage several studies have considered the application of rl algorithms to optimize wastewater treatment processes while minimizing environmental issues hernández del olmo et al 2018 hernandez del olmo et al 2011 syafiie et al 2011 although rl has the potential to address complex interactions between operational conditions and process performance to the best of our knowledge studies that employ rl to optimize cdi systems have not been reported yet in this study deep reinforcement learning drl was used to develop the automatic control model which optimizes the desalination performance of mcdi specifically the objective of the control is to minimize energy consumption and maximize desalted water volume per cycle under conditions similar to the real environment various salt concentrations in the presence of foulants while desalinating the desired amount of salt and implementing the proper number and intensity of flushing to accomplish this purpose we aimed to 1 introduce an optimization framework for the mcdi system that is valid in the real environment by combining one of the state of the art numerical models for the mcdi process that contains single multi ion adsorption as well as electrode fouling with the rl algorithm yoon et al 2022 2 identify the optimal settings of rl that allow the mcdi system to be controlled effectively by comparing three agents and tuning the hyper parameters and 3 investigate the improvements of the mcdi process through the drl model and the adaptability of the trained drl model 2 materials and methods 2 1 mcdi system 2 1 1 mcdi module in this study the mcdi system employed a customized mcdi module consisting of an electrode current collector and spacer the carbon electrodes were separated from a commercial mcdi module e 100 siontech inc korea modifying the size to 4 4 cm for the bottom cdi and 4 3 cm for the top cdi the size of the top cdi was smaller than that of the bottom cdi to secure space for water to flow in and out the two kinds of the ion exchange polymer were separately sprayed on the electrodes cation polymer solution so3h ion exchange capacity of 1 7 1 8 meq g 1 for cation exchange membrane and anion polymer solution nr4br ion exchange capacity of 1 4 1 5 meq g 1 for anion exchange membrane the graphite foil 99 8 purity ls538884 goodfellow cambridge ltd uk was used as the current collector by attaching to the back of the carbon electrodes to separate the electrodes and allow the feed water to flow a spacer made of polyamide 12 was placed between the electrodes the spacer has a 4 4 cm area the same size as the bottom cdi and 0 5 mm thickness 2 1 2 operation and evaluation the battery cycler wbcs3000 wonatech co ltd korea supplied current while recording electrical data such as voltage resistance and energy a constant current was applied to the mcdi cell for one cycle which consisted of a set of adsorption and desorption steps the adsorption step was continued until the cell voltage rose to 1 2 v the applied current was reversed after the adsorption step to desorb the ions from the electrodes until the cell voltage decreased to 0 v a gear pump emp 600 a ems tech korea controlled the flow rate of the feed water to constantly circulate water through the mcdi module the performance of the mcdi process was evaluated per cycle based on the specific energy consumption sec and the desalted water volume per cycle sec and desalted water volume per cycle were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 son et al 2020 1 sec kwh m 3 i a d s 0 t a d s v a d s d t t a d s 2 desalted water volume per cycle m 3 t a d s where r is the ideal gas constant t is the absolute temperature k c 0 is the salt concentration of the feed water mm c d is the salt concentration of the product water mm γ is the water recovery i a d s and v a d s are the applied current a and voltage v during adsorption respectively is the flow rate m3 s 1 and t a d s is the time of adsorption s note that both sec and desalted water volume per cycle are greatly affected by various operations which is likely due to the presence of the tads for example when the flow rate is increased the adsorption time decreases owing to increased resistance causing a reduction in desalted water volume the adsorption time can be increased by dropping the current but this could also increase the sec 2 2 deep reinforcement learning this study proposes a drl method involving the mcdi transport model as an environment in which a deep neural network agent learns to control operational conditions along the state of the mcdi process fig 1 the key elements of rl are the environment agent state action and reward qiang and zhongli 2011 the interaction between the elements of rl plays an important role in controlling the target system based on the purpose qiang and zhongli 2011 the adequate setting of elements is necessary for applying rl to the mcdi system xu et al 2020 this is described in this section of the drl algorithm the learning progressed in the rl algorithm used in this study as stated in this procedure a step 0 initialization of the rl setting the mcdi transport model was validated in a specific range for utilization in the environment first the agent randomly chooses actions within the action range b step 1 interactions between elements of rl the agent provides the selected actions to the environment and estimates the state and reward c step 2 training to find the optimized policy the agent repeats step 1 to increase the reward by developing a policy based on the precious states and rewards results the reinforcement algorithm was coded in python 3 6 the actions and states were collected in a space box and the environment was constructed using a gym developed by openai brockman et al 2016 2 2 1 environment mcdi numerical model the environmental setting determines the target system of rl the recently developed mcdi transport model yoon et al 2022 which is an expansion of the modified donnan model was used in this study as the drl environment this mcdi model is a state of the art numerical model because it can predict mono and divalent ions under both pure salt and fouling conditions the model simulated the mcdi system in terms of the applied current voltage sec etc with high accuracy and the simulated data were collected at 1 s interval since the structure of the mcdi cell used in this study is the same as the previous one model parameters such as the size of the mcdi compartments electrodes and spacer porosity of the electrode and diffusion coefficients of ions in the membrane and spacer were adopted from a previous study yoon et al 2022 for rl the mcdi transport model was converted into a function form which has 6 inputs influent salt concentration inflow foulant concentration current flow rate fouling thickness and operation time and four outputs effluent salt concentration adsorption time sec and desalted water volume per cycle the mcdi transport model considers humic acid as a representative natural organic matter and assumes that the feed water contained nacl and cacl2 in a ratio of 5 5 the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation derived from the experimental data of the previous data the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation derived from the experimental data of the previous data although electrode fouling is a complex phenomenon fouling thickness was selected as a representative factor because the linear correlation between fouling thickness and sac reduction was verified in a previous study yoon et al 2022 in the future studies the drl model could consider more complex fouling phenomena by utilizing advanced models that contained various fouling mechanisms through this model the environment yielded the states of the next step and the reward in response to the actions of the states of the previous step 2 2 2 agents a2c td3 and ppo2 the agent acts as the operator of the actual process control which determines actions by observing the state of the environment the agent of the drl model utilizes neural networks that help the model efficiently find optimized actions by simplifying the complex relationship between the reward state and action the agent learns a policy that maximizes the reward to achieve the process objectives arulkumaran et al 2017 our framework combined python and matlab programs to calculate the action and state from the environment the following three representative agents were investigated the advantage actor critic a2c is based on the actor critic algorithm which uses two interacting networks to combine policy and value based algorithms the actor network determines actions based on the given states by returning the probability of each action to learn the optimal policy the critic network evaluates and adjusts the policy by calculating the value function required to maximize future rewards bekkouch et al 2022 the a2c algorithm adopts the advantage function with the state value function as the value function of the critic network to determine a better action compared to the other actions of the specific state this value function decreases the variance of the policy network and stabilizes the model kuutti et al 2019 owing to these advantages of the a2c many studies have applied the a2c to complex environments in this study multiple a2c agents were asynchronously used to prevent the use of a replay buffer as described by mnih et al 2016 that is technically we used a3c to utilize various new updated data from various environments twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient td3 is an approach developed from the deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg ddpg was regarded as an effective algorithm to handle the continuous action space by linking the q learning and policy gradient method however it is sensitive to the hyper parameter tuning and overestimates the q values at initial learning silver et al 2014 yang et al 2020 to address these issues td3 introduced three techniques the clipped double q learning twin the delayed policy update delayed and target policy smoothing fujimoto et al 2018 compared to ddpg tds highly improves the learning speed and performance during the continuous control process therefore td3 has recently shown prominent achievements in the high dimensional continuous optimization problems dankwa and zheng 2019 proximal policy optimization ppo is an algorithm that combines the concepts of the actor critic algorithm a2c and trust region policy optimization algorithm trpo thus it has multiple workers for actors and critics and uses a trust region to improve the actor instead of mixing new and old policies schulman et al 2015 2017 ppo contains a simplified objective function but it optimizes policy through repeated learning during several epochs ppo2 which is a version of ppo runs on graphics processing units gpu and utilizes vectorized environments for multiprocessing ppo2 has two main advantages first ppo2 solves complex problems with high performance and low computational complexity this is the reason ppo2 is one of the most popular model free rl agents bøhn et al 2019 second ppo2 is an on policy algorithm that converges to the optimal points faster than off policy algorithm liu et al 2022b the on policy algorithm updates the policy through the latest policy experiences and reduces the number of samples for agent training therefore ppo2 shows a more stable and faster policy convergence 2 2 3 state description the states were derived when the agent entered the environment showing the results of the rl trial the agent determines the next actions by considering the state to reflect previously trained information syafiie et al 2011 in process control which is a continuous operation it is important to configure the state by reflecting the time information since the state and action have a reciprocal relationship the state should include information on which the action is based and the result is derived by action through the environment thus the states of rl for mcdi system control are defined based on the characteristics of the feed water concentration operation time charging discharging time and control objectives that are factors measured and observed to control actual processes the state in our rl structure consists of four variables inflow salt concentration inflow foulant concentration operation time and fouling thickness blue box in fig 1 to assume that water continued to flow into the mcdi module at different salt concentrations the inflow salt concentration state was randomly set to values in the range of 16 30 mm the inflow foulant concentration state was fixed at 10 ppm to represent the continuous flow of the foulant into the module the fouling thickness was estimated using the equation approximated by the experimental data of the previous study equation s1 yoon et al 2022 sec and desalted water volume per cycle were calculated after the effluent salt concentration voltage and time were simulated using the mcdi transport model 2 2 4 action description the agent performs actions by reflecting on the state of the environment and rewards to achieve operational goals the operational conditions of the mcdi system such as the current feed flow rate and flushing which affect the mcdi performance were selected as actions performance and are used in actual process control were selected as actions green box in fig 1 the salt concentration of the produced water and energy consumption were determined by tuning the current and feed flow rate which are direct control parameters the ranges of the current and flow rate were selected as suggested in table 1 the mcdi transport model was validated for these ranges table 2 the current and flow rate actions generated by the agent acted as the input variables of the mcdi transport model in a real environment there are various contaminants that cause fouling on the electrode surface of mcdi shim et al 2021 the surface cleaning of the electrode through flushing is required to maintain mcdi performance during long term operation huang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the previous studies verified the necessity of flushing by investigating the fouling reduction of 16 24 in the mcdi desalination performance shim et al 2021 yoon et al 2022 the value of the flushing action was expressed as the removal rate of the fouling thickness eq 3 describes how the flushing action decreases the fouling thickness 3 t h i c k f a f t e r μ m t h i c k f 1 a f where t h i c k f a f t e r is the fouling thickness after flushing implementation and a f is the flushing intensity which is determined by the action the range of the flushing action 1 a f started from 0 4 because the complete removal of fouling is impossible owing to irreversible fouling kimura et al 2004 remize et al 2010 the flushing action indirectly affected the model by changing the state of fouling thickness which is the input of the mcdi transport model 2 2 5 reward and penalty the reward function is a factor leading the training process of rl to satisfy the operation purposes pan et al 2020 the reward function calculates the rewards and penalties by obtaining the changed states from the environment to evaluate the actions of the agent the agent develops a strategy for controlling the process by rewarding and punishing the values for each step the goal of control with rl is to maximize sec and desalted water volume per cycle in the presence of naturally driven foulants by desalinating a specific amount of salt yellow box in fig 1 eq 4 shows that the range of desalinated salt acts as a constraint to determine the optimal operating conditions the reward function employed a linear equation that included the sec and the desalted water volume per cycle states the reward was penalized by the implementation of the flushing action which required additional operational costs the reward and penalty are expressed by eqs 4 and 5 respectively i f d c 0 9 mm i f desalted

the penalty and a p is the constant to adjust the unit and importance of the flushing intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction and optimization of drl model this section describes the drl model setup which includes framework construction optimization and training fig 2 the procedure initially progressed with the setting of the action state and environment the parameters and equations of the reward function were determined based on the simulation results of the environment numerical model to identify the agent that best fits our model framework the performances of the three agents were compared after the key compositions of the drl model were finalized the hyperparameters were tuned and the optimal drl model was constructed fig 2a the model training was continued until the reward sum converged to the maximum value fig 2b 3 1 1 analysis of the numerical simulation results the adsorption time and effluent salt concentration can be tuned by controlling the current and flow rate which are easily adjustable parameters during the operation fig 3 a and b depicts the effluent salt concentration profile as a function of the current and flow rate we can explicitly observe that higher applied currents and lower flow rates show a greater reduction in the salinity of the produced water because the constant high current strongly adsorbs the salt ions from the water by increasing the total charge per unit water volume treated in a cycle fig 3c and table 2a zhao et al 2012 also the small amount of salt ions adsorbed under the high flow rate is attributed to insufficient contact time between the salt ions in the feed water and carbon electrode kim et al 2019 a similar trend was observed for sec fig 3d and table 2b for example for a feed water salt concentration of 20 mm the maximum sec among the simulated data was 0 133 kwh m 3 4 ml min 1 flow rate and 45 ma current and the minimum sec among the simulated data was 0 025 kwh m 3 11 ml min 1 flow rate and 25 ma current the correlation between the amount of salt removed and sec suggests that more energy is consumed to adsorb more salt ions as anticipated when the flow rate is relatively slow local resistance growth which occurs throughout the solution as the residence time increases causes an increase in the electric potential difference between the carbon electrodes he et al 2021 shim et al 2021 consequently this leads to an increase in the consumption of energy to remove salt ions from the feed water in contrast the desalted water volume per cycle as a function of flow rate showed an inverse trend compared to that of desalinated salt and sec fig 3e and table 2c for example when the flow rate increased from 4 ml min 1 to 6 ml min 1 under feed water with a 20 mm salt concentration condition the desalted water volume per cycle rate was also linearly increased by 1 48 times from 1 3 10 5 to 2 0 10 5 m 3 conversely when the applied current was increased by 1 5 times from 30 ma to 45 ma the desalted water volume per cycle rate decreased by 1 78 times the linear relationship between the flow rate and desalted water volume per cycle can be explained by the shorter adsorption time fig 3a and eq 2 in the voltage cut off operation the faster the voltage reaches a limited value 1 2 v during the adsorption step when a higher current is applied which causes a reduction in the adsorption time for example the adsorption cycle time decreased with an increase in the applied current which was 106 s at 25 ma and 257 s at 45 ma 3 1 2 reward function the optimized mcdi system should produce more desalinated water at a low energy demand thus to optimize sec and desalted water volume per cycle simultaneously a reward function of the drl contained these two performance indicators together by referring to the simulation results in section 3 1 1 in eq 4 the differences in units and importance between sec and desalted water volume per cycle were balanced by implementing the constants ar1 and ar2 which factorized the two values furthermore to achieve a certain degree of desalination we adopted the desalinated salt amount as the constraint of the reward function fig 2c not only do constraints regulate the optimization process but they also encourage the agent to quickly determine the shortest path of control thereby minimizing the computational time of the algorithm during training adams et al 2021 thus an additional constraint related to desalted water volume per cycle was introduced to decrease the computational time of the drl model 3 1 3 agent selection there are various drl agents available depending on the features of the target problem such as the dimension data type and complexity bagherzadeh et al 2021 to figure out the best performing agent for the mcdi process optimization we evaluated the performance of agents in terms of stability and performance a2c td3 and ppo2 were trained separately with the default hyperparameters and networks which were provided by openai fujimoto et al 2018 mnih et al 2016 schulman et al 2017 the training was implemented during 1000 episodes which is sufficient to make the reward sum converge to a particular range the initial reward sum of each agent has a similar value 249 by setting a specific seed number 433 that adjusts the first trial of the agent identically fig 4 a as shown in the results of the last episode ppo2 showed the highest improvement in the reward sum from the initial value compared with a2c and td3 table 3 in addition ppo2 converged stably to its optimal state in contrast a2c fluctuated the reward sum largely after the 500th episode reducing the reliability of the training td3 showed no variation during the entire training episode because the actions and states were constant regardless of the inflow salt concentration yellow line in fig 4a it is evident that the td3 agent does not produce a feasible solution to the mcdi process optimization problem moreover when comparing the computational times for each agent table 3 and fig s1 ppo2 exhibited the lowest computational time in the last episode therefore considering both performance and efficiency we selected ppo2 as the agent of the drl model in this study 3 1 4 hyper parameter optimization as ppo2 is an algorithm that updates the policy using a surrogate loss function to prevent the degradation of the rl performance the initial hyperparameters of ppo2 have less of an effect on performance despite this advantage hyperparameter tuning remains essential for improving the training speed and efficiency of the drl model by determining the best hyperparameters for the drl model alves and mateus 2022 four hyperparameters were manually selected by considering other studies and set differently from the default value policy number of training mini batches per update number of epochs when optimizing the surrogate and the number of total episodes the input dataset used in our study is 1 d which does not require a complex network that requires more computational time thus the multilayer perceptron mlp was adopted as policy during the policy update process the experiences of the agent such as the state and action were collected to improve the policy the number of training mini batches per update and number of epochs when optimizing the surrogate are important parameters for setting the number of gathered experiences before changing from the old policy to the new policy the number of episodes should be set sufficiently to continue the rl training until the reward converges to a specific number the selected hyperparameters are summarized in table 4 after optimizing the hyperparameters the drl model showed improved performance expressed as the reward sum fig 4b tuning the hyperparameters increased the reward sum of the last episode from 1 45 default to 44 25 optimized the main reason for the improvement in performance is the increased deviation of actions despite the states being changed during the episode the current actions in the last episode which were trained with the default hyperparameters almost converged to 45 ma fig s2a this indicates that the agent did not react properly to the state furthermore flushing was implemented only once throughout the process red arrow in fig s2b the changes in hyperparameters solved this issue by increasing the number of training mini batches per update and the number of epochs that determine the amount of trial and error experience more detailed control was conducted based on the increased amount of collected data which enhanced the process optimization performance it also markedly accelerates the speed of convergence to optimal performance in the default hyper parameter case the agent caused a negative reward sum until the 500th episode followed by a slightly steep increment orange line in fig 4a and b however after tuning the hyperparameters the reward sum reached the positive reward sum in the 100th episode and fine changes occurred during the remaining episodes blue line in fig 4b 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 drl model training for each episode the drl model was trained with 100 datasets in one episode and tested using 20 datasets the states in one episode were chronologically continuous the reward sum is the total reward in one training episode and the maximum reward sum indicates that the mcdi performance reaches the optimal state while satisfying constraints fig 4b the hyper parameters and factors used in the reward sum were chosen based on the results in section 3 1 results table 4 the reward sum increased continuously as the number of episodes increased the initial training episodes show a drastic increase from 248 99 to 20 13 in the reward sum within the 380th episode blue line in fig 4b at the beginning of training the penalty values were higher than the reward values which caused a negative reward sum the agent tried to understand the environment through a trial and error search thus incorrect controls occurred which caused a penalty and required more computational time to prevent a reduction in the reward due to the penalty perolat et al 2017 after the policy was developed through the training the reward sum converged into the specific range containing the maximum reward sum which shows that drl achieves the purpose the detailed results of the drl application for the mcdi process show that the agent learns how to control the mcdi process to achieve the desired sec and desalted water volume per cycle while satisfying the desalinated salt amount constraint it should be noted that the variables used in the first episode were randomly selected implying that the performance comparisons described later indicate that there are improvements over this first episode fig 5 first the agent did not satisfy the constraints of the reward function in most steps of one episode and increased the reward sum by reducing the number of flushing implementations green box i in fig 5a thus the reward was not calculated through the main equation that contains our purpose maximize desalted water volume per cycle and minimize sec causing sec and desalted water volume per cycle to be changed to the opposite of our purpose green box i in fig 5b after the 37th episode the number of steps that satisfied the constraints started increasing which indicates that drl recognized how to overcome the hurdles to accomplish the main control purposes orange box ii in fig 5a the average value of sec and desalted water volume per cycle in one episode steeply decreased and increased simultaneously to improve the reward sum orange box ii in fig 5b however the number of flushing implementations reached almost zero at the 127th episode orange box ii in fig 5a and remained until the 473th yellow box ii in fig 5a this means that the drl was still focused on excluding the penalty and not optimizing the flushing action by considering the influence of the fouling thickness state on the mcdi performance flushing also began to adjust as the model satisfied the constraints in all steps to determine the appropriate number of flushing cycles the fluctuation continually occurred after approximately the 500th episode white box iii in fig 5a this clearly shows that the agent was able to determine a balanced way for mcdi operation by receiving fewer penalties finally the model controlled the mcdi process so that the sec decreased by 22 07 from 0 054 to 0 042 kwh m 3 and the desalted water volume per cycle increased by 11 60 from 1 96 10 5 to 2 19 10 5 m3 compared to the first episode with 28 numbers of flushing under all steps satisfied constraints fig 5b specifically the actions changed as the agent learned to control the mcdi process the range of action in the applied current was reduced to the range that satisfied the constraint which was the first hurdle for increasing the reward fig 6 a and b unlike the action of the applied current which varies according to the input state the action of the flow rate was changed to a fixed value of 11 ml min 1 fig 6a and c because the applied current is a more sensitive operational variable to the desalinated salt amount than the flow rate under the given condition fig s3 within the designated ranges of the current and flow rate the control of the current value affected the effluent salt concentration desalted water volume per cycle and sec fig s3 for example to desalinate 20 more 20 mm 7 ml min 1 and 5 ma 20 more applied current is required which is less than that of the flow rate 31 therefore the agent determines an effective control method while reducing the computational time by focusing on the current action as stated previously the fouling thickness which directly and indirectly affects the mcdi performance was reduced by the flushing action flushing requires energy and a temporary pause in the process thus the execution of flushing was applied as the penalty after being balanced by the factor ap in eq 5 the bar graphs in fig 6d describe the timing and intensity of flushing after training the number and intensity of the flushing implementation were controlled only to keep the fouling thickness below the proper range middle bar graph in fig 6d whereas frequent high intensity flushing was applied during the first episode top bar graph in fig 6d consequently as the training continued the sec range narrowed until the value which was initially in the wide range of 0 025 0 105 kwh m 3 converged to 0 042 kwh m 3 fig 6e similarly the wide range of desalted water volume per cycle values decreased until they converged to a certain range fig 6f in terms of the extent of desalination the trained model exhibited a similar value in the last episode compared with that of the first episode fig s4 for example when a feed salt concentration of 35 8 mm is used fig s4a an effluent salt concentration of 34 8 mm was found after training whereas that of 34 9 mm was found before training when a low feed salt concentration of 18 mm was used fig s4b an even lower effluent salt concentration of 17 mm was found after training whereas that of 17 3 mm was found before training collectively the rl model exhibited better performance in terms of low energy consumption and greater desalted water volume per cycle at a similar degree of water desalination therefore it can be concluded that it is possible to adjust the optimal constant value by considering the inflow feed water conditions and implementing the appropriate action 3 2 2 apply the optimized drl model to test practical application the test was implemented to verify the trained dpl model for 20 steps orange boxes in fig 6a and d which was completely separated from the trained dataset to evaluate the generalizability and flexibility of the drl model unlike training that started in pristine fouling conditions the test had an initial fouling thickness of 250 μm to ensure that proper action was taken to reduce the fouling thickness even under conditions where the fouling was already stacked on the carbon electrode pink box in fig 6d an average reward of 0 4830 was obtained in the test step which was similar to that in the training step 0 5905 table 5 specifically the test of the trained drl model exhibited sec values of 0 043 kwh m 3 and desalted water volume per cycle values of 2 1 10 5 m 3 pink boxes in fig 6e and f simultaneously the constraints were satisfied in all steps in the test sets thus the amount of desalinated salt in all steps was higher than 0 9 mm this demonstrates that the trained drl model can consistently control the process to accomplish optimization even with unfamiliar data 3 3 adaptability and future improvements in real world processes operations have different control strategies depending on the environment being implemented or the applied industry to discuss the extended application of the proposed drl model we further investigated the control results with different factors the sec adjusted factor ar2 in eq 4 in the reward sum represents the inverse importance of sec during optimization for example the higher the sec adjusted factor the lower the importance of the sec value i e the higher the importance of desalted water volume per cycle this is likely because when a higher sec adjusted factor is used small changes in sec are largely reflected thus in order to assume a situation in which the sec is more important than desalted water volume per cycle the factor was normalized by taking the value of 2 compared to the value used in section 3 1 value of 38 as a standard number the reduction in sec of each control result shows a linear relationship with the factor when the normalized ar2 factor of 2 was used the sec was increased by 15 75 whereas the sec was decreased by 3 06 when the normalized ar2 factor of 2 was used fig 7 a during the test step the same pattern of decreased sec with increased desalted water volume per cycle was observed when a higher ar2 factor was used fig 7b therefore the control results can be easily managed depending on the operational preference according to the setting of the reward equations in the drl model although the proposed drl model showed excellent ability to control the mcdi process with great flexibility depending on demand for in field applications several issues still need to be addressed first the variety of feed compositions should be considered the drl model used in this study consisted of a numerical mcdi model that only considered two representative ions nacl and cacl2 and one representative foulant humic acid in contrast in a real environment various contaminants and ions are present in feed water additionally because the numerical mcdi model simulated the experimental results conducted with a wide spacer 0 5 mm that was utilized to observe the fouling thickness by optical coherence tomography the simulation results showed a low salt removal rate 3 12 at 20 mm table 2a even under the same salt removal capacity of the electrodes owing to the increased water volume between the electrodes yoon et al 2022 from our perspective it seems practically impossible to build a numerical model that can reflect every aspect of the real environment thus applying a deep learning model to the drl as an environment could be a great option to reflect the physicochemical interactions as much as possible second the drl model should include the characteristics of more diverse operation conditions such as zero voltage desorption and constant voltage operation and more various cdi constructions such as flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi and inverted capacitive deionization icdi to improve the versatility of the model the mcdi process was chosen as a representative of cdi in this study owing to its structural similarity with superior desalination performance when compared to cdi and an mcdi model contained fouling indexes has recently been developed yoon et al 2022 additionally the drl model is sufficiently able to adapt to other processes by changing the settings of the model such as the environment state action and reward the use of thermodynamic energy efficiency tee or productivity is a reasonable strategy for comparing different processes alkhadra et al 2022 hawks et al 2019 son et al 2020 wang et al 2019 when building a drl model containing a single reward function by considering tee or productivity it is necessary to be cautious when setting an appropriate constraint because there is a possibility that the actions of the agent converge to an extremely low flow rate or a high current to maximize the tee in a simple manner additionally it is necessary to consider the combination with numerical and physical models that show superior performances in simulating ion selectivity in order to utilize drl for ion selectivity control which has been considered one of the promising applications of cdi technology gamaethiralalage et al 2021 guyes et al 2021 liu et al 2020 qin et al 2019a b ramachandran et al 2019 shocron et al 2022 for example the drl model can suggest an appropriate applied current or pulsed current upon charging based on the desired removal of a certain ion and monitoring data finally an actual desalination system that is linked to the drl model should be built and demonstrated in the field to verify the feasibility of the automation tool proposed in this study this demonstration is a very important step as it not only avoids test measurement errors regulations for safety and equipment failures but also trains the drl model with more practical data one essential consideration when linking the actual system with the drl model is improving the training speed of the drl model because the drl model develops the control strategy through trial and error training the process optimization using the drl model could spend more time compared to those of physical and numerical models which can easily ignore simulation in the extreme range collectively this study provides the fundamental principle based on the data simulated by numerical models for applying the drl model to actual operation which will be the cornerstone of the fully automated electrochemical desalination process 4 conclusions this study aimed to automatically control the operational parameters of the mcdi process such as the applied current flow rate and flushing to optimize the process under various feed water concentrations the drl algorithm which uses state of the art numerical mcdi models as the environment was developed to accomplish this objective we evaluated the performance of drl by sec and desalted water volume per cycle while considering the desalinated concentration as a constraint the major conclusions are summarized as follows the fundamental elements of the drl were established by considering its performance and stability the reward function was determined based on simulation data with adjusted factors among the three agents ppo2 a2c and td3 ppo2 was selected with manually tuned hyperparameters because of its superior stability and control performance the performance of drl was improved after training demonstrating a 22 of reduction in sec and an 11 increase in desalted water volume per cycle the drl automatically controlled the mcdi process along with the influent salt concentration maintaining a fouling thickness of 86 μm 0 042 kwh m 3 sec and 2 2 10 5 m3 desalted water volume per cycle during the training step the test results of the trained drl model showed a similar performance to the training results indicating that the model was successfully constructed for global applications the drl can weigh sec differently by changing a number of factors that represent the importance based on the main operation purpose the sec increased by 20 by reducing the a2 factor from 40 2 to 36 2 thus it has the flexibility to be applied to various industries depending on local demands declaration of

15308,fast characterization of organic waste using near infrared spectroscopy nirs has been successfully developed in the last decade however up to now an on site use of this technology has been hindered by necessary sample preparation steps freeze drying and grinding to avoid important water effects on nirs recent research studies have shown that these effects are highly non linear and relate both to the biochemical and physical properties of samples to account for these complex effects the current study compares the use of many different types of non linear methods such as partial least squares regression plsr based methods global clustered and local versions of plsr machine learning methods support vector machines regression trees and ensemble methods and deep learning methods artificial and convolutional neural networks on an independent test data set non linear methods showed errors 28 lower than linear methods the standard errors of prediction obtained for the prediction of total solids content ts chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical methane potential bmp were respectively 8 160 mg o2 gts 1 and 92 ml ch4 gts 1 these latter errors are similar to successful nirs applications developed on freeze dried samples these findings hold great promises regarding the development of at site and online nirs solutions in anaerobic digestion plants graphical abstract graphical abstract a comprehensive comparison of non linear calibration methods for nirs based characterization of diverse organic waste in raw form image graphical abstract keywords near infrared spectroscopy anaerobic digestion biochemical methane potential water effects non linear modeling neural network data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in bioprocesses such as composting anaerobic digestion ad or pyro gasification the ability to effectively characterize the input organic waste is a necessary condition for optimizing the process jacobi et al 2011 jimenez et al 2015 unfortunately the input feedstock may cover a tremendously wide range of biochemical and physical properties thus making the development of fast and robust analytical procedures a challenging issue in the last decade near infrared spectroscopy nirs in combination with sound multivariate statistical calibrations has emerged as the most reliable and fast solution for characterizing organic materials amongst the developed applications on organic waste the technology has been used to monitor the maturity of compost albrecht et al 2008 vergnoux et al 2009 to assess the biochemical methane potential bmp and biodegradability doublet et al 2013 fitamo et al 2017 godin et al 2015 lesteur et al 2011 mortreuil et al 2018 triolo et al 2014 yang et al 2021 but also to predict important variables such as carbohydrates content nitrogen content and chemical oxygen demand cod charnier et al 2017a cellulose hemicellulose liu et al 2021 or hydrolysis kinetics charnier et al 2017b thanks to these developments a full description of an organic waste can now be provided by nirs in less than three days instead of one to two months for a characteristic like bmp however the analytical process still involves cumbersome sample preparation steps freeze drying and grinding to avoid the effects of water and particle size on nirs which explains the limited adoption of nirs for on line or at site industrial applications water effects on nirs were shown to be highly non linear and resulting from complex interacting physical and chemical effects mallet et al 2021a these physical effects were shown to result from light path length modifications directly related to moisture content by a power law mallet et al 2021c this brings keys to better understand the low performance obtained with linear model based calibrations made on organic waste with diverse biochemical compositions and humidity levels while traditional methods such as plsr have the advantage of simplicity interpretability and robustness these methods are not able to cope with non linear water effects as they rely on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between the predicted characteristic and the spectrum on the other hand non linear methods can consider more complex non linear relationships and thus may provide usable models ni et al 2014 pérez marín et al 2007 different methods can be classified in three categories plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods within chemometrics the founding block of non linear techniques remains plsr wold et al 2001 indeed clustered and local approaches of plsr have been developed where models are built based only on a subset of the dataset this subset can be chosen based on spectral characteristics or using expert knowledge and metadata in local methods based on spectra there is the clustered plsr approach where a clustering method k means preda and saporta 2005 hierarchical clustering tøndel et al 2011 decision tree narayanan et al 2019 is used to identify groups on which to train plsr models when predicting a new observation it is assigned to its cluster based on a spectral distance euclidean or mahalanobis shen et al 2019 or a trained classification method and the corresponding cluster s model is used for prediction in strictly speaking local approaches such as the local plsr shenk et al 1997 or the k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knn lw plsr lesnoff et al 2020 the subset is selected on the fly i e just in time for each new observation based on a spectral distance and the model based on this subset is also built on the fly this type of local approach has been successfully applied for the nirs based prediction of bmp in plant biomasses godin et al 2015 within machine learning methods a first group of methods are based on the regression tree concept with a binary recursive partitioning where models are built within each partition usually a simple average holmes et al 1999 but it can be a plsr eriksson et al 2009 the power of regression trees owes to its simplicity and interpretability based on this regression tree structure ensemble methods have been proposed where forests of such tree models are built based on bagging random forest or boosting xgboost such models have been assessed and compared for nirs based prediction of soil composition de santana et al 2018 nawar and mouazen 2017 or biodiesel blends composition cunha et al 2020 a second group of methods concerns support vector machines svm regression methods drucker et al 1996 which is essentially a constrained version of linear regression where the l2 norm of the coefficient vector is minimized with constraints on the hyperplane maximal margin svm regression is made non linear using kernel functions such as polynomial or gaussian radial basis functions that transform the original data into a higher dimensional feature space to make it possible to perform the linear regression svm regression has been applied in combination with nirs data belousov et al 2002 borin et al 2006 devos et al 2009 and more recently for bmp prediction on algae substrates yao et al 2020 a last category of non linear methods includes deep learning methods artificial neural network ann has been applied to nirs in the last twenty years berzaghi et al 2002 marini et al 2008 nørgaard et al 2013 but the increase of dataset size as well as computational capabilities has recently made it a practical predictive tool in particular one dimensional convolutional neural networks 1d cnn is an architecture that has been found the most suitable for nirs data acquarelli et al 2017 cui and fearn 2018 malek et al 2018 one reason is that the 1d convolution layer plays the role of spectral preprocessor cui and fearn 2018 the power of neural networks lies in its flexible and customizable architecture defined by the number of layers the type of layers dense convolutional and the layers parameters dimensionality padding stride dropout rate activation function mishra and passos 2022 but the challenge of such models is also its complexity and the important number of parameters to tune which makes it prone to overfitting to avoid this the learning hyperparameters mainly batch size number of epochs and learning rate need to be soundly selected another challenge of deep learning methods concerns the low interpretability of the obtained models though some authors propose some numerical tools to investigate the feature importances cui and fearn 2018 in this study the suitability of non linear models is assessed comprehensively for diverse raw organic waste characterization can the higher complexity of machine learning and non linear algorithms provide models usable directly on raw organic materials to answer this non linear methods from the three communities chemometrics machine learning and deep learning are evaluated for the prediction of total solids

their prediction performance root mean squared error rmse median absolute error mad coefficient of determination r2 but also based on their robustness towards water effects i e moisture content variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and reference analyses the dataset consists of 501 different organic waste samples that have been collected in rural territorial and industrial anaerobic digestion plants in france these samples cover a very wide range of biochemical and physical properties solid ligno cellulosic materials like silage cereals ramial wood chips and corn cobs liquid ligno cellulosic suspensions such as manure pig slurry liquid high fat content suspensions catering waste or biowaste sweet emulsions such as lactoserum or syrup or protein and fat solid pastes such as egg waste cacao butter or primary and secondary sludges from wastewater treatment plants the visual aspect of some of these samples is presented in appendix a biochemical characterization of

knnlwplsr lesnoff et al 2020 consisted of the similar procedure as the knnr but instead of the average a locally weighted plsr kim et al 2011 was calculated for each neighborhood the calculated plsr was weighted using a normalized sum to one version of the gaussian radial basis function φ applied to distances δ i between the predicted observation and its neighbors eq 2 φ δ i exp δ i h σ δ with σ δ the standard deviation of distances and h the similarity index simply said this weighing ensures that the closest neighbors to the predicted observation will influence more the final model parameter

regression referred here as svmr was calculated using the radial basis function rbf kernel type two hyperparameters were considered for tuning the kernel coefficient γ 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 101 102 103 and the regularization parameter c 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 101 102 103 3 a decision tree regression referred here as rtree which involves a binary recursive partitioning where the prediction for a given observation is based on a simple average of the fold group of observations in which it lies two hyperparameters were considered for tuning the maximum depth of tree 5 10 30 50 100 the minimum number of observations in a fold 5 10 30 4 an ensemble random forest method referred here as rf which consists in growing multiple regression trees based on random sub selections of features and

and the total number of trees 5 20 50 100 150 5 an ensemble extreme gradient boosting method referred here as xgb which consists in growing multiple regression trees based on random sub selections of features and observations but based on a boosting principle where each new tree is grown to predict the residuals from the sum of predictions made by the existing trees three hyperparameters were considered for tuning the number of trees 5 20 50 100 150 the maximum depth of trees 5 10 20 30 50 100 and the learning rate 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 6 an artificial neural network ann model referred here as nn with a simple dense structure a unique dense layer of 25 neurons was chosen with rectified linear unit relu activation functions which guarantee the non linearity of the method the architecture is presented in fig 2 three hyperparameters were considered for tuning the learning rate 0 001 0 005 0 01 the number of epochs 100 300 500 1000 and the batch size 5 10 30 7 a convolutional neural network

the impact of adding a prior dimension reduction step to the model pipeline was evaluated indeed models were built not only on the original variables but also on the scores of a global principal components analysis pca or a global plsr respectively referred as pca and pls in the case of pca a singular value decomposition svd is applied to the centered spectra x leading to x ukσkvk t with k the number of components chosen σ the singular values and u and v the left and right singular vectors with vtv i the scores tk are calculated as tk xvk the number of components of the pca or plsr was set to 25 components this prior dimension reduction step allowed to reduce the computation time and to stabilize the tuning of non linear methods which are prone to overfitting 2 4 data analysis and model calibration all the data analysis presented in fig 3 was performed using python 3 7 11 data wrangling with pandas 1 3 4 numpy 1 19 5 scipy 1 7 1 scikit learn 1 0 1 tensorflow 2 7 0 and plotting

nir spectra to reduce the random and systematic variations unrelated to the characteristic of interest roger et al 2020 here only simple preprocessing methods were evaluated a simple standard normal variate barnes et al 1989 referred as snv the second order detrend barnes et al 1989 referred as dt2 the first order savitzky golay savitzky and golay 1964 derivation referred as sg1 the second order savitzky golay derivation referred as sg2 and a simple combination of detrend and standard normal variate referred as dt2 snv to get rid of additive and multiplicative effects roger et al 2020 the raw absorbance signal referred as a was used directly as well which resulted overall in testing six different preprocessing conditions the preprocessed spectra are presented in appendix b to evaluate the built models a validation test set was constituted with the aim of producing a representative validation test set the duplex algorithm snee 1977 was run for each reference characteristic ts cod bmp triplicates remained grouped together within the train or test sets for all methods the tuning of hyperparameters was done using a repeated randomized grouped k fold cross validation with k 5 the fold number and n r e p e a t s 30 the repetition number sample triplicates were always kept within one fold to ensure independence between splits within cross validation for each cross validation run various metrics were then calculated the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae willmott and matsuura 2005 the coefficient of determination r2 the choice of the hyperparameters was made by analyzing all these metrics together i e choosing the set of hyperparameters minimizing rmse and mae while maximizing r2 the final performances of the obtained models were evaluated on the

squared pearson correlation coefficient r2 the determination coefficient r2 the bias b and the standard error of prediction sep the formulas are provided in appendix c to evaluate the robustness of each model towards ts variations i e moisture content the models were applied on the dataset of n2 drying experiments presented in section 2 1 mallet et al 2021a the total error of the models can be seen as the result of the average error per substrate inter substrate error and the standard deviation of the errors within each substrate intra substrate error for each substrate the average of the absolute residuals was calculated as well as the standard deviation of absolute residuals let s be the substrate number s 1 89 and ms the space of moisture content levels covered by this substrate for each substrate number s and moisture content level k with k ms an absolute residual can be calculated as in equation 3 the inter substrates and intra substrates errors are calculated for each substrate and correspond respectively to the average and the standard deviation of these residuals for k ms eqs 4 and 5 eq 3 r s k y s k y s k eq 4 a b s o l u t e e r r o r i n t e r s u b s t r a t

predicts the biochemical composition while the intra substrate error is related to how much the model is sensitive to the varying ts the boxplots of these inter substrate and intra substrate errors are plotted in fig 7 3 results discussion 3 1 data overview the distributions of the biochemical variables ts cod bmp of the substrates are provided in fig 4 with histograms of train and test sets respectively in blue and orange the ranges are very wide with ts values between 0 5 and 100 bmp values between 21 and 847 ml ch4 gts 1 and cod values between 456 and 2 800 mg o2 gts 1 the distributions of train and test sets are similar thanks to the duplex algorithm applied to each reference variables ts cod bmp while the distributions of bmp and cod appear to follow normal distributions the distribution of ts values appear to follow a bi normal distribution with a group of substrates with ts values below 30 and a group of substrates with ts values above 80 indeed this latter group of substrates corresponds to naturally low moisture content samples such as high fat content substrates e g oil slaughterhouse waste or agro industrial waste e g flour sucrose paper as well as samples that were simply freeze dried to extend the range of ts on which the models can work i e increase robustness 3 2 model performances linear methods plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods for each model type the results rmse and r2 on train and test sets for the best obtained models amongst the six preprocessing pipelines that were evaluated a a sg1 a sg2 a snv a dt2 a dt2 snv are presented in fig 5 the results for all the six preprocessing pipelines are presented in appendix d and appendix e the rmse and r2 for the best obtained linear plsr models were respectively 10 31 and 0 89 for ts prediction 240 mg o2 gts 1 and 0 77 for cod prediction and 127 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 63 for bmp prediction for ts prediction the difference in error between the nirs based method and the reference method 5 31 is rather low and acceptable this is especially true knowing the huge benefit of being able to measure such variable in only a couple of minutes with nirs instead of 24 h with the reference method however for cod or bmp prediction the errors obtained with nirs based linear models are significantly higher than the errors of the reference methods 112 mg o2 gts 1 for cod and 49 ml ch4 gts 1 for bmp in most cases non linear methods allowed to build models with significantly lower errors than with the linear methods indeed non linear models showed rmse values lowered by up to 23 for ts prediction up to 33 for cod prediction and up to 28 for bmp prediction the best models were obtained with k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knnlwplsr and convolutional neural networks cnn with rmse and r2 respectively equal to 8 and 0 94 for ts prediction respectively equal to 160 mg o2 gts 1 and 0 90 for cod prediction and respectively equal to 92 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 80 for bmp prediction for some models a prior pca was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the input signals pca nn pca xgb pca rf in most cases this resulted in slightly lower model performances compared to models with the raw signal as input xgb rf for example for ts prediction applying a pca reduction before a random forest pca rf resulted in an rmse and r2 of 9 3 and 0 91 instead of 8 5 and 0 93 without pca reduction rf for bmp prediction applying a pca reduction before an extreme gradient boosting pca xgb resulted in an rmse and r2 of 101 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 76 instead of 96 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 79 without pca reduction xgb however in some cases the pca reduction did not deteriorate the models for example for bmp prediction applying a random forest with pca rf or without rf a pca reduction resulted in equal rmse and r2 respectively 111 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 71 in such cases one advantage of applying the dimension reduction method is the gain in computation time indeed not only the method is faster because there are less weights to optimize 20 25 weights instead of 1501 25 weights which results in 25 less time for 500 samples but because there are less weights to optimize the number of iterations needed to find a satisfactory model is also reduced for a batch size of 10 100 epochs are needed instead of 500 which results in a final reduction in computation time of 85 for 500 samples it must be pointed out that a dense neural network without prior dimension reduction nn was not evaluated because such model architecture results in too many coefficients to optimize and therefore an unstable learning process a closer look at the models is provided in fig 6 the observed and predicted values are shown for the three predicted variables ts cod bmp for the best obtained models linear and non linear respectively to the left and right of the figure the best non linear models were obtained using convolutional neural networks cnn though as already mentioned the models obtained with k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knnlwplsr showed similar performances these models when built directly on preprocessed data i e sg2 snv or dt2 for respectively ts cod and bmp happen to be more performant than the models built on raw spectra this puts into perspective some observations made in previous studies cui and fearn 2018 that highlighted the fact that the advantage of convolutional neural networks is that they can be applied without any preprocessing steps and that the preprocessing will be found automatically nevertheless for all predicted variables ts cod bmp the prediction points from the non linear models appear much closer to the diagonal line than linear models which shows how non linear models are much more suited for raw organic waste characterization as expected the train observations in blue are closer to this diagonal line than the test observations in orange because models were built on these train observations however the more significant differences observed between train and test observations for non linear models could imply that these models are still slightly overfit this would imply that these models leave further room for improvements through further hyperparameter tuning nevertheless the obtained errors on the test set in orange are already highly promising the mean absolute deviation mad is provided and complements the rmse and r2 by providing an idea of the error to expect for most samples for bmp prediction while the rmsep equals to 91 8 ml ch4 gts 1 the madp equals to only 52 ml ch4 gts 1 this shows how well the non linear models perform and how in most cases the error made on bmp prediction is very low 3 3 robustness towards moisture content effects one of the questions regarding the use of these non linear models is whether the accuracy gain that was demonstrated here is due to a lower sensitivity to water effects ts differences or due to better considering the differences in biochemical types when estimating the relationship between the signal and the variable to predict as presented in section 2 1 in order to evaluate the robustness of developed nirs models towards moisture content effects a dataset of nirs measurements acquired during n2 drying experiments of various organic substrates was used mallet et al 2021a for cod prediction as indicated by the red arrow in fig 7 switching from a linear to a non linear model results in a decrease of 23 of the average inter substrate error but an increase of 13 of the average intra substrate error similarly for bmp prediction as indicated by the red arrow in fig 7 switching from a linear to a non linear model results in a decrease of 14 of the average inter substrate error but an increase of 67 of the average intra substrate error in other words for cod or bmp prediction the gain in accuracy that was previously observed for non linear models results from a better modeling of the different substrate types physical and biochemical differences more than higher robustness towards ts variations theoretically the ideal absorption law the beer lambert law states that the relationship between concentration and the signal is linear but because here there are so many different substrates the scattering levels are very different and this makes this law poorly adapted for example the reflectance of highly absorbing samples such as raw biogas slurry but also forward scattering transparent liquids oils may have low general levels of measured reflectance these samples will surely not have the same reflectance level than highly scattering samples such as straw flour or biowaste while linear models have difficulties coping with these big differences in signal levels the power of non linear models lies precisely in the ability to work by clusters of substrates finding specific relationships between the signal and the predicted variable locally indeed the relationship between bmp or cod and the measured signals on raw biogas slurry will be different than the relationship between the bmp or cod and the measured signals on straw flour or biowaste and using non linear models this relationship can be modeled differently contrarily to linear models the non linear methods allow to account for these scattering differences between substrates finding different linear relationships for each substrate types in the end non linear methods allowed to reduce the errors that were previously made by linear models between substrate types another aspect related to moisture content effects concerns the oh absorption region around 1430 nm and 1940 nm many studies show that this region is in fact full of indirect information related to chemical composition due to the multiple oh bonding types that water makes with the molecules present in the substrate mallet et al 2021a tsenkova et al 2018 future investigations should be oriented towards interpreting the non linear models to better understand how this region is used by the models this result redefines the scientific questions and technical challenges related to building nir applications on raw wet and diverse organic waste while water effects are certainly a high source of variance with non linearities to be dealt with mallet et al 2021a 2021c it appears that the non linearity due solely to the diversity of organic waste i e biochemical and physical types is very high and that therefore applying non linear models on such datasets can allow a significant gain in accuracy that allows these models to show similar final errors as linear calibrations built on dry samples 4 conclusions in this study non linear methods including plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods were successfully leveraged to build satisfactory ts cod and bmp prediction models based on nirs and applicable on raw and diverse organic waste a general gain in accuracy of 28 based on rmsep was obtained compared to models built with linear methods this significant gain was shown to be mostly due to better modeling the diversity of biochemical and physical types more than being more robust to moisture content variations though not detailed in this study the presented modeling approach based on non linear methods could be successfully applied to other important parameters such as n related parameters total nitrogen content proteins content lipids content or carbohydrates content this means that today a full characterization of the organic waste is possible using nirs and non linear modeling the demonstrated feasibility of applying nirs on raw and diverse substrates without any required sample preparation freeze drying and grinding has huge implications for the industry indeed this finally opens the door to online and at site applications in the organic waste recovery industry ad composting pyrogasification from an applicative and industrial perspective future steps will be to demonstrate equivalent performance on low resolution and low cost portable spectrometers as already shown on dried samples mallet et al 2021b indeed while the current study has demonstrated the feasibility based on lab scale spectrometers with costs ranging between 50 000 and 100 000 the feasibility of the approach on low cost spectrometers below 10 000 should be validated for it to be fully suitable on full scale biogas plants transfer strategies from standard benchtop spectrometers to online spectrometers will also need to be evaluated from a more fundamental perspective future steps should focus on the interpretability of these non linear models in particular better understand how the oh absorption regions are used by these non linear

15308,fast characterization of organic waste using near infrared spectroscopy nirs has been successfully developed in the last decade however up to now an on site use of this technology has been hindered by necessary sample preparation steps freeze drying and grinding to avoid important water effects on nirs recent research studies have shown that these effects are highly non linear and relate both to the biochemical and physical properties of samples to account for these complex effects the current study compares the use of many different types of non linear methods such as partial least squares regression plsr based methods global clustered and local versions of plsr machine learning methods support vector machines regression trees and ensemble methods and deep learning methods artificial and convolutional neural networks on an independent test data set non linear methods showed errors 28 lower than linear methods the standard errors of prediction obtained for the prediction of total solids content ts chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical methane potential bmp were respectively 8 160 mg o2 gts 1 and 92 ml ch4 gts 1 these latter errors are similar to successful nirs applications developed on freeze dried samples these findings hold great promises regarding the development of at site and online nirs solutions in anaerobic digestion plants graphical abstract graphical abstract a comprehensive comparison of non linear calibration methods for nirs based characterization of diverse organic waste in raw form image graphical abstract keywords near infrared spectroscopy anaerobic digestion biochemical methane potential water effects non linear modeling neural network data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in bioprocesses such as composting anaerobic digestion ad or pyro gasification the ability to effectively characterize the input organic waste is a necessary condition for optimizing the process jacobi et al 2011 jimenez et al 2015 unfortunately the input feedstock may cover a tremendously wide range of biochemical and physical properties thus making the development of fast and robust analytical procedures a challenging issue in the last decade near infrared spectroscopy nirs in combination with sound multivariate statistical calibrations has emerged as the most reliable and fast solution for characterizing organic materials amongst the developed applications on organic waste the technology has been used to monitor the maturity of compost albrecht et al 2008 vergnoux et al 2009 to assess the biochemical methane potential bmp and biodegradability doublet et al 2013 fitamo et al 2017 godin et al 2015 lesteur et al 2011 mortreuil et al 2018 triolo et al 2014 yang et al 2021 but also to predict important variables such as carbohydrates content nitrogen content and chemical oxygen demand cod charnier et al 2017a cellulose hemicellulose liu et al 2021 or hydrolysis kinetics charnier et al 2017b thanks to these developments a full description of an organic waste can now be provided by nirs in less than three days instead of one to two months for a characteristic like bmp however the analytical process still involves cumbersome sample preparation steps freeze drying and grinding to avoid the effects of water and particle size on nirs which explains the limited adoption of nirs for on line or at site industrial applications water effects on nirs were shown to be highly non linear and resulting from complex interacting physical and chemical effects mallet et al 2021a these physical effects were shown to result from light path length modifications directly related to moisture content by a power law mallet et al 2021c this brings keys to better understand the low performance obtained with linear model based calibrations made on organic waste with diverse biochemical compositions and humidity levels while traditional methods such as plsr have the advantage of simplicity interpretability and robustness these methods are not able to cope with non linear water effects as they rely on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between the predicted characteristic and the spectrum on the other hand non linear methods can consider more complex non linear relationships and thus may provide usable models ni et al 2014 pérez marín et al 2007 different methods can be classified in three categories plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods within chemometrics the founding block of non linear techniques remains plsr wold et al 2001 indeed clustered and local approaches of plsr have been developed where models are built based only on a subset of the dataset this subset can be chosen based on spectral characteristics or using expert knowledge and metadata in local methods based on spectra there is the clustered plsr approach where a clustering method k means preda and saporta 2005 hierarchical clustering tøndel et al 2011 decision tree narayanan et al 2019 is used to identify groups on which to train plsr models when predicting a new observation it is assigned to its cluster based on a spectral distance euclidean or mahalanobis shen et al 2019 or a trained classification method and the corresponding cluster s model is used for prediction in strictly speaking local approaches such as the local plsr shenk et al 1997 or the k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knn lw plsr lesnoff et al 2020 the subset is selected on the fly i e just in time for each new observation based on a spectral distance and the model based on this subset is also built on the fly this type of local approach has been successfully applied for the nirs based prediction of bmp in plant biomasses godin et al 2015 within machine learning methods a first group of methods are based on the regression tree concept with a binary recursive partitioning where models are built within each partition usually a simple average holmes et al 1999 but it can be a plsr eriksson et al 2009 the power of regression trees owes to its simplicity and interpretability based on this regression tree structure ensemble methods have been proposed where forests of such tree models are built based on bagging random forest or boosting xgboost such models have been assessed and compared for nirs based prediction of soil composition de santana et al 2018 nawar and mouazen 2017 or biodiesel blends composition cunha et al 2020 a second group of methods concerns support vector machines svm regression methods drucker et al 1996 which is essentially a constrained version of linear regression where the l2 norm of the coefficient vector is minimized with constraints on the hyperplane maximal margin svm regression is made non linear using kernel functions such as polynomial or gaussian radial basis functions that transform the original data into a higher dimensional feature space to make it possible to perform the linear regression svm regression has been applied in combination with nirs data belousov et al 2002 borin et al 2006 devos et al 2009 and more recently for bmp prediction on algae substrates yao et al 2020 a last category of non linear methods includes deep learning methods artificial neural network ann has been applied to nirs in the last twenty years berzaghi et al 2002 marini et al 2008 nørgaard et al 2013 but the increase of dataset size as well as computational capabilities has recently made it a practical predictive tool in particular one dimensional convolutional neural networks 1d cnn is an architecture that has been found the most suitable for nirs data acquarelli et al 2017 cui and fearn 2018 malek et al 2018 one reason is that the 1d convolution layer plays the role of spectral preprocessor cui and fearn 2018 the power of neural networks lies in its flexible and customizable architecture defined by the number of layers the type of layers dense convolutional and the layers parameters dimensionality padding stride dropout rate activation function mishra and passos 2022 but the challenge of such models is also its complexity and the important number of parameters to tune which makes it prone to overfitting to avoid this the learning hyperparameters mainly batch size number of epochs and learning rate need to be soundly selected another challenge of deep learning methods concerns the low interpretability of the obtained models though some authors propose some numerical tools to investigate the feature importances cui and fearn 2018 in this study the suitability of non linear models is assessed comprehensively for diverse raw organic waste characterization can the higher complexity of machine learning and non linear algorithms provide models usable directly on raw organic materials to answer this non linear methods from the three communities chemometrics machine learning and deep learning are evaluated for the prediction of total solids ts chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical methane potential bmp on different types of organic waste and without any sample preparation drying grinding the calibrated models are evaluated based on their prediction performance root mean squared error rmse median absolute error mad coefficient of determination r2 but also based on their robustness towards water effects i e moisture content variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and reference analyses the dataset consists of 501 different organic waste samples that have been collected in rural territorial and industrial anaerobic digestion plants in france these samples cover a very wide range of biochemical and physical properties solid ligno cellulosic materials like silage cereals ramial wood chips and corn cobs liquid ligno cellulosic suspensions such as manure pig slurry liquid high fat content suspensions catering waste or biowaste sweet emulsions such as lactoserum or syrup or protein and fat solid pastes such as egg waste cacao butter or primary and secondary sludges from wastewater treatment plants the visual aspect of some of these samples is presented in appendix a biochemical characterization of samples was obtained by using nirs based calibration models charnier et al 2017a applied to freeze dried and ground samples the errors of these models on independent test sets were evaluated at 128 mg o2 gts 1 for cod and 78 ml ch4 gts 1 for bmp however for samples which contained volatile molecules e g volatile fatty acids ammonia nh3 that can disappear during the drying process such as silage or biowaste standard bmp and cod measurements were made as described in angelidaki et al 2009 charnier et al 2017a the total solids content was measured on all samples using the standard protocol 48 h of oven drying at 105 c and the standard error of laboratory was evaluated at 5 the histograms of obtained reference values are presented in fig 1 furthermore in order to evaluate the robustness of developed nirs models towards moisture content effects a dataset of nirs measurements acquired during n2 drying experiments of various organic substrates was used as described in mallet et al 2021a the oven drying was not used because of possible chemical modifications at high temperatures maillard reactions and freeze drying was not used because it requires to freeze the sample and temperature

knnlwplsr lesnoff et al 2020 consisted of the similar procedure as the knnr but instead of the average a locally weighted plsr kim et al 2011 was calculated for each neighborhood the calculated plsr was weighted using a normalized sum to one version of the gaussian radial basis function φ applied to distances δ i between the predicted observation and its neighbors eq 2 φ δ i exp δ i h σ δ with σ δ the standard deviation of distances and h the similarity index simply said this weighing ensures that the closest neighbors to the predicted observation will influence more the final model parameter

102 103 and the regularization parameter c 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 101 102 103 3 a decision tree regression referred here as rtree which involves a binary recursive partitioning where the prediction for a given observation is based on a simple average of the fold group of observations in which it lies two hyperparameters were considered for tuning the maximum depth of tree 5 10 30 50 100 the minimum number of observations in a fold 5 10 30 4 an ensemble random forest method referred here as rf which consists in growing multiple regression trees based on random sub selections of features and observations and then bagging all these tree models by averaging its predictions various hyperparameters were fixed the minimum number of samples within each leaf 5 the number of features drawn for

and the total number of trees 5 20 50 100 150 5 an ensemble extreme gradient boosting method referred here as xgb which consists in growing multiple regression trees based on random sub selections of features and observations but based on a boosting principle where each new tree is grown to predict the residuals from the sum of predictions made by the existing trees three hyperparameters were considered for tuning the number of trees 5 20 50 100 150 the maximum depth of trees 5 10 20 30 50 100 and the learning rate 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 6 an artificial neural network ann model referred here as nn with a simple dense structure a unique dense layer of 25 neurons was chosen with rectified linear unit relu activation functions which guarantee the non linearity of the method the architecture is presented in fig 2 three hyperparameters were considered for tuning the learning rate 0 001 0 005 0 01 the number of epochs 100 300 500 1000 and the batch size 5 10 30 7 a convolutional neural network

the impact of adding a prior dimension reduction step to the model pipeline was evaluated indeed models were built not only on the original variables but also on the scores of a global principal components analysis pca or a global plsr respectively referred as pca and pls in the case of pca a singular value decomposition svd is applied to the centered spectra x leading to x ukσkvk t with k the number of components chosen σ the singular values and u and v the left and right singular vectors with vtv i the scores tk are calculated as tk xvk the number of components of the pca or plsr was set to 25 components this prior dimension reduction step allowed to reduce the computation time and to stabilize the tuning of non linear methods which are prone to overfitting 2 4 data analysis and model calibration all the data analysis presented in fig 3 was performed using python 3 7 11 data wrangling with pandas 1 3 4 numpy 1 19 5 scipy 1 7 1 scikit learn 1 0 1 tensorflow 2 7 0 and plotting

nir spectra to reduce the random and systematic variations unrelated to the characteristic of interest roger et al 2020 here only simple preprocessing methods were evaluated a simple standard normal

savitzky golay derivation referred as sg2 and a simple combination of detrend and standard normal variate referred as dt2 snv to get rid of additive and multiplicative effects roger et al 2020 the raw absorbance signal referred as a was used directly as well which resulted overall in testing six different preprocessing conditions the preprocessed spectra are presented in appendix b to evaluate the built models a validation test set was constituted with the aim of producing a representative validation test set the duplex algorithm snee 1977 was run for each reference characteristic ts cod bmp triplicates remained grouped together within the train or test sets for all methods the tuning of hyperparameters was done using a repeated randomized grouped k fold cross validation with k 5 the fold number and n r e p e a t s 30 the repetition number sample triplicates were always kept within one fold to ensure independence between splits within cross validation for each cross validation run various metrics were then calculated the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae willmott and matsuura 2005 the coefficient of determination r2 the choice of the hyperparameters was made by analyzing all these metrics together i e choosing the set of hyperparameters minimizing rmse and mae while maximizing r2 the final performances of the obtained models were evaluated on the

each model towards ts variations i e moisture content the models were applied on the dataset of n2 drying experiments presented in section 2 1 mallet et al 2021a the total error of the models can be seen as the result of the average error per substrate inter substrate error and the standard deviation of the errors within each substrate intra substrate error for each substrate the average of the absolute residuals was calculated as well as the standard deviation of absolute residuals let s be the substrate number s 1 89 and ms the space of moisture content levels covered by this substrate for each substrate number s and moisture content level k with k ms an absolute residual can be calculated as in equation 3 the inter substrates and intra substrates errors are calculated for each substrate and correspond respectively to the average and the standard deviation of these residuals for k ms eqs 4 and 5 eq 3 r s k y s k y s k eq 4 a b s o l u t e e r r o r i n t e r s u b s t r a t

predicts the biochemical composition while the intra substrate error is related to how much the model is sensitive to the varying ts the boxplots of these inter substrate and intra substrate errors are plotted in fig 7 3 results discussion 3 1 data overview the distributions of the biochemical variables ts cod bmp of the substrates are provided in fig 4 with histograms of train and test sets respectively in blue and orange the ranges are very wide with ts values between 0 5 and 100 bmp values between 21 and 847 ml ch4 gts 1 and cod values between 456 and 2 800 mg o2 gts 1 the distributions of train and test sets are similar thanks to the duplex algorithm applied to each reference variables ts cod bmp while the distributions of bmp and cod appear to follow normal distributions the distribution of ts values appear to follow a bi normal distribution with a group of substrates with ts values below 30 and a group of substrates with ts values above 80 indeed this latter group of substrates corresponds to naturally low moisture content samples such as high fat content substrates e g oil slaughterhouse waste or agro industrial waste e g flour sucrose paper as well as samples that were simply freeze dried to extend the range of ts on which the models can work i e increase robustness 3 2 model performances linear methods plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods for each model type the results rmse and r2 on train and test sets for the best obtained models amongst the six preprocessing pipelines that were evaluated a a sg1 a sg2 a snv a dt2 a dt2 snv are presented in fig 5 the results for all the six preprocessing pipelines are presented in appendix d and appendix e the rmse and r2 for the best obtained linear plsr models were respectively 10 31 and 0 89 for ts prediction 240 mg o2 gts 1 and 0 77 for cod prediction and 127 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 63 for bmp prediction for ts prediction the difference in error between the nirs based method and the reference method 5 31 is rather low and acceptable this is especially true knowing the huge benefit of being able to measure such variable in only a couple of minutes with nirs instead of 24 h with the reference method however for cod or bmp prediction the errors obtained with nirs based linear models are significantly higher than the errors of the reference methods 112 mg o2 gts 1 for cod and 49 ml ch4 gts 1 for bmp in most cases non linear methods allowed to build models with significantly lower errors than with the linear methods indeed non linear models showed rmse values lowered by up to 23 for ts prediction up to 33 for cod prediction and up to 28 for bmp prediction the best models were obtained with k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knnlwplsr and convolutional neural networks cnn with rmse and r2 respectively equal to 8 and 0 94 for ts prediction respectively equal to 160 mg o2 gts 1 and 0 90 for cod prediction and respectively equal to 92 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 80 for bmp prediction for some models a prior pca was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the input signals pca nn pca xgb pca rf in most cases this resulted in slightly lower model performances compared to models with the raw signal as input xgb rf for example for ts prediction applying a pca reduction before a random forest pca rf resulted in an rmse and r2 of 9 3 and 0 91 instead of 8 5 and 0 93 without pca reduction rf for bmp prediction applying a pca reduction before an extreme gradient boosting pca xgb resulted in an rmse and r2 of 101 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 76 instead of 96 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 79 without pca reduction xgb however in some cases the pca reduction did not deteriorate the models for example for bmp prediction applying a random forest with pca rf or without rf a pca reduction resulted in equal rmse and r2 respectively 111 ml ch4 gts 1 and 0 71 in such cases one advantage of applying the dimension reduction method is the gain in computation time indeed not only the method is faster because there are less weights to optimize 20 25 weights instead of 1501 25 weights which results in 25 less time for 500 samples but because there are less weights to optimize the number of iterations needed to find a satisfactory model is also reduced for a batch size of 10 100 epochs are needed instead of 500 which results in a final reduction in computation time of 85 for 500 samples it must be pointed out that a dense neural network without prior dimension reduction nn was not evaluated because such model architecture results in too many coefficients to optimize and therefore an unstable learning process a closer look at the models is provided in fig 6 the observed and predicted values are shown for the three predicted variables ts cod bmp for the best obtained models linear and non linear respectively to the left and right of the figure the best non linear models were obtained using convolutional neural networks cnn though as already mentioned the models obtained with k nearest neighbors locally weighted plsr knnlwplsr showed similar performances these models when built directly on preprocessed data i e sg2 snv or dt2 for respectively ts cod and bmp happen to be more performant than the models built on raw spectra this puts into perspective some observations made in previous studies cui and fearn 2018 that highlighted the fact that the advantage of convolutional neural networks is that they can be applied without any preprocessing steps and that the preprocessing will be found automatically nevertheless for all predicted variables ts cod bmp the prediction points from the non linear models appear much closer to the diagonal line than linear models which shows how non linear models are much more suited for raw organic waste characterization as expected the train observations in blue are closer to this diagonal line than the test observations in orange because models were built on these train observations however the more significant differences observed between train and test observations for non linear models could imply that these models are still slightly overfit this would imply that these models leave further room for improvements through further hyperparameter tuning nevertheless the obtained errors on the test set in orange are already highly promising the mean absolute deviation mad is provided and complements the rmse and r2 by providing an idea of the error to expect for most samples for bmp prediction while the rmsep equals to 91 8 ml ch4 gts 1 the madp equals to only 52 ml ch4 gts 1 this shows how well the non linear models perform and how in most cases the error made on bmp prediction is very low 3 3 robustness towards moisture content effects one of the questions regarding the use of these non linear models is whether the accuracy gain that was demonstrated here is due to a lower sensitivity to water effects ts differences or due to better considering the differences in biochemical types when estimating the relationship between the signal and the variable to predict as presented in section 2 1 in order to evaluate the robustness of developed nirs models towards moisture content effects a dataset of nirs measurements acquired during n2 drying experiments of various organic substrates was used mallet et al 2021a for cod prediction as indicated by the red arrow in fig 7 switching from a linear to a non linear model results in a decrease of 23 of the average inter substrate error but an increase of 13 of the average intra substrate error similarly for bmp prediction as indicated by the red arrow in fig 7 switching from a linear to a non linear model results in a decrease of 14 of the average inter substrate error but an increase of 67 of the average intra substrate error in other words for cod or bmp prediction the gain in accuracy that was previously observed for non linear models results from a better modeling of the different substrate types physical and biochemical differences more than higher robustness towards ts variations theoretically the ideal absorption law the beer lambert law states that the relationship between concentration and the signal is linear but because here there are so many different substrates the scattering levels are very different and this makes this law poorly adapted for example the reflectance of highly absorbing samples such as raw biogas slurry but also forward scattering transparent liquids oils may have low general levels of measured reflectance these samples will surely not have the same reflectance level than highly scattering samples such as straw flour or biowaste while linear models have difficulties coping with these big differences in signal levels the power of non linear models lies precisely in the ability to work by clusters of substrates finding specific relationships between the signal and the predicted variable locally indeed the relationship between bmp or cod and the measured signals on raw biogas slurry will be different than the relationship between the bmp or cod and the measured signals on straw flour or biowaste and using non linear models this relationship can be modeled differently contrarily to linear models the non linear methods allow to account for these scattering differences between substrates finding different linear relationships for each substrate types in the end non linear methods allowed to reduce the errors that were previously made by linear models between substrate types another aspect related to moisture content effects concerns the oh absorption region around 1430 nm and 1940 nm many studies show that this region is in fact full of indirect information related to chemical composition due to the multiple oh bonding types that water makes with the molecules present in the substrate mallet et al 2021a tsenkova et al 2018 future investigations should be oriented towards interpreting the non linear models to better understand how this region is used by the models this result redefines the scientific questions and technical challenges related to building nir applications on raw wet and diverse organic waste while water effects are certainly a high source of variance with non linearities to be dealt with mallet et al 2021a 2021c it appears that the non linearity due solely to the diversity of organic waste i e biochemical and physical types is very high and that therefore applying non linear models on such datasets can allow a significant gain in accuracy that allows these models to show similar final errors as linear calibrations built on dry samples 4 conclusions in this study non linear methods including plsr based methods machine learning methods and deep learning methods were successfully leveraged to build satisfactory ts cod and bmp prediction models based on nirs and applicable on raw and diverse organic waste a general gain in accuracy of 28 based on rmsep was obtained compared to models built with linear methods this significant gain was shown to be mostly due to better modeling the diversity of biochemical and physical types more than being more robust to moisture content variations though not detailed in this study the presented modeling approach based on non linear methods could be successfully applied to other important parameters such as n related parameters total nitrogen content proteins content lipids content or carbohydrates content this means that today a full characterization of the organic waste is possible using nirs and non linear modeling the demonstrated feasibility of applying nirs on raw and diverse substrates without any required sample preparation freeze drying and grinding has huge implications for the industry indeed this finally opens the door to online and at site applications in the organic waste recovery industry ad composting pyrogasification from an applicative and industrial perspective future steps will be to demonstrate equivalent performance on low resolution and low cost portable spectrometers as already shown on dried samples mallet et al 2021b indeed while the current study has demonstrated the feasibility based on lab scale spectrometers with costs ranging between 50 000 and 100 000 the feasibility of the approach on low cost spectrometers below 10 000 should be validated for it to be fully suitable on full scale biogas plants transfer strategies from standard benchtop spectrometers to online spectrometers will also need to be evaluated from a more fundamental perspective future steps should focus on the interpretability of these non linear models in particular better understand how the oh absorption regions are used by these non linear

15309,conventional polyamide pa nanofiltration nf membranes can readily adsorb aromatic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs therefore these substances can easily be transported across the membrane by solution diffusion resulting in a poor edc rejection in this work a novel thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane was fabricated by incorporating covalent organic frameworks cofs into the pa layer via an interfacial polymerization reaction cofs with functional groups can provide abundant active binding sites for highly efficient edc capture the rejection of the optimal tfn cof membrane for bisphenol a bisphenol af and sodium 2 biphenylate was 98 3 99 1 and 99 3 respectively which was much higher than of the rejection of the pristine nf membrane 82 4 95 5 and 96 4 respectively additionally the tfn cof membrane could be regenerated fast and efficiently by washing with ethanol for some minutes cof nanofillers with porous structures provide additional water channels making it possible to overcome the permeability selectivity trade off of nf membranes the water permeance 17 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of the optimal membrane was about two times higher than for the pristine nf membrane 8 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in addition the tfn cof membrane with a cof loading of 0 05 w v had an excellent na2so4 rejection 95 2 due to size exclusion and strong donnan effect this work combines traditional nf membranes and adsorption materials to achieve efficient capture and rapid release of edcs without sacrificing salt rejections which opens the door to develop fit for purpose adsorptive nf membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capture and release of endocrine disrupting compounds tfn cof membranes interfacial polymerization na2so4 rejection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to rapid urbanization and industrialization water pollution has become an emerging issue threatening human health insufficiently treated wastewater discharge is one of the primary causes of water contamination sukatis et al 2022 tao et al 2022 xu et al 2022a endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are frequently detected in municipal and industrial wastewater and could lead to adverse health effects for animals and humans even at trace concentrations ahmed et al 2018 xu et al 2022b nanofiltration nf has drawn increasing attention in water treatment and wastewater reclamation and has been widely reported to remove edcs nevertheless the rejection of edcs of the existing polyamide nf membranes can be even lower than 50 hindering their further applications jin et al 2010 kimura et al 2004 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 the low rejection can be attributed to 1 hydrophobic interactions between edcs and membranes 2 an inappropriate pore size of nf membrane for edcs removal and 3 solution diffusion of edcs in the polyamide pa matrix dai et al 2021 peng et al 2022 yang et al 2020b hydrophilic surface coating of nf membranes is one of the strategies for enhancing the rejection of edcs however the coating method often increases the membrane thickness compromising the water permeance guo et al 2017 xu et al 2021 incorporating nanoparticles into the pa active layer which is referred to as a thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane is another attractive route to address the trade off between water permeance and rejection of edcs uniformly dispersed nanofillers provide an optimized water transport path enabling an enhanced water permeance liao et al 2021 yang et al 2020b for example wang s group incorporated metal organic frameworks mofs into the pa layer the resultant membrane showed an excellent edc rejection 79 8 and a high water flux 39 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 due to the constructed water edc selective nanochannels pores by mofs dai et al 2019 although most existing tfn membranes exhibit an increased water permeance the enhancement in rejection of edcs is less obvious covalent organic frameworks cofs are porous organic polymeric materials consisting of covalently bound organic building blocks ahmed and jhung 2021 cofs have been widely used in water remediation applications adsorption and filtration due to its superior intrinsic properties such as the ordered geometry high porosity high specific surface area good water stability easy reusability and excellent adsorption capacity et al fan et al 2018 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 wang s group successfully prepared tpb dmtp cofs with large channels and a high specific surface area and employed them as an efficient adsorbent for sulfamerazine the tpb dmtp cof proved to be a promising adsorbent for sulfamerazine due to its high fast adsorption kinetics adsorption capacity 209 mg g and reusability zhuang et al 2020 although cofs exhibit an excellent adsorption performance for organic micropollutants their nanoparticle form inherently impedes their practicality first the adsorbent recovery needs further filtration steps second the agglomeration of the nanoparticles declines the number of adsorption sites last the packed column requires substantial pressure to achieve a higher permeance fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 2019 notably the incorporation of cofs in nf membranes is expected to efficiently remove organic micropollutants from wastewater moreover the presence of hydrogen bonding or π π interactions between cofs and the membrane imparts superior compatibility to the fabricated cof based membranes li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 however few studies have reported tfn cof porous membranes for removing edcs from wastewater in this work tpb dmtp cof was selected and uniformly deposited on the pes substrate before forming the pa layer to construct a tfn cof membrane the orderly arranged pores and outstanding specific surface area about 3000 m2 g endow tpb dmtp cof with more adsorption sites to allow a high affinity over host guest interactions in an attractive way the membrane separation

wastewater the performance of tfn cof membranes in simulated water was investigated to explore the feasibility of solving practical environmental problems the simulated wastewater consisted of edcs humic acid ha and kaolinite the used ha concentration was set at 10 mg l to represent a typical dissolved organic carbon doc content the kaolinite concentration was set at 10 mg l to indicate the turbidity of simulated edc containing raw water the solution conductivity was modulated with a 20 mmol l cacl2 solution at 4 bar yang et al 2020b the used concentration of edcs 2 mg l bpa 5 mg l bpaf and 5 mg l sopp in the aqueous feed solution were considerably higher than the range recorded in municipal and industrial wastewater e g 0 23 149 µg l for bpa santhi et al 2012 before detecting edcs the simulated wastewater was filtered through a 0 22 μm pes microfiltration membrane to remove suspended particles the analytical method for edcs can be found in section s1 in the supplementary information 2 6 sorption tests after edc filtration testing the used membranes were cut into smaller samples of 3 cm by 3 cm and gently rinsed with di water the membrane samples were then put into 30 ml of a 50 wt ethanol solution and shaken at 200 rpm for 2 h to remove the edcs the extracted samples were then used for edc analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the tpb dmtp cof was synthesized by the condensation of 1 3 5 tri 4 aminophenyl benzene tpb and 2 5 dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde dmtp under solvothermal conditions the detailed synthesis procedure is provided in section s2 in the supplementary information the xrd patterns the n2 adsorption isotherms curve the ftir spectra and the tem image of the tpb dmtp cof are shown in fig s3 these results indicate that the resulting cof had a high crystallinity and a large specific surface area the chemical composition of the pes nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was measured by ftir fig 2 a compared with the pristine pes substrate a new characteristic peak at around 1628 cm 1 appeared in the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes which corresponds to the c o stretching vibration from the carbonyl groups introduced by the ip reaction between pip and tmc the typical c n stretching vibration peak 1507 cm 1 and c n stretching peak 1352 cm 1 from tpb dmtp cof appeared on the tfn cof0 05 membrane indicating successful cof incorporation xps spectra of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes are displayed in fig 2b which shows three characteristic peaks at a binding energy of 287 ev c1s 401 ev n1s and 533 ev o1s an obvious difference in fig 2c and d can be found between the deconvoluted o 1s spectra of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes the typical peak rate of n c o groups from the nf blank membrane 77 70 is higher than the tfn cof0 05 membrane 71 42 indicating a higher crosslinking degree of the nf blank membrane moreover the o c o groups originate from carboxylates due to the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride groups present in tmc the o c o groups peak rate of nf blank membrane 22 30 is lower than tfn cof0 05 membrane 28 58 indicating that more acyl chloride groups did not participate in the ip process in the latter and cannot form a dense pa layer in addition the crosslinking degree of the separation layer can be calculated by the equations given in section s3 the nf blank membrane showed a higher crosslinking degree of 49 3 compared with the tfn cof0 05 membrane 26 9 this indicates that a loose separation layer is formed cof nanofillers could attract water molecules around them which would hydrolyze tmc and terminate the ip reaction in their vicinity resulting in an incompact pa layer the results are consistent with the deconvoluted o 1s spectra the surface charge of membranes significantly influences their rejection ability the surface charge properties of the fabricated membranes were determined by the zeta potential measurement see fig 2e the nf blank and the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a negatively charged surface which can be attributed to the cooh groups generated from the hydrolysis of the unreacted acyl chlorides the negatively charged surface endows the tfn cof0 05 membrane with a high rejection of na2so4 and sopp which is discussed further the dynamic water contact angle of the membranes is shown in fig 2f during the first five seconds the contact angle of the membranes decreased compared with the commercial nf 270 the more hydrophilic nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes are expected to have a better edc removal efficiency due to the reduced hydrophobic interactions gao et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 the morphology of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was characterized by sem the nf blank membrane showed a typical protuberant and wrinkled structure because of the interface convective flow caused by the intense exothermic reaction between ip and tmc fig 3 a more pronounced nodules and protuberant surfaces were found at the tfn cof0 05 membrane fig 3b introducing cof nanofillers would enhance the pip sorption and thus increase the local amine monomer concentrations which intensifies the instantaneous ip reaction resulting in rougher membrane morphology fig 3c and d display the cross sectional sem images of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes respectively the thickness of the separation layer of the tfn cof0 05 membrane 70 nm was lower than that of the pristine membrane 100 nm which is consistent with the results measured by the ellipsometry method table s3 this observation is mainly ascribed to the following two reasons first the pip molecules can form hydrogen bonds with the amine groups of the cofs leading to a decline of the pip diffusion rate second the cof nanofillers can efficiently enhance the sorption and control the release of the pip increasing the local pip concentration according to the freger theory decreasing the diffusion rate of amine monomers or elevating the local amine monomer concentration can lead to a thinner pa layer during the ip process freger and srebnik 2003 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 the sem image of the tpb dmtp cof powder is shown in fig 3e the embedding of the nanofiller under the pa layer can be observed in fig 3f from this figure it can be seen that the cofs were evenly dispersed between the pes substrate and the pa layer forming a sandwich like structure however the nanosheets start to agglomerate and present significant folds on the membrane surface with increased cof deposition as evident in fig s4 a and b resulting a poor separation performance the surface roughness of nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was measured by afm and the results are presented in fig 3g and h the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a higher roughness of 22 8 nm compared with that of the pristine nf membrane 15 6 nm due to the introduction of nanofillers and the intensified instantaneous ip reaction the enhanced convex structure and folds can effectively increase the contact area of water molecules during the trans membrane process which is conducive to enhancing water permeance 3 2 salt rejection fig 4 presents the effect of the cofs content on the separation performance of tfn cof membranes a remarkable enhancement in the water permeance of membranes was found when increasing the cofs content fig 4a more specifically the tfn cof0 05 membrane had an outstanding water permeance of 17 14 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was approximately two times higher than that of the nf blank membrane 8 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 introducing cof nanofillers can significantly increase the local pip concentration and reduce the pip diffusion rate thus forming a thinner pa layer the thin separation layer had a small transmembrane hydraulic resistance leading to a high water permeance furthermore cof nanofillers with porous structures can optimize transport pathways by providing additional water pathways lastly the rough membrane surface with increased contact areas is favorable for the transport of water molecules the salt rejections of the nf blank and tfn cof membranes for nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 are presented in fig 4b the salt rejection decreased with increasing cof loading from 0 01 to 0 2 w v which can be attributed to the formation of a loose separation layer furthermore the salt rejection order na2so4 mgcl2 nacl indicates that tfn cof membranes have a negatively charged surface consistent with the zeta potential measurement results notably the tfn cof0 05 membrane still showed a high na2so4 rejection 95 23 due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic repulsion interactions and size exclusion to further investigate the rejection mechanism the rejection of theneutral peg probe by the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was explored as the peg rejection is governed by size exclusion as displayed in fig 4c the mwco of the tfn cof0 05 membrane 280 da was higher than the nf blank membrane 230 da indicating a looser structure of the tfn cof0 05 membrane this result is consistent with the crosslinking degree results in addition the similar zeta potential trend between the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membrane fosters the outstanding na2so4 rejection based on the electrostatic repulsion interaction the permeance of the single salt solutions na2so4 mgcl2 nacl of the nf blank and tfn cof membranes is shown in fig s5 similar to the pure water permeance the water permeance of salt solutions increased with an increased cof loading moreover the tfn cof membranes showed an excellent na2so4 rejection with the cof contents increasing from 0 to 0 05 w v fig 4d while the selectivity rapidly decreased when the cof loading exceeded 0 10 w v this change can be attributed to the impaired selective layer due to nanomaterial agglomeration 3 3 edc rejection fig 5 demonstrates the edcs separation performance of the tfn cof membranes with different cofs contents the water permeance of the tfn cof membranes increased significantly compared with that of the pristine nf membrane fig s6 the edcs rejection of tfn cof membranes also increased effectively with enhanced cof contents as can be seen in fig 5a taking bpa as an example the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a water bpa selectivity nearly four times as large as the nf blank membrane fig 5b this improvement is mainly due to the strong adsorption ability of the incorporated cofs to further investigate the edcs rejection mechanism adsorption of edcs bpa bpaf and sopp by tfn cof membranes was studied as shown in fig 5c the adsorption capacity of the pes substrate is not included the sorption experiments indicate that the edcs sorption amount enhanced with increased cof loading the functional groups from cofs in the membrane i e amine hydroxylic carboxylic aromatic and phenolic groups can dominate the edc capture the hydrogen bond and π π interactions render the tfn cof membranes a high edc affinity via host guest interactions furthermore the edc rejection of the tfn cof0 30 membrane was determined to explore the performance of the tfn cof membranes with the maximum cof loading the results showed a compromised edc rejection and water edc selectivity which may be attributed to the severe agglomeration of nanofillers forming defects in the separation layer see fig s4 fig 5d compares the separation performance of the nf 270 nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membrane regarding edc removal efficiency the edcs rejection of the tfn cof0 05 membrane was much higher than that of the nf 270 and nf blank membrane in addition to the strong adsorption of cofs for edcs other factors such as size sieving electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions should be considered as well considering the different properties of the three edcs used in this study fig s1 their separation mechanism needs to be discussed separately first for the neutral molecules bpa and bpaf the difference in their molecular weights led to different removal rates regardless of the adsorption effect of cofs the nf 270 mwco of 340 da and the nf blank mwco of 230 da showed a high rejection for edcs with a larger size i e bpaf m w 336 23 da due to the size exclusion mechanism the nf 270 membrane had a very low bpa m w 228 29 da rejection because of the relatively large pore size mwco 340 da and hydrophobic surface fig 5d the donnan effect must be considered for negatively charged edcs i e sopp although sopp has the smallest molecular weight m w 193 20 da negatively charged membranes have a higher sopp rejection due to the strong charge repulsion as a result the nf blank and nf 270 membranes have higher rejection for bpaf and sopp than bpa surprisingly the tfn cof0 05 membrane had almost 100 rejection for the three considered edcs before cofs reached adsorption saturation this increased rejection is due the adsorption effect of cofs on the pa matrix notably based on the edc rejection of the nf blank membrane 82 4 for bpa 95 5 for bpaf and 96 4 for sopp it can be concluded that the tfn cof0 05 membrane would first achieve adsorption saturation using bpa as the feed solution in this case the regeneration performance of the membrane needs to be explored which will be discussed in the next section a schematic representation of edcs and na2so4 rejection of tfn cof membranes is presented in fig 5e during the ip process the cof nanofiller could attract water molecules around them which would hydrolyze tmc and terminate the ip reaction in their vicinity forming hydrophilic nanochannels and thinner separation layers as mentioned before thus the porous interlayer can provide additional water pathways which reduces the transmembrane hydraulic resistance and improves the water permeance of membranes according to the solution diffusion theory the transport of a hydrophobic solute is primarily governed by membrane adsorption and further diffusion in the membrane li et al 2019 when the contaminated water flows and penetrates through the membrane edcs are transported from the bulk solution to the external surface of the pa layer then the internal mass transfer of the edcs is carried out by pore diffusion from the outer surface to the inner pores the hydrophilic surface size sieving and electrostatic repulsion are the first barriers preventing the passage of edcs fortunately the edcs that are still able to escape the first barriers and enter the membrane interior would be captured and fixed by the cofs 3 4 long term membrane stability and regeneration performance a long term stability experiment cross flow filtration for 70 h was carried out by using an aqueous feed solution containing 2 mg l bpa 5 mg l bpaf and 5 mg l sopp the results are presented in fig 6 the used edc concentration was much higher than the range recorded in industrial and municipal wastewaters taking bpa for example 0 23 149 μg l the rejection of bpa bpaf and sopp by the nf blank membrane was 82 4 95 5 and 96 4 respectively considering the similar surface hydrophilicity mwco and surface charge density of the nf blank and the tfn cof0 05 membrane it could be assumed that the removal rate of edcs by the two membranes is at the same level before the edc adsorption by the cofs therefore after passing through the first barriers the edcs are captured by cofs gradually making the membrane saturated in this case membrane regeneration is necessary to allow for the reusability of the membrane in this study the bpa removal efficiency was evaluated for 10 cycles the removal efficiency reached 90 for one cycle using the tfn cof0 05 membrane fig 6a the saturated membrane can be regenerated by ethanol washing for 2 min every 7 h as the selected bpa concentration 2 mg l was much higher than the typical concentration range recorded in wastewaters 0 23 149 μg l it can be estimated that for real life wastewaters the tfn cof0 05 membrane can run for 0 13 to 7 04 years before saturation is reached supporting information s4 however it is an ideal calculation and the actual wastewater treatment situation will be more complicated shortening the average service life of the membrane if saturation is reached the membrane can be simply regenerated with ethanol washing for 2 min to release the bpa the bpa removal efficiency of the nf 270 membrane remained stable at around 30 indicating that this membrane is not suitable for the treatment of bpa wastewater moreover the tfn cof0 05 membrane maintained relatively stable bpaf and sopp rejections during the 70 h filtration test as can be seen from fig 6 b and c this result indicates that the tfn cof0 05 membrane did not reach saturation when bpaf or sopp were used in the feed solution for the 70 h filtration test despite the much higher bpaf and sopp concentration than that in typical wastewaters due to the relatively larger size of bpaf and the negatively charged nature of sopp only a small amount of bpaf and sopp passes through the membrane resulting in stable rejections at 99 1 and 99 3 respectively therefore only a small amount of bpaf and sopp is adsorbed by the cofs the bpaf and sopp rejection of the tfn cof0 05 was better than that of the nf blank membrane and superior to the nf 270 commercial membrane this indicates the potential of the novel membranes for practical applications in edc removal from wastewater furthermore the bpa contaminated ethanol can be concentrated and separated to obtain pure ethanol and bpa bpa is used to synthesize materials such as polycarbonate and epoxy resins and is used in the manufacture of plastic bottles e g water milk sippy cups and the inner coating of food and beverage cans e g milk powder ohore and zhang 2019 this work demonstrates that bpa can successfully be separated from wastewater to obtain pure chemicals for further industrial applications 3 5 simulated raw water edcs 5 mg l bpaf 5 mg l sopp and 2 mg l bpa were added into simulated raw water 20 mmol l cacl2 10 mg l kaolinite and 10 mg l ha to explore the usability of the tfn cof0 05 membrane for addressing real environmental problems these results are presented in fig s7 the selected edcs concentration was much higher than that in natural wastewater the cross flow filtration experiment was operated for 2 h to obtain the permeate solution the water permeance of the nf 270 and tfn cof0 05 membranes was 20 4 and 17 1 m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively the rejection of bpa bpaf and sopp by the tfn cof0 05 membrane in simulated water was 97 8 99 0 and 99 1 respectively the rejection performance was superior to the nf 270 membrane 30 2 91 5 and 65 4 respectively the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a high edc removal efficiency owing to the hydrophilic surface smaller mwco and abundant adsorption sites the membrane separation performance in terms of edcs e g bpa was compared with the state of the art membranes as shown in table 1 the tfn cof membrane has an outstanding bpa removal efficiency without compromising the water permeance given the exceptional removal performance for both edcs and na2so4 the high water permeance and the excellent renewability the tfn cof0 05 membrane has commercial potential in wastewater reclamation as it overcomes the drawbacks of existing adsorbents in wastewater treatment as discussed in the introduction part 4 conclusion in this work nanostructured cofs were pre deposited onto the pes substrate before the ip process to optimize transport pathways compared with the nf blank membrane the optimal tfn cof0 05 membrane has higher water permeance and edcs rejection with a water edc selectivity nearly four times as high as the nf blank membrane the enhancement in water permanence can be ascribed to the additional water pathways and reduced transmembrane hydraulic resistance the enhanced edcs rejection is due to the high quality hydrophilic pa barrier layer and abundant functional active binding sites from cofs compared with the commercial nf 270 membrane the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a significantly higher edcs rejection during the long term stability test the novel tfn cof membrane is expected to run for several months to years in the treatment of real wastewater before regeneration is required furthermore the regeneration experiments indicate that the novel membrane can rapidly release edcs by ethanol washing for 2 min considering the high na2so4 rejection the tfn cof membranes have great potential for treating natural wastewater containing edcs declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

15309,conventional polyamide pa nanofiltration nf membranes can readily adsorb aromatic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs therefore these substances can easily be transported across the membrane by solution diffusion resulting in a poor edc rejection in this work a novel thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane was fabricated by incorporating covalent organic frameworks cofs into the pa layer via an interfacial polymerization reaction cofs with functional groups can provide abundant active binding sites for highly efficient edc capture the rejection of the optimal tfn cof membrane for bisphenol a bisphenol af and sodium 2 biphenylate was 98 3 99 1 and 99 3 respectively which was much higher than of the rejection of the pristine nf membrane 82 4 95 5 and 96 4 respectively additionally the tfn cof membrane could be regenerated fast and efficiently by washing with ethanol for some minutes cof nanofillers with porous structures provide additional water channels making it possible to overcome the permeability selectivity trade off of nf membranes the water permeance 17 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of the optimal membrane was about two times higher than for the pristine nf membrane 8 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 in addition the tfn cof membrane with a cof loading of 0 05 w v had an excellent na2so4 rejection 95 2 due to size exclusion and strong donnan effect this work combines traditional nf membranes and adsorption materials to achieve efficient capture and rapid release of edcs without sacrificing salt rejections which opens the door to develop fit for purpose adsorptive nf membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capture and release of endocrine disrupting compounds tfn cof membranes interfacial polymerization na2so4 rejection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to rapid urbanization and industrialization water pollution has become an emerging issue threatening human health insufficiently treated wastewater discharge is one of the primary causes of water contamination sukatis et al 2022 tao et al 2022 xu et al 2022a endocrine disrupting compounds edcs are frequently detected in municipal and industrial wastewater and could lead to adverse health effects for animals and humans even at trace concentrations ahmed et al 2018 xu et al 2022b nanofiltration nf has drawn increasing attention in water treatment and wastewater reclamation and has been widely reported to remove edcs nevertheless the rejection of edcs of the existing polyamide nf membranes can be even lower than 50 hindering their further applications jin et al 2010 kimura et al 2004 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 the low rejection can be attributed to 1 hydrophobic interactions between edcs and membranes 2 an inappropriate pore size of nf membrane for edcs removal and 3 solution diffusion of edcs in the polyamide pa matrix dai et al 2021 peng et al 2022 yang et al 2020b hydrophilic surface coating of nf membranes is one of the strategies for enhancing the rejection of edcs however the coating method often increases the membrane thickness compromising the water permeance guo et al 2017 xu et al 2021 incorporating nanoparticles into the pa active layer which is referred to as a thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane is another attractive route to address the trade off between water permeance and rejection of edcs uniformly dispersed nanofillers provide an optimized water transport path enabling an enhanced water permeance liao et al 2021 yang et al 2020b for example wang s group incorporated metal organic frameworks mofs into the pa layer the resultant membrane showed an excellent edc rejection 79 8 and a high water flux 39 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 due to the constructed water edc selective nanochannels pores by mofs dai et al 2019 although most existing tfn membranes exhibit an increased water permeance the enhancement in rejection of edcs is less obvious covalent organic frameworks cofs are porous organic polymeric materials consisting of covalently bound organic building blocks ahmed and jhung 2021 cofs have been widely used in water remediation applications adsorption and filtration due to its superior intrinsic properties such as the ordered geometry high porosity high specific surface area good water stability easy reusability and excellent adsorption capacity et al fan et al 2018 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 wang s group successfully prepared tpb dmtp cofs with large channels and a high specific surface area and employed them as an efficient adsorbent for sulfamerazine the tpb dmtp cof proved to be a promising adsorbent for sulfamerazine due to its high fast adsorption kinetics adsorption capacity 209 mg g and reusability zhuang et al 2020 although cofs exhibit an excellent adsorption performance for organic micropollutants their nanoparticle form inherently impedes their practicality first the adsorbent recovery needs further filtration steps second the agglomeration of the nanoparticles declines the number of adsorption sites last the packed column requires substantial pressure to achieve a higher permeance fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 2019 notably the incorporation of cofs in nf membranes is expected to efficiently remove organic micropollutants from wastewater moreover the presence of hydrogen bonding or π π interactions between cofs and the membrane imparts superior compatibility to the fabricated cof based membranes li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 however few studies have reported tfn cof porous membranes for removing edcs from wastewater in this work tpb dmtp cof was selected and uniformly deposited on the pes substrate before forming the pa layer to construct a tfn cof membrane the orderly arranged pores and outstanding specific surface area about 3000 m2 g endow tpb dmtp cof with more adsorption sites to allow a high affinity over host guest interactions in an attractive way the membrane separation performance was systematically investigated by determination of the water permeance salt rejection and removal efficiency of three common edcs namely bisphenol a bpa bisphenol af bpaf and sodium 2 biphenylate sopp the separation performance of a commercial nf membrane nf 270 was compared with the fabricated membranes throughout this study morphologies and physicochemical characteristics of the membrane surfaces were studied by sem tem afm xps ftir dynamic water contact angle and zeta potentials a simple ethanol washing operation enabled an easy regeneration of the separation performance of

turbidity of simulated edc containing raw water the solution conductivity was modulated with a 20 mmol l cacl2 solution at 4 bar yang et al 2020b the used concentration of edcs 2 mg l bpa 5 mg l bpaf

information 2 6 sorption tests after edc filtration testing the used membranes were cut into smaller samples of 3 cm by 3 cm and gently rinsed with di water the membrane samples were then put into 30 ml of a 50 wt ethanol solution and shaken at 200 rpm for 2 h to remove the edcs the extracted samples were then used for edc analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the tpb

the resulting cof had a high crystallinity and a large specific surface area the chemical composition of the pes nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was measured by ftir fig 2 a compared with the pristine pes substrate a new characteristic peak at around 1628 cm 1 appeared in the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes which corresponds to the c o stretching vibration from the carbonyl groups introduced by the ip reaction between pip and tmc the typical c n stretching vibration peak 1507 cm 1 and c n stretching peak 1352 cm 1 from tpb dmtp cof appeared on the tfn cof0 05 membrane indicating successful cof incorporation xps spectra of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes are displayed in fig 2b which shows three characteristic peaks at a binding energy of 287 ev c1s 401 ev n1s and 533 ev o1s an obvious difference in fig 2c and d can be found between the deconvoluted o 1s spectra of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes the typical peak rate of n c o groups from the nf blank membrane 77 70 is higher than the tfn cof0 05 membrane 71 42 indicating a higher crosslinking degree of the nf blank membrane moreover the o c o groups originate from carboxylates due to the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride groups present in tmc the o c o groups peak rate of nf blank membrane 22 30 is lower than tfn cof0 05 membrane 28 58 indicating that more acyl chloride groups did not participate in the ip process in the latter and cannot form a dense pa layer in addition the crosslinking degree of the separation layer can be calculated by the equations given in section s3 the nf blank membrane showed a higher crosslinking degree of 49 3 compared with the tfn cof0 05 membrane 26 9 this indicates that a loose separation layer is formed cof nanofillers could attract water molecules around them which would hydrolyze tmc and terminate the ip reaction in their vicinity resulting in an incompact pa layer the results are consistent with the deconvoluted o 1s spectra the surface charge of membranes significantly influences their rejection ability the surface charge properties of the fabricated membranes were determined by the zeta potential measurement see fig 2e the nf blank and the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a negatively charged surface which can be attributed to the cooh groups generated from the hydrolysis of the unreacted acyl chlorides the negatively charged surface endows the tfn cof0 05 membrane with a high rejection of na2so4 and sopp which is discussed further the dynamic water contact angle of the membranes is shown in fig 2f during the first five seconds the contact angle of the membranes decreased compared with the commercial nf 270 the more hydrophilic nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes are expected to have a better edc removal efficiency due to the reduced hydrophobic interactions gao et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 the morphology of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was characterized by sem the nf blank membrane showed a typical protuberant and wrinkled structure because of the interface convective flow caused by the intense exothermic reaction between ip and tmc fig 3 a more pronounced nodules and protuberant surfaces were found at the tfn cof0 05 membrane fig 3b introducing cof nanofillers would enhance the pip sorption and thus increase the local amine monomer concentrations which intensifies the instantaneous ip reaction resulting in rougher membrane morphology fig 3c and d display the cross sectional sem images of the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes respectively the thickness of the separation layer of the tfn cof0 05 membrane 70 nm was lower than that of the pristine membrane 100 nm which is consistent with the results measured by the ellipsometry method table s3 this observation is mainly ascribed to the following two reasons first the pip molecules can form hydrogen bonds with the amine groups of the cofs leading to a decline of the pip diffusion rate second the cof nanofillers can efficiently enhance the sorption and control the release of the pip increasing the local pip concentration according to the freger theory decreasing the diffusion rate of amine monomers or elevating the local amine monomer concentration can lead to a thinner pa layer during the ip process freger and srebnik 2003 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 the sem image of the tpb dmtp cof powder is shown in fig 3e the embedding of the nanofiller under the pa layer can be observed in fig 3f from this figure it can be seen that the cofs were evenly dispersed between the pes substrate and the pa layer forming a sandwich like structure however the nanosheets start to agglomerate and present significant folds on the membrane surface with increased cof deposition as evident in fig s4 a and b resulting a poor separation performance the surface roughness of nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was measured by afm and the results are presented in fig 3g and h the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a higher roughness of 22 8 nm compared with that of the pristine nf membrane 15 6 nm due to the introduction of nanofillers and the intensified instantaneous ip reaction the enhanced convex structure and folds can effectively increase the contact area of water molecules during the trans membrane process which is conducive to enhancing water permeance 3 2 salt rejection fig 4 presents the effect of the cofs content on the separation performance of tfn cof membranes a remarkable enhancement in the water permeance of membranes was found when increasing the cofs content fig 4a more specifically the tfn cof0 05 membrane had an outstanding water permeance of 17 14 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was approximately two times higher than that of the nf blank membrane 8 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 introducing cof nanofillers can significantly increase the local pip concentration and reduce the pip diffusion rate thus forming a thinner pa layer the thin separation layer had a small transmembrane hydraulic resistance leading to a high water permeance furthermore cof nanofillers with porous structures can optimize transport pathways by providing additional water pathways lastly the rough membrane surface with increased contact areas is favorable for the transport of water molecules the salt rejections of the nf blank and tfn cof membranes for nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 are presented in fig 4b the salt rejection decreased with increasing cof loading from 0 01 to 0 2 w v which can be attributed to the formation of a loose separation layer furthermore the salt rejection order na2so4 mgcl2 nacl indicates that tfn cof membranes have a negatively charged surface consistent with the zeta potential measurement results notably the tfn cof0 05 membrane still showed a high na2so4 rejection 95 23 due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic repulsion interactions and size exclusion to further investigate the rejection mechanism the rejection of theneutral peg probe by the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membranes was explored as the peg rejection is governed by size exclusion as displayed in fig 4c the mwco of the tfn cof0 05 membrane 280 da was higher than the nf blank membrane 230 da indicating a looser structure of the tfn cof0 05 membrane this result is consistent with the crosslinking degree results in addition the similar zeta potential trend between the nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membrane fosters the outstanding na2so4 rejection based on the electrostatic repulsion interaction the permeance of the single salt solutions na2so4 mgcl2 nacl of the nf blank and tfn cof membranes is shown in fig s5 similar to the pure water permeance the water permeance of salt solutions increased with an increased cof loading moreover the tfn cof membranes showed an excellent na2so4 rejection with the cof contents increasing from 0 to 0 05 w v fig 4d while the selectivity rapidly decreased when the cof loading exceeded 0 10 w v this change can be attributed to the impaired selective layer due to nanomaterial agglomeration 3 3 edc rejection fig 5 demonstrates the edcs separation performance of the tfn cof membranes with different cofs contents the water permeance of the tfn cof membranes increased significantly compared with that of the pristine nf membrane fig s6 the edcs rejection of tfn cof membranes also increased effectively with enhanced cof contents as can be seen in fig 5a taking bpa as an example the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a water bpa selectivity nearly four times as large as the nf blank membrane fig 5b this improvement is mainly due to the strong adsorption ability of the incorporated cofs to further investigate the edcs rejection mechanism adsorption of edcs bpa bpaf and sopp by tfn cof membranes was studied as shown in fig 5c the adsorption capacity of the pes substrate is not included the sorption experiments indicate that the edcs sorption amount enhanced with increased cof loading the functional groups from cofs in the membrane i e amine hydroxylic carboxylic aromatic and phenolic groups can dominate the edc capture the hydrogen bond and π π interactions render the tfn cof membranes a high edc affinity via host guest interactions furthermore the edc rejection of the tfn cof0 30 membrane was determined to explore the performance of the tfn cof membranes with the maximum cof loading the results showed a compromised edc rejection and water edc selectivity which may be attributed to the severe agglomeration of nanofillers forming defects in the separation layer see fig s4 fig 5d compares the separation performance of the nf 270 nf blank and tfn cof0 05 membrane regarding edc removal efficiency the edcs rejection of the tfn cof0 05 membrane was much higher than that of the nf 270 and nf blank membrane in addition to the strong adsorption of cofs for edcs other factors such as size sieving electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions should be considered as well considering the different properties of the three edcs used in this study fig s1 their separation mechanism needs to be discussed separately first for the neutral molecules bpa and bpaf the difference in their molecular weights led to different removal rates regardless of the adsorption effect of cofs the nf 270 mwco of 340 da and the nf blank mwco of 230 da showed a high rejection for edcs with a larger size i e bpaf m w 336 23 da due to the size exclusion mechanism the nf 270 membrane had a very low bpa m w 228 29 da rejection because of the relatively large pore size mwco 340 da and hydrophobic surface fig 5d the donnan effect must be considered for negatively charged edcs i e sopp although sopp has the smallest molecular weight m w 193 20 da negatively charged membranes have a higher sopp rejection due to the strong charge repulsion as a result the nf blank and nf 270 membranes have higher rejection for bpaf and sopp than bpa surprisingly the tfn cof0 05 membrane had almost 100 rejection for the three considered edcs before cofs reached adsorption saturation this increased rejection is due the adsorption effect of cofs on the pa matrix notably based on the edc rejection of the nf blank membrane 82 4 for bpa 95 5 for bpaf and 96 4 for sopp it can be concluded that the tfn cof0 05 membrane would first achieve adsorption saturation using bpa as the feed solution in this case the regeneration performance of the membrane needs to be explored which will be discussed in the next section a schematic representation of edcs and na2so4 rejection of tfn cof membranes is presented in fig 5e during the ip process the cof nanofiller could attract water molecules around them which would hydrolyze tmc and terminate the ip reaction in their vicinity forming hydrophilic nanochannels and thinner separation layers as mentioned before thus the porous interlayer can provide additional water pathways which reduces the transmembrane hydraulic resistance and improves the water permeance of membranes according to the solution diffusion theory the transport of a hydrophobic solute is primarily governed by membrane adsorption and further diffusion in the membrane li et al 2019 when the contaminated water flows and penetrates through the membrane edcs are transported from the bulk solution to the external surface of the pa layer then the internal mass transfer of the edcs is carried out by pore diffusion from the outer surface to the inner pores the hydrophilic surface size sieving and electrostatic repulsion are the first barriers preventing the passage of edcs fortunately the edcs that are still able to escape the first barriers and enter the membrane interior would be captured and fixed by the cofs 3 4 long term membrane stability and regeneration performance a long term stability experiment cross flow filtration for 70 h was carried out by using an aqueous feed solution containing 2 mg l bpa 5 mg l bpaf and 5 mg l sopp the results are presented in fig 6 the used edc concentration was much higher than the range recorded in industrial and municipal wastewaters taking bpa for example 0 23 149 μg l the rejection of bpa bpaf and sopp by the nf blank membrane was 82 4 95 5 and 96 4 respectively considering the similar surface hydrophilicity mwco and surface charge density of the nf blank and the tfn cof0 05 membrane it could be assumed that the removal rate of edcs by the two membranes is at the same level before the edc adsorption by the cofs therefore after passing through the first barriers the edcs are captured by cofs gradually making the membrane saturated in this case membrane regeneration is necessary to allow for the reusability of the membrane in this study the bpa removal efficiency was evaluated for 10 cycles the removal efficiency reached 90 for one cycle using the tfn cof0 05 membrane fig 6a the saturated membrane can be regenerated by ethanol washing for 2 min every 7 h as the selected bpa concentration 2 mg l was much higher than the typical concentration range recorded in wastewaters 0 23 149 μg l it can be estimated that for real life wastewaters the tfn cof0 05 membrane can run for 0 13 to 7 04 years before saturation is reached supporting information s4 however it is an ideal calculation and the actual wastewater treatment situation will be more complicated shortening the average service life of the membrane if saturation is reached the membrane can be simply regenerated with ethanol washing for 2 min to release the bpa the bpa removal efficiency of the nf 270 membrane remained stable at around 30 indicating that this membrane is not suitable for the treatment of bpa wastewater moreover the tfn cof0 05 membrane maintained relatively stable bpaf and sopp rejections during the 70 h filtration test as can be seen from fig 6 b and c this result indicates that the tfn cof0 05 membrane did not reach saturation when bpaf or sopp were used in the feed solution for the 70 h filtration test despite the much higher bpaf and sopp concentration than that in typical wastewaters due to the relatively larger size of bpaf and the negatively charged nature of sopp only a small amount of bpaf and sopp passes through the membrane resulting in stable rejections at 99 1 and 99 3 respectively therefore only a small amount of bpaf and sopp is adsorbed by the cofs the bpaf and sopp rejection of the tfn cof0 05 was better than that of the nf blank membrane and superior to the nf 270 commercial membrane this indicates the potential of the novel membranes for practical applications in edc removal from wastewater furthermore the bpa contaminated ethanol can be concentrated and separated to obtain pure ethanol and bpa bpa is used to synthesize materials such as polycarbonate and epoxy resins and is used in the manufacture of plastic bottles e g water milk sippy cups and the inner coating of food and beverage cans e g milk powder ohore and zhang 2019 this work demonstrates that bpa can successfully be separated from wastewater to obtain pure chemicals for further industrial applications 3 5 simulated raw water edcs 5 mg l bpaf 5 mg l sopp and 2 mg l bpa were added into simulated raw water 20 mmol l cacl2 10 mg l kaolinite and 10 mg l ha to explore the usability of the tfn cof0 05 membrane for addressing real environmental problems these results are presented in fig s7 the selected edcs concentration was much higher than that in natural wastewater the cross flow filtration experiment was operated for 2 h to obtain the permeate solution the water permeance of the nf 270 and tfn cof0 05 membranes was 20 4 and 17 1 m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively the rejection of bpa bpaf and sopp by the tfn cof0 05 membrane in simulated water was 97 8 99 0 and 99 1 respectively the rejection performance was superior to the nf 270 membrane 30 2 91 5 and 65 4 respectively the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a high edc removal efficiency owing to the hydrophilic surface smaller mwco and abundant adsorption sites the membrane separation performance in terms of edcs e g bpa was compared with the state of the art membranes as shown in table 1 the tfn cof membrane has an outstanding bpa removal efficiency without compromising the water permeance given the exceptional removal performance for both edcs and na2so4 the high water permeance and the excellent renewability the tfn cof0 05 membrane has commercial potential in wastewater reclamation as it overcomes the drawbacks of existing adsorbents in wastewater treatment as discussed in the introduction part 4 conclusion in this work nanostructured cofs were pre deposited onto the pes substrate before the ip process to optimize transport pathways compared with the nf blank membrane the optimal tfn cof0 05 membrane has higher water permeance and edcs rejection with a water edc selectivity nearly four times as high as the nf blank membrane the enhancement in water permanence can be ascribed to the additional water pathways and reduced transmembrane hydraulic resistance the enhanced edcs rejection is due to the high quality hydrophilic pa barrier layer and abundant functional active binding sites from cofs compared with the commercial nf 270 membrane the tfn cof0 05 membrane had a significantly higher edcs rejection during the long term stability test the novel tfn cof membrane is expected to run for several months to years in the treatment of real wastewater before regeneration is required furthermore the regeneration experiments indicate that the novel membrane can rapidly release edcs by ethanol washing for 2 min considering the high na2so4 rejection the tfn cof membranes have great potential for treating natural wastewater containing edcs declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no
