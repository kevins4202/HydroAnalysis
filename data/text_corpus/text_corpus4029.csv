20145,nearly half of the world s lakes freeze periodically in the past few decades lakes in the northern hemisphere are increasingly recording unusually short or no annual ice season due to climate variability and change this is raising concerns about the potential impact of short annual ice cover season on lake ecosystem structure stability and function here we develop a tentative framework that delineates the connection between winter climate variability shorter lake ice season and related environmental and social impacts with focus on winter thermal thresholds in lake ice this framework organizes existing knowledge on this topic and presents a systems scale view the integrative system s scale view presented in this study seeks to inform a usability of seasonal climatic

atmosphere to the lake fig 1 consequently lake organisms and biogeochemical processes that can operate under relatively cold dark calm and oxygen limited lake environment often dominate during the ice cover season 5 6 in recent decades however lakes in northern hemisphere are recording unusually short annual ice seasons including no ice season and no complete ice cover 7 9 recent studies point to both inter annual climate variability for example due to el niño related weather 8 10 and long term climate warming trends 11 13 7 as causative factors the shortening of the annual ice season can have cascading cross seasonal effects on the lake characteristics including its water quality for instance in the summer of 2012 the surface of lake auburn a southern maine usa lake with no history of water quality issues turned green stemming from severe algal blooms 14 in subsequent weeks severe anoxic conditions developed at the lake bottom and killed the lake s entire cold water trout population williams 14 suggests that the 2012 event at lake auburn were triggered by the early end to the ice cover season and high summer water temperatures caused by the unusually mild winter and high sediment flux into the lake due to heavy springtime rains weather and climate induced contrasts in lake physical conditions and trophic status during spring and summer seasons are also evident in european lakes wherein milder winters with shorter ice periods or ice free conditions appear to lead to larger algal biomass thus contributing to water quality declines e g 15 16 large interannual swings towards warmer temperatures and continued warming trends portend higher incidence of unusually short ice cover season and underscore the need to attend to the following knowledge gaps a nature and predictability of unusually short ice season b implication of short ice season on lake structure and function due to theoretical and practical limitations the nature and predictability of shorter lake ice season date arising from its links to winter weather climate conditions is poorly understood 17 18 very few lakes have their winter ice in dates recorded and thus the effect of winter weather variability in determining the lake ice formation and its timing has not been well studied since lake ice melts in spring most studies also focus on the relationship between spring weather conditions and lake ice out dates e g 19 12 13 nevertheless winter is the main season that provides the freeze energy to form and thicken the ice that can be melted in spring 17 the rise in the frequency of no complete ice cover ncic and ice free winters in the northern hemisphere implies that mild winter conditions and related decrease in the winter freeze energy not only can cause the shortening of the ice cover season but also engender dramatic changes in the lake ice regime finally winter climate variability in the extratropics is linked to large scale oceanic atmospheric circulation patterns such as enso whose signals in the tropical pacific can be detected six to nine months ahead 20 21 given that this can offer prospects for seasonal or longer predictability of the annual lake ice season at a regional scale there is a need to rethink the importance of winter weather climate variability on the lake ice phenology in the published literature the range of impacts of shorter or no ice cover season on the lake ecosystem structure stability and function has also received limited attention 5 22 this stems from the long held misconception that the presence of an ice cover brings all biotic and abiotic activities in lakes to a standstill 5 however the under ice lake environment maintains substantial biological activity 6 moreover there are case studies e g 23 that have examined the impact of shifts in lake ice phenology on the physical chemical and biological constituent s of lakes finally short or no lake ice cover seasons have socio economic implications 2 24 25 this study focuses on the nature and predictability of unusually short ice season and related human and environmental systems in what follows we use a findings from recent studies and b a case study lake auburn to elaborate on the relationship between winter air temperature and lake ice season in the northern regions including demonstrating the presence of winter air temperature thresholds whose exceedance non exceedance produces early late ice out dates we also discuss the relationship between winter climate conditions and synoptic oceanic atmospheric circulation pattern such as enso can be used to predict the lake ice season at local and regional scales following this a review of lake ecosystem response to shorter no ice cover period in freezing lakes is presented this includes developing a tentative social ecological framework that maps the multiple pathways and feedback by which perturbations stemming from short ice cover period may cascade across the lake watershed system 2 relationship between winter weather climate variability and lake ice out dates in the extratropics variability of ice out dates for the past few decades the lake ice season in the northern extratropics is recording unusually early ice out dates including no complete ice cover and ice free winter 26 7 9 moreover the pervasiveness of unusually early ice out dates is attributed to the combined effect of secular trends and interannual annual to interdecadal scale variability in ice out dates 7 27 10 from the late nineteenth century magnuson et al 11 and other studies 12 13 7 9 have detected significant trends towards earlier ice out dates for lakes in the northern hemisphere with the exception of the very northern lakes however the trends in the ice phenology of most lakes are also marked by significant decadal and inter annual variability which enhance or reverse the trend in the lake ice out dates 28 27 7 8 29 10 for instance the ice out dates at lake auburn maine usa from 1870 2010 displays a significant p 0 05 long term trend towards earlier ice out date wherein the mean ice out date shifts from april 27 th for the 1870 1900 period to april 17 th for the 1980 2008 period see fig 2 however during the 1870 1900 period there were still three years when the ice out date was earlier than april 17 th while there were five years when the ice out date was later than april 27 th during the 1980 2010 period in the extratropics the chain of events that modulate the inter annual variability of lake ice phenology often involve synoptic oceanic atmospheric circulation teleconnections patterns regional weather regimes and local meteorological conditions that accelerate or impede lake ice growth or melt 28 30 27 29 18 winter air temperatures and ice out dates for lakes ice cover formation growth and decay are outcomes of the thermal energy transfer between lake and overlying atmosphere integrated over time and space for large lakes 31 the heat energy exchange between lake and atmosphere is primarily determined by prevailing meteorological conditions particularly air temperature as they indicate the energy surplus or deficit in the atmosphere 32 31 in general ice forms and grows on the lake surface under sub freezing daily air temperatures and in the northern extra tropics winter months are often characterized by daily air temperatures below 0 c 18 ice melts follows a period of above freezing daily air temperatures predominantly during the spring months in the northern extratropics consequently both winter and spring seasons temperature play a critical role in determining the length and phenology of the ice season in order to illustrate the effect of daily winter air temperatures on the evolution of ice for lakes in the northern extratropics we model the lake ice evolution at lake auburn for the 2005 6 and 2006 07 ice season using a 1 d freshwater lake thermodynamic model flake 33 at lake auburn the ice in dates for the 2005 06 and 2006 07 ice cover season were december 18 th and 10 th respectively figs 3 a b after the ice in date the ice cover begins to thicken rapidly during the two ice cover seasons significant thickening of lake ice occurred during the winter december to february period figs 3a b moreover the rate of ice growth corresponded to the daily freezing degree days the extent in degrees to which daily air temperatures fell below freezing figs 3e f at the end of february the ice cover thickness in 2007 was twice as much to that of 2006 fig 3a b this was because the total sum of the daily winter freezing degree days accumulated freezing degree days afdd in 2006 07 was about 1 5 times higher than that of 2005 06 fig 3c d at the beginning of march however the ice cover stops growing and even starts to thin melt given that the daily average temperature start rise above the freezing point figs 3a b in both seasons the rate at which the ice melted in spring march june mirrored the daily melting degree days the extent in degrees to which daily air temperatures rises above freezing figs 3e f the ice out date in 2006 07 was about 18 days later than in 2005 06 ice cover season figs 3a b the timing of the spring lake ice out dates depends on the thickness of winter ice and the heat energy during the melt spring period 34 32 generally thinner winter ice and or warmer spring air temperatures are associated with earlier spring ice out dates and thicker ice and or cooler spring air temperatures are related to later spring ice out dates given that winter is the main period that provides the bulk of the freeze energy to form and grow ice seasonal winter air temperatures can modulate the variability of spring ice out date by controlling the ice thickness 34 28 consequently for many lakes in the extratropics seasonal winter air temperatures and derived degree day variables are significantly correlated to the spring lake ice out dates 28 17 franssen and scherrer 35 showed for multiple lakes in switzerland that there are winter afdd thresholds whose exceedance non exceedance determines whether seasonal ice even forms on lakes beyene and jain 10 18 have also shown for multiple lakes in northern north america that the response of spring ice out dates to seasonal winter air temperatures can be nonlinear and that there are seasonal winter degree day indices whose exceedance or non exceedance produces dramatic changes in the spring lake ice out dates fig 4 depicts the joint winter afdds and amdds that correspond to the earliest and latest 15 ice out dates at lake auburn from 1950 to 2010 synoptic teleconnection patterns and ice out dates for many lakes in the northern extratropics the spring ice out date shows coherence with synoptic teleconnection patterns large scale teleconnection patterns refer to semi periodic and persistent atmospheric and oceanic anomalies that extends over a large geographical area 36 in northern europe united kingdom and russia studies have found the timing of the spring ice out date has a strong relationship with the phases of the northern atlantic oscillation nao pattern 37 38 29 for lakes in northern usa and canada variability of spring ice out dates has been related to one or more of the following synoptic teleconnection patterns nao 30 8 29 10 enso 30 8 27 18 pacific decadal oscillation 30 27 pacific north america 30 and tropical northern hemisphere 10 large scale teleconnection patterns modulate the variability of spring lake ice out date by promoting warm and cold and or wet and dry spells that delay or accelerate lake ice formation or melt 30 27 29 10 18 moreover in regions where multiple teleconnection patterns exist the effect of one pattern on spring ice out dates might be moderated by the effect of another pattern for example bai et al 8 found that the effect of enso on great lakes ice extent can be moderated or enhanced by nao livingstone 28 found that relationship between nao pattern and spring ice out dates at lake mendota have weakened since the first half of the twentieth century enso is the largest source of global winter climate variability and phase shifts in enso arise due to its sensitivity to particular tropical pacific sea surface temperature anomalies 21 the slow evolution and persistence of enso events affords seasonal predictability 21 20 studies show enso related wintertime climate forecast skill in the northern extratropics modulates atmospheric circulation patterns 39 consequently few north american studies have characterized the relationship between spring ice out dates seasonal winter air temperatures and enso patterns to predict lake ice season 40 8 10 18 for example bai et al 8 showed that for great lakes mild winters and reduced ice cover extent occur during el niño warm phase of enso and positive nao phases beyene and jain 10 found that for eight selected lakes in maine el niño events increases the likelihood of mild winters that are associated with early spring ice out dates by 50 80 relative to the climatology 1950 2010 beyene and jain 18 showed that for seven out of the eight selected lakes in different north american regions the occurrence probability of mild winters that produce early spring ice out dates increases by 1 5 2 8 times to that of the climatology during strong eastern el niño patterns 1951 2010 3 delineation of lake watershed processes within the context of lake ice we reviewed over 40 peer reviewed case studies that examined the response of one or more lake watershed parameter s to the early end of the ice cover period tables 1 and s1 in what follows we summarize the potential impact of shorter no ice cover season on the physical chemical biological and social attributes of lakes in the northern extratropics fig 5 shows the response and feedback of key lake ecological and social processes seasonal thermal structure and mixing regime when the surface of lakes is covered in ice only a small fraction of the atmospheric heat input reaches the lake water column this is because ice reflects back 30 90 of the solar insolation 31 early ice out increases atmospheric heat input into lakes for lakes in the northern cold regions this can lead to warmer spring and summer lake water temperatures e g 41 43 earlier onset of spring turnover and summer stratification period e g 44 46 and upsurge in spring summer sensible and latent heat flux 47 for some lakes the absence of lake ice during winter triggers dramatic changes in the lake s mixing regime such as a shift from cold monomictic to dimictic or from dimictic to warm monomictic e g 48 49 however the persistence and degree to which shorter or no ice duration affects the thermal structure of northern cold region lakes depends on lake specific factors such as water clarity morphometry and water residence time which determine the distribution of extra added heat in lake volume 41 nutrient cycling during long ice cover periods benthic respiration and decomposition of organic matter near sediment 50 51 causes depletion of oxygen oxygen depletion is pronounced in lakes with low hypolimnion water volume and high organic matter oxygen depletion creates an anoxic reducing environment at lake water sediment interface which promotes the release of reactive manganese iron and phosphorous 52 54 conversely a shorter or no ice cover season may decrease the likelihood of anoxic conditions from developing at lake sediments during the winter season however the early end to the lake ice season in lakes often leads to the early onset of spring summer lake stratification period with limited mixing between epilimnion upper and hypolimnion waters 43 46 in shallow lakes or ones with a strong thermocline at a lower depth the lengthening of the stratification season enhances the development of anoxic conditions at the sediment water interface which in turn favors the release of reactive nutrients from sediments to the overlying water column 55 aquatic species and trophic interaction during complete ice cover period in lakes the surface snow ice cover acts as a lid creating dark less turbid and cold under ice lake environment 5 these conditions generally favor heterotrophic processes and lower plankton biomass as the low light setting restricts autotrophic plankton productivity and the non turbulent conditions promote sinking of non motile algae 6 thus early ice out period may lead to increases in the spring and summer algal biomass 23 37 45 change in the seasonal composition and succession of plankton species 56 57 53 for various cold region lakes significant mismatches in the response of predator and prey plankton species caused by shorter ice cover season can also engender the re organization of the lake food web 58 however the extent to which shorter or no ice duration alters the plankton abundance community and trophic relationships in lakes depend on factors such as snow ice conditions nutrient availability and spring summer climate 59 the cold dark and oxygen limited lake environment during ice cover season also provides an optimum environment for native cold water fish species 60 therefore the early end to the lake ice season commingling with warmer lake water temperatures diminish the survival advantage of these native fish species and promote the spread of invasive warm water fish species 61 62 it also reduces the likelihood of winter fish kills as there is less potential for anoxic conditions to develop at the lake bottom during short or no ice cover period 55 on the other hand early ice out dates may correspond to the lengthening of summer stratification period in lakes and in shallow lakes or lakes with strong thermocline at lower depth this promotes the occurrence of anoxic conditions and fish kills in the hypolimnion waters during summer fall season 14 economic and cultural values over half of a billion people live in northern cold regions where lakes freeze periodically 9 for humans lake ice has always inspired appreciation of nature s power value and beauty as evidenced by the long term ice phenology records kept for hundreds of years 11 consequently lake ice has been related to the sense of identity and emotional social and spiritual wellbeing 2 for example for over five centuries shinto priests used lake suwa ice phenology to start their purification processions and predict the rice harvest 2 in canada usa and europe frozen lakes are long been used as venues for various festivals and tournaments such as ice fishing derbies and skating competitions 31 49 the shortening of annual lake ice season may jeopardize spiritual practices and cultural traditions for example the purification processions at lake suwa were performed only 69 times in the past 100 years because the lake surface did not freeze in winter 2 shorter or no lake ice cover season can have local and regional economic implications for land locked locations it can contribute to increased economic hardship and scarcity of provisions as lake ice offers an inexpensive winter roadway to rural and distant communities and industrial development and mining sites 49 63 in manitoba canada mild winter conditions in 2010 prompted the closure of a 2200 km winter road located on frozen ground rivers and lakes and hindered the transport of food gas and construction materials to more than 30 000 first nations people thus resulting in an emergency declaration 24 shorter or no annual lake ice season may cause the cancellation of wintertime recreational events and loss of revenues from the popular outdoor winter recreational activities ice fishing skating and snowmobiling 49 2 64 in addition for many northern indigenous communities shorter ice season and thinner ice in northern lakes may disrupt the timing occurrence and harvests of various subsistence activities e g hunting gathering fishing as ice covered lakes provides access to traditional hunting fishing and trapping grounds 65 25 66 finally we noted earlier that shorter or no ice season might lead to increased algal biomass and loss of cold water fishes in cold region lakes these conditions may put off recreational activities during the open water season increase water treatment costs and reduce lake shore property prices 49 however it is important to note that the economic implications of shorter ice cover season are not all negative and are site specific for instance kling et al 67 reported that for the great lakes smaller ice cover extents and longer ice free period lead to longer shipping periods and lowering of ice breaking costs local climate during the open water period lakes moderate local climate conditions by giving up their thermal energy via sensible and latent heat flux in late fall and winter to warm local atmospheric conditions and absorbing via sensible heat flux the heat energy in the atmosphere in late spring and summer to cool atmospheric conditions the presence of complete ice cover severely limits the thermal and moisture exchange between the relatively warm lake waters under ice and overlying frigid air 5 31 gerbush et al 68 found that for lake erie the latent heat flux for an ice cover with 90 ice concentration was approximately 13 of that of the open water period during late fall and winter later ice in date or lower ice cover extent in medium to large lakes can dramatically raise the moisture and heat sensible and latent lost to the atmosphere such conditions promote the development of severe downwind fog and precipitation e g lake snow effect 69 70 for instance due to lesser than average ice cover extent over lake ontario during the winter of 2007 the town of redfield new york usa received about 141 inches of lake effect snowfall over seven days in spring and early summer early ice out increases solar insolation and the heat energy stored in lakes this enhances the seasonal and annual moisture and latent heat fluxes from lakes for medium to large lakes it may also prolong the period lake and atmosphere flux exchanges and delay the winter ice in date 4 concluding remarks over the past century the length of the ice season and its phenology of northern extratropical lakes has undergone significant changes towards shorter or no ice season current and projected warming of air temperatures and interannual and decadal climate variability are likely to exacerbate this trend the consequences of changes in lakes with seasonal ice cover are far reaching and range from water supplies ecosystem structure and health cultural uses to local and regional tourism and economy this review presents a general framework by which the nature and predictability of short no ice cover seasons and its impacts on linked socio ecological systems may be examined and understood at local and regional scales to improve on this framework we recommend future works in the following research areas winter limnology advancing our understanding of lake ice processes requires improvement to the current monitoring and investigative approaches and topics novel lake sampling instruments and procedures that work when lakes are covered in ice are needed in situ data collection must also be supplemented by adopting remote sensing monitoring approaches 49 in addition to achieve improved prediction of lake ice effects on the lake ecosystem structure and functions lake ice models should be coupled with hydrological limnological climatic and social systems models within winter limnology studies the influence of lake ice on the human population is the least studied subject while many studied have casually noted the importance of lake ice on the lifestyle of local indigenous population the authors are aware of only one study 2 where the spiritual cultural economic and emotional implication of lake ice on the social system are extensively studied however there are many indigenous communities particularly in the high latitudes whose economy nutritional diet lifestyle and transport network might be massively disrupted by shortening of the lake ice season more social implication studies therefore will be needed if adaptation and mitigation options are to be developed and effective strategies are to be adopted lake ice season prediction forecast to date enso is the only phenomenon with skillful seasonal climate forecast 20 studies also show that enso exhibits a strong influence on the atmospheric circulation patterns 39 thus affording foreknowledge of lake ice phenomena experimental studies to characterize the role of winter meteorological variable s on the lake ice season would aid management efforts future climate research focused on enso winter climate teleconnections are therefore needed where approaches and frameworks that assess enso induced climate shifts will render lake social ecological systems vulnerable declaration of competing interest the

patterns large scale teleconnection patterns refer to semi periodic and persistent atmospheric and oceanic anomalies that extends over a large geographical area 36 in northern europe united kingdom and russia studies have found the timing of the spring ice out date has a strong relationship with the phases of the northern atlantic oscillation nao pattern 37 38 29 for lakes in northern usa and canada variability of spring ice out dates has been related to one or more of the following synoptic teleconnection patterns nao 30 8 29 10 enso 30 8 27 18 pacific decadal oscillation 30 27 pacific north america 30 and tropical northern hemisphere 10 large scale teleconnection patterns modulate the variability of spring lake ice out date by promoting warm and cold and or wet and dry spells that delay or accelerate lake ice formation or melt 30 27 29 10 18 moreover in regions where multiple teleconnection patterns exist the effect of one pattern on spring ice out dates might be moderated by the effect of another pattern for example bai et al 8 found that the effect of enso on great lakes ice extent can be moderated or enhanced by nao livingstone 28 found that relationship between nao pattern and spring ice out dates at lake mendota have weakened since the first half of the twentieth century enso is the largest source of global winter climate variability and phase shifts in enso arise due to its sensitivity to particular tropical pacific sea surface temperature anomalies 21 the slow evolution and persistence of enso events affords seasonal predictability 21 20 studies show enso related wintertime climate forecast skill in the northern extratropics modulates atmospheric circulation patterns 39 consequently few north american studies have characterized the relationship between spring ice out dates seasonal winter air temperatures and enso patterns to predict lake ice season 40 8 10 18 for example bai et al 8 showed that for great lakes mild winters and reduced ice cover extent occur during el niño warm phase of enso and positive nao phases beyene and jain 10 found that for eight selected lakes in maine el niño events increases the likelihood of mild winters that are associated with early spring ice out dates by 50 80 relative to the climatology 1950 2010 beyene and jain 18 showed that for seven out of the eight selected lakes in different north american regions the occurrence probability of mild winters that produce early spring ice out dates increases by 1 5 2 8 times to that of the climatology during strong eastern el niño patterns 1951 2010 3 delineation of lake watershed processes within the context of lake ice we reviewed over 40 peer reviewed case studies that examined the response of one or more lake watershed parameter s to the early end of the ice cover period tables 1 and s1 in what follows we summarize the potential impact of shorter no ice cover season on the physical chemical biological and social attributes of lakes in the northern extratropics fig 5 shows the response and feedback of key lake ecological and social processes seasonal thermal structure and mixing regime when the surface of lakes is covered in ice only a small fraction of the atmospheric heat input reaches the lake water column this is because ice reflects back 30 90 of the solar insolation 31 early ice out increases atmospheric heat input into lakes for lakes in the northern cold regions this can lead to warmer spring and summer lake water temperatures e g 41 43 earlier onset of spring turnover and summer stratification period e g 44 46 and upsurge in spring summer sensible and latent heat flux 47 for some lakes the absence of lake ice during winter triggers dramatic changes in the lake s mixing regime such as a shift from cold monomictic to dimictic or from dimictic to warm monomictic e g 48 49 however the persistence and degree to which shorter or no ice duration affects the thermal structure of northern cold region lakes depends on lake specific factors such as water clarity morphometry and water residence time which determine the distribution of extra added heat in lake volume 41 nutrient cycling during long ice cover periods benthic respiration and decomposition of organic matter near sediment 50 51 causes depletion of oxygen oxygen depletion is pronounced in lakes with low hypolimnion water volume and high organic matter oxygen depletion creates an anoxic reducing environment at lake water sediment interface which promotes the release of reactive manganese iron and phosphorous 52 54 conversely a shorter or no ice cover season may decrease the likelihood of anoxic conditions from developing at lake sediments during the winter season however the early end to the lake ice season in lakes often leads to the early onset of spring summer lake stratification period with limited mixing between epilimnion upper and hypolimnion waters 43 46 in shallow lakes or ones with a strong thermocline at a lower depth the lengthening of the stratification season enhances the development of anoxic conditions at the sediment water interface which in turn favors the release of reactive nutrients from sediments to the overlying water column 55 aquatic species and trophic interaction during complete ice cover period in lakes the surface snow ice cover acts as a lid creating dark less turbid and cold under ice lake environment 5 these conditions generally favor heterotrophic processes and lower plankton biomass as the low light setting restricts autotrophic plankton productivity and the non turbulent conditions promote sinking of non motile algae 6 thus early ice out period may lead to increases in the spring and summer algal biomass 23 37 45 change in the seasonal composition and succession of plankton species 56 57 53 for various cold region lakes significant mismatches in the response of predator and prey plankton species caused by shorter ice cover season can also engender the re organization of the lake food web 58 however the extent to which shorter or no ice duration alters the plankton abundance community and trophic relationships in lakes depend on factors such as snow ice conditions nutrient availability and spring summer climate 59 the cold dark and oxygen limited lake environment during ice cover season also provides an optimum environment for native cold water fish species 60 therefore the early end to the lake ice season commingling with warmer lake water temperatures diminish the survival advantage of these native fish species and promote the spread of invasive warm water fish species 61 62 it also reduces the likelihood of winter fish kills as there is less potential for anoxic conditions to develop at the lake bottom during short or no ice cover period 55 on the other hand early ice out dates may correspond to the lengthening of summer stratification period in lakes and in shallow lakes or lakes with strong thermocline at lower depth this promotes the occurrence of anoxic conditions and fish kills in the hypolimnion waters during summer fall season 14 economic and cultural values over half of a billion people live in northern cold regions where lakes freeze periodically 9 for humans lake ice has always inspired appreciation of nature s power value and beauty as evidenced by the long term ice phenology records kept for hundreds of years 11 consequently lake ice has been related to the sense of identity and emotional social and spiritual wellbeing 2 for example for over five centuries shinto priests used lake suwa ice phenology to start their purification processions and predict the rice harvest 2 in canada usa and europe frozen lakes are long been used as venues for various festivals and tournaments such as ice fishing derbies and skating competitions 31 49 the shortening of annual lake ice season may jeopardize spiritual practices and cultural traditions for example the purification processions at lake suwa were performed only 69 times in the past 100 years because the lake surface did not freeze in winter 2 shorter or no lake ice cover season can have local and regional economic implications for land locked locations it can contribute to increased economic hardship and scarcity of provisions as lake ice offers an inexpensive winter roadway to rural and distant communities and industrial development and mining sites 49 63 in manitoba canada mild winter conditions in 2010 prompted the closure of a 2200 km winter road located on frozen ground rivers and lakes and hindered the transport of food gas and construction materials to more than 30 000 first nations people thus resulting in an emergency declaration 24 shorter or no annual lake ice season may cause the cancellation of wintertime recreational events and loss of revenues from the popular outdoor winter recreational activities ice fishing skating and snowmobiling 49 2 64 in addition for many northern indigenous communities shorter ice season and thinner ice in northern lakes may disrupt the timing occurrence and harvests of various subsistence activities e g hunting gathering fishing as ice covered lakes provides access to traditional hunting fishing and trapping grounds 65 25 66 finally we noted earlier that shorter or no ice season might lead to increased algal biomass and loss of cold water fishes in cold region lakes these conditions may put off recreational activities during the open water season increase water treatment costs and reduce lake shore property prices 49 however it is important to note that the economic implications of shorter ice cover season are not all negative and are site specific for instance kling et al 67 reported that for the great lakes smaller ice cover extents and longer ice free period lead to longer shipping periods and lowering of ice breaking costs local climate during the open water period lakes moderate local climate conditions by giving up their thermal energy via sensible and latent heat flux in late fall and winter to warm local atmospheric conditions and absorbing via sensible heat flux the heat energy in the atmosphere in late spring and summer to cool atmospheric conditions the presence of complete ice cover severely limits the thermal and moisture exchange between the relatively warm lake waters under ice and overlying frigid air 5 31 gerbush et al 68 found that for lake erie the latent heat flux for an ice cover with 90 ice concentration was approximately 13 of that of the open water period during late fall and winter later ice in date or lower ice cover extent in medium to large lakes can dramatically raise the moisture and heat sensible and latent lost to the atmosphere such conditions promote the development of severe downwind fog and precipitation e g lake snow effect 69 70 for instance due to lesser than average ice cover extent over lake ontario during the winter of 2007 the town of redfield new york usa received about 141 inches of lake effect snowfall over seven days in spring and early summer early ice out increases solar insolation and the heat energy stored in lakes this enhances the seasonal and annual moisture and latent heat fluxes from lakes for medium to large lakes it may also prolong the period lake and atmosphere flux exchanges and delay the winter ice in date 4 concluding remarks over the past century the length of the ice season and its phenology of northern extratropical lakes has undergone significant changes towards shorter or no ice season current and projected warming of air temperatures and interannual and decadal climate variability are likely to exacerbate this trend the consequences of changes in lakes with seasonal ice cover are far reaching and range from water supplies ecosystem structure and health cultural uses to local and regional tourism and economy this review presents a general framework by which the nature and predictability of short no ice cover seasons and its impacts on linked socio ecological systems may be examined and understood at local and regional scales to improve on this framework we recommend future works in the following research areas winter limnology advancing our understanding of lake ice processes requires improvement to the current monitoring and investigative approaches and topics novel lake sampling instruments and procedures that work when lakes are covered in ice are needed in situ data collection must also be supplemented by adopting remote sensing monitoring approaches 49 in addition to achieve improved prediction of lake ice effects on the lake ecosystem structure and functions lake ice models should be coupled with hydrological limnological climatic and social systems models within winter limnology studies the influence of lake ice on the human population is the least studied subject while many studied have casually noted the importance of lake ice on the lifestyle of local indigenous population the authors are aware of only one study 2 where the spiritual cultural economic and emotional implication of lake ice on the social system are extensively studied however there are many indigenous communities particularly in the high latitudes whose economy nutritional diet lifestyle and transport network might be massively disrupted by shortening of the lake ice season more social implication studies therefore will be needed if adaptation and mitigation options are to be developed and effective strategies are to be adopted lake ice season prediction forecast to date enso is the only phenomenon with skillful seasonal climate forecast 20 studies also show that enso exhibits a strong influence on the atmospheric circulation patterns 39 thus affording foreknowledge of lake ice phenomena experimental studies to characterize the role of winter meteorological variable s on the lake ice season would aid management efforts future climate research focused on enso winter climate teleconnections are therefore needed where approaches and frameworks that assess enso induced climate shifts will render lake social ecological systems vulnerable declaration of competing interest the

20146,the relationship between human health and water quantity is less understood than that of water quality based on earlier studies the who has established a threshold of 13 2 gallons per person per day gal c d 50 l per person per day or l c d of water as sufficient for health 26 in remote and low income communities where piped water and sanitation systems do not exist residents may seek water from multiple sources and use water for different purposes at multiple locations in this paper we aim to assess the quantity of water needed for different hygiene and physiologic needs and whether that water is required in the home and could be provided through a decentralized water and sanitation system or if it could be used at an alternate location using known appliance water flow rates and established or reasonable duration and frequency of use we determine that the overall water need for a household of 5 5 persons assuming low frequency use across categories e g cooking handwashing laundry etc is 79 0 gallons household 299 l household which equates to a total use of 14 4 gal c d 54 5 l c d assuming a functional centralized shower and laundry facility 20 2 gallons 76 5 l are needed in the home per day equivalent to 3 7 gal c d 14 l c d we conclude that when combined with access to centralized laundry and shower facilities decentralized in home water and sanitation systems can facilitate sufficient water use to protect health keywords household water security water access alaska native decentralized water and sanitation climate change water sanitation and hygiene 1 introduction although the relationship between clean water and health is well established the relationship between human health and water quantity is still being explored 30 43 44 evaluations of water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions often rely on estimates of water quantity used as a proxy for water access and water related health due to observations of improved health outcomes when greater volumes of water are available on premise 9 26 41 44 researchers often compare these estimates to the world health organization who intermediate service level access measure of 50 l per capita per day l c d 13 2 gallons per capita per day gal c d 26 imbedded in this metric is the assumption that households rely on access to a single centralized improved drinking water source for all water usage 19 most studies estimate the average use of a single water source within the home without considering use by purpose nor that different water sources may be considered appropriate for different uses 34 35 44 however household reliance on access to a single water source may threaten household water security hhws due to socio ecologic factors such as affordability reliability of service effects of climate change as well as trust in the safety and quality of that source 19 40 further as howard and bartram note 2003 16 not all water used to protect health must occur within the home and that practices such as laundry or bathing can be conducted off plot the purpose of this paper is to explore evidence based scenarios that combine access to centralized off premise and decentralized on premise improved water sources to achieve the who s intermediate service level in homes without indoor plumbing throughout we use the who definition of improved water source one that is constructed to protect the source from outside contamination 48 we review global health recommendations for per capita water use by health related purpose in order to explore the potential of a built environmental context of on and off premise water access to promote hhws we then conduct a table top exercise to explore how much water should be used within the home to protect health and how much water use can be centralized off premise we refer to this combination of access to improved water sources as a community approach to increase hhws recognizing that water security is a dynamic and complex condition beyond access 12 14 29 40 1 1 quantity as a measure of household water security in 2003 who established the standard of 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d as the minimum volume of water a person needs to assure consumption drinking and cooking promote hygiene and result in low health concern 26 practitioners policymakers advocates and scholars worldwide have adopted this minimum as the primary metric for measuring hhws 44 although quantity is a useful metric howard and bartram 26 emphasized that water use patterns drive health outcomes and that not all water must be used within the home to protect health the evidence further suggests that it is the effective use of both water and cleansing agents and the timing of hygiene practices that are more important than volumes of water used furthermore as some hygiene behaviour protective of health for example laundry and bathing may be carried out off plot the quantity of water required to sustain good hygiene may vary significantly with water collection behavior howard and bartram 2003 16 authors of a more recent review of water quantity literature 43 conclude that although water used per capita per day is a useful indicator of hhws it does not necessarily reflect the relationship between water and health outcomes based on a review of epidemiologic evidence they argue that although higher quantities of water promote health how those quantities of water are used is the primary driver of improved health outcomes see also 26 1 2 household water insecurity in remote alaska native communities alaska ranks last in proportion of homes with in home piped water access in the united states while most homes statewide are served with piped water in rural alaska approximately 15 of occupied housing units lack in home water and sanitation services i e are unplumbed rural alaskan communities are primarily alaska native which is a complex term referring to 11 distinct cultures categorized into 5 major groups speaking 20 different language dialects 3 there are over 30 unserved remote alaska native communities primarily in the yup ik cup ik and athabascan regions of western and interior alaska 25 50 in addition there are an unquantified number of households scattered throughout the state who either have lost connection to their community s centralized piped water system or are periodically disconnected due to nonpayment or system failures 14 many of alaska s unserved communities are deemed ineligible for in home service by state and federal funding agencies due to factors such as affordability economic sustainability and vulnerability to climate change 16 18 25 these remaining unserved communities are extremely remote with no connections to road systems and expensive construction operations and maintenance costs factors such as a small customer base permafrost extreme cold costly transportation and inadequate costly energy supplies contribute to the high expenditures associated with water and sewer services 6 21 in some alaska native communities ancs pipes must be insulated above ground due to permafrost leading to high energy costs and frequent freeze ups though all communities in rural alaska are supposed to have a water treatment facility that treats raw water to epa clean water act standards 47 there is limited funding available to maintain the facilities and households must have the resources to pay for services despite an increase in funding in recent years the estimated gap between funds available for construction of water and sewer infrastructure and ancs needs is over 1 3 billion 28 adding to this multifaceted problem are climate changes that are damaging existing infrastructure and forcing the relocation of some communities thirty one ancs are considered imminently threatened by climate change and therefore cannot qualify for government funding to improve their existing infrastructure that is increasingly threatened by melting permafrost erosion salt water intrusion and storm surges 25 49 climate change is also contributing to fluctuations in water access due to storms floods and other service interruptions that cause prolonged water insecurity even in households that are connected to centralized piped water and sewer systems 7 14 15 in communities with an operational centralized facility water is then either piped to homes transported via small haul 100 gallon 378 5 l tankers or collected from the facility by individual residents eleven communities use a small haul system and over 30 villages use self haul systems where residents haul water to their homes themselves typically in containers ranging from 5 to 33 gallons 18 9 l 124 9 l the task of hauling water is usually done by older boys and able bodied men though all household members may haul water unplumbed households rely on a plastic basin of water for handwashing often reusing dirty water multiple times see fig 1 in many unserved communities households use buckets as toilets known as honey buckets and must haul raw sewage to the dump exposing themselves to fecal borne pathogens 11 most self haul communities have a central facility washeteria in the community for showers and laundry however washeterias are not always available when residents need them some shower and laundry services are unaffordable and many of the facilities need critical repairs several case studies in remote ancs have described the limited quantity of water used in unplumbed households around 1 5 2 5 gal c d 5 7 9 5 l c d less than the 4 0 gal c d 15 0 l c d recommended by the sphere handbook sphere 42 for a refugee camp 14 16 18 45 46 limited access to water results in water rationing and reuse of dirty washbasin and laundry water 45 various studies have described the health consequences of this extreme household water insecurity including significantly higher rates of water wash infections such as skin respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in self haul communities or regions with a high proportion of self haul communities 24 39 46 51 1 3 addressing household water insecurity through modular technology an alaskan experiment in 2013 the state of alaska created the alaska water and sewer challenge as a response to this context of prolonged water insecurity and underfunding amid the growing detrimental effects of climate change on community infrastructure the state sought proposals from engineering teams for small durable simple modular system designs that could withstand arctic conditions comply with the alaska plumbing code and other regulations and meet additional criteria summarized in table 1 2 however the requirements of delivering 15 gal c d 56 7 l c d through modular water treatment and sanitation units while keeping construction operations costs and complexity low proved challenging engineers struggled to design systems that could meet the accessibility criteria while also being small simple to operate and affordable the alaska native tribal health consortium division of environmental health and engineering 1 1 at any given time the anthc dehe is working to construct water supply infrastructure in about 40 alaska native communities took a different approach and developed a portable water treatment and sanitation system known as the portable alternative sanitation system pass engineers sought to reduce the incidence of skin respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in unplumbed homes by facilitating effective in home use of water and by targeting three drivers of exposure treated drinking water handwashing and human waste the pass unit consists of a modular point of entry water treatment and sanitation system that provides running treated water 100 gallons of water storage capacity a separating dry toilet and a urinal gray water and urine are diverted to an underground seepage pit although the pass provides the in home infrastructure necessary to promote the use of water it does not pipe water into the homes specifications of the pass and its advantages over an unplumbed home are included in table 2 preliminary pre post intervention data indicated that households with pass units only increased their average in home water use by 0 41 gal c d 1 6 l c d from 2 60 gal c d 9 8 l c d to 3 01 gal c d 11 4 l c d 50 however household members who were surveyed also reported overall improved health the incongruence of these data highlighted a gap in thinking behind the pass as a wash intervention and its evaluation researchers were relying on in home water use as a proxy for how the pass affected health and did not account for water use at other sources in the absence of a centralized water distribution system the question remains of how households can access a minimum of 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d when residents still must haul water into their homes 2 methods 2 1 unpacking 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d water quantity recommendations by health related purpose in order to explore scenarios that would achieve the who s intermediate service level in unserved homes we first identified quantity recommendations by usage categories drinking food preparation sanitation hygiene and bathing as detailed by gleick 20 and howard and bartram 26 table 3 based on his review of existing literature in 1996 gleick estimated that an individual requires 5 l c d for drinking 1 3 gal c d 10 l c d 2 6 gal c d for cooking and kitchen 20 l c d for sanitation services and 15 l c d for bathing 20 although 50 l c d 5 3 gal c d is a widely accepted standard for total water needed to protect health howard and bartram 26 did not unpack this volume by specific health related purpose instead they provide estimates only for the minimum amounts needed for what they characterize as basic access resulting in high health concern we therefore used gleick s 20 recommendations to build our scenarios although we include howard and bartram s 26 estimates for reference we consulted the cold regions utility monograph crum 41 for regionally relevant quantity by purpose recommendations in contrast to the who crum authors point to 60 l c d throughout the monograph that as the minimum amount of water considered adequate for drinking cooking bathing and laundry 41 5 16 the monograph does not contain individual quantities by purpose likely because the primary objective of their estimates is to inform design plans and not directly tied to health outcomes second we separated out the specific uses subsumed by gleick s broad purpose categories whether those activities occur at individual or household levels and the variables affecting quantities used we summarize these activities and assumptions in table 4 assuming that water used for drinking and food preparation primarily occurs within the home we explored the specific activities categorized as sanitation hygiene and bathing in order to identify where each of these activities could take place in the home or central facility and separated each specific use by location within home or centralized public facility in order to determine a minimum per capita quantity of water that is needed within the home to protect health we assumed a household size of 5 5 persons which we calculated based on data from the anthc dehe this assumption is based on the most recent population sizes and number of occupied homes for two communities piloting pass units communities deemed by funding agencies to be ineligible for centralized in home piped water and sanitation services tend to be smaller and more impoverished we chose to use internal data rather than census data because we believe it to be a more accurate estimate of household size the three premises behind our scenarios are 1 households have pass systems with sink that provides running water and a separating toilet 2 we assume that communities have a functioning and reliable central facility washeteria with public showers and clothes washers the premise being that in the absence of a piped system it is easier to move either the person or the clothes to the facility source of water for both those functions rather than moving the large volume of water needed for these activities to the home 3 we assumed the acceptance and use of a diverting waterless toilet and low flow fixtures as provided by the pass we established a list of the essential individual and household water needs and determined which needs must be met in the home and which needs could be met at the washeteria we determined per person and per household quantity needed for each function assuming use of the pass low flow fixtures and waterless toilet 2 2 evidence based assumptions of water use water is needed for the following individual and household sanitation hygiene and bathing needs handwashing showering bathing dishwashing house cleaning and laundry after reviewing existing literature and public health practice materials we found no guidelines on how many times people must wash hands or dishes take showers or do laundry even in the context of adequate water supply many factors will impact the frequency of each of these uses across individuals households and cultures we therefore made some broad but reasonable assumptions regarding frequency of these activities and created estimates of low average and high frequency of use we categorized each need as either individual or household and whether it had to occur in the home or could occur elsewhere such as centralized laundry and shower facilities 2 2 1 in home needs individual 1 physiologic needs e g drinking based on data reviewed by howard and bartram 26 we estimated a mid level water need of 3 7 l c d 1 gal c d by averaging the recommended volumes for a 70 kilogram kg adult to assure hydration in average conditions 0 8 gal c d 3 0 l c d and when conducting manual labor in high temperatures 1 2 gal c d 4 5 l c d understanding that water needs may vary depending on age gender ambient temperature activity level consumption of liquids purchased e g soda and whether a woman is pregnant or nursing we then calculated a low and high range we based our low estimate on the minimum water needed to assure hydration for a 70 kg adult man 0 8 gal c d 3 0 l c d and the high estimate on the minimum amount required by a breastfeeding woman 1 5 gal c d 5 5 l c d 2 handwashing we estimated individual hand washes per day required to protect health based on standard public health recommendations to wash hands at a minimum before eating and after using the toilet both for urination and defecation although there are no clear medical guidelines internet searches indicated that a well hydrated individual urinates about 6 times a day 5 8 52 assuming that individuals also eat three meals a day we estimated that 8 10 and 12 hand washes per day were reasonable minimum mid and maximum rates for this study we calculated the amount of water per hand wash based on a duration of 30 s using a low flow fixture 0 5 gallon per minute gal min based on pass design specifications 0 25 gal hand wash 2 3 in home needs household 1 food preparation this includes water for food preparation and cooking for mid level estimates we assumed use of water for cooking oatmeal referred to as mush in many communities and boiled meat a typical meal in many alaska native homes twice a day using a 15 1 liter 4 gallons pot one half full of water 2 washing dishes we assume households use 9 5 l 2 5 gallons per wash based on the standard size of a plastic washbasin customary in rural alaska native homes for mid level estimates we assumed that households wash dishes twice per day we also assume that this water is used to clean countertops 3 cleaning house we assume households use a full 5 gallon 18 9 l bucket per cleaning for mid level estimates we assume that households clean their house once per week 2 4 centralized needs individual bathing we calculated water used for bathing based on flow rates 2 5 gal min 9 5 l min and duration 7 min of most public showers in remote alaska native communities we assume a mid level shower frequency of one time per day and that public showers are not equipped with a water saver 2 4 1 centralized needs household 1 laundry for mid level estimates we assumed that an average household 5 5 persons would wash on average 7 5 loads laundry once per week one for each person plus two loads for household things like sheets towels coats etc for laundry done within a home we assume that each load uses 20 gallons 75 7 l based on the typical size of portable washers used on premise in alaska native communities this amount is also an appropriate estimate for those washing laundry off premise as washeterias typically use 17 gal washers per john warren personal communication 2 5 table top exercise we then conducted a simple table top exercise using excel and information gathered from anthc water engineers with extensive experience in cold regions joe hess and john warren personal communication to revise assumptions in our estimates including faucet flow rates and public laundry infrastructure to better reflect actual conditions in remote alaskan communities we then calculated water use estimates gal c d for the average household size of 5 5 persons based on population data from two communities currently using pass using mid level upper and lower estimates of use the assumed purpose and frequency of water uses are summarized in table 4 below 3 results 3 1 combining in home water use with centralized communal sources can achieve 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d based on the assumptions described above we calculated estimates for water use for an average household size of 5 5 persons using the low middle and high estimates table 5 below illustrates the calculations used for low water use for the different household needs the table shows the overall water need for a household of 5 5 assuming low level use for the different categories is 79 0 gallons per household which equates to a total use per person of 14 4 gal c d 54 5 l c d assuming a functional off premise shower and laundry facility 20 2 gallons is needed in the home per day equivalent to 3 7 gal c d 76 5 l c d table 6 shows the estimated total water needs per person and per household of 5 5 individuals based on low middle and high water use and how these needs can be met through the combination of in home and centralized water use in summary in the context of communal laundry and shower facilities we estimated the amount of water needed per individual ranged from a low of 3 7 gallons 14 l to a high of 7 2 gallons 27 3 l with a mid range of 4 9 gal c d 18 5 l c d for an average household size of 5 5 persons water needed in the home ranged from 20 2 to 39 4 gal c d with a mid range of 27 1 gallons per home per day 76 4 149 1 l c d mid range 102 6 l c d 4 conclusions and discussion based on generous assumptions regarding average frequency of use and the availability of a centralized facility for showering and laundry we estimated the amount of in home water needed per individual ranged from a low of 3 7 a middle of 4 9 and a high of 7 2 gal c d for a household of 5 5 persons we estimate the average amount of water needed in the home based on mid range use to be 27 1 gallons per day when combined with water used at communal sources pass households should be able to reach the who minimum of 13 2 gal c d defined as intermediate water access resulting in low health concern 26 this would require filling the 100 gallon pass tank every three days thus we conclude that a community approach to household water security that combines in home access to an improved source and off premise access for non consumptive purposes can improve water related health in unserved communities one strength of our analysis is we did not compromise on water needs for hygiene or drinking or on water quality improving sanitation and maintaining the ability to wash hands frequently in clean flowing water would probably be the biggest contribution of the pass to improve household health and reduce water related disease therefore for any given estimate of use we assumed that almost half of the water should be used for hand washing likewise we used howard and bartram s 26 minimum recommendation of 0 8 gal c d 2 9 l c d for the hydration needs of an adult 70 kg male additionally all of the water that goes through the pass system is treated to drinking water quality our findings are limited based on several assumptions we made on amount and frequency of water usage as well as water use by purpose there is little literature that determines how much water should be used for any specific activity so the assumptions are based on public health recommendations expert consultations observation data and general observations we do not take into consideration individualized needs such as bathing that may need to occur within the home for infants young children

water use we assumed low estimates for all water needs and similarly for medium and high estimates in reality there would be a mix of low medium and high uses across the different water use needs

9 gal c d 18 5 l c d of in home water use a major limitation to using more water within the home is the time distance and physical strength required to collect water 10 15 16 18 23 53 as well as the safety of water collectors therefore we recommend exploring sources that may be closer to households than the centralized facility as an option for households with in home treatment and protected storage these sources could include ice springs surface water or rainwater which are trusted often traditional sources that many indigenous peoples of the circumpolar north prefer to drink 14 31 38 harvesting rainwater in particular reduces the time and costs involved in obtaining water and has been shown to increase hygiene related water use 33 in western alaska average rainfall is around 15 in per year which falls mostly during the summer and fall with 80 collection a 1000 square foot roof could collect an additional 6 000 gallons 22 712 l 32 distributed over the six warmer months this would allow for an additional 6 6 gal c d 25 l c d of water that requires minimal work to bring into the home a two year study involving nine communities in alaska found that over 80 of samples from rainwater catchment met water quality standards 32 the authors estimated that rainwater catchment could increase annual household water use by 17 40 providing point of entry in home treatment and protected storage such as the pass would increase the benefit of rainwater collection by providing potable drinking water another option is to subsidize small haul delivery systems in order to maintain household water costs below 5 of median household income while providing sufficient water small haul delivery is often cost prohibitive in rural alaska since it requires multiple trips to and from a source recent region wide subsidy programs such as the community utility assistance program cuap in northwestern alaska indicate the potential viability of subsidizing water delivery using funds allocated from the northwest arctic borough general fund the cuap program has enabled residents in one small community to access more water by helping to cover operations and labor costs for the washeteria and water delivery staff we recommend that haul systems include a centralized point for water use such as a washeteria since delivery systems alone may not provide sufficient water to rely on in home use 13 further a community wide approach to hhws that includes a functional centralized facility for laundry and showering is essential to meet the who 13 2 gal c d 50 l c d threshold many of these facilities across alaska are in a state of disrepair and costs to households for doing laundry are prohibitive establishing decent facilities for showering and laundry and subsidizing the

20146,the relationship between human health and water quantity is less understood than that of water quality based on earlier studies the who has established a threshold of 13 2 gallons per person per day gal c d 50 l per person per day or l c d of water as sufficient for health 26 in remote and low income communities where piped water and sanitation systems do not exist residents may seek water from multiple sources and use water for different purposes at multiple locations in this paper we aim to assess the quantity of water needed for different hygiene and physiologic needs and whether that water is required in the home and could be provided through a decentralized water and sanitation system or if it could be used at an alternate location using known appliance water flow rates and established or reasonable duration and frequency of use we determine that the overall water need for a household of 5 5 persons assuming low frequency use across categories e g cooking handwashing laundry etc is 79 0 gallons household 299 l household which equates to a total use of 14 4 gal c d 54 5 l c d assuming a functional centralized shower and laundry facility 20 2 gallons 76 5 l are needed in the home per day equivalent to 3 7 gal c d 14 l c d we conclude that when combined with access to centralized laundry and shower facilities decentralized in home water and sanitation systems can facilitate sufficient water use to protect health keywords household water security water access alaska native decentralized water and sanitation climate change water sanitation and hygiene 1 introduction although the relationship between clean water and health is well established the relationship between human health and water quantity is still being explored 30 43 44 evaluations of water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions often rely on estimates of water quantity used as a proxy for water access and water related health due to observations of improved health outcomes when greater volumes of water are available on premise 9 26 41 44 researchers often compare these estimates to the world health organization who intermediate service level access measure of 50 l per capita per day l c d 13 2 gallons per capita per day gal c d 26 imbedded in this metric is the assumption that households rely on access to a single centralized improved drinking water source for all water usage 19 most studies estimate the average use of a single water source within the home without considering use by purpose nor that different water sources may be considered appropriate for different uses 34 35 44 however household reliance on access to a single water source may threaten household water security hhws due to socio ecologic factors such as affordability reliability of service effects of climate change as well as trust in the safety and quality of that source 19 40 further as howard and bartram note 2003 16 not all water used to protect health must occur within the home and that practices such as laundry or bathing can be conducted off plot the purpose of this paper is to explore evidence based scenarios that combine access to centralized off premise and decentralized on premise improved water sources to achieve the who s intermediate service level in homes without indoor plumbing throughout we use the who definition of improved water source one that is constructed to protect the source from outside contamination 48 we review global health recommendations for per capita water use by health related purpose in order to explore the potential of a built environmental context of on and off premise water access to promote hhws we then conduct a table top exercise to explore how much water should be used within the home to protect health and how much water use can be centralized off premise we refer to this combination of access to improved water sources as a community approach to increase hhws recognizing that water security is a dynamic and complex condition beyond access 12 14 29 40 1 1 quantity as a measure of household water security in 2003 who established the standard of 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d as the minimum volume of water a person needs to assure consumption drinking and cooking promote hygiene and result in low health concern 26 practitioners policymakers advocates and scholars worldwide have adopted this minimum as the primary metric for measuring hhws 44 although quantity is a useful metric howard and bartram 26 emphasized that water use patterns drive health outcomes and that not all water must be used within the home to protect health the evidence further suggests that it is the effective use of both water and cleansing agents and the timing of hygiene practices that are more important than volumes of water used furthermore as some hygiene behaviour protective of health for example laundry and bathing may be carried out off plot the quantity of water required to sustain good hygiene may vary significantly with water collection behavior howard and bartram 2003 16 authors of a more recent review of water quantity literature 43 conclude that although water used per capita per day is a useful indicator of hhws it does not necessarily reflect the relationship between water and health outcomes based on a review of epidemiologic evidence they argue that although higher quantities of water promote health how those quantities of water are used is the primary driver of improved health outcomes see also 26 1 2 household water insecurity in remote alaska native communities alaska ranks last in proportion of homes with in home piped water access in the united states while most homes statewide are served with piped water in rural alaska approximately 15 of occupied housing units lack in home water and sanitation services i e are unplumbed rural alaskan communities are primarily alaska native which is a complex term referring to 11 distinct cultures categorized into 5 major groups speaking 20 different language dialects 3 there are over 30 unserved remote alaska native communities primarily in the yup ik cup ik and athabascan regions of western and interior alaska 25 50 in addition there are an unquantified number of households scattered throughout the state who either have lost connection to their community s centralized piped water system or are periodically disconnected due to nonpayment or system failures 14 many of alaska s unserved communities are deemed ineligible for in home service by state and federal funding agencies due to factors such as affordability economic sustainability and vulnerability to climate change 16 18 25 these remaining unserved communities are extremely remote with no connections to road systems and expensive construction operations and maintenance costs factors such as a small customer base permafrost extreme cold costly transportation and inadequate costly energy supplies contribute to the high expenditures associated with water and sewer services 6 21 in some alaska native communities ancs pipes must be insulated above ground due to permafrost leading to high energy costs and frequent freeze ups though all communities in rural alaska are supposed to have a water treatment facility that treats raw water to epa clean water act standards 47 there is limited funding available to maintain the facilities and households must have the resources to pay for services despite an increase in funding in recent years the estimated gap between funds available for construction of water and sewer infrastructure and ancs needs is over 1 3 billion 28 adding to this multifaceted problem are climate changes that are damaging existing infrastructure and forcing the relocation of some communities thirty one ancs are considered imminently threatened by climate change and therefore cannot qualify for government funding to improve their existing infrastructure that is increasingly threatened by melting permafrost erosion salt water intrusion and storm surges 25 49 climate change is also contributing to fluctuations in water access due to storms floods and other service interruptions that cause prolonged water insecurity even in households that are connected to centralized piped water and sewer systems 7 14 15 in communities with an operational centralized facility water is then either piped to homes transported via small haul 100 gallon 378 5 l tankers or collected from the facility by individual residents eleven communities use a small haul system and over 30 villages use self haul systems where residents haul water to their homes themselves typically in containers ranging from 5 to 33 gallons 18 9 l 124 9 l the task of hauling water is usually done by older boys and able bodied men though all household members may haul water unplumbed households rely on a plastic basin of water for handwashing often reusing dirty water multiple times see fig 1 in many unserved communities households use buckets as toilets known as honey buckets and must haul raw sewage to the dump exposing themselves to fecal borne pathogens 11 most self haul communities have a central facility washeteria in the community for showers and laundry however washeterias are not always available when residents need them some shower and laundry services are unaffordable and many of the facilities need critical repairs several case studies in remote ancs have described the limited quantity of water used in unplumbed households around 1 5 2 5 gal c d 5 7 9 5 l c d less than the 4 0 gal c d 15 0 l c d recommended by the sphere handbook sphere 42 for a refugee camp 14 16 18 45 46 limited access to water results in water rationing and reuse of dirty washbasin and laundry water 45 various studies have described the health consequences of this extreme household water insecurity including significantly higher rates of water wash infections such as skin respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in self haul communities or regions with a high proportion of self haul communities 24 39 46 51 1 3 addressing household water insecurity through modular technology an alaskan experiment in 2013 the state of alaska created the alaska water and sewer challenge as a response to this context of prolonged water insecurity and underfunding amid the growing detrimental effects of climate change on community infrastructure the state sought proposals from engineering teams for small durable simple modular system designs that could withstand arctic conditions comply with the alaska plumbing code and other regulations and meet additional criteria summarized in table 1 2 however the requirements of delivering 15 gal c d 56 7 l c d through modular water treatment and sanitation units while keeping construction operations costs and complexity low proved challenging engineers struggled to design systems that could meet the accessibility criteria while also being small simple to operate and affordable the alaska native tribal health consortium division of environmental health and engineering 1 1 at any given time the anthc dehe is working to construct water supply infrastructure in about 40 alaska native communities took a different approach and developed a portable water treatment and sanitation system known as the portable alternative sanitation system pass engineers sought to reduce the incidence of skin respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in unplumbed homes by facilitating effective in home use of water and by targeting three drivers of exposure treated drinking water handwashing and human waste the pass unit consists of a modular point of entry water treatment and sanitation system that provides running treated water 100 gallons of water storage capacity a separating dry toilet and a urinal gray water and urine are diverted to an underground seepage pit although the pass provides the in home infrastructure necessary to promote the use of water it does not pipe water into the homes specifications of the pass and its advantages over an unplumbed home are included in table 2 preliminary pre post intervention data indicated that households with pass units only increased their average in home water use by 0 41 gal c d 1 6 l c d from 2 60 gal c d 9 8 l c d to 3 01 gal c d 11 4 l c d 50 however household members who were surveyed also reported overall improved health the incongruence of these data highlighted a gap in thinking behind the pass as a wash intervention and its evaluation researchers were relying on in home water use as a proxy for how the pass affected health and did not account for water use at other sources in the absence of a centralized water distribution system the question remains of how households can access a minimum of 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d when residents still must haul water into their homes 2 methods 2 1 unpacking 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d water quantity recommendations by health related purpose in order to explore scenarios that would achieve the who s intermediate service level in unserved homes we first identified quantity recommendations by usage categories drinking food preparation sanitation hygiene and bathing as detailed by gleick 20 and howard and bartram 26 table 3 based on his review of existing literature in 1996 gleick estimated that an individual requires 5 l c d for drinking 1 3 gal c d 10 l c d 2 6 gal c d for cooking and kitchen 20 l c d for sanitation services and 15 l c d for bathing 20 although 50 l c d 5 3 gal c d is a widely accepted standard for total water needed to protect health howard and bartram 26 did not unpack this volume by specific health related purpose instead they provide estimates only for the minimum amounts needed for what they characterize as basic access resulting in high health concern we therefore used gleick s 20 recommendations to build our scenarios although we include howard and bartram s 26 estimates for reference we consulted the cold regions utility monograph crum 41 for regionally relevant quantity by purpose recommendations in contrast to the who crum authors point to 60 l c d throughout the monograph that as the minimum amount of water considered adequate for drinking cooking bathing and laundry 41 5 16 the monograph does not contain individual quantities by purpose likely because the primary objective of their estimates is to inform design plans and not directly tied to health outcomes second we separated out the specific uses subsumed by gleick s broad purpose categories whether those activities occur at individual or household levels and the variables affecting quantities used we summarize these activities and assumptions in table 4 assuming that water used for drinking and food preparation primarily occurs within the home we explored the specific activities categorized as sanitation hygiene and bathing in order to identify where each of these activities could take place in the home or central facility and separated each specific use by location within home or centralized public facility in order to determine a minimum per capita quantity of water that is needed within the home to protect health we assumed a household size of 5 5 persons which we calculated based on data from the anthc dehe this assumption is based on the most recent population sizes and number of occupied homes for two communities piloting pass units communities deemed by funding agencies to be ineligible for centralized in home piped water and sanitation services tend to be smaller and more impoverished we chose to use internal data rather than census data because we believe it to be a more accurate estimate of household size the three premises behind our scenarios are 1 households have pass systems with sink that provides running water and a separating toilet 2 we assume that communities have a functioning and reliable central facility washeteria with public showers and clothes washers the premise being that in the absence of a piped system it is easier to move either the person or the clothes to the facility source of water for both those functions rather than moving the large volume of water needed for these activities to the home 3 we assumed the acceptance and use of a diverting waterless toilet and low flow fixtures as provided by the pass we established a list of the essential individual and household water needs and determined which needs must be met in the home and which needs could be met at the washeteria we determined per person and per household quantity needed for each function assuming use of the pass low flow fixtures and waterless toilet 2 2 evidence based assumptions of water use water is needed for the following individual and household sanitation hygiene and bathing needs handwashing showering bathing dishwashing house cleaning and laundry after reviewing existing literature and public health practice materials we found no guidelines on how many times people must wash hands or dishes take showers or do laundry even in the context of adequate water supply many factors will impact the frequency of each of these uses across individuals households and cultures we therefore made some broad but reasonable assumptions regarding frequency of these activities and created estimates of low average and high frequency of use we categorized each need as either individual or household and whether it had to occur in the home or could occur elsewhere such as centralized laundry and shower facilities 2 2 1 in home needs individual 1 physiologic needs e g drinking based on data reviewed by howard and bartram 26 we estimated a mid level water need of 3 7 l c d 1 gal c d by averaging the recommended volumes for a 70 kilogram kg adult to assure hydration in average conditions 0 8 gal c d 3 0 l c d and when conducting manual labor in high temperatures 1 2 gal c d 4 5 l c d understanding that water needs may vary depending on age gender ambient temperature activity level consumption of liquids purchased e g soda and whether a woman is pregnant or nursing we then calculated a low and high range we based our low estimate on the minimum water needed to assure hydration for a 70 kg adult man 0 8 gal c d 3 0 l c d and the high estimate on the minimum amount required by a breastfeeding woman 1 5 gal c d 5 5 l c d 2 handwashing we estimated individual hand washes per day required to protect health based on standard public health recommendations to wash hands at a minimum before eating and after using the toilet both for urination and defecation although there are no clear medical guidelines internet searches indicated that a well hydrated individual urinates about 6 times a day 5 8 52 assuming that individuals also eat three meals a day we estimated that 8 10 and 12 hand washes per day were reasonable minimum mid and maximum rates for this study we calculated the amount of water per hand wash based on a duration of 30 s using a low flow fixture 0 5 gallon per minute gal min based on pass design specifications 0 25 gal hand wash 2 3 in home needs household 1 food preparation this includes water for food preparation and cooking for mid level estimates we assumed use of water for cooking oatmeal referred to as mush in many communities and boiled meat a typical meal in many alaska native homes twice a day using a 15 1 liter 4 gallons pot one half full of water 2 washing dishes we assume households use 9 5 l 2 5 gallons per wash based on the standard size of a plastic washbasin customary in rural alaska native homes for mid level estimates we assumed that households wash dishes twice per day we also assume that this water is used to clean countertops 3 cleaning house we assume households use a full 5 gallon 18 9 l bucket per cleaning for mid level estimates we assume that households clean their house once per week 2 4 centralized needs individual bathing we calculated water used for bathing based on flow rates 2 5 gal min 9 5 l min and duration 7 min of most public showers in remote alaska native communities we assume a mid level shower frequency of one time per day and that public showers are not equipped with a water saver 2 4 1 centralized needs household 1 laundry for mid level estimates we assumed that an average household 5 5 persons would wash on average 7 5 loads laundry once per week one for each person plus two loads for household things like sheets towels coats etc for laundry done within a home we assume that each load uses 20 gallons 75 7 l based on the typical size of portable washers used on premise in alaska native communities this amount is also an appropriate estimate for those washing laundry off premise as washeterias typically use 17 gal washers per john warren personal communication 2 5 table top exercise we then conducted a simple table top exercise using excel and information gathered from anthc water engineers with extensive experience in cold regions joe hess and john warren personal communication to revise assumptions in our estimates including faucet flow rates and public laundry infrastructure to better reflect actual conditions in remote alaskan communities we then calculated water use estimates gal c d for the average household size of 5 5 persons based on population data from two communities currently using pass using mid level upper and lower estimates of use the assumed purpose and frequency of water uses are summarized in table 4 below 3 results 3 1 combining in home water use with centralized communal sources can achieve 50 l c d 13 2 gal c d based on the assumptions described above we calculated estimates for water use for an average household size of 5 5 persons using the low middle and high estimates table 5 below illustrates the calculations used for low water use for the different household needs the table shows the overall water need for a household of 5 5 assuming low level use for the different categories is 79 0 gallons per household which equates to a total use per person of 14 4 gal c d 54 5 l c d assuming a functional off premise shower and laundry facility 20 2 gallons is needed in the home per day equivalent to 3 7 gal c d 76 5 l c d table 6 shows the estimated total water needs per person and per household of 5 5 individuals based on low middle and high water use and how these needs can be met through the combination of in home and centralized water use in summary in the context of communal laundry and shower facilities we estimated the amount of water needed per individual ranged from a low of 3 7 gallons 14 l to a high of 7 2 gallons 27 3 l with a mid range of 4 9 gal c d 18 5 l c d for an average household size of 5 5 persons water needed in the home ranged from 20 2 to 39 4 gal c d with a mid range of 27 1 gallons per home per day 76 4 149 1 l c d mid range 102 6 l c d 4 conclusions and discussion based on generous assumptions regarding average frequency of use and the availability of a centralized facility for showering and laundry we estimated the amount of in home water needed per individual ranged from a low of 3 7 a middle of 4 9 and a high of 7 2 gal c d for a household of 5 5 persons we estimate the average amount of water needed in the home based on mid range use to be 27 1 gallons per day when combined with water used at communal sources pass households should be able to reach the who minimum of 13 2 gal c d defined as intermediate water access resulting in low health concern 26 this would require filling the 100 gallon pass tank every three days thus we conclude that a community approach to household water security that combines in home access to an improved source and off premise access for non consumptive purposes can improve water related health in unserved communities one strength of our analysis is we did not compromise on water needs for hygiene or drinking or on water quality improving sanitation and maintaining the ability to wash hands frequently in clean flowing water would probably be the biggest contribution of the pass to improve household health and reduce water related disease therefore for any given estimate of use we assumed that almost half of the water should be used for hand washing likewise we used howard and bartram s 26 minimum recommendation of 0 8 gal c d 2 9 l c d for the hydration needs of an adult 70 kg male additionally all of the water that goes through the pass system is treated to drinking water quality our findings are limited based on several assumptions we made on amount and frequency of water usage as well as water use by purpose there is little literature that determines how much water should be used for any specific activity so the assumptions are based on public health recommendations expert consultations observation data and general observations we do not take into consideration individualized needs such as bathing that may need to occur within the home for infants young children and elders or in the maqi yup ik steam bath or sauna traditionally used for bathing further total water usage depends on the flow rates of fixtures and duration of water used for our estimates of low water use we assumed low estimates for all water needs and similarly for medium and high estimates in reality there would be a mix of low medium and high uses across the different water use needs although our exercise is based on observations gained from working in remote alaska native communities where declining funding and climate change hinder household access to sufficient and safe water our findings have global relevance this paper contributes to a growing area of investigation around how household use of multiple water sources for different purposes affects human health and may promote hhws 1 4 19 27 34 36 37 scholars have found that households will combine water sources to overcome factors that impede hhws such as seasonality of sources 37 or inadequate access to improved sources 22 understanding the potential of combining centralized and decentralized water and sanitation infrastructure may provide a roadmap for improving household water security in remote communities amid limited funding and the increasing effects of climate change on household water security in the context of alaska how do we move self haul communities from 2 gal c d 7 6 l c d to a mid range of 4 9 gal c d 18 5 l c d of in home water use a major limitation to using more water within the home is the time distance and physical strength required to collect water 10 15 16 18 23 53 as well as the safety of water collectors therefore we recommend exploring sources that may be closer to households than the centralized facility as an option for households with in home treatment and protected

20147,current water infrastructure designs and design processes are ill suited to address deep uncertainties related to climate variability and change water systems increasingly exhibit fragility to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions the concept of resilience offers a framework to improve water system design for uncertain futures by incorporating capabilities such as persistence adaptability and transformability existing formalizations of resilience in engineering design however are dependent on assumptions of climate and hydrologic stationarity and of well characterized uncertainty rendering them obsolete relative to our current understanding of the uncertainties we face in this paper we use methods based on decision making under deep uncertainty to establish a methodology to design for the resilience of water systems the formulation generates water system design options that provide resilience capabilities at least cost and specify the optimal choices for persistence adaptability and transformability for performance over a wide range of possible futures as it was developed for application beyond water systems the resilience by design is a generalizable approach offering important new methods of planning and managing for the resilience of critical infrastructure 1 introduction recent and repeated incidence of extreme weather resulting in major disasters to cities and to agricultural systems with countless human victims plainly reveals that society is not prepared for the climate risks we now face these events and their often catastrophic consequences are increasing in frequency relative to historic norms 47 and overwhelming infrastructure designed according to that history the infrastructure underpinning our vital water systems is particularly vulnerable why are water infrastructure systems unable to handle these shocks the primary reason is a failure of planning and design to accommodate these events water systems and the infrastructure and operational rules that undergird them have been designed using static assumptions of climate and deterministic assumptions of other key design variables consequently our water systems are not designed to handle climate surprises 40 and as a society we are exposed to more risk than intended in our infrastructure design and often much greater vulnerability than we realize in short we have been overconfident in our ability to anticipate and design for an uncertain future and thus too often our support systems fail in the face of surprise climate changes are expected to cause an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events subsequently increasing the risk to infrastructure systems and to the communities that depend on them empirical studies have provided evidence of increasing trends in climate extremes 11 while also indicating that some trends may be occurring that we have yet to detect like flood risk 48 yet the complexity of the earth s climate including the chaotic manifestations of natural variability defy immediate progress in the accurate prediction of weather related design variables 19 25 32 45 10 26 despite the expectation that on average extreme weather events will increase we currently lack the technical ability to estimate changes at specific locations at the temporal and spatial scales required for infrastructure design 49 the lack of precise estimates of essential design variables including knowledge of the direction of change in the case of precipitation for many regions 22 has troubling implications for water infrastructure system design and operations typical infrastructure design processes use deterministic methods that depend on single estimates of future design variables more advanced approaches use probabilistic estimates of design variables that are represented with probability distribution functions now ample evidence suggests that the probability distributions themselves are changing over time in ways we can only partially anticipate e g 44 2 5 without a reliable replacement for historical probabilities however current design methods are caught between dependence on potentially unreliable estimates based on the historical record and projections from models that do not reliably simulate the variables of concern compounding current challenges our design approaches depend on risk based benefit cost analysis that rely upon the estimation of weather risks that we cannot accurately predict as a result we face valid and urgent concerns for the future performance of our infrastructure systems amidst increasing evidence of their fragility there is growing public recognition that these are critical design challenges given our limited ability to anticipate the trends and shocks of the future indeed society s desire to build the resilience of critical systems is a response to heightened awareness of the fragile nature of infrastructure while climate research may eventually improve our ability to predict climate futures society must make decisions now on infrastructure design our current design approach will have lasting consequences for future preparedness while we have little control over the weather and our ability to accurately predict future climates the methods we choose to design infrastructure systems for resilience to future stressors are within our control recent advances in decision making under uncertainty and high performance computing enable new design methods that are capable of meeting this challenge 31 here we endeavor to take up that challenge through advances in methods for systems analysis and resilience design applied systems analysis and resilience science aim to address the challenge of designing critical systems such as water infrastructure for future uncertainties and related risks our conception of resilience couples the engineering design standard of robustness with the ecological concepts of persistence adaptation and transformation cf 14 6 we define a resilient infrastructure system as one that can maintain its function and services over a wide range of future conditions adapting and transforming to accommodate change while managing failure in a systematic manner that limits damages and costs during extreme events resilience is rarely applied quantitatively in the design of infrastructure systems e g 1 and in those rare cases only probabilistic approaches have been applied e g 20 50 examples include logistic networks such as electric motor supply chains 21 runway use scheduling 51 and transportation networks e g 41 23 where uncertainties can be confidently characterized in probabilistic terms these resilience design methods may be adequate however the design of long lived infrastructure systems demands methods that can address uncertainties that defy confident assignment of probability distributions to outcomes such uncertainties have been described as severe knightian and most recently as deep uncertainty and include uncertainties associated with climate change population growth and demand transitions among others 42 knight 24 proposed the original distinction between risk which was characterized by unknowns that could be described probabilistically and uncertainty which could not be described probabilistically due to lack of adequate knowledge to build resilience in the face of deep uncertainty requires a more robust quantitative approach to designing infrastructure systems in this paper we propose a new methodology to incorporate decision making under deep uncertainty within resilience design processes this is possible through the application of decision making under deep uncertainty dmdu theory to a formulation built upon optimal control theory the resilience design literature provides a probabilistic basis for the mathematical formulation which is updated for the case where assigning a single probability distribution to uncertain variables is not advisable in section 2 we describe in more detail the sources of shortcomings in current infrastructure design approaches and the guidance that the resilience literature offers for addressing them in section 3 we suggest a solution in the form of an optimal control model addressing the key principles derived in section 2 in section 4 we describe the implementation of the model within a dmdu framework the paper closes with final considerations for further development and application of this new framework which we call resilience by design 2 designing infrastructure for a deeply uncertain future infrastructure investments entail large capital costs affect large areas are long to construct and long lived and are unique by nature of their social ecological setting many infrastructure systems design efforts commonly require tradeoffs among diverse interests with differing preferences with effects that are realized over long time periods and large spatial areas the design process for new projects and systems can be lengthy and highly complex as they often have the potential for significant societal and environmental impacts both positive and negative that go well beyond the lifetime of the investment 52 53 to these complexities we must add uncertainty related to future climate societal and earth system conditions as we reckon with evidence of our limited ability to accurately anticipate the future e g 38 recognition of these concerns has motivated growing interest in resilience design for infrastructure understanding that these critical systems must perform well in the face of uncertainty and surprise 54 conventional infrastructure design and evaluation methods are based on assumptions of well defined uncertainties using fixed probability distributions in the cases where uncertainty is quantitatively addressed unwarranted confidence in our ability to describe uncertainty can exacerbate system vulnerability and undermine resilience 28 both cost benefit analysis cba and our application of cost effectiveness analysis cea as standard design and decision criteria demonstrate how resilience can be undermined by overconfidence in probabilities cost benefit analysis and related methods e g cea often guide infrastructure design and are typically authoritative when evaluating infrastructure alternatives since at least the u s flood control act of 1928 cba has been the basis for evaluating alternative water infrastructure designs 55 the inability to accurately estimate the probabilities of climate related design values in the future undermines cba because of its dependence on such probabilities for example the typical design approach for a flood control system requires estimation of the probability of occurrence of flood magnitude which is used to estimate the expected benefits of flood risk reduction in a context of perfect information risk based cba leads to the efficient use of financial resources the efficient level of flood protection is the level at which the expected benefits of the flood protection system avoided damages meet or exceed the expected cost of providing that protection events that exceed that magnitude are expected to happen so rarely that they do not warrant design consideration in this context cba informs the design process by assuring that resources are used efficiently in an economic sense however the effect of climate change on hydrologic variability and extremes defies our ability to estimate the required probabilities consequently this standard design approach breaks down use of historical observations to estimate flood probabilities may underestimate or overestimate the risk as yet there are no credible predictions of what the future probabilities are likely to be the evidence suggests that a wide range of uncertainties cause unreliable estimates of costs and benefits in infrastructure design flyvbjerg 56 is particularly critical of infrastructure design approaches citing cba as strongly misleading and a cause of misplaced overconfidence in design certainty cited in 57 dams in particular have been identified as problematic from a financial environmental and social perspective 58 key issues include the difficulty of discounting future costs and benefits underestimation of the value of losses common given the loss averse nature of human value judgments and the difficulty of estimating effects within complex systems 16 this challenge is increased when ecosystem services are involved as they present additional non market valuation and benefit aggregation concerns 43 in addition conventional design approaches do not adequately consider the performance of the system in failure instead the typical approach is to satisfy a specified level of reliability meaning nonfailure for providing desired services with the design level of reliability met the ultimate consequences of cases that end in failure are typically disregarded lack of consideration of the consequences of failure is especially problematic given the well established human nature of risk aversion empirical studies demonstrate that people prefer to avoid a loss of a given magnitude over a gain of the same magnitude and the difference in preferences may be quite large 16 59 brown and gregory 60 found the preference for avoiding losses over equivalent gains to be on the order of 2 1 to 5 1 in experimental tests cited in 16 insurance markets exist to enable people to avoid large private financial losses demonstrating their willingness to pay to do so however there is no equivalent real versus financial mechanism for humans to avoid losses from infrastructure failure faced with deep uncertainty relative to future conditions of the earth system and to complex human societal change conventional project evaluation frameworks that are dependent on probabilities that we cannot reliably estimate and that also disregard the consequences of failure are not merely obsolete they are arguably a critical liability and source of fragility for critical infrastructure systems 3 resilience by design resilience offers the conceptual framework for updating infrastructure design methods to prepare for the future advances in resilience science cf 61 62 14 suggest that resilience refers to the ability of a system both to remain in its current equilibrium persisting under and adapting to change as well as its ability to shift or transform to a new equilibrium thriving in a changed configuration resilience derives from the system s identity its components their configuration and interactions which enables it under disturbance to maintain coherent function within an expected range of variation 6 system functions include the provision of specific services or more broadly the societal services produced by natural systems and economic and social capital from human systems ibid this conceptualization of resilience addresses the need to recognize that under extreme change systems cannot merely persist without change but must adapt and transform to novel conditions and stressors under changing climate and water futures this approach to resilience enables design to sustain system function and services for the long term under whatever range of stressors may be projected following the framing proposed in related work 14 6 we suggest that three capabilities characterize a resilient system persistence its ability to maintain coherent function in response to disruption and changing conditions without altering its identity adaptability its ability to maintain coherent function by modifying its identity to accommodate change transformability its ability to change identity and to establish a new stable function when pushed beyond tipping points that preclude maintaining its prior state the resilience by design framework thus focuses on identifying and evaluating the performance of a given system design or identity in terms of its persistence adaptability and transformability in the face of future hazards and to incremental change see fig 1 the proposed framework provides an analytical approach to the design of systems that perform coherently under the stresses of gradual change and of rapid onset shocks that would otherwise preclude its function and provision of services for instance a resilient water infrastructure system would be able to sustain its water provisioning water quality regulation and waste and storm water management services under both low frequency changes and trends in precipitation regimes as well as extreme flooding or drought events the resilience literature implicitly acknowledges the difficulty of foreseeing future conditions and the effects they yield in a complex system c f 63 meanwhile the resilience design literature is largely based on probabilistic approaches that rely on an assumption of prescribed future probabilities the result is resilience design approaches that address uncertainty and capabilities such as persistence and recovery but only when probabilities can be well defined uncertainties that must be considered for our future system and infrastructure designs are not so easily predicted climate change for instance defies our accurate prediction the prevailing approach in the resilience design literature formulates the design challenge as an optimal control problem the methods integrate the design of a system with the monitoring and control functions that enable adjustment to changing conditions hosseini et al 21 summarizes this literature which typically examine network systems especially transportation and logistics a large number of studies use optimization models to prescribe optimal recovery strategies see 64 65 1 uncertainty is generally modeled probabilistically for example assigning probability density functions to network outage occurrence and location 21 46 34 or not explicitly considered 28 furthermore there is no recognition of the dependence of built infrastructure systems on the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide youn et al 46 provides an instructive probabilistic formulation the model consists of resilience driven system design featuring a design objective that is the sum of reliability which is satisfactory performance for assumed conditions and restoration which is recovery from a problematic condition or state this model provides a useful basis for resilience design by integrating the design of the system with the ability to recover from failure as well as predictive functions to proactively adapt to changing conditions when and if they are detected however the youn et al 46 model is developed for cases of well characterized uncertainty and short operational periods such as an aircraft control actuator consequently there is no consideration of the effects when the system enters failure mode as infrastructure systems sometimes do but aircraft must never there is also no acknowledgment of changing probabilities over time and uncertainty in probability distributions due to the short time horizon considered these are not tenable assumptions for infrastructure design achieving resilience in infrastructure systems requires planning for the long term and for the uncertainties and surprises the future may hold in particular it requires accommodation for the need to transform when the current system configuration can no longer provide the required services recent advances in decision making under deep uncertainty provide an opportunity to advance the probabilistically based resilience design approach presented by youn et al 46 for applicability to the design of infrastructure systems this growing subfield hails from the discipline of decision analysis marchau et al 31 provides a recent review and sampling of these methods the core of the framework focuses on using multi dimensional sensitivity analysis to assess the performance of alternative strategies over a wide range of possible futures e g 4 12 27 in this literature providing acceptable performance over a wide range of futures is referred to as robustness some methods use single or multiple probability distributions to characterize the weight of evidence for the robustness of a strategy for example by quantifying the probability assigned to the futures to which a strategy is robust 9 39 this approach has been widely applied to assess the robustness of infrastructure systems to climate change especially in the case of water infrastructure however it has not been previously applied to the challenge of designing for infrastructure resilience by incorporating the capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability 4 resilience by design methodology resilience by design is a performance based conceptualization of resilience which means that the resilience of a particular system design is evaluated based on how it performs under a set of specified test conditions and as measured based on specified resilience metrics this approach is common in engineering resilience studies but contrasts with prescriptions for resilience that focus on the presence or absence or degree of particular resilience traits e g 62 66 3 67 68 69 cataloging the traits of resilient systems serves as a useful reference in the design of a resilient system but provides little guidance on which traits are needed and in what proportion or combination for a particular design while options such as creating redundancy through multiples of critical facilities may enhance resilience design should seek efficiency in the use of financial and physical resources by evaluating alternative designs based on performance the relative contribution to total system resilience of different design aspects may be observed in this way the most efficient design for achieving system resilience may be identified following the optimal control literature resilience by design approaches the evaluation of alternative designs via optimization which is an efficient and systematic way to evaluate multiple possible designs the optimization process is embedded within a decision making under deep uncertainty framework the overarching objective is resilient performance of the system that enables it to persist in its function under disturbance adapt to changing conditions as they develop and identify the need to transform to a new system via initiating a redesign process when conditions warrant the mathematical formulation described below implements a resilience design objective suited for long lived infrastructure systems subject to a large number of uncertain external factors in most cases such factors are associated with poorly characterized uncertainty the design objective solves for resilience capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability formulated as a fixed system design that is directly integrated with reactive recovery from changing conditions and proactive responses to anticipated change it also quantifies damages that are not mitigated by the design called residual risk 7 to signal when transformation is required decision variables are the design parameters of the system the choices that are to be made constraints include immutable physical aspects of the system and performance aspects that must be met here we present the optimization as a formal mathematical model while we note that resilience by design may be applied as conceptual or logical framework for design and may be used to rank alternative design options the approach may be applied to design new infrastructure and to renovate existing systems as well as planning efforts the process begins with an initial step of assessing vulnerability to future conditions as described for example in brown et al 9 and ray and brown 70 the result is a system designed for the long term limited by our ability to predict the outcomes of external forces but not beyond our ability to design systems that can respond to them 4 1 general formulation of resilience by design resilience by design requires an alternative mindset for the designer one in which the aspiration is to create a design that effectively lasts forever rather than providing only the next increment of service or more accurately while providing the next increment of service in other words the designer should consider what is required for the system to continue without end this is the essence of resilience while this does not preclude discounting future costs and benefits full consideration of the long term future generally implies a low discount rate and may require hyperbolic discounting to ensure the future is not inappropriately undervalued for simplicity we omit discounting in the derivation that follows below given the centrality of cost benefit analysis cba to infrastructure design processes the resilience by design formulation begins by enhancing cba to address uncertainty following a probabilistic formulation deep uncertainty will be addressed in section 4 2 the cba design problem can be described as 1 m a x expected n e t b e n e f i t total e x p e c t e d b e n e f i t total e x p e c t e d c o s t where the goal is to identify the system design that maximizes the expected net benefit here we focus on costs for the purpose of clarity and conciseness although uncertainty in benefits can be addressed as well using the method presented in section 4 2 the total expected cost of a design including the losses that are incurred due to failures or damages can be stated as 2 total e x p e c t e d c o s t s fixed d e s i g n c o s t expected c o s t o f r e a c t i v e r e c o v e r y expected c o s t o f p r o a c t i v e r e c o v e r y cost o f m o n i t o r i n g a n d d e t e c t i o n utility o f e x p e c t e d l o s s e s here there is a distinction between values known at the time of design which include fixed costs of the system operation and maintenance and of monitoring and detection m d and unknown values including the costs of reactive and proactive recovery and of losses which are expected values conditioned on random variables that represent external factors unknown at the time of the design in addition we distinguish between reactive recovery which is the recovery from a failure state when it occurs and proactive recovery which is the corrective action implemented to prevent or mitigate a failure when it is likely proactive recovery depends on monitoring and detection of the conditions that increase the probability of failure and the initiation of appropriate actions finally we introduce a utility function for losses to reflect the well established human preference for avoiding large losses 16 finally the design approach applies equally to structural components as well as the policies for management of water systems that determine their operations see 9 for an example of adaptive management of an infrastructure operating policy this resilience by design approach considers the three capabilities of a resilient system described above 6 as illustrated in fig 2 designs for persistence incur the fixed design costs of providing a desired level of service reliability and the reactive recovery costs to return the system to normal after failure fixed design costs include both capital costs and routine operations and maintenance costs implicit in this formulation is the optimization of operations with selection of the fixed design e g 17 reactive recovery actions are determined partially by the fixed design and limited to operations of that fixed design and or by components specifically related to recovery actions for example lund 71 incorporates sandbagging activities and evacuations as recovery activities with a floodplain management design optimization adaptability of the system corresponds to its ability to proactively recover when conditions warrant this involves both detecting conditions that are problematic for the system s current configuration and detection of deterioration in system performance in either case proactive recovery activities can be initiated to select operations policies or system configurations that better suit prevailing conditions finally transformation of the system is incorporated into the design process through inclusion of the utility of losses the utility of expected losses triggers transformation of the system when they exceed a threshold of acceptability for example a design option with an unacceptably large utility of losses indicates that the system requires transformation in such cases performance objectives for the system and constraints must be re evaluated or an entirely new system design process initiated it is conceivable that in extreme cases transformation may include abandonment of the proposed infrastructure for a location in which the utility of losses is consistently too great the design challenge can be described as an optimization seeking to minimize the total cost of the design we focus on costs solely for clarity let z equal the total cost of a given resilience design 3 z i c i y i k c k ρ r 1 p d l c l ρ p p d u l y i ρ r ρ p p d x where ci represents the cost of alternative fixed design variables yi cj is the cost of monitoring and detection components mdj ck is the cost of reactive recovery activities ρ r p d x is the probability of detection of problematic performance based on the monitoring and modeling function this probability is conditional on the values of x and defined for a given probability distribution on x see below and cl is the cost of proactive recovery activities pp in addition to the direct costs of the system design our formulation includes the losses l that are incurred by a given design due to poor performance under extreme circumstances the losses are a function of the fixed design the recovery activities detection of the problematic conditions and the value of the external uncertain variable s that cause those conditions a utility function u l is used to value losses proportionally to societal preferences for the avoidance of large losses let a particular system design be represented by dr representing a particular set of yi mdj ρr and ρp the planner s objective is to minimize total expected cost z of a given design dr by selecting the combination of fixed design variables reactive recovery capabilities monitoring and detection capabilities and proactive recovery capabilities 4 min d r e x z e total c o s t d r the expectation is calculated by integrating over the probability distributions of external random variables x yielding 5 min d r e x z p x z x d x i c i y i j c j m d j p x k c k ρ r 1 p dx l c l ρ p p dx u l y i ρ r ρ p p dx x d x this formulation seeks the combination of fixed design values and adaptive design values that minimize the expected cost of the design including the utility of losses when failure occurs the utility function must return values in the same units as costs the decision variables chosen by the optimization also determine the relative proportion of persistence and adaptability capabilities and the necessity of transformation the decision variables yi and mdj represent the fixed design values of the system that combined with the decision variables for reactive recovery ρr and their costs ck represent the persistence of the system following eq 2 similarly the level of adaptability is set by the optimal values of the monitoring and detection costs cj and cl the cost of proactive recovery actions ρp the occurrence of hazards in the future is uncertain so terms affected by hazards are modified by the probability p x of the random vector x representing uncertain external factors such as temperature precipitation demand costs etc this includes all variable costs and losses note that at this point we define expectations for a single p x however p x itself is uncertain the robustness evaluation for multiple probability distributions on x is described in section 4 2 finally the utility of losses u l provides an indication of when transformation is necessary the utility function represents losses that may be both financial and nonfinancial and incurred by different parts of society as such preferences must be representative of the society or stakeholders impacted for example as described in brown et al 8 and moody and brown 33 when the value of the utility of losses reaches an unacceptably high level relative to decision maker preferences the fixed system design with reactive and proactive recovery costs is unable to provide the necessary level of service this condition necessitates design for transformability the result is a design optimization that yields system resilience to uncertainties through persisting and recovery forecasting and adapting and transforming based on projected future conditions 4 2 addressing deep uncertainty a particular challenge for assessing resilience is the dependence of the evaluation on assumptions about future conditions for example the future probabilities of external factors p x the term deep uncertainty has been used to describe cases where a single probability distribution cannot be specified to describe future conditions with confidence a variety of methods have been developed to address deep uncertainty see 31 in general these methods emphasize sensitivity analysis of designs over many possible futures rather than the use of expected values based on a probabilistically described future or a single best guess future moody and brown 72 introduced a climate robustness index to quantify the ability of alternative designs to provide acceptable performance over many possible futures this is one of several alternatives for quantifying robustness depending on the preference of the analyst 18 the method evaluates designs over a range of possible future outcomes and defines ex post scenarios according to a given design s ability to provide acceptable performance across this range while this requires that a threshold of acceptable performance be specified the threshold can be varied in evaluating alternatives or subject to sensitivity analysis incorporating the ability to provide acceptable performance over a deeply uncertain future renders the optimization decision one of maximizing the performance robustness rbs of a given alternative design dr over the possible values of external factors x for a set of possible probability distributions on x 6 max d r r b s min d r e x z where s is the set of probability distributions on x seeking optimal alternatives over a set of probability distributions has been called belief dominance 3 reflecting the non dominated performance across uncertainty in future probabilities of x which the authors describe as beliefs belief dominance is similar to preference dominance the basis of pareto optimality where an alternative is non dominated if one objective cannot be improved without reducing the performance of another objective in practical terms belief dominance can be implemented by evaluating alternatives over different sets of probabilities assigned to possible future outcomes that is the future is described not by a single probability distribution but rather by a set of distributions options that perform best across all the distributions are non dominated in terms of the uncertainty of future outcomes this can also be combined with pareto optimality in the case of a multi objective decision problem for example if z is a vector of objectives including financial costs environmental costs and social costs in this paper with no loss of generality we present only the single financial cost objective 5 conclusion the potentially devastating implications of climate change and the deeply uncertain trends of its magnitude and direction raise concerns that current infrastructure systems are not prepared for the future since design processes have not adapted to the implications of a nonstationary climate there is further concern that new and retrofit infrastructure development designs will be similarly ill conceived to provide the resilience that people desire infrastructure design must address the uncertainty of the future including uncertainties that cannot confidently be modeled probabilistically and those that manifest as trends or low frequency variability infrastructure design must also account for losses and the disproportionate value they hold in human decision making finally infrastructure systems designs must acknowledge and preserve ecosystems that provide many of the underpinning functions and services that infrastructure intends to harness and sustain a resilience approach provides the conceptual basis for this urgently needed advance in the design of critical infrastructure here we introduce the resilience by design methodology for infrastructure design to incorporate both the ability to manage short term shocks and surprises and to accommodate long term trends the methodology follows a decision making under deep uncertainty framework that addresses the implications of our limited ability to correctly predict future conditions while the approach is a significant advance for the resilience design literature perhaps our more significant contribution is the expression of an objective to achieve acceptable and enduring performance over previously untenable time frames our belief is the resilience by design approach may help to fundamentally change the design of infrastructure to address urgent challenges of navigating uncertain climate and earth system futures mathematical and empirical experimentation will be required to test and refine this hypothesis some of which we have undertaken in related work 13 it is the authors hope that this contribution will inspire further applications to design for a resilient future acknowledgments this work was supported by grants 2017 fwc 202 and 2018 gpo 017 from the rockefeller foundation the authors are also grateful for the generous support provided by the resilience shift for this work the paper was greatly improved by the efforts of two anonymous reviewers 
20147,current water infrastructure designs and design processes are ill suited to address deep uncertainties related to climate variability and change water systems increasingly exhibit fragility to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions the concept of resilience offers a framework to improve water system design for uncertain futures by incorporating capabilities such as persistence adaptability and transformability existing formalizations of resilience in engineering design however are dependent on assumptions of climate and hydrologic stationarity and of well characterized uncertainty rendering them obsolete relative to our current understanding of the uncertainties we face in this paper we use methods based on decision making under deep uncertainty to establish a methodology to design for the resilience of water systems the formulation generates water system design options that provide resilience capabilities at least cost and specify the optimal choices for persistence adaptability and transformability for performance over a wide range of possible futures as it was developed for application beyond water systems the resilience by design is a generalizable approach offering important new methods of planning and managing for the resilience of critical infrastructure 1 introduction recent and repeated incidence of extreme weather resulting in major disasters to cities and to agricultural systems with countless human victims plainly reveals that society is not prepared for the climate risks we now face these events and their often catastrophic consequences are increasing in frequency relative to historic norms 47 and overwhelming infrastructure designed according to that history the infrastructure underpinning our vital water systems is particularly vulnerable why are water infrastructure systems unable to handle these shocks the primary reason is a failure of planning and design to accommodate these events water systems and the infrastructure and operational rules that undergird them have been designed using static assumptions of climate and deterministic assumptions of other key design variables consequently our water systems are not designed to handle climate surprises 40 and as a society we are exposed to more risk than intended in our infrastructure design and often much greater vulnerability than we realize in short we have been overconfident in our ability to anticipate and design for an uncertain future and thus too often our support systems fail in the face of surprise climate changes are expected to cause an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events subsequently increasing the risk to infrastructure systems and to the communities that depend on them empirical studies have provided evidence of increasing trends in climate extremes 11 while also indicating that some trends may be occurring that we have yet to detect like flood risk 48 yet the complexity of the earth s climate including the chaotic manifestations of natural variability defy immediate progress in the accurate prediction of weather related design variables 19 25 32 45 10 26 despite the expectation that on average extreme weather events will increase we currently lack the technical ability to estimate changes at specific locations at the temporal and spatial scales required for infrastructure design 49 the lack of precise estimates of essential design variables including knowledge of the direction of change in the case of precipitation for many regions 22 has troubling implications for water infrastructure system design and operations typical infrastructure design processes use deterministic methods that depend on single estimates of future design variables more advanced approaches use probabilistic estimates of design variables that are represented with probability distribution functions now ample evidence suggests that the probability distributions themselves are changing over time in ways we can only partially anticipate e g 44 2 5 without a reliable replacement for historical probabilities however current design methods are caught between dependence on potentially unreliable estimates based on the historical record and projections from models that do not reliably simulate the variables of concern compounding current challenges our design approaches depend on risk based benefit cost analysis that rely upon the estimation of weather risks that we cannot accurately predict as a result we face valid and urgent concerns for the future performance of our infrastructure systems amidst increasing evidence of their fragility there is growing public recognition that these are critical design challenges given our limited ability

there is no equivalent real versus financial mechanism for humans to avoid losses from infrastructure failure faced with deep uncertainty relative to future conditions of the earth system and to complex human societal change conventional project evaluation frameworks that are dependent on probabilities that we cannot reliably estimate and that also disregard the consequences of failure are not merely obsolete they are arguably a critical liability and source of fragility for critical infrastructure systems 3 resilience by design resilience offers the conceptual framework for updating infrastructure design methods to prepare for the future advances in resilience science cf 61 62 14 suggest that resilience refers to the ability of a system both to remain in its current equilibrium persisting under and adapting to change as well as its ability to shift or transform to a new equilibrium thriving in a changed configuration resilience derives from the system s identity its components their configuration and interactions which enables it under disturbance to maintain coherent function within an expected range of variation 6 system functions include the provision of specific services or more broadly the societal services produced by natural systems and economic and social capital from human systems ibid this conceptualization of resilience addresses the need to recognize that under extreme change systems cannot merely persist without change but must adapt and transform to novel conditions and stressors under changing climate and water futures this approach to resilience enables design to sustain system function and services for the long term under whatever range of stressors may be projected following the framing proposed in related work 14 6 we suggest that three capabilities characterize a resilient system persistence its ability to maintain coherent function in response to disruption and changing conditions without altering its identity adaptability its ability to maintain coherent function by modifying its identity to accommodate change transformability its ability to change identity and to establish a new stable function when pushed beyond tipping points that preclude maintaining its prior state the resilience by design framework thus focuses on identifying and evaluating the performance of a given system design or identity in terms of its persistence adaptability and transformability in the face of future hazards and to incremental change see fig 1 the proposed framework provides an analytical approach to the design of systems that perform coherently under the stresses of gradual change and of rapid onset shocks that would otherwise preclude its function and provision of services for instance a resilient water infrastructure system would be able to sustain its water provisioning water quality regulation and waste and storm water management services under both low frequency changes and trends in precipitation regimes as well as extreme flooding or drought events the resilience literature implicitly acknowledges the difficulty of foreseeing future conditions and the effects they yield in a complex system c f 63 meanwhile the resilience design literature is largely based on probabilistic approaches that rely on an assumption of prescribed future probabilities the result is resilience design approaches that address uncertainty and capabilities such as persistence and recovery but only when probabilities can be well defined uncertainties that must be considered for our future system and infrastructure designs are not so easily predicted climate change for instance defies our accurate prediction the prevailing approach in the resilience design literature formulates the design challenge as an optimal control problem the methods integrate the design of a system with the monitoring and control functions that enable adjustment to changing conditions hosseini et al 21 summarizes this literature which typically examine network systems especially transportation and logistics a large number of studies use optimization models to prescribe optimal recovery strategies see 64 65 1 uncertainty is generally modeled probabilistically for example assigning probability density functions to network outage occurrence and location 21 46 34 or not explicitly considered 28 furthermore there is no recognition of the dependence of built infrastructure systems on the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide youn et al 46 provides an instructive probabilistic formulation the model consists of resilience driven system design featuring a design objective that is the sum of reliability which is satisfactory performance for assumed conditions and restoration which is recovery from a problematic condition or state this model provides a useful basis for resilience design by integrating the design of the system with the ability to recover from failure as well as predictive functions to proactively adapt to changing conditions when and if they are detected however the youn et al 46 model is developed for cases of well characterized uncertainty and short operational periods such as an aircraft control actuator consequently there is no consideration of the effects when the system enters failure mode as infrastructure systems sometimes do but aircraft must never there is also no acknowledgment of changing probabilities over time and uncertainty in probability distributions due to the short time horizon considered these are not tenable assumptions for infrastructure design achieving resilience in infrastructure systems requires planning for the long term and for the uncertainties and surprises the future may hold in particular it requires accommodation for the need to transform when the current system configuration can no longer provide the required services recent advances in decision making under deep uncertainty provide an opportunity to advance the probabilistically based resilience design approach presented by youn et al 46 for applicability to the design of infrastructure systems this growing subfield hails from the discipline of decision analysis marchau et al 31 provides a recent review and sampling of these methods the core of the framework focuses on using multi dimensional sensitivity analysis to assess the performance of alternative strategies over a wide range of possible futures e g 4 12 27 in this literature providing acceptable performance over a wide range of futures is referred to as robustness some methods use single or multiple probability distributions to characterize the weight of evidence for the robustness of a strategy for example by quantifying the probability assigned to the futures to which a strategy is robust 9 39 this approach has been widely applied to assess the robustness of infrastructure systems to climate change especially in the case of water infrastructure however it has not been previously applied to the challenge of designing for infrastructure resilience by incorporating the capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability 4 resilience by design methodology resilience by design is a performance based conceptualization of resilience which means that the resilience of a particular system design is evaluated based on how it performs under a set of specified test conditions and as measured based on specified resilience metrics this approach is common in engineering resilience studies but contrasts with prescriptions for resilience that focus on the presence or absence or degree of particular resilience traits e g 62 66 3 67 68 69 cataloging the traits of resilient systems serves as a useful reference in the design of a resilient system but provides little guidance on which traits are needed and in what proportion or combination for a particular design while options such as creating redundancy through multiples of critical facilities may enhance resilience design should seek efficiency in the use of financial and physical resources by evaluating alternative designs based on performance the relative contribution to total system resilience of different design aspects may be observed in this way the most efficient design for achieving system resilience may be identified following the optimal control literature resilience by design approaches the evaluation of alternative designs via optimization which is an efficient and systematic way to evaluate multiple possible designs the optimization process is embedded within a decision making under deep uncertainty framework the overarching objective is resilient performance of the system that enables it to persist in its function under disturbance adapt to changing conditions as they develop and identify the need to transform to a new system via initiating a redesign process when conditions warrant the mathematical formulation described below implements a resilience design objective suited for long lived infrastructure systems subject to a large number of uncertain external factors in most cases such factors are associated with poorly characterized uncertainty the design objective solves for resilience capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability formulated as a fixed system design that is directly integrated with reactive recovery from changing conditions and proactive responses to anticipated change it also quantifies damages that are not mitigated by the design called residual risk 7 to signal when transformation is required decision variables are the design parameters of the system the choices that are to be made constraints include immutable physical aspects of the system and performance aspects that must be met here we present the optimization as a formal mathematical model while we note that resilience by design may be applied as conceptual or logical framework for design and may be used to rank alternative design options the approach may be applied to design new infrastructure and to renovate existing systems as well as planning efforts the process begins with an initial step of assessing vulnerability to future conditions as described for example in brown et al 9 and ray and brown 70 the result is a system designed for the long term limited by our ability to predict the outcomes of external forces but not beyond our ability to design systems that can respond to them 4 1 general formulation of resilience by design resilience by design requires an alternative mindset for the designer one in which the aspiration is to create a design that effectively lasts forever rather than providing only the next increment of service or more accurately while providing the next increment of service in other words the designer should consider what is required for the system to continue without end this is the essence of resilience while this does not preclude discounting future costs and benefits full consideration of the long term future generally implies a low discount rate and may require hyperbolic discounting to ensure the future is not inappropriately undervalued for simplicity we omit discounting in the derivation that follows below given the centrality of cost benefit analysis cba to infrastructure design processes the resilience by design formulation begins by enhancing cba to address uncertainty following a probabilistic formulation deep uncertainty will be addressed in section 4 2 the cba design problem can be described as 1 m a x expected n e t b e n e f i t total e x p e c t e d b e n e f i t total e x p e c t e d c o s t where the goal is to identify the system design that maximizes the expected net benefit here we focus on costs for the purpose of clarity and conciseness although uncertainty in benefits can be addressed as well using the method presented in section 4 2 the total expected cost of a design including the losses that are incurred due to failures or damages can be stated as 2 total e x p e c t e d c o s t s fixed d e s i g n c o s t expected c o s t o f r e a c t i v e r e c o v e r y expected c o s t o f p r o a c t i v e r e c o v e r y cost o f m o n i t o r i n g a n d d e t e c t i o n utility o f e x p e c t e d l o s s e s here there is a distinction between values known at the time of design which include fixed costs of the system operation and maintenance and of monitoring and detection m d and unknown values including the costs of reactive and proactive recovery and of losses which are expected values conditioned on random variables that represent external factors unknown at the time of the design in addition we distinguish between reactive recovery which is the recovery from a failure state when it occurs and proactive recovery which is the corrective action implemented to prevent or mitigate a failure when it is likely proactive recovery depends on monitoring and detection of the conditions that increase the probability of failure and the initiation of appropriate actions finally we introduce a utility function for losses to reflect the well established human preference for avoiding large losses 16 finally the design approach applies equally to structural components as well as the policies for management of water systems that determine their operations see 9 for an example of adaptive management of an infrastructure operating policy this resilience by design approach considers the three capabilities of a resilient system described above 6 as illustrated in fig 2 designs for persistence incur the fixed design costs of providing a desired level of service reliability and the reactive recovery costs to return the system to normal after failure fixed design costs include both capital costs and routine operations and maintenance costs implicit in this formulation is the optimization of operations with selection of the fixed design e g 17 reactive recovery actions are determined partially by the fixed design and limited to operations of that fixed design and or by components specifically related to recovery actions for example lund 71 incorporates sandbagging activities and evacuations as recovery activities with a floodplain management design optimization adaptability of the system corresponds to its ability to proactively recover when conditions warrant this involves both detecting conditions that are problematic for the system s current configuration and detection of deterioration in system performance in either case proactive recovery activities can be initiated to select operations policies or system configurations that better suit prevailing conditions finally transformation of the system is incorporated into the design process through inclusion of the utility of losses the utility of expected losses triggers transformation of the system when they exceed a threshold of acceptability for example a design option with an unacceptably large utility of losses indicates that the system requires transformation in such cases performance objectives for the system and constraints must be re evaluated or an entirely new system design process initiated it is conceivable that in extreme cases transformation may include abandonment of the proposed infrastructure for a location in which the utility of losses is consistently too great the design challenge can be described as an optimization seeking to minimize the total cost of the design we focus on costs solely for clarity let z equal the total cost of a given resilience design 3 z i c i y i k c k ρ r 1 p d l c l ρ p p d u l y i ρ r ρ p p d x where ci represents the cost of alternative fixed design variables yi cj is the cost of monitoring and detection components mdj ck is the cost of reactive recovery activities ρ r p d x is the probability of detection of problematic performance based on the monitoring and modeling function this probability is conditional on the values of x and defined for a given probability distribution on x see below and cl is the cost of proactive recovery activities pp in addition to the direct costs of the system design our formulation includes the losses l that are incurred by a given design due to poor performance under extreme circumstances the losses are a function of the fixed design the recovery activities detection of the problematic conditions and the value of the external uncertain variable s that cause those conditions a utility function u l is used to value losses proportionally to societal preferences for the avoidance of large losses let a particular system design be represented by dr representing a particular set of yi mdj ρr and ρp the planner s objective is to minimize total expected cost z of a given design dr by selecting the combination of fixed design variables reactive recovery capabilities monitoring and detection capabilities and proactive recovery capabilities 4 min d r e x z e total c o s t d r the expectation is calculated by integrating over the probability distributions of external random variables x yielding 5 min d r e x z p x z x d x i c i y i j c j m d j p x k c k ρ r 1 p dx l c l ρ p p dx u l y i ρ r ρ p p dx x d x this formulation seeks the combination of fixed design values and adaptive design values that minimize the expected cost of the design including the utility of losses when failure occurs the utility function must return values in the same units as costs the decision variables chosen by the optimization also determine the relative proportion of persistence and adaptability capabilities and the necessity of transformation the decision variables yi and mdj represent the fixed design values of the system that combined with the decision variables for reactive recovery ρr and their costs ck represent the persistence of the system following eq 2 similarly the level of adaptability is set by the optimal values of the monitoring and detection costs cj and cl the cost of proactive recovery actions ρp the occurrence of hazards in the future is uncertain so terms affected by hazards are modified by the probability p x of the random vector x representing uncertain external factors such as temperature precipitation demand costs etc this includes all variable costs and losses note that at this point we define expectations for a single p x however p x itself is uncertain the robustness evaluation for multiple probability distributions on x is described in section 4 2 finally the utility of losses u l provides an indication of when transformation is necessary the utility function represents losses that may be both financial and nonfinancial and incurred by different parts of society as such preferences must be representative of the society or stakeholders impacted for example as described in brown et al 8 and moody and brown 33 when the value of the utility of losses reaches an unacceptably high level relative to decision maker preferences the fixed system design with reactive and proactive recovery costs is unable to provide the necessary level of service this condition necessitates design for transformability the result is a design optimization that yields system resilience to uncertainties through persisting and recovery forecasting and adapting and transforming based on projected future conditions 4 2 addressing deep uncertainty a particular challenge for assessing resilience is the dependence of the evaluation on assumptions about future conditions for example the future probabilities of external factors p x the term deep uncertainty has been used to describe cases where a single probability distribution cannot be specified to describe future conditions with confidence a variety of methods have been developed to address deep uncertainty see 31 in general these methods emphasize sensitivity analysis of designs over many possible futures rather than the use of expected values based on a probabilistically described future or a single best guess future moody and brown 72 introduced a climate robustness index to quantify the ability of alternative designs to provide acceptable performance over many possible futures this is one of several alternatives for quantifying robustness depending on the preference of the analyst 18 the method evaluates designs over a range of possible future outcomes and defines ex post scenarios according to a given design s ability to provide acceptable performance across this range while this requires that a threshold of acceptable performance be specified the threshold can be varied in evaluating alternatives or subject to sensitivity analysis incorporating the ability to provide acceptable performance over a deeply uncertain future renders the optimization decision one of maximizing the performance robustness rbs of a given alternative design dr over the possible values of external factors x for a set of possible probability distributions on x 6 max d r r b s min d r e x z where s is the set of probability distributions on x seeking optimal alternatives over a set of probability distributions has been called belief dominance 3 reflecting the non dominated performance across uncertainty in future probabilities of x which the authors describe as beliefs belief dominance is similar to preference dominance the basis of pareto optimality where an alternative is non dominated if one objective cannot be improved without reducing the performance of another objective in practical terms belief dominance can be implemented by evaluating alternatives over different sets of probabilities assigned to possible future outcomes that is the future is described not by a single probability distribution but rather by a set of distributions options that perform best across all the distributions are non dominated in terms of the uncertainty of future outcomes this can also be combined with pareto optimality in the case of a multi objective decision problem for example if z is a vector of objectives including financial costs environmental costs and social costs in this paper with no loss of generality we present only the single financial cost objective 5 conclusion the potentially devastating implications of climate change and the deeply uncertain trends of its magnitude and direction raise concerns that current infrastructure systems are not prepared for the future since design processes have not adapted to the implications of a nonstationary climate there is further concern that new and retrofit infrastructure development designs will be similarly ill conceived to provide the resilience that people desire infrastructure design must address the uncertainty of the future including uncertainties that cannot confidently be modeled probabilistically and those that manifest as trends or low frequency variability infrastructure design must also account for losses and the disproportionate value they hold in human decision making finally infrastructure systems designs must acknowledge and preserve ecosystems that provide many of the underpinning functions and services that infrastructure intends to harness and sustain a resilience approach provides the conceptual basis for this urgently needed advance in the design of critical infrastructure here we introduce the resilience by design methodology for infrastructure design to incorporate both the ability to manage short term shocks and surprises and to accommodate long term trends the methodology follows a decision making under deep uncertainty framework that addresses the implications of our limited ability to correctly predict future conditions while the approach is a significant advance for the resilience design literature perhaps our more significant contribution is the expression of an objective to achieve acceptable and enduring performance over previously untenable time frames our belief is the resilience by design approach may help to fundamentally change the design of infrastructure to address urgent challenges of navigating uncertain climate and earth system futures mathematical and empirical experimentation will be required to test and refine this hypothesis some of which we have undertaken in related work 13 it is the authors hope that this contribution will inspire further applications to design for a resilient future acknowledgments this work was supported by grants 2017 fwc 202 and 2018 gpo 017 from the rockefeller foundation the authors are also grateful for the generous support provided by the resilience shift for this work the paper was greatly improved by the efforts of two anonymous reviewers 
20148,urban systems are embedded within and thereby reliant upon the complex systems of their surrounding watersheds building the freshwater resilience of urban systems therefore hinges on building the freshwater resilience of the larger human hydrological systems within which they are nested this consideration creates a system of feedbacks and tradeoffs which are critical to the resilience of the system as well as complex to manage from both hydrological and institutional perspectives there are few pragmatic examples within the literature of how to plan for freshwater resilience in urban hydrological systems this article shows an example of the freshwater resilience planning and investment prioritization process for the water supply of mexico city and the surrounding supply systems keywords resilience planning urban systems mexico 1 introduction the resilience of water systems is critical to urban resilience freshwater provisioning and regulating services e g water supply water quality and flood regulation play a major role in shaping urban vulnerabilities to the stresses and shocks of global change in the modern era 1 4 moreover cities have an outsized influence on the resilience of freshwater systems spurring transformations from natural to highly managed systems in order to meet their needs this duality requires that we consider and manage hydrological and urban systems in interdependence accounting for complex feedbacks and uncertainties by most accounts conventional urban water management has proven to be ill suited to achieving the goal of sustainability despite longstanding recognition of urban systems as a collection of nested systems both within and beyond the physical limits of a single city 5 7 water management shortcomings are commonly attributed to physical and institutional siloing of urban water systems 1 the need for integrated approaches to urban water management is only increasing as urban system complexity and interdependence also increases 8 a growing body of work on resilience based approaches provides a potentially useful framing for water resources planning and management for urban water systems under uncertainty 9 13 resilience in the broad context of natural resource management has been defined in a multitude of ways by the ecological and engineering communities 14 19 urban resilience specifically has become an important area of focused inquiry as global urbanization trends continue meerow and colleagues provide a recent review of urban resilience highlighting predominating inconsistencies in its interpretation and enumerating several conceptual tensions among current applications 12 elmqvist and colleagues provide a useful way forward by introducing a framework which addresses current conceptual ambiguities in the policy and research communities and propose streamlined interpretations of urban sustainability and resilience 20 the authors distinguish urban sustainability as a normative concept representing societal preferences urban resilience is then framed as a non normative trait of a system which can maintain function under disturbance we consider this to be largely congruent to the capabilities based framing provided in boltz et al 2019 which specifies resilience capabilities of a system as being manifested in the system s identity its components their configuration and interactions which enables it under disturbance to maintain coherent function within an expected range of variation this capabilities framing is readily applicable to quantitative resilience planning through the adoption of a performance based approach where desired function can be measured as target performance level for water supply allocation within a system for societally defined sustainability objectives e g social ecological and economic though there are many urban resilience applications in individual cities 21 and the inclusion of spatial and temporal scale considerations are emerging e g 22 applications of quantitative performance based resilience planning exercises in urban systems across scales are limited considering the case of mexico city s water system we introduce a novel approach joining human hydrologic modeling and stakeholder engagement for freshwater resilience planning under uncertainty across scales we apply the resilience by design process proposed by brown et al 2019 to a coupled model of the cutzamala human hydrologic system to solve for the water supply sustainability objectives of local residents and decision makers in the greater metropolitan supply system of mexico city gmss we demonstrate the need to consider urban areas as nested systems within the broader freshwater systems that supply them finally we consider the importance of participatory performance based approaches for resilience planning of water resources systems under uncertainty to our knowledge this represents the first time that water resources analysis and planning for mexico city has addressed the urban system coupled with the hydrological systems upon which it relies 2 resilience planning reuniting engineering and ecological resilience holling s use of the word versus in his oft cited publication engineering resilience versus ecological resilience 16 points to a customary distinction between the two communities framing of the concept engineering approaches to resilience focus on measurement and design for an engineered system s recovery from a state of failure with little consideration of process or system complexity e g 14 23 25 social ecological resilience approaches emphasize system complexity and importance of participatory processes with less emphasis on design and measurement e g 26 29 a key distinction to underscore here is the role of stakeholders social ecological resilience approaches emphasize participatory processes and cogeneration of knowledge 26 29 participation is also a key tenet of the related field of adaptive water resources management and governance 30 33 which generally strives to promote the ability of water systems to recover and to adjust to change 34 synergistic to this is the emergent emphasis in environmental decision making on the need to move beyond basic participatory approaches and knowledge transfer to co creation of knowledge 34 in the science policy society interface knowledge co generation is of particular relevance to climate assessments and scenario planning e g 35 37 indeed such approaches may prove essential for dynamic multi scale systems such as urban water systems where co production of knowledge translation and even negotiation across scales may be fundamental to addressing historically intractable problems 38 although the importance of stakeholders in participatory modeling and planning has a long tradition in the water resources engineering community 39 41 this has not been emphasized in related resilience engineering literature which has instead largely centered around performance metrics and measurement e g 14 23 25 in prevailing water resources planning and management studies resilience metrics are utilitized to measure system performance through simulation or as an explicit objective to decide among actions which may improve system performance through optimization the selection of a resilience metric is dependent on the application itself and on decision maker preferences 10 14 our effort to merge these traditionally divergent approaches of the engineering and social ecological communities is novel within the literature beyond mere novelty however we are inspired by the need to merge these communities and co create knowledge of how to plan and manage for resilience in the coupled human hydrological systems in which both approaches are important 3 water in mexico city and the greater metropolitan supply system water management in mexico city has a long and complex history of co evolution the city s very founding relied upon managing water resources and risks related to flooding and urban drainage in 1324 the aztec city of tecnochtitlan was built on lake texcoco permanently tying its fate to climate and water risks 42 groundwater management in particular has long been a challenge in the mexico city metropolitan area mcma 43 44 over abstraction of the aquifer and resulting land subsidence has been documented since the early 1900s 45 in recent decades the ability of the current water supply system to meet future demand has been mcma s utmost concern given restrictions in service coverage and unabated demand from a greater metropolitan population expected to grow from 22 to about 29 million by 2030 46 water management solutions to date have centered on supply side investments that are often economically socially and environmentally costly 47 48 water related risks in mcma have been widely documented e g 49 50 recent and important efforts have been made by researchers to advance understanding of water related vulnerability within mcma through improving the understanding of intraurban dynamics such as neighborhood scale agency in hydrological risk management 51 lerner et al interviewed land use planning and water management officials in mcma to identify governance gaps in decision making revealing the importance of including informal institutions in efforts to reduce water related vulnerability 52 in an overview of 700 years of water management and infrastructure development in metropolitan mexico city another study examines decision cycles for public infrastructure planning related to hydrologic risk stressing the influence of current decisions on future risks 53 though these studies reference external water sources cutzamala and lerma basins water resources planning work to date has been largely confined within city limits our current work complements these efforts expanding beyond the city limits for an integrated assessment of the broader water system and incorporating social and environmental objectives all of which we believe to be critical for sound water system planning and management mexico city s present day water supply comes from a variety of sources that form three main water subsystems the alto lerma and cutzamala systems to the west of the city and the mexico city mcma system see fig 1 and table 1 together these comprise the greater metropolitan supply system gmss the alto lerma basin has served as an important source of water for mexico city mcma since 1942 54 initially the water provided to mcma was drawn from streams in 1951 growing demand and diminishing surface water availability prompted the development of a system of pumps for groundwater extraction to satisfy needs in mcma and in the alto lerma basin subsequent aquifer over abstraction in the basin has resulted in land subsidence and groundwater depletion 55 56 an urbanizing local population and rapid growth in water demand from industry and commercial agriculture have required that the lerma system supply less water to mcma about 10 of mcma s total supply at present spanning the states of michoacán and méxico the cutzamala system provides approximately 30 of mcma s water supply on average its system of reservoirs provides a storage capacity of around 1 2 years of historical supply provisions to mcma making the system particularly vulnerable to long term drought this vulnerability was exposed in 2007 2009 and again in 2011 2013 when droughts led to the curtailment of large allocations of water traditionally provided to local irrigators and up to a 36 reduction in the monthly volume historically delivered to mcma in the mexico city system mcma water is drawn directly from the mexico city aquifer through wells within the city and well fields outside of the city notably the barrientos caldera and chiconautla systems water is distributed through a complex network of pipes that are operated by opening and closing valves and storage tank operations throughout the system 57 significant portions of the population experience intermittent water supply or do not have connections to the piped network and rely heavily on trucked water pipas 58 losses across the network exceed 40 of the total water supply to mcma from these three sub systems 59 4 methods 4 1 resilience planning an engineering and social ecological approach planning for resilience of a system may be broken into a series of questions resilience of what to what for whom and what can be done answering these questions requires both an understanding of the system dynamics and of the values of the managers and stakeholders themselves our approach to resilience planning for water supply in the gmss fig 2 integrates decision making under deep uncertainty frameworks e g 2 61 63 and a stakeholder centric resilience assessment process proposed in the social ecological resilience literature 29 in a five step stakeholder driven analytical process the following section outlines the generalized stakeholder process for co produced understanding and assessment of the gmss that accompanies quantitative modeling following approaches of brown et al and poff et al 10 63 addressing the question resilience of what steps 1 to 3 of fig 2 involves defining relevant subsystems and building coupled human hydrologic models of the system 64 subsystems were chosen based on physical attributes of the system and jurisdictional divisions in water management this geographic scale of analysis reflects both physical risks hydrologic and infrastructure and the scope of actors and institutions that may affect change within the system the modeling process requires multiple iterations with stakeholders in order to ensure quality and credibility the next two steps of the process integrate engineering and social ecological approaches following performance based measures of resilience common in engineering while incorporating social ecological and economic sustainability objectives stakeholders in each subsystem define performance targets that represent their values and serve as viable indicators of water system function e g water supply measures of resilience are based on how well the system performs under stress and recovers from failure to achieve those targets in this study we consider the magnitude duration and volume of water deficit as measures of system resilience in terms of persistence and adaptability performance based metric framing allows us to directly measure resilience in terms of system function water supply rather than describing resilience according to system traits e g connectivity redundancy this enables a more objective measurement of water system resilience as revealed by its ability to persist in its function under disturbance 9 specific disturbances are addressed in step 4 of the process stakeholder defined performance targets and thus our resilience metrics represent value judgements necessitating an important additional consideration for whom central to social ecological resilience 65 preferences commonly derive from cultural values and social political and economic dynamics making the selection of who is in the room and how the conversation is managed critical factors in defining resilience metrics for the present analysis we identified stakeholder preferences by involving affected communities water users and decision makers throughout the resilience diagnosis and design process considering the question resilience to what step 4 begins by identifying the stresses and shocks or uncertainties that affect each subsystem our analysis follows advances in bottom up approaches for assessing system vulnerability across multiple plausible futures e g 2 60 63 66 69 robustness measures are used to evaluate resilience performance metrics across relevant uncertainties and associated futures these measures characterize the system s ability to persist adapt and transform to be resilient answering the question what can be done step 5 is the ultimate goal of the rbd process 10 this requires an analysis of the system s sensitivity to the uncertainties defined in the prior step as well as an evaluation of how different actions may affect system performance multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moea are used to explore the performance of alternative system configurations e g infrastructure and decision variables e g operating rules the approach combines rigorous modeling with revealed stakeholder preferences in order to examine human hydrological system resilience design options meeting alternative performance objectives under specified stressors or uncertainties the analysis may be conducted across all subsystems and in the aggregate addressing interdependencies among nested systems comprising the gmss our analysis below focuses on the cutzamala subsystem as a critical element representing that nested interdependency of the gmss 4 2 case study the cutzamala resilience by design analysis employs a human hydrologic model 64 to evaluate the performance of alternative design options aiming to improve the persistence and adaptability of water deliveries to mcma across multiple climate futures climate uncertainty was explored through a simulation of system performance under varied temperature and precipitation scenarios table 2 climate time series were generated for change intervals of 0 5 c and 10 precipitation for a period of 62 years using the approach outlined in 70 elicitation of stakeholder preferences informing the resilience by design rbd analysis for the gmss was conducted in a series of eleven workshops in the alto lerma basin cutzamala system and mexico city systems over a two year period thirty four institutions participated providing representation from private and public sector academic institutions and civil society stakeholders some participants joined multiple workshops to ensure an exchange of information and perspectives among the subsystems additional details on the process are outlined in appendix a following the framework detailed in hassenforder et al 71 the robustness of alternative design options in the cutzamala system table 3 is evaluated relative to four resilience metrics mean failure magnitude duration volume deficit and reliability robustness is calculated as the mean performance across all temperature and precipitation scenarios per laplace s principle of insufficient reason 72 73 the robustness quantification method provides a consistent means of comparison without designating performance thresholds which can be variable in time finally interdependencies among the subsystems were explored by comparing cutzamala system investments and additional mcma interventions that emerged from stakeholder consultations table 3 5 results and discussion 5 1 resilience by design an application for resilience planning of the cutzamala system our analysis of the performance reliability of cutzamala water supply to mcma across multiple climate futures reveals that without an increase in average precipitation the cutzamala system will not be able to maintain reliable water delivery to mexico city by 2050 fig 3 accordingly additional options are imperative to meeting mcma water demands performance values and rankings of selected infrastructure investment options relative to their robustness in meeting the target water delivery to mcma are listed in table 4 results show that options providing increased storage capacity are the highest ranked relative to objectives of improving of reliability and mean failure duration the importance of the choice of preferred resilience capabilities and metrics is demonstrated by the variation in ranking among design options particularly between metrics related to failure duration and magnitude the higher variation in the values of some metrics e g failure volumes suggests that certain metrics may be more effective for differentiating between options which may appear to have the same of similar performance for others metrics i e reducing the number of non dominated options to select from less variation in performance is exhibited for failure magnitude and reliability which both fail to distinguish differences in system performance amongst three of the options the seeming anomaly whereby some options appear to have minimal performance benefits while others decrease system performance relative to inaction relates to two factors first system reoperation is required when new infrastructure is put in place additionally some of the design options e g tuxpan pump and irrigation aim to improve water supply for local irrigation rather than for mcma demonstrating the need to consider multiple performance targets for multiple user groups in order to fully assesses the performance impacts of certain options 5 2 the greater metropolitan supply system as an integrated system a comparison of cutzamala and mcma intervention costs and yields under current climate conditions offers a basis to explore connections and interdependencies among subsystems within the gmss the results in fig 4 show that yield cost ratios vary among design options and between subsystems where the investment is to take place this reveals important differences in efficiencies and resilience outcomes within sub systems while also suggesting important gains that may be derived from managing the gmss as an integrated system individual infrastructure investment projects in the cutzamala system have the potential to increase water supply to mcma by up to 3 m3 s under historic climate conditions while significant these gains are equal or inferior to the volume that could be saved through leak reduction in mcma or through artificial aquifer recharge these results suggest that on the basis of cost effectiveness alone there are benefits to considering investments across the gmss thereby demonstrating the importance of designing for resilience of the integrated gmss system as opposed to three distinct subsystems by extension it is likely that the inclusions of additional resilience metrics to evaluate investments in all three subsystems will lead to an increased understanding tradeoffs and interdependencies throughout the integrated system 5 3 the importance of participation in resilience planning the resilience by design process for water supply in the gmss revealed consistent stakeholder preferences for social and economic performance targets in the alto lerma cutzamala and mcma subsystems table 5 economic targets are approximated as service delivery requirements for domestic agricultural and industrial sectors social targets revealed strong stakeholder preferences for maximizing equity in water allocation among users and user groups in mcma this reflected concerns with distributional inequity particularly related to how shortages are distributed across socio economic classes in the city in the case of alto lerma and cutzamala the issue of equity is manifested as discrepancies between formal agreements and actual water consumption among users selection of environmental targets in each subsystem was guided by stakeholder preference and expert opinion priority environmental concerns included depletion of natural aquifer reserves and resulting land subsidence in the highly stressed mcma and alto lerma systems while surface flow requirements were of principal concern in cutzamala where the main drivers of

uncertainties are consistent with those revealed in recent research on perceived causes of hydrological risk in the region 52 proposed interventions included public policy green and grey infrastructure operations and stewardship activities tables 3 and 5 despite the diversity of proposed actions and roles stakeholders emphasized common objectives across the three subsystems suggesting a strong preference for collective action on solutions for the system as a whole and not merely within each discrete subsystem stakeholder perceptions of the linkages between uncertainties to specific performance targets revealed a clear difference in local and system wide understanding of water resilience stresses suggesting that critical system interdependencies are poorly understood or not prioritized fig 5 while stakeholders readily characterized the perceived effects of uncertainties on performance targets within each subsystem the effects of uncertainties in one subsystem on performance targets in other subsystems and on the system as a whole were not clearly recognized similarly stakeholders did not emphasize the influence of relevant uncertainties on social performance targets we attribute this not to a lack of effect rather to limited knowledge or prioritization of the relationship between social targets and water system shocks and stresses 6 conclusions our application of the resilience by design approach 10 to mexico city and the gmss revealed value in the resilience planning process itself as a means of systematically assessing and developing a shared vision of objectives and stressors for the water resources of the region as has been noted in other studies overlap dependence between resilience metrics is important and requires additional mathematical evaluation for the system of interest 75 particularly for understanding which metrics will be computationally meaningful in a multi objective framework evaluation of selected metrics in the cutzamala system alone demonstrates the need to further understand the relationship between these metrics particularly in complex multi reservoir non linear systems furthermore the calculation of resilience to what i e robustness requires careful consideration of how robustness is measured as it may also have implications for the evaluation of design options and related investment risk and return 73 inclusion of the full nested urban system in the planning and prioritization process allows a better understanding of relevant tradeoffs enabling more critical prioritization of design options and investments with the larger integrated system our evaluation of the cutzamala system and mcma design alternatives further revealed the vital importance of physical and operational interdependencies between the city and the human hydrologic systems it is nested within for example the benefits of artificial recharge in mexico city could be offset by a failure to protect natural recharge of the same aquifer i e investing in policies and projects to improve and or sustain natural recharge while there are viable resilience solutions that meet performance targets for mcma alone building resilience for mcma and the gmss as a whole requires integration and resolution of tradeoffs across all subsystems this is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that urban water security itself is reliant on planning for water security across all water systems and source areas a full articulation and analysis of benefits and tradeoffs in designing for system wide resilience in the gmss requires further exploration the framework presented here provides a foundation for a comprehensive resilience analysis of the coupled alto lerma cutzamala and mexico city systems to better understand the risks faced resilience measures within each subsystem their influence on system wide resilience and options for managing tradeoffs between different risks and management goals similarities in stakeholder identification of performance targets and uncertainties throughout the gmss offer a positive sign that a common vision or at least a similar vision exists for the future of water resources in the region as social aspects of water system resilience are of great importance to gmss stakeholders investment decisions cannot be reached solely through an engineering optimization of system components and configuration relative to performance targets the choice between investing in supply side infrastructure in cutzamala versus system efficiency in mexico city is not merely a matter of which system configuration provides more water at a given cost but also of who gets the water and when what types of interventions will be successful at addressing water supply equity issues must also be understood and factored into water system design furthermore while solutions in one region may provide more per capita water they may also be harder to implement due to issues of agency amongst the involved actors consequently policy institutional regulatory and decentralized interventions that directly affect the distribution of water must also be understood and

20148,urban systems are embedded within and thereby reliant upon the complex systems of their surrounding watersheds building the freshwater resilience of urban systems therefore hinges on building the freshwater resilience of the larger human hydrological systems within which they are nested this consideration creates a system of feedbacks and tradeoffs which are critical to the resilience of the system as well as complex to manage from both hydrological and institutional perspectives there are few pragmatic examples within the literature of how to plan for freshwater resilience in urban hydrological systems this article shows an example of the freshwater resilience planning and investment prioritization process for the water supply of mexico city and the surrounding supply systems keywords resilience planning urban systems mexico 1 introduction the resilience of water systems is critical to urban resilience freshwater provisioning and regulating services e g water supply water quality and flood regulation play a major role in shaping urban vulnerabilities to the stresses and shocks of global change in the modern era 1 4 moreover cities have an outsized influence on the resilience of freshwater systems spurring transformations from natural to highly managed systems in order to meet their needs this duality requires that we consider and manage hydrological and urban systems in interdependence accounting for complex feedbacks and uncertainties by most accounts conventional urban water management has proven to be ill suited to achieving the goal of sustainability despite longstanding recognition of urban systems as a collection of nested systems both within and beyond the physical limits of a single city 5 7 water management shortcomings are commonly attributed to physical and institutional siloing of urban water systems 1 the need for integrated approaches to urban water management is only increasing as urban system complexity and interdependence also increases 8 a growing body of work on resilience based approaches provides a potentially useful framing for water resources planning and management for urban water systems under uncertainty 9 13 resilience in the broad context of natural resource management has been defined in a multitude of ways by the ecological and engineering communities 14 19 urban resilience specifically has become an important area of focused inquiry as global urbanization trends continue meerow and colleagues provide a recent review of urban resilience highlighting predominating inconsistencies in its interpretation and enumerating several conceptual tensions among current applications 12 elmqvist and colleagues provide a useful way forward by introducing a framework which addresses current conceptual ambiguities in the policy and research communities and propose streamlined interpretations of urban sustainability and resilience 20 the authors distinguish urban sustainability as a normative concept representing societal preferences urban resilience is then framed as a non normative trait of a system which can maintain function under disturbance we consider this to be largely congruent to the capabilities based framing provided in boltz et al 2019 which specifies resilience capabilities of a system as being manifested in the system s identity its components their configuration and interactions which enables it under disturbance to maintain coherent function within an expected range of variation this capabilities framing is readily applicable to quantitative resilience planning through the adoption of a performance based approach where desired function can be measured as target performance level for water supply allocation within a system for societally defined sustainability objectives e g social ecological and economic though there are many urban resilience applications in individual cities 21 and the inclusion of spatial and temporal scale considerations are emerging e g 22 applications of quantitative performance based resilience planning exercises in urban systems across scales are limited considering the case of mexico city s water system we introduce a novel approach joining human hydrologic modeling and stakeholder engagement for freshwater resilience planning under uncertainty across scales we apply the resilience by design process proposed by brown et al 2019 to a coupled model of the cutzamala human hydrologic system to solve for the water supply sustainability objectives of local residents and decision makers in the greater metropolitan supply system of mexico city gmss we demonstrate the need to consider urban areas as nested systems within the broader freshwater systems that supply them finally we consider the importance of participatory performance based approaches for resilience planning of water resources systems under uncertainty to our knowledge this represents the first time that water resources analysis and planning for mexico city has addressed the urban system coupled with the hydrological systems upon which it relies 2 resilience planning reuniting engineering and ecological resilience holling s use of the word versus in his oft cited publication engineering resilience versus ecological resilience 16 points to a customary distinction between the two communities framing of the concept engineering approaches to resilience focus on measurement and design for an engineered system s recovery from a state of failure with little consideration of process or system complexity e g 14 23 25 social ecological resilience approaches emphasize system complexity and importance of participatory processes with less emphasis on design and measurement e g 26 29 a key distinction to underscore here is the role of stakeholders social ecological resilience approaches emphasize participatory processes and cogeneration of knowledge 26 29 participation is also a key tenet of the related field of adaptive water resources management and governance 30 33 which generally strives to promote the ability of water systems to recover and to adjust to change 34 synergistic to this is the emergent emphasis in environmental decision making on the need to move beyond basic participatory approaches and knowledge transfer to co creation of knowledge 34 in the science policy society interface knowledge co generation is of particular relevance to climate assessments and scenario planning e g 35 37 indeed such approaches may prove essential for dynamic multi scale systems such as urban water systems where co production of knowledge translation and even negotiation across scales may be fundamental to addressing historically intractable problems 38 although the importance of stakeholders in participatory modeling and planning has a long tradition in the water resources engineering community 39 41 this has not been emphasized in related resilience engineering literature which has instead largely centered around performance metrics and measurement e g 14 23 25 in prevailing water resources planning and management studies resilience metrics are utilitized to measure system performance through simulation or as an explicit objective to decide among actions which may improve system performance through optimization the selection of a resilience metric is dependent on the application itself and on decision maker preferences 10 14 our effort to merge these traditionally divergent approaches of the engineering and social ecological communities is novel within the literature beyond mere novelty however we are inspired by the need to merge these communities and co create knowledge of how to plan and manage for resilience in the coupled human hydrological systems in which both approaches are important 3 water in mexico city and the greater metropolitan supply system water management in mexico city has a long and complex history of co evolution the city s very founding relied upon managing water resources and risks related to flooding and urban drainage in 1324 the aztec city of tecnochtitlan was built on lake texcoco permanently tying its fate to climate and water risks 42 groundwater management in particular has long been a challenge in the mexico city metropolitan area mcma 43 44 over abstraction of the aquifer and resulting land subsidence has been documented since the early 1900s 45 in recent decades the ability of the current water supply system to meet future demand has been mcma s utmost concern given restrictions in service coverage and unabated demand from a greater metropolitan population expected to grow from 22 to about 29 million by 2030 46 water management solutions to date have centered on supply side investments that are often economically socially and environmentally costly 47 48 water related risks in mcma have been widely documented e g 49 50 recent and important efforts have been made by researchers to advance understanding of water related vulnerability within mcma through improving the understanding of intraurban dynamics such as neighborhood scale agency in hydrological risk management 51 lerner et al interviewed land use planning and water management officials in mcma to identify governance gaps in decision making revealing the importance of including informal institutions in efforts to reduce water related vulnerability 52 in an overview of 700 years of water management and infrastructure development in metropolitan mexico city another study examines decision cycles for public infrastructure planning related to hydrologic risk stressing the influence of current decisions on future risks 53 though these studies reference external water sources cutzamala and lerma basins water resources planning work to date has been largely confined within city limits our current work complements these efforts expanding beyond the city limits for an integrated assessment of the broader water system and incorporating social and environmental objectives all of which we believe to be critical for sound water system planning and management mexico city s present day water supply comes from a variety of sources that form three main water subsystems the alto lerma and cutzamala systems to the west of the city and the mexico city mcma system see fig 1 and table 1 together these comprise the greater metropolitan supply system gmss the alto lerma basin has served as an important source of water for mexico city mcma since 1942 54 initially the water provided to mcma was drawn from streams in 1951 growing demand and diminishing surface water availability prompted the development of a system of pumps for groundwater extraction to satisfy needs in mcma and in the alto lerma basin subsequent aquifer over abstraction in the basin has resulted in land subsidence and groundwater depletion 55 56 an urbanizing local population and rapid growth in water demand from industry and commercial agriculture have required that the lerma system supply less water to mcma about 10 of mcma s total supply at present spanning the states of michoacán and méxico the cutzamala system provides approximately 30 of mcma s water supply on average its system of reservoirs provides a storage capacity of around 1 2 years of historical supply provisions to mcma making the system particularly vulnerable to long term drought this vulnerability was exposed in 2007 2009 and again in 2011 2013 when droughts led to the curtailment of large allocations of water traditionally provided to local irrigators and up to a 36 reduction in the monthly volume historically delivered to mcma in the mexico city system mcma water is drawn directly from the mexico city aquifer through wells within the city and well fields outside of the city notably the barrientos caldera and chiconautla systems water is distributed through a complex network of pipes that are operated by opening and closing valves and storage tank operations throughout the system 57 significant portions of the population experience intermittent water supply or do not have connections to the piped network and rely heavily on trucked water pipas 58 losses across the network exceed 40 of the total water supply to mcma from these three sub systems 59 4 methods 4 1 resilience planning an engineering and social ecological approach planning for resilience of a system may be broken into a series of questions resilience of what to what for whom and what can be done answering these questions requires both an understanding of the system dynamics and of the values of the managers and stakeholders themselves our approach to resilience planning for water supply in the gmss fig 2 integrates decision making under deep uncertainty frameworks e g 2 61 63 and a stakeholder centric resilience assessment process proposed in the social ecological resilience literature 29 in a five step stakeholder driven analytical process the following section outlines the generalized stakeholder process for co produced understanding and assessment of the gmss that accompanies quantitative modeling following approaches of brown et al and poff et al 10 63 addressing the question resilience of what steps 1 to 3 of fig 2 involves defining relevant subsystems and building coupled human hydrologic models of the system 64 subsystems were chosen based on physical attributes of the system and jurisdictional divisions in water management this geographic scale of analysis reflects both physical risks hydrologic and infrastructure and the scope of actors and institutions that may affect change within the system the modeling process requires multiple iterations with stakeholders in order to ensure quality and credibility the next two steps of the process integrate engineering and social ecological approaches following performance based measures of resilience common in engineering while incorporating social ecological and economic sustainability objectives stakeholders in each subsystem define performance targets that represent their values and serve as viable indicators of water system function e g water supply measures of resilience are based on how well the system performs under stress and recovers from failure to achieve those targets in this study we consider the magnitude duration and volume of water deficit as measures of system resilience in terms of persistence and adaptability performance based metric framing allows us to directly measure resilience in terms of system function water supply rather than describing resilience according to system traits e g connectivity redundancy this enables a more objective measurement of water system resilience as revealed by its ability to persist in its function under disturbance 9 specific disturbances are addressed in step 4 of the process stakeholder defined performance targets and thus our resilience metrics represent value judgements necessitating an important additional consideration for whom central to social ecological resilience 65 preferences commonly derive from cultural values and social political and economic dynamics making the selection of who is in the room and how the conversation is managed critical factors in defining resilience metrics for the present analysis we identified stakeholder preferences by involving affected communities water users and decision makers throughout the resilience diagnosis and design process considering the question resilience to what step 4 begins by identifying the stresses and shocks or uncertainties that affect each subsystem our analysis follows advances in bottom up approaches for assessing system vulnerability across multiple plausible futures e g 2 60 63 66 69 robustness measures are used to evaluate resilience performance metrics across relevant uncertainties and associated futures these measures characterize the system s ability to persist adapt and transform to be resilient answering the question what can be done step 5 is the ultimate goal of the rbd process 10 this requires an analysis of the system s sensitivity to the uncertainties defined in the prior step as well as an evaluation of how different actions may affect system performance multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moea are used to explore the performance of alternative system configurations e g infrastructure and decision variables e g operating rules the approach combines rigorous modeling with revealed stakeholder preferences in order to examine human hydrological system resilience design options meeting alternative performance objectives under specified stressors or uncertainties the analysis may be conducted across all subsystems and in the aggregate addressing interdependencies among nested systems comprising the gmss our analysis below focuses on the cutzamala subsystem as a critical element representing that nested interdependency of the gmss 4 2 case study the cutzamala resilience by design analysis employs a human hydrologic model 64 to evaluate the performance of alternative design options aiming to improve the persistence and adaptability of water deliveries to mcma across multiple climate futures climate uncertainty was explored through a simulation of system performance under varied temperature and precipitation scenarios table 2 climate time series were generated for change intervals of 0 5 c and 10 precipitation for a period of 62 years using the approach outlined in 70 elicitation of stakeholder preferences informing the resilience by design rbd analysis for the gmss was conducted in a series of eleven workshops in the alto lerma basin cutzamala system and mexico city systems over a two year period thirty four institutions participated providing representation from private and public sector academic institutions and civil society stakeholders some participants joined multiple workshops to ensure an exchange of information and perspectives among the subsystems additional details on the process are outlined in appendix a following the framework detailed in hassenforder et al 71 the robustness of alternative design options in the cutzamala system table 3 is evaluated relative to four resilience metrics mean failure magnitude duration volume deficit and reliability robustness is calculated as the mean performance across all temperature and precipitation scenarios per laplace s principle of insufficient reason 72 73 the robustness quantification method provides a consistent means of comparison without designating performance thresholds which can be variable in time finally interdependencies among the subsystems were explored by comparing cutzamala system investments and additional mcma interventions that emerged from stakeholder consultations table 3 5 results and discussion 5 1 resilience by design an application for resilience planning of the cutzamala system our analysis of the performance reliability of cutzamala water supply to mcma across multiple climate futures reveals that without an increase in average precipitation the cutzamala system will not be able to maintain reliable water delivery to mexico city by 2050 fig 3 accordingly additional options are imperative to meeting mcma water demands performance values and rankings of selected infrastructure investment options relative to their robustness in meeting the target water delivery to mcma are listed in table 4 results show that options providing increased storage capacity are the highest ranked relative to objectives of improving of reliability and mean failure duration the importance of the choice of preferred resilience capabilities and metrics is demonstrated by the variation in ranking among design options particularly between metrics related to failure duration and magnitude the higher variation in the values of some metrics e g failure volumes suggests that certain metrics may be more effective for differentiating between options which may appear to have the same of similar performance for others metrics i e reducing the number of non dominated options to select from less variation in performance is exhibited for failure magnitude and reliability which both fail to distinguish differences in system performance amongst three of the options the seeming anomaly whereby some options appear to have minimal performance benefits while others decrease system performance relative to inaction relates to two factors first system reoperation is required when new infrastructure is put in place additionally some of the design options e g tuxpan pump and irrigation aim to improve water supply for local irrigation rather than for mcma demonstrating the need to consider multiple performance targets for multiple user groups in order to fully assesses the performance impacts of certain options 5 2 the greater metropolitan supply system as an integrated system a comparison of cutzamala and mcma intervention costs and yields under current climate conditions offers a basis to explore connections and interdependencies among subsystems within the gmss the results in fig 4 show that yield cost ratios vary among design options and between subsystems where the investment is to take place this reveals important differences in efficiencies and resilience outcomes within sub systems while also suggesting important gains that may be derived from managing the gmss as an integrated system individual infrastructure investment

20149,resilience is a topic of extensive academic discourse as its relevance is elevated in response to climate change there is limited research into the concept of resilience from the perspective of those in fields of practice to address this gap we conducted fieldwork in four cities to ask for perspectives on what enables cities to cope with water related shocks and stresses based on analysis of interview responses and focus group discussions we propose key characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity necessary for urban water resilience we discuss findings in the context of evidence gathered in the field and prevalent work in current water resilience literature it is our hope that this work may provide insights into the critically important human dimensions necessary for a shift towards resilience as a prevailing paradigm for urban water management 1 introduction there is growing acknowledgement that the lack of progress towards climate mitigation targets and the irreversible legacy of past greenhouse gas emissions necessitate an acceleration of adaptation efforts globally water resources management is at the heart of this challenge with many of the implications of climate change likely to be experienced through impacts on the hydrologic cycle 9 as the world s urban population continues to boom cities will feel the impact of such crises most acutely many recent and high profile examples from cape town california and sao paulo highlight the significant economic societal and environmental consequences of a lack of preparedness 1 44 47 50 urban water managers as the stewards of this fundamental resource face the complex task of planning for the future under a confluence of highly uncertain socioeconomic and climatic conditions despite an increasing abundance of information guidance and efforts towards the development of adaptation plans implementation of adaptation actions remains elusive 49 under the rational choice model water resource managers can be assumed to make decisions that optimise performance based on a search for information and selection of the best alternative 65 despite the prominence of the rational choice model 61 strides in the psychology and behavioural economics literature over recent decades show the important role that heuristic rules 28 defined as an intuitive rapid and automatic system of judgement 67 play in human behaviour these heuristics or rules of thumb show how prejudice personal experience and knowledge and the way information is presented all have a profound effect on how we perceive risk and make decisions 73 73 we know that people show a reluctance to move from the status quo and adopt innovations even in the face of overwhelming evidence 39 64 61 62 thus motivating behaviour that leads to resilience actions requires a better understanding of the perspectives of those taking action over the past 10 years growing appreciation of the diversity and scale of urban hazards the complexity of cities and the uncertainty associated with climate change globalisation and urbanisation has emphasised the importance of moving beyond risk management to building resilience 8 we define resilience here as the ability of the system to persist adapt and transform pat when conditions require 14 25 the concept of urban water resilience relates to building these characteristics persistence adaptability and transformability in order to manage water related chronic stresses or sudden shocks that threaten widespread disruption or the collapse of physical or social systems 6 human systems at all scales are characterized by a dynamic interplay between social ecological and technological factors 11 46 a large part of society s ability to manage for resilience lies in the capital stock derived from its actors social networks and institutions and the interactions that occur between them 42 70 as such assessing and enhancing the adaptive capacity of such actors social networks and institutions is critical to building resilience resilience scholars frequently promote adaptive governance as a strategy to enhance the adaptability and flexibility of socio ecological systems 2 3 11 21 26 58 at its essence adaptive governance expands upon resource management to include social components as central to the adaptive management of complex systems 5 18 21 26 commonly cited attributes of adaptive governance include participation collaboration polycentric and multi layered decision making accountability and transparency deliberative and nested 4 22 24 26 27 30 42 52 54 55 57 60 70 71 despite considerable recognition of adaptive governance as strategy to mitigate against the deep uncertainty presented by climate change water managers urban policy makers and practitioners often face the central challenge of translating the concept of adaptive governance and resilience into tangible and practical implementation jimenez et al 35 argue that one must focus on embedding key attributes of adaptive governance such as those cited above in the delivery of core functions of water governance for resilience planning and preparedness policy and strategy disaster response and recovery measures coordination capacity development financing regulations and monitoring evaluation in addition the values of stakeholders taking part in governance processes the capacity of those stakeholders and institutions and the amount of available resources influences how successful one will be in operationalising the priniciples of adaptive governance many studies have sought to characterise human social and organisational resilience through qualitative empirical research 12 15 19 45 48 63 66 few studies extend this approach to consider human social and governance dimensions of resilience conjunctively the city resilience index arup 7 provides the closest example to the present work in this case data from 91 interviews and 38 focus group discussions across six cities concepción cali cape town new orleans semarang and surat was used to articulate a definition of urban resilience and indicators and metrics that allow one to measure the resilience of any city 8 key themes of resilience that were identified and relevant to this study include equity and inclusiveness consultative planning appropriate land use and zoning comprehensive city monitoring and data management effective coordination with other government bodies and proactive multi stakeholder collaboration although there are some areas of overlap with this work the research focus in the case of the city resilience index was on urban resilience broadly and as such many of the themes identified were not directly relevant nor specific enough to the question of urban water resilience furthermore analysis was limited to the administrative boundary of the city whereas the work presented here considers the city within its hydrological context to our knowledge the present study is the only case of qualitative empirical research focussed on urban water resilience through this work we seek to begin bridging the gap between theory and practice through empirical investigation of stakeholder perspectives we interviewed people in four cities greater miami and the beaches mexico city cape town and kingston upon hull for their perspectives on what enables them to effectively deal with water related shocks and stresses in ordinary and extraordinary conditions based on analysis of interview responses and focus group discussions we propose key characteristics of human societal and governance capacity necessary for urban water resilience we discuss findings in the context of evidence gathered in the field and prevalent work in current water resilience discourse it is our hope that this work may provide insights into the critically important human dimensions necessary for a shift towards resilience as a prevailing paradigm for urban water management 2 methods this paper draws on data collected as part of a wider study of urban water resilience city water resilience approach 6 we undertook fieldwork in mexico city greater miami and the beaches cape town and hull between april and july 2018 engaging more than 700 stakeholders through 32 interviews 28 focus group discussions 10 workshops and 13 site visits see table 1 for summary of engagement the aim of the research was to understand local perspectives on urban water resilience in semi structured interviews and focus group discussions 17 we asked participants to identify key water related shocks and stresses they face in their city and subsequently the things that help and hinder them in dealing with these shocks and stresses the structure of all focus group discussions and interviews was consistent in all cases workshops and site visits provided a useful forum in which to contextualise findings of interviews and focus group discussions but are not used directly in analysis presented here anecdotal evidence gathered throughout fieldwork is discussed in the context of empirical findings in the discussion we sought to select participants that would provide a representation of the diversity of professional specialisations within the water sector i e water wastewater and flooding as well as from interdependent sectors with an influence and interest in water i e emergency response planning environment community groups energy transport etc in addition we sought to engage stakeholders from across public private and civil society organisations fig 1 summarises the proportion of observations generated from each sub sector of public private and civil society data gathered through stakeholder engagement resulted in a master database of 1210 records each record representing a unique stakeholder observation of a factor that helped or hindered them in dealing with shocks and stresses they face in their city for the purposes of this analysis we examine a subset of this master database that represents the human societal and governance factors of resilience and accounts for 61 of the entire dataset of the 1210 records in the dataset we classified 742 records as human social or governance factors factors not included in analysis here relate to those that describe the role of infrastructure technology and the environment in enabling resilience the method of analysis is summarised in fig 2 and employs a joint emergent and a priori coding technique to identify key themes in the data 13 coding describes a process that involves constructing short labels that describe dissect and distil the data while preserving their essential properties 31 this process allows one to develop meaningful categories that can be analysed and interpreted in emergent thematic coding the coder identifies categories on the fly through the process of reviewing raw data and is drawn from grounded theory 29 69 this differs from a priori coding or template analysis 38 in which the coder defines categories before data is reviewed and each observation assigned its best fit 13 coupling a priori and emergent qualitative analytic methods enabled the work to build on previous research insights while also remaining open to the possibility of new themes revealed through data exploration initial coding of the raw data was first undertaken using emergent thematic coding through this process individual observations expressed by a stakeholder as positive or negative factor of resilience were aggregated into groups called themes that combined related factors for example the observation there is an annual storm drill prior to the start of hurricane season is assigned to the category effective disaster response and recovery plans although observations are expressed both in terms of factors that help positive factor or hinder negative factor the city in dealing with shocks and stresses themes are always expressed as positive contributions towards urban water resilience for example the factor migrant workers do not qualify for relief programmes is placed in the theme of equal provision of basic services this process resulted in 53 distinct themes in the next step 32 pre defined themes were introduced based on commonly cited attributes of resilience from the adaptive governance literature see introduction the raw data was then revisited and coded into one these 75 a priori themes 53 emergent themes and the 32 from the literature once initial classification is complete overlapping or redundant themes are combined or alternatively split into smaller groups where diverse factors were found within a single theme this process of consolidation from factor to theme was conducted iteratively until a set of themes was established that fairly represent all factors coded to them finally we grouped themes into goals by considering the likely outcome of realising each theme this process resulted in 38 distinct themes and 9 goals which we present in table 2 throughout the data analysis process a series of workshops took place with the researchers who conducted the fieldwork experts and city stakeholders to review and critique emerging themes and goals this included a convening of representatives from all four partner cities in london 3 results table 2 provides the themes and goals that are the result of the data analysis process and represent the characteristics of human societal and governance capacity necessary for urban water resilience based on the perspectives of stakeholders we engaged in mexico city miami cape town and kingston upon hull the most prevalent themes that emerged from the data are presented in fig 3 as those containing the highest proportion of the dataset when data is aggregated across all four cities for example effective regulation of land use and development contains 5 of the 742 human societal and governance factors whilst public education around water resilience issues is the most prevalent theme overall accounting for 11 of all factors this is significantly more than the next most prevalent theme 78 factors vs 50 for inclusive participation including vulnerable people at different stages of decision making processes the factors in public education around water resilience issues are largely split into two groups 1 the communication of risk how to use water responsibly and what to do in a crisis and 2 the communication of the value of resilience to build public support for resilience initiatives with the exception of cape town the six themes presented in fig 3 capture the top three most prevalent themes for each city in the case of cape town effective policies to minimize risk in vulnerable communities and accurate baseline data are the joint third most prevalent theme accounting for 6 of their city specific data when considering the total number of factors associated with each of the 9 goals as presented in fig 4 coordinated collaborative governance equity inclusiveness long term strategic vision and regulation accountability contain approximately 110 factors each 15 empowered stakeholders captures the largest proportion of the dataset with 151 factors 20 which also translates to the individual city level it is in the top 3 for all four cities disaster response recovery effective asset management and safeguards to human health hold relatively small sample sizes the low count in disaster response recovery and safeguards to human health is somewhat surprising given that questioning was framed around coping with shocks and stresses this may simply reflect the absence of a major shock event requiring an emergency response and coordination with other critical services see themes under these goals in table 2 in the cities in recent memory 1 1 we consider recent memory to be within the last 10 years a lack of awareness and concern from citizens regarding flooding in hull 5 of the population having signed up to receive flood alerts despite significant efforts from local authorities to increase those taking up the service despite experiencing a major flood event in 2007 shows how memory of a shock event can fade over time this would not explain the low count for miami however where devastating hurricanes are a commonplace occurrence the low count for effective asset management is due to the fact that most factors under this goal were not classified as a human societal or governance factor but largely of infrastructure or the environment although it is useful to consider the prevalence of different themes to glean general insights across all cities the number of factors associated with each theme when considering the entire dataset does not necessarily mean that the same pattern is observed for specific cities for example the theme coordination with the energy system has a relatively low count of factors associated with it when data is aggregated across cities and does not appear in the top 20 most prevalent themes only 9 of the 742 total factors however 7 of the 9 factors associated with this theme were generated by stakeholders in miami this is not an insignificant proportion of the total number of factors generated by miami 4 and in this context is comparable to the theme grassroots initiatives towards water resilience issues which is in the top 5 most prevalent themes across the entire dataset see fig 3 for miami the routine experience of serious hurricanes makes coordination with the energy system a critical aspect of their resilience to these shock events this highlights the highly context specific nature of what resilience means for different cities and stakeholders furthermore the low prevalence of a theme does not necessarily mean that it should be considered as less important than those with a high count of factors we did not define a threshold for a critical mass of factors required in order to establish a distinct theme as the number of times a single observation was made is partly a function of the number of stakeholders engaged from different sectors for example coordination with business and industry contains only 2 of the 742 factors however this low count may simply be a function of the relatively low proportion of stakeholders that were interviewed from business and industry 14 4 discussion here we discuss these findings in the context of current resilience discourse and anecdotal evidence gathered in the field 4 1 ensure the right people can make good decisions at the right time water is a public good largely managed by public institutions in the case of emergency situations central government is likely to be the only institution capable of mustering the required resources to respond unsurprisingly the data from all cities shows a strong emphasis on the role of government in tackling water resilience challenges the specific form of government necessary for water resilience remains unclear much of the existing literature on governance for resilience adopts a pro democratic stance and there is a need to further investigate the influence of regime types or trade offs of open or closed political systems in resilience building 27 current resilience discourse often advocates for institutional arrangements in which responsibility and decision making power is shared facilitating the ability to plan and make decisions at the appropriate level when needed it is argued that such systems are more flexible and better able to cope with uncertainty when compared to those in which decision making power is centred around one entity 18 37 however polycentrism in isolation can lead to significant negative outcomes successful implementation of a polycentric approach requires close coordination and collaboration amongst stakeholders and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities 23 37 56 effective coordination can be extremely challenging in disaster situations in 2007 hull experienced devastating floods in which 13 people died and more than a year after the floods took place thousands remained displaced poor planning and lack of coordination amongst responsible agencies in the crisis were primary drivers of the disaster 59 a further example is that of the drought crisis in cape town in which a lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities of national vs local government led to a delayed response to the drought crisis and subsequent implementation of costly emergency measures 6 47 thus a polycentric regime must ensure clear consensus on roles and responsibilities in ordinary and extraordinary conditions the actors and institutions responsible for managing urban water systems were often observed to be working in silos for instance there may be different entities overseeing different parts of the urban water system water supply sewage and wastewater management flooding water quality etc in addition diverse stakeholders have influence and responsibility over management of the system such as the non governmental and community based organizations citizens and other interdependent critical urban systems energy transportation telecommunications etc all share different power dynamics interests and priorities as such the need for coordination and collaboration amongst water management agencies and with other critical infrastructure systems is strongly reflected across all four cities beyond facilitating distributed decision making power coordination and collaboration is important in building social capital through shaping strong partnerships and networks building trust promoting shared understanding among stakeholders and diversified participation 27 51 71 coordination and collaboration is not limited to the public sector and in particular should extend to the private sector where infrastructure assets are held in private ownership as is the case for water supply in hull access to robust baseline data forecasts and models emerged as prevalent theme in most cities ensuring decisions are grounded in evidence and robust science is essential this way one frames a problem and characterises the solutionhas great bearing on how successful you will be in inspiring agency 39 72 analysis undertaken in a collaborative approach provides the opportunity to build trust and ownership in the findings generated and has great political power providing a neutral space to broker divisive debate for example mexico city a participatory collaborative modelling process led by the world bank and the university of massachusetts amherst 68 is successfully coalescing the traditionally fragmented water sector towards a shared objective to build the resilience of mexico city s water system and connected basins this in a context where political stakes are notoriously high miami the southeast florida climate compact a collaboration of four counties established unified sea level rise projections accelerating climate change adaptation efforts in addition a groundwater model developed by the us geological survey was widely accepted by stakeholders who had been previously distrustful of models developed by the state water department hull the living with water partnership a coalition of key public institutions and the local private water utility formed in part as a response to the 2007 floods has developed an integrated catchment model that is able to analyse impacts from multiple sources of flooding this provides a common ground from which to build investment plans for all parties 4 2 include diverse stakeholders in decision making processes participation is one of the most common attributes cited in resilience literature and is critical foundation for ensuring two of the goals we propose here equity and inclusiveness and empowered stakeholders table 2 participatory decision making can help identify risks to different categories of stakeholders and assets develop a common vision of resilience identify sources of finance support community ownership and buy in as well as monitor social impacts moreover it can empower specific vulnerable groups to implement grassroots initiatives that build their resilience to shocks and stresses 53 however engaging stakeholders is not an easy task due to a range of issues among which lack of resources and time complexity of issues at hand and stakeholder fatigue one also needs to recognise power relations between local communities and government as a prerequisite to meaningful participation 3 36 for the process to be effective efficient and inclusive the objectives of the engagement need to be clearly stated ex ante stakeholders and their responsibilities need to be mapped and appropriate mechanisms put in place to ensure representativity free and safe participation and access to information 36 stakeholders need to be informed on the expected use of inputs and monitor public accountability over time 55 the collaborative modelling exercise ongoing in mexico city provides a good example of best practice 68 in her review of ecosystem based management initiatives in the usa layzer et al 40 found that policies created through participatory processes do not necessarily yield optimal environmental outcomes despite being comprehensive and holistic in nature this finding provides a cautionary tale relevant for this work that participative processes require compromise whilst such processes are shown to build human social and institutional capital 10 32 34 41 43 74 it is important to ensure that mechanisms are in place for situations where consensus cannot be reached in order to avoid inertia 4 3 leave no one behind equity and inclusiveness is both an explicit goal and common thread across themes table 2 resilience is arguably contingent on social justice 39 as all citizens must be able to prepare respond to and recover from water related shocks and stresses in most instances physical vulnerability maps closely to social vulnerability which is not only a function of demography but also of the extent of one s social network 20 furthermore race often tracks closely with social vulnerability 16 this imbalance in exposure and vulnerability is perhaps most acutely felt when a disaster hits vulnerable communities living in the hardest hit areas are often permanently displaced despite being the least able to afford to relocate 39 this correlation between physical and social vulnerability was observed in all partner cities with a few notable examples miami the recent phenomena of climate gentrification vulnerable communities are increasingly more exposed to sea level rise as they are pushed into the lowest elevation coastal zones as a result of increasing land value at higher elevations mexico city many of the poorest neighbourhoods live in higher elevation areas of the city that are beyond the reach of centralised water supply or receive piped water that is at too low a pressure to be used these areas receive trucked water supply from privatised trucks or pipas often at much higher costs the industry has come to serve as a powerful tool for sexual and economic exploitation within these communities such exploitation is arguably a violation of human rights and has major implications on human and social capital hull flood vulnerability in hull maps closely with indicators of social vulnerability such as poverty employment and health these communities are often unable to afford adequate insurance to cover the cost of damages in the case of a flood and were in many cases displaced for more than a year following the major flooding of 2007 5 conclusion change is hard despite significant advances in resilience literature in the last decade implementation of resilience measures and approaches is still confined to a relatively small group of early adopters it can be particularly challenging to take measures towards water resilience under normal conditions heuristic rules of thumb rather than statistical inference or rational judgement drive how people perceive risk 73 at a societal level group dynamics and pressures compound this attrition of rational judgement 33 our proposition is that by creating the right enabling conditions citizens society and policy makers will be more likely to adopt best practice water resilience tools and approaches and make better decisions in the face of deep uncertainty by gaining the perspectives of people directly tackling shocks and stress in cities we hope to begin to bridge the gap between scholarship and reality and provide tangible examples of what urban water resilience means in practice we propose 9 goals and 38 themes that represent characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity that enable urban water systems to persist adapt and transform in the face of water related shocks and stresses and implement resilience actions this work represents the perceptions of stakeholders from four cities around the world the researchers conducting this study and the many reviewers and collaborators who have continually provided feedback and critique along the way further work is required to test the proposed themes and goals in a larger set of cities in particular there is a need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the roles of polycentrism and delivering meaningful participation within limited time and resource constraints our findings show there is divergence amongst cities as to what matters most not all the themes presented here will apply in every context nor would it be reasonable to expect a city to deliver in all areas all the time thus it is critical to ensure solutions are context specific and respond to the needs and perspectives of local communities this poses some interesting questions that warrant further investigation in future work which themes are most critical at what moment in which context and do important trade offs exist between themes presented here acknowledgements we are grateful for the generous support provided by the rockefeller foundation the resilience shift london and arup also to our partners and the many stakeholders we engaged in mexico city miami cape town and kingston upon hull for your time effort and intellectual contribution 
20149,resilience is a topic of extensive academic discourse as its relevance is elevated in response to climate change there is limited research into the concept of resilience from the perspective of those in fields of practice to address this gap we conducted fieldwork in four cities to ask for perspectives on what enables cities to cope with water related shocks and stresses based on analysis of interview responses and focus group discussions we propose key characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity necessary for urban water resilience we discuss findings in the context of evidence gathered in the field and prevalent work in current water resilience literature it is our hope that this work may provide insights into the critically important human dimensions necessary for a shift towards resilience as a prevailing paradigm for urban water management 1 introduction there is growing acknowledgement that the lack of progress towards climate mitigation targets and the irreversible legacy of past greenhouse gas emissions necessitate an acceleration of adaptation efforts globally water resources management is at the heart of this challenge with many of the implications of climate change likely to be experienced through impacts on the hydrologic cycle 9 as the world s urban population continues to boom cities will feel the impact of such crises most acutely many recent and high profile examples from cape town california and sao paulo highlight the significant economic societal and environmental consequences of a lack of preparedness 1 44 47 50 urban water managers as the stewards of this fundamental resource face the complex task of planning for the future under a confluence of highly uncertain socioeconomic and climatic conditions despite an increasing abundance of information guidance and efforts towards the development of adaptation plans implementation of adaptation actions remains elusive 49 under the rational choice model water resource managers can be assumed to make decisions that optimise performance based on a search for information and selection of the best alternative 65 despite the prominence of the rational choice model 61 strides in the psychology and behavioural economics literature over recent decades show the important role that heuristic rules 28 defined as an intuitive rapid and automatic system of judgement 67 play in human behaviour these heuristics or rules of thumb show how prejudice personal experience and knowledge and the way information is presented all have a profound effect on how we perceive risk and make decisions 73 73 we know that people show a reluctance to move from the status quo and adopt innovations even in the face of overwhelming evidence 39 64 61 62 thus motivating behaviour that leads to resilience actions requires a better understanding of the perspectives of those taking action over the past 10 years growing appreciation of the diversity and scale of urban hazards the complexity of cities and the uncertainty associated with climate change globalisation and urbanisation has emphasised the importance of moving beyond risk management to building resilience 8 we define resilience here as the ability of the system to persist adapt and transform pat when conditions require 14 25 the concept of urban water resilience relates to building these characteristics persistence adaptability and transformability in order to manage water related chronic stresses or sudden shocks that threaten widespread disruption or the collapse of physical or social systems 6 human systems at all scales are characterized by a dynamic interplay between social ecological and technological factors 11 46 a large part of society s ability to manage for resilience lies in the capital stock derived from its actors social networks and institutions and the interactions that occur between them 42 70 as such assessing and enhancing the adaptive capacity of such actors social networks and institutions is critical to building resilience resilience scholars frequently promote adaptive governance as a strategy to enhance the adaptability and flexibility of socio ecological systems 2 3 11 21 26 58 at its essence adaptive governance expands upon resource management to include social components as central to the adaptive management of complex systems 5 18 21 26 commonly cited attributes of adaptive governance include participation collaboration polycentric and multi layered decision making accountability and transparency deliberative and nested 4 22 24 26 27 30 42 52 54 55 57 60 70 71 despite considerable recognition of adaptive governance as strategy to mitigate against the deep uncertainty presented by climate change water managers urban policy makers and practitioners often face the central challenge of translating the concept of adaptive governance and resilience into tangible and practical implementation jimenez et al 35 argue that one must focus on embedding key attributes of adaptive governance such as those cited above in the delivery of core functions of water governance for resilience planning and preparedness policy and strategy disaster response and recovery measures coordination capacity development financing regulations and monitoring evaluation in addition the values of stakeholders taking part in governance processes the capacity of those stakeholders and institutions and the amount of available resources influences how successful one will be in operationalising the priniciples of adaptive governance many studies have sought to characterise human social and organisational resilience through qualitative empirical research 12 15 19 45 48 63 66 few studies extend this approach to consider human social and governance dimensions of resilience conjunctively the city resilience index arup 7 provides the closest example to the present work in this case data from 91 interviews and 38 focus group discussions across six cities concepción cali cape town new orleans semarang and surat was used to articulate a definition of urban resilience and indicators and metrics that allow one to measure the resilience of any city 8 key themes of resilience that were identified and relevant to this study include equity and inclusiveness consultative planning appropriate land use and zoning comprehensive city monitoring and data management effective coordination with other government bodies and proactive multi stakeholder collaboration although there are some areas of overlap with this work the

solutionhas great bearing on how successful you will be in inspiring agency 39 72 analysis undertaken in a collaborative approach provides the opportunity to build trust and ownership in the findings generated and has great political power providing a neutral space to broker divisive debate for example mexico city a participatory collaborative modelling process led by the world bank and the university of massachusetts amherst 68 is successfully coalescing the traditionally fragmented water sector towards a shared objective to build the resilience of mexico city s water system and connected basins this in a context where political stakes are notoriously high miami the southeast florida climate compact a collaboration of four counties established unified sea level rise projections accelerating climate change adaptation efforts in addition a groundwater model developed by the us geological survey was widely accepted by stakeholders who had been previously distrustful of models developed by the state water department hull the living with water partnership a coalition of key public institutions and the local private water utility formed in part as a response to the 2007 floods has developed an integrated catchment model that is able to analyse impacts from multiple sources of flooding this provides a common ground from which to build investment plans for all parties 4 2 include diverse stakeholders in decision making processes participation is one of the most common attributes cited in resilience literature and is critical foundation for ensuring two of the goals we propose here equity and inclusiveness and empowered stakeholders table 2 participatory decision making can help identify risks to different categories of stakeholders and assets develop a common vision of resilience identify sources of finance support community ownership and buy in as well as monitor social impacts moreover it can empower specific vulnerable groups to implement grassroots initiatives that build their resilience to shocks and stresses 53 however engaging stakeholders is not an easy task due to a range of issues among which lack of resources and time complexity of issues at hand and stakeholder fatigue one also needs to recognise power relations between local communities and government as a prerequisite to meaningful participation 3 36 for the process to be effective efficient and inclusive the objectives of the engagement need to be clearly stated ex ante stakeholders and their responsibilities need to be mapped and appropriate mechanisms put in place to ensure representativity free and safe participation and access to information 36 stakeholders need to be informed on the expected use of inputs and monitor public accountability over time 55 the collaborative modelling exercise ongoing in mexico city provides a good example of best practice 68 in her review of ecosystem based management initiatives in the usa layzer et al 40 found that policies created through participatory processes do not necessarily yield optimal environmental outcomes despite being comprehensive and holistic in nature this finding provides a cautionary tale relevant for this work that participative processes require compromise whilst such processes are shown to build human social and institutional capital 10 32 34 41 43 74 it is important to ensure that mechanisms are in place for situations where consensus cannot be reached in order to avoid inertia 4 3 leave no one behind equity and inclusiveness is both an explicit goal and common thread across themes table 2 resilience is arguably contingent on social justice 39 as all citizens must be able to prepare respond to and recover from water related shocks and stresses in most instances physical vulnerability maps closely to social vulnerability which is not only a function of demography but also of the extent of one s social network 20 furthermore race often tracks closely with social vulnerability 16 this imbalance in exposure and vulnerability is perhaps most acutely felt when a disaster hits vulnerable communities living in the hardest hit areas are often permanently displaced despite being the least able to afford to relocate 39 this correlation between physical and social vulnerability was observed in all partner cities with a few notable examples miami the recent phenomena of climate gentrification vulnerable communities are increasingly more exposed to sea level rise as they are pushed into the lowest elevation coastal zones as a result of increasing land value at higher elevations mexico city many of the poorest neighbourhoods live in higher elevation areas of the city that are beyond the reach of centralised water supply or receive piped water that is at too low a pressure to be used these areas receive trucked water supply from privatised trucks or pipas often at much higher costs the industry has come to serve as a powerful tool for sexual and economic exploitation within these communities such exploitation is arguably a violation of human rights and has major implications on human and social capital hull flood vulnerability in hull maps closely with indicators of social vulnerability such as poverty employment and health these communities are often unable to afford adequate insurance to cover the cost of damages in the case of a flood and were in many cases displaced for more than a year following the major flooding of 2007 5 conclusion change is hard despite significant advances in resilience literature in the last decade implementation of resilience measures and approaches is still confined to a relatively small group of early adopters it can be particularly challenging to take measures towards water resilience under normal conditions heuristic rules of thumb rather than statistical inference or rational judgement drive how people perceive risk 73 at a societal level group dynamics and pressures compound this attrition of rational judgement 33 our proposition is that by creating the right enabling conditions citizens society and policy makers will be more likely to adopt best practice water resilience tools and approaches and make better decisions in the face of deep uncertainty by gaining the perspectives of people directly tackling shocks and stress in cities we hope to begin to bridge the gap between scholarship and reality and provide tangible examples of what urban water resilience means in practice we propose 9 goals and 38 themes that represent characteristics of human societal and institutional capacity that enable urban water systems to persist adapt and transform in the face of water related shocks and stresses and implement resilience actions this work represents the perceptions of stakeholders from four cities around the world the researchers conducting this study and the many reviewers and collaborators who have continually provided feedback and critique along the way further work is required to test the proposed themes and goals in a larger set of cities in particular there is a need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the roles of polycentrism and delivering meaningful participation within limited time and resource constraints our findings show there is divergence amongst cities as to what matters most not all the themes presented here will apply in every context nor would it be reasonable to expect a city to deliver in all areas all the time thus it is critical to ensure solutions are context specific and respond to the needs and perspectives of local communities this poses some interesting questions that warrant further investigation in future work which themes are most critical at what moment in which context and do important trade offs exist between themes presented here acknowledgements we are grateful for the generous support provided by the rockefeller foundation the resilience shift london and arup also to
