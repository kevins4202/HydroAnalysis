17750,saturated column experiments were conducted to systematically examine the influence of hydration on the detachment of nano and micro sized latex colloids 35 nm and 1 μm respectively from sand the colloids were attached on the sand in primary minima pm using high ionic strength is nacl solutions the pm were predicted to be shallower and located farther from sand surfaces with increasing is due to the hydration force consequently a greater amount of colloid detachment occurred in deionized water when the colloids were initially deposited at a higher is atomic force microscopy afm examinations showed that both nanoscale protruding asperities and large wedge like valleys existed on the sand surface the influence of these surface features on the interaction energies forces was modeled by approximating the roughness as cosinoidal waves and two intersecting half planes respectively the pm were deep and attachment was irreversible at concave regions for all iss even if the hydration force was included conversely colloids were weakly attached at protruding asperities due to a reduced pm depth and thus were responsible for the detachment upon is reduction the afm examinations confirmed that the adhesive forces were enhanced and reduced or even completely eliminated at concave and convex locations of sand surfaces respectively these results have important implications for surface cleaning and prediction of the transport and fate of hazardous colloids and colloid associated contaminants in subsurface environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloids detachment hydration surface roughness porous media 1 introduction attachment and detachment are two primary processes that inhibit and facilitate colloid transport in porous media respectively ryan and elimelech 1996 shen et al 2012a attachment is defined as the adhesion of a colloid in solution onto a collector surface and the opposite mechanism is referred to as detachment yao et al 1971 tosco et al 2009 while colloid attachment has been examined extensively much less attention has been given to colloid detachment crist et al 2004 fang et al 2014 pazmino et al 2014 molnar et al 2015a bradford et al 2015 2017 babakhani et al 2017 colloid detachment in porous media is desired for a variety of industrial and environmental processes for example membrane and deep bed filtration have been frequently used to remove colloids in water and wastewater batra et al 2001 miao et al 2017 the filtration capacities of the membrane and deep bed decrease with increasing colloid attachment on these surfaces therefore periodic detachment of colloids from these surfaces is critical to regenerating membranes and filter beds although engineered colloids such as nanoscale zero valent iron have been shown to be very effective to remove contaminants from water shi et al 2018 chen et al 2019 tian et al 2019 the application of these nanomaterials for in situ soil remediation is very limited because they are readily attached to soil surfaces kang et al 2016 song et al 2019 therefore understanding the mechanisms that control the detachment of nanomaterials from soil surfaces is critical to enhancing their mobilities and increasing efficiencies for in situ soil and groundwater remediation detachment of a colloid from a collector surface occurs when the adhesive force torque that acts on the colloid is overcome by applied forces torques from hydrodynamic shear and or brownian diffusion bergendahl and grasso 2000 bedrikovetsky et al 2011 trauscht et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 the adhesive force mainly arises from the various colloidal interactions between the colloid and the surface elimelech and o melia 1990 van der waals vdw attraction and electrostatic double layer dl interaction are long range colloidal interaction forces which can be quantitatively described by the classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory verwey and overbeek 1948 ryan and elimelech 1996 when the separation distance between the colloid and surface is within a few nanometers e g 4 nm short range repulsive forces emerge which can dominate the colloid surface interaction ohki and ohshima 1999 manciu and ruckenstein 2001 grasso et al 2002 liang et al 2007 israelachvili 2010 colloid detachment cannot occur if the short range repulsive forces are absent because colloids are predicted to be immobilized in deep primary energy wells due to the dominance of vdw attraction over dl energy at small separation distances hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 hydration or structural force is a typical short range repulsive force which accounts for the energy needed to dehydrate interacting surfaces containing ionic or polar species in aqueous solution ruckenstein and manciu 2003 leng 2012 direct measurements using a force apparatus israelachvili and pashley 1983 showed that the hydration force is extremely strong at small separation distances which can prevent the interacting surfaces from approaching any closer than 0 5 0 6 nm i e the thickness of two water molecules israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 israelachvili 2010 anand et al 2016 the hydration force decays very rapidly with increasing separation distance i e in an exponential manner israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 israelachvili 2010 in addition to the separation distance the hydration force is highly dependent on the hydrophilicity of the interacting surfaces and solution chemistry such as hydrated cations ph and ionic strength is pashley and israelachvili 1984 israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 molina bolívar and ortega vinuesa 1999 molina bolı var et al 2001 anand et al 2016 for example various studies elimelech 1990 molina bolívar and ortega vinuesa 1999 manciu and ruckenstein 2001 miao et al 2015 2017 showed that when the concentration of an electrolyte solution exceeded a critical value the repulsive hydration force could alter the interaction between surfaces pashley 1981 1982 and miao et al 2015 experimentally showed that the hydration force altered the interaction energy when the electrolyte concentration was 10 mm for nacl e g the critical value manciu and ruckenstein 2001 2004 and song et al 2005 showed that the strong repulsion due to hydration can keep hydrophilic colloids e g silica and latex particles monodispersed in high electrolyte solutions even though classic dlvo theory predicts coagulation under these chemical conditions this is due to sorption of hydrated cations na or ca2 onto the particle water interface which increased the volume of hydration layers and thus inhibited particle aggregation song et al 2005 miao et al 2015 2017 showed that hydration forces can decrease the fouling of membranes by negatively charged protein colloids i e bovine serum albumin elimelech 1990 conducted column experiments to examine the attachment of latex colloids in glass bead porous media and showed that repulsive hydration forces caused an anomalous decrease of attachment efficiencies with increasing electrolyte concentration at high is even though the repulsive hydration force has been identified to reduce aggregation and attachment its influence on colloid detachment has not been investigated to date the mechanisms that control the detachment of colloids from collector surfaces could be very complex due to the coupling of repulsive hydration forces with surface heterogeneity e g nanoscale roughness surface roughness has been indicated to play an important role in both colloid attachment and detachment bradford and torkzaban 2015 bradford et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 saturated column experiments were conducted to systematically examine effects from a repulsive hydration force on the detachment of nano and micro sized colloids denoted as ncs and mcs respectively from sand surfaces that contains heterogeneities the colloids were first attached in primary minima on sand without colloid breakthrough using different electrolyte concentrations at a high is more colloids were attached with weak adhesions at a higher is due to an increased repulsive hydration force and these colloids were susceptible to detachment when the is was reduced to deionized di water the mechanisms controlling the detachment of colloids from rough surfaces by the presence of repulsive hydration forces were interpreted by calculating dlvo energies using the surface element integration sei technique and determining adhesive forces via atomic force microscopy afm examinations the findings in this study advanced our understanding about mechanisms controlling colloid detachment in natural and engineered systems which has important implication to surface cleaning water treatment and prediction of colloid facilitated contaminant transport in subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 colloidal particles and porous media white spherical carboxylate modified polystyrene latex particles with sizes of 35 nm and 1 μm fisher scientific inc were used as model ncs and mcs respectively both colloids are hydrophilic with a density of 1 055 g cm3 reported by the manufacturer colloidal influent suspensions for column transport experiments were prepared by diluting the stock colloid suspensions using nacl solution at different iss 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m to achieve a colloid concentration of 20 mg l the ph of the colloidal influent suspensions was adjusted to 7 by addition of 1 mm nahco3 colloid concentrations of the effluent suspensions from the column experiments were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california at a wavelength of 225 nm and 430 nm for the ncs and mcs respectively quartz sand purchased from sigma aldrich st louis missouri with sizes ranging from 300 to 355 μm was used to pack the columns the method of zhuang et al 2005 was used to extensively remove metal oxides and other impurities on this sand the cleaned sand surfaces were examined using a hitachi s4300 scanning electron microscope sem hitachi co tokyo japan the sem measurements show that the sand surfaces were very rough see supplementary material sm fig s1 the roughness morphology was similar to those in previous studies alshibli and alsaleh 2004 wang et al 2016a sizes of the ncs and mcs and zeta potentials of the colloids and sand were determined in nacl solutions at selected iss using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts a method from previous studies tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2005 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2017 was used to measure zeta potentials of sand briefly the cleaned sand was sonicated for 5 min in an electrolyte solution of interest and samples of the supernatant were then taken for zeta potential measurements 2 2 column transport experiments acrylic columns that are 1 8 cm in inner diameter and 9 cm long were used for column transport experiments the cleaned sand was incrementally wet packed in the column and gently vibrated to minimize any layering and air entrapment the porosities of packed sand beds φ were determined to be 0 36 using ϕ 1 m ρ v where m is the dry mass of packed sand v the is volume of the column and ρ is the density of sand grains taken as 2 65 g cm3 all column transport experiments were done at an approach velocity of 4 10 5 m s 0 24 cm min background nacl solution was first injected upward into a column for at least 20 pore volumes pvs to equilibrate the solution chemistry of the system similar to previous studies hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 li et al 2017 a three step procedure was then used to examine the attachment and detachment of colloids briefly 5 pvs of colloid suspension was introduced to the packed column to allow the colloids to be attached at a given is 0 05 0 1 0 2 or 0 5 m phase 1 followed by elution with colloid free electrolyte solution to displace unattached colloids in pore water phase 2 and finally elution with di water to detach the colloids that were initially attached in phase 1 phase 3 note that the colloids that were loosely associated with collectors or in low flow regions via secondary minimum energy association could also be released during phase 2 and 3 johnson et al 2018 the fraction of reentrained colloids fra was calculated as fra m 3 1 m 12 where m 12 is the fraction of colloids recovered from phases 1 and 2 and m 3 is the recovered fraction during phase 3 for selected transport experiments two additional phases were initiated following completion of phase 3 specifically the hydration force was increased by increasing the solution is using 58 pvs of 1 m colloid free nacl electrolyte solution at ph 7 during phase 4 the column was subsequently flushed with di water during phase 5 to examine whether additional colloid detachment could be achieved blank experiments were conducted using colloid free background electrolyte solution instead of colloid suspension during phase 1 these blank experiments showed that negligible colloidal impurities were detached from the sand during phases 1 5 these results confirmed that the method of zhuang et al 2005 was very effective in removing colloidal impurities from the sand 2 3 atomic force microscopy measurements in addition to the aforementioned sem measurements the sand surface roughness was also characterized by an afm dimension icon bruker co karlsruhe germany holding a regular silicon nitride si3n4 tip np 10 bruker with a nominal spring constant of 0 06 n m specifically the sand grains were fixed on a glass slide using uv glue solidification by uv light and the grain surfaces were imaged using contact mode in air the scanned area of each measurement was 10 10 μm fig s2 in the sm shows a typical afm image of the sand surface and measured values of roughness parameters including mean m average roughness r a root mean square roughness r q maximum roughness r m and surface area difference sad force curves were determined by interacting sand surfaces with silicon ball probes sicon b35 appnano of a diameter of 35 nm and a nominal spring constant of 0 29 n m under the chemical conditions used in the column experiments via contact mode both convex and concave locations on sand surfaces were measured for each chemical condition adhesion maps were obtained via force volume mode using the method of vadillo rodriguez and logan 2006 briefly retraction force curves were obtained in 16 16 arrays over scan areas of 2 2 μm the maximum negative force i e adhesion force during tip retraction for each force curve of a scan area as a function of the x y location was plotted to obtain the adhesion maps surface heights at the x y locations where the adhesions were measured were also recorded to obtain height maps details about the procedures for the measurements of force curves and adhesion height maps were shown in the sm 2 4 calculation of dlvo interaction energies and forces both the sem image in sm fig s1 and the afm image in sm fig s2 show that the sand surfaces are very rough nanoscale protruding asperities and microscale wedge like concave asperities were densely and sparsely distributed over the surface respectively to determine the influence of these two main roughness features on colloid attachment and detachment the interaction energies between a colloid and these features were calculated the nanoscale protruding asperities and wedge like concave asperities were represented as cosinoidal waves and two intersecting half planes respectively cf fig 1 the cosinoidal surface was described using the following expression zhao et al 2016 hong et al 2017 1 z x y p x cos π x 2 w x p y cos π y 2 w y where the terms p x p y and π 2w x π 2w y are the scaled amplitudes and frequencies of the asperities on a rough surface in x and y directions respectively a planar surface can be represented using eq 1 by setting p x 0 and p y 0 the sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 and bhattacharjee et al 1998 was used to calculate the interaction energies for a colloid interacting with the cosinoidal surface briefly the colloid surface was discretized into small area elements ds the total interaction energy u was obtained by summing the differential interaction energy e between each area element ds on the colloid surface and the corresponding area element ds on the cosinoidal surface the differential interaction energy was considered as the sum of vdw attraction dl interaction born br and hydration hr interactions mahmood et al 2001 pazmino et al 2014 bradford et al 2017 the expressions used to calculate e vdw e dl e br and e hr were shown in sm table s1 note that the equation of molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 was used to calculate e hr which considers that the hydration interaction energy is proportional to the electrolyte concentration or is the calculated interaction energies were made dimensionless by dividing by the product of the boltzmann constant k and the absolute temperature t for the interaction of the colloid with the two half planes the interaction force was calculated instead of the energy because it is more convenient for interpreting colloid mobilization within the concave surface li et al 2017 the expressions in sm table s2 were used to determine separation distances between a colloid and the two half planes the sei technique was used to calculate the interaction force between a colloid and a half plane the total interaction force between the colloid and two intersecting half planes was obtained as the vector sum of the two force components that act on the colloid detailed procedures for calculating the interaction energies or forces between the colloid and the two roughness features have been shown in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of colloids and collectors sm table s3 shows measured zeta potentials of the ncs mcs and sand in electrolyte solutions that were used in column experiments the zeta potential values were negative at ph 7 for all considered solution iss zeta potentials only reflect the average electrokinetic charge of the entire surface of the colloids and sand consequently the net negative zeta potential does not reflect local charge variations elimelech et al 2000 while the method of zhuang et al 2005 was used to extensively remove colloidal and chemical impurities from the sand surfaces in this study the influence of surface charge heterogeneity on the attachment and detachment of colloids on from the treated sand surfaces could still exist this is because charge heterogeneity could arise for example from impurities or substitutions within mineral matrices that are exposed on the surface even after the removal of surface coating johnson et al 2011 previous theoretical and experimental studies santore and kozlova 2007 shen et al 2013 2020 pazmino et al 2014 trauscht et al 2015 showed that surface charge heterogeneity can play a significant role on colloid attachment once the sizes or densities of the charge heterogeneities were larger than a critical value which changes with system conditions such as is in these cases the repulsive energy barriers were reduced to be comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt or even completely disappeared causing colloid attachment in primary minima the value of zeta potential was less negative at higher is as frequently observed for the latex colloids and sand in the literature torkzaban and bradford 2016 xu et al 2016 li et al 2017 as shown in sm table s3 the sizes of the mcs and ncs in di water were comparable to those in nacl electrolyte solutions with is 0 2 m indicating that aggregation was insignificant at these iss this is because the carboxylate modified polystyrene latex particles are stable in univalent salt solutions as reported by the manufacturer when the is was increased to 0 5 m there was an evident increase of the mc size hence a certain degree of aggregation occurred at this high is for this large colloid 3 2 colloid attachment fig 2 presents nc and mc breakthrough curves in sand when the solution is ranged from 0 05 m to 0 5 m complete deposition i e c c 0 0 c and c 0 are effluent and influent concentration of colloids respectively occurred during phase 1 for ncs at all iss and for mcs at is 0 1 m this indicates that all colloids were favorably attached in primary minima under these conditions using the correlation equation of tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the calculated single collector contact efficiency was 0 01 for the mc the determined value of c c 0 corresponding to attachment efficiency of unity was 0 1 for our column conditions via the expression of logan et al 1995a this value was larger than those in phase 1 of fig 2 which verifies the favorable attachment in primary minima interaction energy calculations see sm fig s3 and sm table s4 cannot explain the favorable attachment in primary minima if the sand surface was assumed to be planar specifically the calculations showed that repulsive energy barriers existed at is 0 1 m for the nc and at is 0 2 m for the mc these energy barriers reduce the probability for attachment to occur when colloids strike the sand surfaces ryan and elimelech 1996 i e the attachment efficiency in colloid filtration theory is 1 particularly the calculated maximum energy barrier u max was 10 7 kt at 0 05 m for the nc and 239 4 kt at 0 1 m for the mc these values are significantly larger than the average kinetic energy of a colloid which essentially inhibit attachment of any colloids in the primary minima note that if the hydration repulsion was included the values of u max were slightly increased see sm table s4 which further prevented the attachment in a primary minimum however both the ncs and mcs were completely attached under these chemical conditions both sem sm fig s1 and afm sm fig s2 examinations show that the sand surfaces were very rough and exhibited densely distributed nanoscale protruding asperities and large wedge like depressions surface roughness has been widely recognized as a major cause of the aforementioned discrepancies between the theoretical calculations and experimental observations zou et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 2018 li et al 2017 kananizadeh et al 2019 sm tables s5 and s6 present calculated values of u max for a cosinoidal surface with different values of w and p w p p x p y w w x w y interacting with the nc and mc at different iss respectively the presence of nanoscale cosinoidal protrusions reduces the repulsive energy barrier and accordingly increases colloid attachment in primary minima for example although the value of u max was larger than 200 kt for the mc planar surface interaction at 0 1 m the energy barrier disappears between the mc and cosinoidal surfaces when w 10 nm therefore the mc is favorably attached at primary minima atop of protruding asperities notably although the primary minimum depths are also reduced for the mc at 0 1 m with w 10 nm they are still significantly larger than the average kinetic energy of a colloid e g 14 48 kt and 8 96 kt for p w 0 5 and p w 1 respectively thus colloids can be maintained at the energy wells the reduction of the energy barrier is more significant for larger value of p w which means that sharper asperities i e smaller surface curvature are more favorable for colloid attachment in primary minima similar findings have also been obtained for the interaction energy between a colloid and a rough surface modeled as a planar surface carrying a hemispheroidal asperity shen et al 2015 if the charge heterogeneity is coupled with the physical protruding asperities the repulsive energy barrier can be further reduced causing an increase of attachment in primary minima shen et al 2018 2020 rasmuson et al 219 vanness et al 2019 for example while the values of u max are significant for the mc interacting with a cosinoidal surface at 0 05 m for w 30 28 54 and 14 06 kt for p w 0 5 and p w 1 respectively the repulsive energy barrier disappears if the cosinoidal surface is assumed to be positively charged zeta potential was taken to be 24 mv for calculations at 0 05 m therefore the mcs were favorable to be attached on the sand surfaces with positively charged cosinoidal protrusions via primary minimum association the charge heterogeneity could also solely result in attachment in primary minima provided that its size or distribution density is large enough to eliminate the repulsive energy barrier or reduce it to be comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid pazmino et al 2014 trauscht et al 2015 shen et al 2020 in addition to the protruding asperities the interaction force maps in sm figs s4 and s5 show that attachment in a primary minimum can also be increased in concave areas when repulsive force barriers are reduced or even disappear in the region close to the vertex of the depressions the sem examinations in sm fig s6 showed that the colloids were attached on protruding asperities and particularly concave locations of the sand surfaces notably the aggregation of mcs in solution at 0 5 m see the size measurements in sm table s3 does not significantly influence the interaction energy because it is mainly determined by the interaction between the primary particles of aggregates and the surface lin and wiesner 2012 however colloid aggregation can enhance retention by increasing sedimentation and straining at is of 0 5 m solovitch et al 2010 minor amounts of mcs were detected in the effluent in phase 1 when the solution is equaled 0 05 and 0 1 m the breakthrough was slightly more significant at 0 05 m than at 0 1 m this is because of the existence of a critical is above which the protruding asperities can completely eliminate the repulsive energy barrier see sm tables s5 and s6 the critical is value is smaller for sharper asperities wang et al 2019 in addition the size or density of a charge heterogeneity that can result in successful attachment is smaller at a higher is shen et al 2013 hence reducing solution is can decrease the fraction of the sand surface where the repulsive energy barrier is eliminated consequently a smaller fraction of colloids striking the surface will be successful in attachment when is 0 1 m indeed li et al 2017 through sem examinations showed that the colloids were uniformly attached on sand surfaces at high iss and less attachments occurred at protruding asperities at a lower is when sand was extensively treated to remove charge heterogeneity the same treatment as used in this study complete attachment still occurred for the nc at the low iss because the critical is decreases with the decreasing colloid size see sm tables s5 and s6 3 3 colloid detachment in phase 2 of fig 2 the columns were flushed with colloid free nacl electrolyte solutions to elute the unattached colloids in pore water no colloids were detected during phase 2 when complete deposition occurred in phase 1 this illustrates that all injected colloids were rapidly attached the colloidal concentration decreased from a very small value during phase 1 to zero in phase 2 at iss of 0 05 and 0 1 m for the mcs the unattached colloids in pore water were displaced out of the columns in this phase the colloids that were loosely associated with shallow primary and secondary minima may also be reentrained from energy wells wang et al 2016b hilpert et al 2017 however no tails existed in the breakthrough curves of phase 2 which implies that the reentrainment from shallow energy wells by brownian diffusion and hydrodynamic drag was minor shen et al 2007 molnar et al 2015 this is expected because the reentrainment from shallow energy wells mainly occurred when the colloids were initially attached at low iss on relatively smooth surfaces kuznar and elimelech 2007 shen et al 2012b in phase 3 of fig 2 detachment of colloids occurred when the solution is was decreased by flushing the columns with di water interaction energy calculations showed that the depths of primary force minima δf are deep at concave locations at all solution iss cf sm fig s7 therefore detached colloids should not be from concave locations on sand surfaces similarly rasmuson et al 2019 showed that multiple interactions among asperities decrease detachment of colloids from rough silica surfaces the sem images in sm fig s6 confirms that colloids attached at concave locations were irreversibly retained when the solution is was reduced in agreement with the observations in li et al 2017 in contrast interaction energy calculations in sm tables s5 and s6 showed that the presence of protruding asperities can significantly reduce the primary minimum depth δu or detachment energy barrier these interaction energy calculations are consistent with afm examinations in fig 3 which shows that adhesion was enhanced and reduced at concave and convex locations respectively the adhesions can even disappear at convex locations causing a repulsive interaction force i e positive value of force at all separation distances e g sm figs s8a and s8d the absence of adhesion is due to a monotonic decrease of the interaction energy with increasing separation distance i e no primary energy well in an interaction energy curve this is because the shallow primary minimum between a colloid and a nanoscale protruding asperity is eliminated by the repulsive interaction energy from the bulk collector surface shen et al 2012b 2015 2018 therefore colloids attached at convex locations will be detached by a reduction of solution is if the forces that act on the colloids change from attractive to repulsive or if the attraction is small enough be overcome by hydrodynamic shear or brownian diffusion yu et al 2014 showed that protruding asperities cuboid pillars or pits on surfaces silicon wafers can reduce particle attachment even under favorable conditions i e in the absence of repulsive energy barriers the detachment of colloids from protruding asperities was confirmed by the sem examinations shown in sm fig s6 note that if the nanoscale protruding asperities also exhibit significant charge heterogeneity the colloid could still attach atop the protruding asperities due to an increase of attraction by the charge heterogeneity while surface charge heterogeneity could significantly assist colloid attachment it has little influence on colloid detachment compared to surface roughness when they co exist on a surface bradford and torkzaban 2015 vanness et al 2019 in fact shen et al 2013 showed that surface charge heterogeneity increases the irreversibility of colloid attachment by increasing primary minimum depth for example the nc that was attached on the cosinoidal surface at 0 5 m with w 1 and w p 0 5 at primary minimum 6 84 kt could be detached upon reduction of solution is to be lower than 0 1 m primary minimum depth 0 84 kt the attachment become irreversible to is reduction if the cosinoidal surface is positively charged because the primary minimum depth is significant at all solution iss 10 kt vanness et al 2019 showed that the detachment of colloids attached on charge heterogeneities of surfaces could occur even without physical protruding asperities if steric repulsion was included however steric repulsion arises from polymer and or surfactant coatings on surfaces grasso et al 2012 which were absent in our experimental systems consequently detachment due to the coupled influence of surface charge heterogeneity and steric repulsion should be minor in our study fig 4 and sm table s7 present calculated values of fra for nc and mc at the solution is when the colloids were attached phase 1 the value of fra was larger for the mc than the nc at a given is similarly pazmino et al 2014 showed that larger colloids were more susceptible to release when the is was reduced this is likely because the smaller size of the nc allows them to more readily approach as shown by the trajectory simulations of ron et al 2019 and then irreversibly attach at concave locations see sm fig s6 due to a similar reason rasmuson et al 2019 showed that it was harder to detach colloids from surfaces with larger physical asperities by increasing flow velocity it has to be noted that the complete deposition in phase 1 of fig 2 indicates that favorable attachment in primary minima was the main retention mechanism for the nc and mc due to use of high solution iss as mentioned previously however it is possible that a minor fraction of nc or mc was still attached at secondary minima in low flow regions e g concave locations and grain grain contacts johnson et al 2007 molnar et al 2015b the mc was more favorably attached at secondary minimum than nc due to an increase of secondary minimum depth with colloid size hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 this could also be a reason for the larger value of fra for the mc since the secondary minimum attachment is completely reversible in response to reduction of solution is the value of fra increased with increasing solution is for both colloids one possible explanation for the observation is that increasing is increased repulsive hydration force sm fig s9 causing the primary minima to be shallower and located farther from the protruding asperities see fig 5 a when di water was introduced to quickly reduce the is the hydrated cations may remain in the gaps between colloids and protruding asperity tips due to limited diffusion bradford and kim 2010 causing the colloids to be still located at the enlarged separation distances see fig 5b in contrast the concentrations of salts in areas between the colloids and bulk sand surfaces could be rapidly decreased resulting in an increase of dl repulsion colloids that were initially weakly attached at larger separation distances due to elevated hydration repulsion at higher is are more susceptible to detachment with an is reduction elimelech 1990 miao et al 2015 2017 indeed comparison of the adhesion maps with the height maps in fig 3 show that the maximum value of adhesion was smaller at higher is for a rough surface this confirms that more weak attachment sites were present at a higher is fig 5c illustrates that the colloids remain attached atop the asperities in di water if the hydration cations are displaced and the hydration repulsion disappears therefore colloids can be detached from these asperities only when they were initially attached at high iss causing an increase in fra with increasing solution is note that the high value of fra for mcs when the is 0 5 m may also be due to disaggregation when the is was reduced in addition to the aforementioned size measurements to show the aggregation of mcs at 0 5 m the half time of aggregation t 1 2 was determined for the mcs at this high is to further testify that the mcs could be deposited as aggregates logan et al 1995b the expression developed by szilagyi et al 2014 for calculating the value of t 1 2 is t 1 2 2 k s n 0 where n 0 is initial particle concentration and k s is rate coefficient of aggregation when the repulsive energy between the mcs was absent at 0 5 m the value of k s is calculated by k s 8kt 3η where η is absolute viscosity of fluid the calculated value of t 1 2 was 1 2 h which was comparable to the time of injection of the mc suspension in phase 1 i e 1 3 h the calculations confirmed that aggregation of mcs could occur before attachment on sand surfaces to verify the existence of hydration cations during detachment additional column experiments were conducted using the same experimental procedure as that adopted for fig 2 however the concentration of na was determined instead of measuring colloid concentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 for mc was used we found that the mass recovery did not reach unity after flushing of di water of phase 3 specifically the determined values of mass recovery for na were 94 5 and 97 1 with injection of 0 5 m and 0 1 m nacl in phase 1 respectively in contrast the mass recoveries reached nearly unity if no mc was introduced in phase 1 i e the control experiments these results confirm the existence of hydration na cations during detachment and the interaction of the attached mc with the sand surfaces e g at concave locations play a critical role in remaining hydration cations it is worthwhile mentioning that the value of fra should decrease with increasing is when hydration repulsion is not considered this is because colloids will be attached at deeper primary minima at a higher is and accordingly less colloids can be detached by an is reduction in contrast to the results in fig 4 franchi and o melia 2003 showed the decrease of fra with increasing solution is by conducting column experiments using sulfate latex colloids and glass beads they attributed the reason to the more dominance of irreversible attachment in primary minima over reversible attachment in secondary minima at a higher is the importance of hydration repulsion on colloid detachment from primary minima is verified by observations in fig 6 specifically additional nc and mc detachment can be achieved after completion of phase 3 by increasing the solution is to 1 m nacl phase 4 and then flushing with di water phase 5 the elevation of the repulsive hydration force during phase 4 further weakened the adhesive interaction so that additional colloids can be released when the is was reduced during phase 5 as mentioned above solute equilibrium should not be reached in the gaps between the colloids and rough surfaces when flushing with di water during phase 5 c f fig 5b this means that the rate of decrease of hydration with is reduction is much slower than the rate of hydration increase with increasing is i e hydration hysteresis with is conversely if the rates of hydration were the same during is increase phase 4 and decrease phase 5 then no additional colloids should be detached because there is no net change in hydration repulsion the elevation of hydration repulsion caused considerable in situ clay release from soil in fig 7 in this case a solution chemistry sequence of di water 1 m nacl and di water was employed during phases 1 2 and 3 respectively the effluent clay concentration was monitored during this blank experiment details about the experimental procedure were shown in the sm no clay release was observed during phases 1 and 2 whereas tremendous amounts of clay released occurred during phase 3 this detachment behavior in the soil occurs because of an increase in the repulsive hydration force when the is was increased to 1 m nacl during phase 2 moreover the high na concentration displaced multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 in the soil which can cause irreversible attachment by cation bridges schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bradford and kim 2010 shen et al 2012a torkzaban et al 2013 the icp oes experiments confirmed the occurrence of cation exchange during phase 2 see sm fig s10 interestingly the tails in the na breakthrough curves of sm fig s10 confirms the existence of slow release of the na which caused the aforementioned hydration hysteresis note that no cation exchange was detected in the sand experiments of figs 2 and 4 due to thorough cleaning of the sand grains using the aggressive method of zhuang et al 2005 to remove multivalent cations that may exist on sand surfaces in addition no colloids were released in phase 2 when the is was increased to 1 m because the increase of hydration by the is increase cannot completely eliminate the primary minimum even at nanoscale protruding asperities the interaction force was attractive at all separation distance under the favorable condition of 1 m nacl while the hydration is a short range force which only influences the interaction force at small separation distances 3 4 implications the soil grains used in this study had been thoroughly washed and sonicated to remove clay colloids before packing the columns see sm sonication has been commonly believed to be a very effective method for removal of colloidal particles from surfaces however numerous clay colloids were still detached from the sand after flushing the column with nacl electrolyte solution with a high is and then reducing the is using di water therefore the use of high is electrolyte solutions could be combined with other approaches e g ultrasonic and megasonic methods for enhancing surface cleaning that is critical to various industrial processes such as fabrication of semiconductors and microelectronic devices however elevating repulsive hydration forces with high is salt solutions may also mobilize colloids that carry contaminants and enhance their transport in subsurface environments during is reduction such colloid mobilization by hydration may be common in coastal zones where salinization and desalinization of groundwater are alternated therefore accurate prediction of the transport and fate of contaminants in these areas should consider these factors 4 conclusions saturated column experiments were conducted to examine the role of hydration in the detachment of ncs and mcs in saturated sand porous media colloids were first attached in primary minima under high is nacl conditions and a fraction of attached colloids were detached by introducing di water to reduce the is dlvo interaction energy calculations and afm examinations revealed that the detached colloids upon is reduction were those initially attached atop of nanoscale protruding asperities on the sand surfaces where the primary minimum depth and adhesion were reduced the fra increased with the is that the colloids were initially attached because the hydration repulsion is larger at a higher is and this causes colloids attached atop asperities to have weaker adhesions at farther distances the weakly attached colloids are more readily detached by decreasing is if the displacement of the cations between the colloids and asperities that causes hydration repulsion is retarded during the is reduction our results suggest the importance of considering hydration in surface cleaning processes and in predicting the transport and fate of colloid associated contaminants in areas such as coastal zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17750,saturated column experiments were conducted to systematically examine the influence of hydration on the detachment of nano and micro sized latex colloids 35 nm and 1 μm respectively from sand the colloids were attached on the sand in primary minima pm using high ionic strength is nacl solutions the pm were predicted to be shallower and located farther from sand surfaces with increasing is due to the hydration force consequently a greater amount of colloid detachment occurred in deionized water when the colloids were initially deposited at a higher is atomic force microscopy afm examinations showed that both nanoscale protruding asperities and large wedge like valleys existed on the sand surface the influence of these surface features on the interaction energies forces was modeled by approximating the roughness as cosinoidal waves and two intersecting half planes respectively the pm were deep and attachment was irreversible at concave regions for all iss even if the hydration force was included conversely colloids were weakly attached at protruding asperities due to a reduced pm depth and thus were responsible for the detachment upon is reduction the afm examinations confirmed that the adhesive forces were enhanced and reduced or even completely eliminated at concave and convex locations of sand surfaces respectively these results have important implications for surface cleaning and prediction of the transport and fate of hazardous colloids and colloid associated contaminants in subsurface environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloids detachment hydration surface roughness porous media 1 introduction attachment and detachment are two primary processes that inhibit and facilitate colloid transport in porous media respectively ryan and elimelech 1996 shen et al 2012a attachment is defined as the adhesion of a colloid in solution onto a collector surface and the opposite mechanism is referred to as detachment yao et al 1971 tosco et al 2009 while colloid attachment has been examined extensively much less attention has been given to colloid detachment crist et al 2004 fang et al 2014 pazmino et al 2014 molnar et al 2015a bradford et al 2015 2017 babakhani et al 2017 colloid detachment in porous media is desired for a variety of industrial and environmental processes for example membrane and deep bed filtration have been frequently used to remove colloids in water and wastewater batra et al 2001 miao et al 2017 the filtration capacities of the membrane and deep bed decrease with increasing colloid attachment on these surfaces therefore periodic detachment of colloids from these surfaces is critical to regenerating membranes and filter beds although engineered colloids such as nanoscale zero valent iron have been shown to be very effective to remove contaminants from water shi et al 2018 chen et al 2019 tian et al 2019 the application of these nanomaterials for in situ soil remediation is very limited because they are readily attached to soil surfaces kang et al 2016 song et al 2019 therefore understanding the mechanisms that control the detachment of nanomaterials from soil surfaces is critical to enhancing their mobilities and increasing efficiencies for in situ soil and groundwater remediation detachment of a colloid from a collector surface occurs when the adhesive force torque that acts on the colloid is overcome by applied forces torques from hydrodynamic shear and or brownian diffusion bergendahl and grasso 2000 bedrikovetsky et al 2011 trauscht et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 the adhesive force mainly arises from the various colloidal interactions between the colloid and the surface elimelech and o melia 1990 van der waals vdw attraction and electrostatic double layer dl interaction are long range colloidal interaction forces which can be quantitatively described by the classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory verwey and overbeek 1948 ryan and elimelech 1996 when the separation distance between the colloid and surface is within a few nanometers e g 4 nm short range repulsive forces emerge which can dominate the colloid surface interaction ohki and ohshima 1999 manciu and ruckenstein 2001 grasso et al 2002 liang et al 2007 israelachvili 2010 colloid detachment cannot occur if the short range repulsive forces are absent because colloids are predicted to be immobilized in deep primary energy wells due to the dominance of vdw attraction over dl energy at small separation distances hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 hydration or structural force is a typical short range repulsive force which accounts for the energy needed to dehydrate interacting surfaces containing ionic or polar species in aqueous solution ruckenstein and manciu 2003 leng 2012 direct measurements using a force apparatus israelachvili and pashley 1983 showed that the hydration force is extremely strong at small separation distances which can prevent the interacting surfaces from approaching any closer than 0 5 0 6 nm i e the thickness of two water molecules israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 israelachvili 2010 anand et al 2016 the hydration force decays very rapidly with increasing separation distance i e in an exponential manner israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 israelachvili 2010 in addition to the separation distance the hydration force is highly dependent on the hydrophilicity of the interacting surfaces and solution chemistry such as hydrated cations ph and ionic strength is pashley and israelachvili 1984 israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 molina bolívar and ortega vinuesa 1999 molina bolı var et al 2001 anand et al 2016 for example various studies elimelech 1990 molina bolívar and ortega vinuesa 1999 manciu and ruckenstein 2001 miao et al 2015 2017 showed that when the concentration of an electrolyte solution exceeded a critical value the repulsive hydration force could alter the interaction between surfaces pashley 1981 1982 and miao et al 2015 experimentally showed that the hydration force altered the interaction energy when the electrolyte concentration was 10 mm for nacl e g the critical value manciu and ruckenstein 2001 2004 and song et al 2005 showed that the strong repulsion due to hydration can keep hydrophilic colloids e g silica and latex particles monodispersed in high electrolyte solutions even though classic dlvo theory predicts coagulation under these chemical conditions this is due to sorption of hydrated cations na or ca2 onto the particle water interface which increased the volume of hydration layers and thus inhibited particle aggregation song et al 2005 miao et al 2015 2017 showed that hydration forces can decrease the fouling of membranes by negatively charged protein colloids i e bovine serum albumin elimelech 1990 conducted column experiments to examine the attachment of latex colloids in glass bead porous media and showed that repulsive hydration forces caused an anomalous decrease of attachment efficiencies with increasing electrolyte concentration at high is even though the repulsive hydration force has been identified to reduce aggregation and attachment its influence on colloid detachment has not been investigated to date the mechanisms that control the detachment of colloids from collector surfaces could be very complex due to the coupling of repulsive hydration forces with surface heterogeneity e g nanoscale roughness surface roughness has been indicated to play an important role in both colloid attachment and detachment bradford and torkzaban 2015 bradford et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 saturated column experiments were conducted to systematically examine effects from a repulsive hydration force on the detachment of nano and micro sized colloids denoted as ncs and mcs respectively from sand surfaces that contains heterogeneities the colloids were first attached in primary minima on sand without colloid breakthrough using different electrolyte concentrations at a high is more colloids were attached with weak adhesions at a higher is due to an increased repulsive hydration force and these colloids were susceptible to detachment when the is was reduced to deionized di water the mechanisms controlling the detachment of colloids from rough surfaces by the presence of repulsive hydration forces were interpreted by calculating dlvo energies using the surface element integration sei technique and determining adhesive forces via atomic force microscopy afm examinations the findings in this study advanced our understanding about mechanisms controlling colloid detachment in natural and engineered systems which has important implication to surface cleaning water treatment and prediction of colloid facilitated contaminant transport in subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 colloidal particles and porous media white spherical carboxylate modified polystyrene latex particles with sizes of 35 nm and 1 μm fisher scientific inc were used as model ncs and mcs respectively both colloids are hydrophilic with a density of 1 055 g cm3 reported by the manufacturer colloidal influent suspensions for column transport experiments were prepared by diluting the stock colloid suspensions using nacl solution at different iss 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m to achieve a colloid concentration of 20 mg l the ph of the colloidal influent suspensions was adjusted to 7 by addition of 1 mm nahco3 colloid concentrations of the effluent suspensions from the column experiments were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california at a wavelength of 225 nm and 430 nm for the ncs and mcs respectively quartz sand purchased from sigma aldrich st louis missouri with sizes ranging from 300 to 355 μm was used to pack the columns the method of zhuang et al 2005 was used to extensively remove metal oxides and other impurities on this sand the cleaned sand surfaces were examined using a hitachi s4300 scanning electron microscope sem hitachi co tokyo japan the sem measurements show that the sand surfaces were very rough see supplementary material sm fig s1 the roughness morphology was similar to those in previous studies alshibli and alsaleh 2004 wang et al 2016a sizes of the ncs and mcs and zeta potentials of the colloids and sand were determined in nacl solutions at selected iss using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts a method from previous studies tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2005 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2017 was used to measure zeta potentials of sand briefly the cleaned sand was sonicated for 5 min in an electrolyte solution of interest and samples of the supernatant were then taken for zeta potential measurements 2 2 column transport experiments acrylic columns that are 1 8 cm in inner diameter and 9 cm long were used for column transport experiments the cleaned sand was incrementally wet packed in the column and gently vibrated to minimize any layering and air entrapment the porosities of packed sand beds φ were determined to be 0 36 using ϕ 1 m ρ v where m is the dry mass of packed sand v the is volume of the column and ρ is the density of sand grains taken as 2 65 g cm3 all column transport experiments were done at an approach velocity of 4 10 5 m s 0 24 cm min background nacl solution was first injected upward into a column for at least 20 pore volumes pvs to equilibrate the solution chemistry of the system similar to previous studies hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 li et al 2017 a three step procedure was then used to examine the attachment and detachment of colloids briefly 5 pvs of colloid suspension was introduced to the packed column to allow the colloids to be attached at a given is 0 05 0 1 0 2 or 0 5 m phase 1 followed by elution with colloid free electrolyte solution to displace unattached colloids in pore water phase 2 and finally elution with di water to detach the colloids that were initially attached in phase 1 phase 3 note that the colloids that were loosely associated with collectors or in low flow regions via secondary minimum energy association could also be released during phase 2 and 3 johnson et al 2018 the fraction of reentrained colloids fra was calculated as fra m 3 1 m 12 where m 12 is the fraction of colloids recovered from phases 1 and 2 and m 3 is the recovered fraction during phase 3 for selected transport experiments two additional phases were initiated following completion of phase 3 specifically the hydration force was increased by increasing the solution is using 58 pvs of 1 m colloid free nacl electrolyte solution at ph 7 during phase 4 the column was subsequently flushed with di water during phase 5 to examine whether additional colloid detachment could be achieved blank experiments were conducted using colloid free background electrolyte solution instead of colloid suspension during phase 1 these blank experiments showed that negligible colloidal impurities were detached from the sand during phases 1 5 these results confirmed that the method of zhuang et al 2005 was very effective in removing colloidal impurities from the sand 2 3 atomic force microscopy measurements in addition to the aforementioned sem measurements the sand surface roughness was also characterized by an afm dimension icon bruker co karlsruhe germany holding a regular silicon nitride si3n4 tip np 10 bruker with a nominal spring constant of 0 06 n m specifically the sand grains were fixed on a glass slide using uv glue solidification by uv light and the grain surfaces were imaged using contact mode in air the scanned area of each measurement was 10 10 μm fig s2 in the sm shows a typical afm image of the sand surface and measured values of roughness parameters including mean m average roughness r a root mean square roughness r q maximum roughness r m and surface area difference sad force curves were determined by interacting sand surfaces with silicon ball probes sicon b35 appnano of a diameter of 35 nm and a nominal spring constant of 0 29 n m under the chemical conditions used in the column experiments via contact mode both convex and concave locations on sand surfaces were measured for each chemical condition adhesion maps were obtained via force volume mode using the method of vadillo rodriguez and logan 2006 briefly retraction force curves were obtained in 16 16 arrays over scan areas of 2 2 μm the maximum negative force i e adhesion force during tip retraction for each force curve of a scan area as a function of the x y location was plotted to obtain the adhesion maps surface heights at the x y locations where the adhesions were measured were also recorded to obtain height maps details about the procedures for the measurements of force curves and adhesion height maps were shown in the sm 2 4 calculation of dlvo interaction energies and forces both the sem image in sm fig s1 and the afm image in sm fig s2 show that the sand surfaces are very rough nanoscale protruding asperities and microscale wedge like concave asperities were densely and sparsely distributed over the surface respectively to determine the influence of these two main roughness features on colloid attachment and detachment the interaction energies between a colloid and these features were calculated the nanoscale protruding asperities and wedge like concave asperities were represented as cosinoidal waves and two intersecting half planes respectively cf fig 1 the cosinoidal surface was described using the following expression zhao et al 2016 hong et al 2017 1 z x y p x cos π x 2 w x p y cos π y 2 w y where the terms p x p y and π 2w x π 2w y are the scaled amplitudes and frequencies of the asperities on a rough surface in x and y directions respectively a planar surface can be represented using eq 1 by setting p x 0 and p y 0 the sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 and bhattacharjee et al 1998 was used to calculate the interaction energies for a colloid interacting with the cosinoidal surface briefly the colloid surface was discretized into small area elements ds the total interaction energy u was obtained by summing the differential interaction energy e between each area element ds on the colloid surface and the corresponding area element ds on the cosinoidal surface the differential interaction energy was considered as the sum of vdw attraction dl interaction born br and hydration hr interactions mahmood et al 2001 pazmino et al 2014 bradford et al 2017 the expressions used to calculate e vdw e dl e br and e hr were shown in sm table s1 note that the equation of molina bolivar and ortega vinuesa 1999 was used to calculate e hr which considers that the hydration interaction energy is proportional to the electrolyte concentration or is the calculated interaction energies were made dimensionless by dividing by the product of the boltzmann constant k and the absolute temperature t for the interaction of the colloid with the two half planes the interaction force was calculated instead of the energy because it is more convenient for interpreting colloid mobilization within the concave surface li et al 2017 the expressions in sm table s2 were used to determine separation distances between a colloid and the two half planes the sei technique was used to calculate the interaction force between a colloid and a half plane the total interaction force between the colloid and two intersecting half planes was obtained as the vector sum of the two force components that act on the colloid detailed procedures for calculating the interaction energies or forces between the colloid and the two roughness features have been shown in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of colloids and collectors sm table s3 shows measured zeta potentials of the ncs mcs and sand in electrolyte solutions that were used in column experiments the zeta potential values were negative at ph 7 for all considered solution iss zeta potentials only reflect the average electrokinetic charge of the entire surface of the colloids and sand consequently the net negative zeta potential does not reflect local charge variations elimelech et al 2000 while the method of zhuang et al 2005 was used to extensively remove colloidal and chemical impurities from the sand surfaces in this study the influence of surface charge heterogeneity on the attachment and detachment of colloids on from the treated sand surfaces could still exist this is because charge heterogeneity could arise for example from impurities or substitutions within mineral matrices that are exposed on the surface even after the removal of surface coating johnson et al 2011 previous theoretical and experimental studies santore and kozlova 2007 shen et al 2013 2020 pazmino et al 2014 trauscht et al 2015 showed that surface charge heterogeneity can play a significant role on colloid attachment once the sizes or densities of the charge heterogeneities were larger than a critical value which changes with system conditions such as is in these cases the repulsive energy barriers were reduced to be comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid i e 1 5 kt or even completely disappeared causing colloid attachment in primary minima the value of zeta potential was less negative at higher is as frequently observed for the latex colloids and sand in the literature torkzaban and bradford 2016 xu et al 2016 li et al 2017 as shown in sm table s3 the sizes of the mcs and ncs in di water were comparable to those in nacl electrolyte solutions with is 0 2 m indicating that aggregation was insignificant at these iss this is because the carboxylate modified polystyrene latex particles are stable in univalent salt solutions as reported by the manufacturer when the is was increased to 0 5 m there was an evident increase of the mc size hence a certain degree of aggregation occurred at this high is for this large colloid 3 2 colloid attachment fig 2 presents nc and mc breakthrough curves in sand when the solution is ranged from 0 05 m to 0 5 m complete deposition i e c c 0 0 c and c 0 are effluent and influent concentration of colloids respectively occurred during phase 1 for ncs at all iss and for mcs at is 0 1 m this indicates that all colloids were favorably attached in primary minima under these conditions using the correlation equation of tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the calculated single collector contact efficiency was 0 01 for the mc the determined value of c c 0 corresponding to attachment efficiency of unity was 0 1 for our column conditions via the expression of logan et al 1995a this value was larger than those in phase 1 of fig 2 which verifies the favorable attachment in primary minima interaction energy calculations see sm fig s3 and sm table s4 cannot explain the favorable attachment in primary minima if the sand surface was assumed to be planar specifically the calculations showed that repulsive energy barriers existed at is 0 1 m for the nc and at is 0 2 m for the mc these energy barriers reduce the probability for attachment to occur when colloids strike the sand surfaces ryan and elimelech 1996 i e the attachment efficiency in colloid filtration theory is 1 particularly the calculated maximum energy barrier u max was 10 7 kt at 0 05 m for the nc and 239 4 kt at 0 1 m for the mc these values are significantly larger than the average kinetic energy of a colloid which essentially inhibit attachment of any colloids in the primary minima note that if the hydration repulsion was included the values of u max were slightly increased see sm table s4 which further prevented the attachment in a primary minimum however both the ncs and mcs were completely attached under these chemical conditions both sem sm fig s1 and afm sm fig s2 examinations show that the sand surfaces were very rough and exhibited densely distributed nanoscale protruding asperities and large wedge like depressions surface roughness has been widely recognized as a major cause of the aforementioned discrepancies between the theoretical calculations and experimental observations zou et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 2018 li et al 2017 kananizadeh et al 2019 sm tables s5 and s6 present calculated values of u max for a cosinoidal surface with different values of w and p w p p x p y w w x w y interacting with the nc and mc at different iss respectively the presence of nanoscale cosinoidal protrusions reduces the repulsive energy barrier and accordingly increases colloid attachment in primary minima for example although the value of u max was larger than 200 kt for the mc planar surface interaction at 0 1 m the energy barrier disappears between the mc and cosinoidal surfaces when w 10 nm therefore the mc is favorably attached at primary minima atop of protruding asperities notably although the primary minimum depths are also reduced for the mc at 0 1 m with w 10 nm they are still significantly larger than the average kinetic energy of a colloid e g 14 48 kt and 8 96 kt for p w 0 5 and p w 1 respectively thus colloids can be maintained at the energy wells the reduction of the energy barrier is more significant for larger value of p w which means that sharper asperities i e smaller surface curvature are more favorable for colloid attachment in primary minima similar findings have also been obtained for the interaction energy between a colloid and a rough surface modeled as a planar surface carrying a hemispheroidal asperity shen et al 2015 if the charge heterogeneity is coupled with the physical protruding asperities the repulsive energy barrier can be further reduced causing an increase of attachment in primary minima shen et al 2018 2020 rasmuson et al 219 vanness et al 2019 for example while the values of u max are significant for the mc interacting with a cosinoidal surface at 0 05 m for w 30 28 54 and 14 06 kt for p w 0 5 and p w 1 respectively the repulsive energy barrier disappears if the cosinoidal surface is assumed to be positively charged zeta potential was taken to be 24 mv for calculations at 0 05 m therefore the mcs were favorable to be attached on the sand surfaces with positively charged cosinoidal protrusions via primary minimum association the charge heterogeneity could also solely result in attachment in primary minima provided that its size or distribution density is large enough to eliminate the repulsive energy barrier or reduce it to be comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid pazmino et al 2014 trauscht et al 2015 shen et al 2020 in addition to the protruding asperities the interaction force maps in sm figs s4 and s5 show that attachment in a primary minimum can also be increased in concave areas when repulsive force barriers are reduced or even disappear in the region close to the vertex of the depressions the sem examinations in sm fig s6 showed that the colloids were attached on protruding asperities and particularly concave locations of the sand surfaces notably the aggregation of mcs in solution at 0 5 m see the size measurements in sm table s3 does not significantly influence the interaction energy because it is mainly determined by the interaction between the primary particles of aggregates and the surface lin and wiesner 2012 however colloid aggregation can enhance retention by increasing sedimentation and straining at is of 0 5 m solovitch et al 2010 minor amounts of mcs were detected in the effluent in phase 1 when the solution is equaled 0 05 and 0 1 m the breakthrough was slightly more significant at 0 05 m than at 0 1 m this is because of the existence of a critical is above which the protruding asperities can completely eliminate the repulsive energy barrier see sm tables s5 and s6 the critical is value is smaller for sharper asperities wang et al 2019 in addition the size or density of a charge heterogeneity that can result in successful attachment is smaller at a higher is shen et al 2013 hence reducing solution is can decrease the fraction of the sand surface where the repulsive energy barrier is eliminated consequently a smaller fraction of colloids striking the surface will be successful in attachment when is 0 1 m indeed li et al 2017 through sem examinations showed that the colloids were uniformly attached on sand surfaces at high iss and less attachments occurred at protruding asperities at a lower is when sand was extensively treated to remove charge heterogeneity the same treatment as used in this study complete attachment still occurred for the nc at the low iss because the critical is decreases with the decreasing colloid size see sm tables s5 and s6 3 3 colloid detachment in phase 2 of fig 2 the columns were flushed with colloid free nacl electrolyte solutions to elute the unattached colloids in pore water no colloids were detected during phase 2 when complete deposition occurred in phase 1 this illustrates that all injected colloids were rapidly attached the colloidal concentration decreased from a very small value during phase 1 to zero in phase 2 at iss of 0 05 and 0 1 m for the mcs the unattached colloids in pore water were displaced out of the columns in this phase the colloids that were loosely associated with shallow primary and secondary minima may also be reentrained from energy wells wang et al 2016b hilpert et al 2017 however no tails existed in the breakthrough curves of phase 2 which implies that the reentrainment from shallow energy wells by brownian diffusion and hydrodynamic drag was minor shen et al 2007 molnar et al 2015 this is expected because the reentrainment from shallow energy wells mainly occurred when the colloids were initially attached at low iss on relatively smooth surfaces kuznar and elimelech 2007 shen et al 2012b in phase 3 of fig 2 detachment of colloids occurred when the solution is was decreased by flushing the columns with di water interaction energy calculations showed that the depths of primary force minima δf are deep at concave locations at all solution iss cf sm fig s7 therefore detached colloids should not be from concave locations on sand surfaces similarly rasmuson et al 2019 showed that multiple interactions among asperities decrease detachment of colloids from rough silica surfaces the sem images in sm fig s6 confirms that colloids attached at concave locations were irreversibly retained when the solution is was reduced in agreement with the observations in li et al 2017 in contrast interaction energy calculations in sm tables s5 and s6 showed that the presence of protruding asperities can significantly reduce the primary minimum depth δu or detachment energy barrier these interaction energy calculations are consistent with afm examinations in fig 3 which shows that adhesion was enhanced and reduced at concave and convex locations respectively the adhesions can even disappear at convex locations causing a repulsive interaction force i e positive value of force at all separation distances e g sm figs s8a and s8d the absence of adhesion is due to a monotonic decrease of the interaction energy with increasing separation distance i e no primary energy well in an interaction energy curve this is because the shallow primary minimum between a colloid and a nanoscale protruding asperity is eliminated by the repulsive interaction energy from the bulk collector surface shen et al 2012b 2015 2018 therefore colloids attached at convex locations will be detached by a reduction of solution is if the forces that act on the colloids change from attractive to repulsive or if the attraction is small enough be overcome by hydrodynamic shear or brownian diffusion yu et al 2014 showed that protruding asperities cuboid pillars or pits on surfaces silicon wafers can reduce particle attachment even under favorable conditions i e in the absence of repulsive energy barriers the detachment of colloids from protruding asperities was confirmed by the sem examinations shown in sm fig s6 note that if the nanoscale protruding asperities also exhibit significant charge heterogeneity the colloid could still attach atop the protruding asperities due to an increase of attraction by the charge heterogeneity while surface charge heterogeneity could significantly assist colloid attachment it has little influence on colloid detachment compared to surface roughness when they co exist on a surface bradford and torkzaban 2015 vanness et al 2019 in fact shen et al 2013 showed that surface charge heterogeneity increases the irreversibility of colloid attachment by increasing primary minimum depth for example the nc that was attached on the cosinoidal surface at 0 5 m with w 1 and w p 0 5 at primary minimum 6 84 kt could be detached upon reduction of solution is to be lower than 0 1 m primary minimum depth 0 84 kt the attachment become irreversible to is reduction if the cosinoidal surface is positively charged because the primary minimum depth is significant at all solution iss 10 kt vanness et al 2019 showed that the detachment of colloids attached on charge heterogeneities of surfaces could occur even without physical protruding asperities if steric repulsion was included however steric repulsion arises from polymer and or surfactant coatings on surfaces grasso et al 2012 which were absent in our experimental systems consequently detachment due to the coupled influence of surface charge heterogeneity and steric repulsion should be minor in our study fig 4 and sm table s7 present calculated values of fra for nc and mc at the solution is when the colloids were attached phase 1 the value of fra was larger for the mc than the nc at a given is similarly pazmino et al 2014 showed that larger colloids were more susceptible to release when the is was reduced this is likely because the smaller size of the nc allows them to more readily approach as shown by the trajectory simulations of ron et al 2019 and then irreversibly attach at concave locations see sm fig s6 due to a similar reason rasmuson et al 2019 showed that it was harder to detach colloids from surfaces with larger physical asperities by increasing flow velocity it has to be noted that the complete deposition in phase 1 of fig 2 indicates that favorable attachment in primary minima was the main retention mechanism for the nc and mc due to use of high solution iss as mentioned previously however it is possible that a minor fraction of nc or mc was still attached at secondary minima in low flow regions e g concave locations and grain grain contacts johnson et al 2007 molnar et al 2015b the mc was more favorably attached at secondary minimum than nc due to an increase of secondary minimum depth with colloid size hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 this could also be a reason for the larger value of fra for the mc since the secondary minimum attachment is completely reversible in response to reduction of solution is the value of fra increased with increasing solution is for both colloids one possible explanation for the observation is that increasing is increased repulsive hydration force sm fig s9 causing the primary minima to be shallower and located farther from the protruding asperities see fig 5 a when di water was introduced to quickly reduce the is the hydrated cations may remain in the gaps between colloids and protruding asperity tips due to limited diffusion bradford and kim 2010 causing the colloids to be still located at the enlarged separation distances see fig 5b in contrast the concentrations of salts in areas between the colloids and bulk sand surfaces could be rapidly decreased resulting in an increase of dl repulsion colloids that were initially weakly attached at larger separation distances due to elevated hydration repulsion at higher is are more susceptible to detachment with an is reduction elimelech 1990 miao et al 2015 2017 indeed comparison of the adhesion maps with the height maps in fig 3 show that the maximum value of adhesion was smaller at higher is for a rough surface this confirms that more weak attachment sites were present at a higher is fig 5c illustrates that the colloids remain attached atop the asperities in di water if the hydration cations are displaced and the hydration repulsion disappears therefore colloids can be detached from these asperities only when they were initially attached at high iss causing an increase in fra with increasing solution is note that the high value of fra for mcs when the is 0 5 m may also be due to disaggregation when the is was reduced in addition to the aforementioned size measurements to show the aggregation of mcs at 0 5 m the half time of aggregation t 1 2 was determined for the mcs at this high is to further testify that the mcs could be deposited as aggregates logan et al 1995b the expression developed by szilagyi et al 2014 for calculating the value of t 1 2 is t 1 2 2 k s n 0 where n 0 is initial particle concentration and k s is rate coefficient of aggregation when the repulsive energy between the mcs was absent at 0 5 m the value of k s is calculated by k s 8kt 3η where η is absolute viscosity of fluid the calculated value of t 1 2 was 1 2 h which was comparable to the time of injection of the mc suspension in phase 1 i e 1 3 h the calculations confirmed that aggregation of mcs could occur before attachment on sand surfaces to verify the existence of hydration cations during detachment additional column experiments were conducted using the same experimental procedure as that adopted for fig 2 however the concentration of na was determined instead of measuring colloid concentration using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 for mc was used we found that the mass recovery did not reach unity after flushing of di water of phase 3 specifically the determined values of mass recovery for na were 94 5 and 97 1 with injection of 0 5 m and 0 1 m nacl in phase 1 respectively in contrast the mass recoveries reached nearly unity if no mc was introduced in phase 1 i e the control experiments these results confirm the existence of hydration na cations during detachment and the interaction of the attached mc with the sand surfaces e g at concave locations play a critical role in remaining hydration cations it is worthwhile mentioning that the value of fra should decrease with increasing is when hydration repulsion is not considered this is because colloids will be attached at deeper primary minima at a higher is and accordingly less colloids can be detached by an is reduction in contrast to the results in fig 4 franchi and o melia 2003 showed the decrease of fra with increasing solution is by conducting column experiments using sulfate latex colloids and glass beads they attributed the reason to the more dominance of irreversible attachment in primary minima over reversible attachment in secondary minima at a higher is the importance of hydration repulsion on colloid detachment from primary minima is verified by observations in fig 6 specifically additional nc and mc detachment can be achieved after completion of phase 3 by increasing the solution is to 1 m nacl phase 4 and then flushing with di water phase 5 the elevation of the repulsive hydration force during phase 4 further weakened the adhesive interaction so that additional colloids can be released when the is was reduced during phase 5 as mentioned above solute equilibrium should not be reached in the gaps between the colloids and rough surfaces when flushing with di water during phase 5 c f fig 5b this means that the rate of decrease of hydration with is reduction is much slower than the rate of hydration increase with increasing is i e hydration hysteresis with is conversely if the rates of hydration were the same during is increase phase 4 and decrease phase 5 then no additional colloids should be detached because there is no net change in hydration repulsion the elevation of hydration repulsion caused considerable in situ clay release from soil in fig 7 in this case a solution chemistry sequence of di water 1 m nacl and di water was employed during phases 1 2 and 3 respectively the effluent clay concentration was monitored during this blank experiment details about the experimental procedure were shown in the sm no clay release was observed during phases 1 and 2 whereas tremendous amounts of clay released occurred during phase 3 this detachment behavior in the soil occurs because of an increase in the repulsive hydration force when the is was increased to 1 m nacl during phase 2 moreover the high na concentration displaced multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 in the soil which can cause irreversible attachment by cation bridges schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 bradford and kim 2010 shen et al 2012a torkzaban et al 2013 the icp oes experiments confirmed the occurrence of cation exchange during phase 2 see sm fig s10 interestingly the tails in the na breakthrough curves of sm fig s10 confirms the existence of slow release of the na which caused the aforementioned hydration hysteresis note that no cation exchange was detected in the sand experiments of figs 2 and 4 due to thorough cleaning of the sand grains using the aggressive method of zhuang et al 2005 to remove multivalent cations that may exist on sand surfaces in addition no colloids were released in phase 2 when the is was increased to 1 m because the increase of hydration by the is increase cannot completely eliminate the primary minimum even at nanoscale protruding asperities the interaction force was attractive at all separation distance under the favorable condition of 1 m nacl while the hydration is a short range force which only influences the interaction force at small separation distances 3 4 implications the soil grains used in this study had been thoroughly washed and sonicated to remove clay colloids before packing the columns see sm sonication has been commonly believed to be a very effective method for removal of colloidal particles from surfaces however numerous clay colloids were still detached from the sand after flushing the column with nacl electrolyte solution with a high is and then reducing the is using di water therefore the use of high is electrolyte solutions could be combined with other approaches e g ultrasonic and megasonic methods for enhancing surface cleaning that is critical to various industrial processes such as fabrication of semiconductors and microelectronic devices however elevating repulsive hydration forces with high is salt solutions may also mobilize colloids that carry contaminants and enhance their transport in subsurface environments during is reduction such colloid mobilization by hydration may be common in coastal zones where salinization and desalinization of groundwater are alternated therefore accurate prediction of the transport and fate of contaminants in these areas should consider these factors 4 conclusions saturated column experiments were conducted to examine the role of hydration in the detachment of ncs and mcs in saturated sand porous media colloids were first attached in primary minima under high is nacl conditions and a fraction of attached colloids were detached by introducing di water to reduce the is dlvo interaction energy calculations and afm examinations revealed that the detached colloids upon is reduction were those initially attached atop of nanoscale protruding asperities on the sand surfaces where the primary minimum depth and adhesion were reduced the fra increased with the is that the colloids were initially attached because the hydration repulsion is larger at a higher is and this causes colloids attached atop asperities to have weaker adhesions at farther distances the weakly attached colloids are more readily detached by decreasing is if the displacement of the cations between the colloids and asperities that causes hydration repulsion is retarded during the is reduction our results suggest the importance of considering hydration in surface cleaning processes and in predicting the transport and fate of colloid associated contaminants in areas such as coastal zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17751,experimental tests were performed to demonstrate applicability of remote real time control rtc of pressures for leakage reduction in water distribution networks wdns the experimental tests were carried out in a laboratory pilot system equipped with a motorized plunger valve a rtc system with the adoption of an integral type control algorithm was implemented in order to adjust the valve on the basis of pressure measurements acquired in real time a numerical model of the pilot system was used to verify the suitability of the hypothesis of steady state conditions in simulating the laboratory tests the results of the experiments show that under appropriate calibration of the control algorithm the rtc system is able to perform effective control of the pressure comparison between results of the simulations and experiments reveals that the steady state model describes correctly the evolution of the pressure control processes observed in the laboratory pilot system thus opening perspectives for testing remote rtc schemes for leakage management in real wdns graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution systems remote real time control pressure control control valve 1 introduction active control of pressure is considered as one of the most promising methodologies to reduce water leakages in water distribution networks wdns araujo et al 2006 creaco and walski 2017 evidence has amply proven that the increase in background losses such as the leakage from pipe breaks joints etc is markedly correlated to the increase in operational pressure in the pipes of the distribution network thornton 2002 ciaponi et al 2015 traditional pressure reduction methods generally make use of pressure control valves pcvs normal practice is to install such devices at the inlets to the districts of the wdn and to set them properly in order to lower the piezometric level of the whole district thornton 2002 typically pcvs are used for local control with the objective of achieve and maintain the desired pressure set point locally at the site of installation immediately at the outlet of the valve pressure set point can be constant or vary during the day according to prefixed time scheduling most common types of pcvs include mechanically hydraulically driven devices that need to be calibrated in situ usually by adjustment of a secondary screw based pilot valve as a function of pressure prescott and ulanicki 2008 nicolini and zovatto 2009 abdelmeguid et al 2011 alternatively the valve can be adjusted on the basis of pressure measurements using electronic controllers janus and ulanicki 2018 in principle controlling pcvs according to local values of pressure does not assure proper control of the piezometric levels of the downstream wdn in fact such a type of control is significantly affected by the uncertainty in the estimation of the spatio temporal distribution of nodal water demands leakages as well as energy losses in the wdn recently focusing on leakage reduction various researchers campisano et al 2016 berardi et al 2017 page et al 2017a have explored the potential of methodologies based on the use of remote real time control rtc for improving pressure regulation in wdns depending on the network characteristics rtc systems can suitably replace traditional pressure control strategies by moving from local to remote control technologies creaco and walski 2018 indeed remote rtc systems use distributed remote information about the current status of the wdn in order to improve the effectiveness of pressure and thus leakage control strategies typically one or more pressure sensors are installed in the network in nodes that are far remote from the valve site normally such nodes are placed in the downstream part of the district selected among those with low pressure campisano et al 2010 information obtained by the continuous acquisition of remote pressure measurements is transmitted through a specific communication infrastructure in real time normally using gsm or dedicated radio lines being finally used to adjust dynamically the upstream control valves campisano et al 2010 giustolisi et al 2017 rtc is implemented by means of controllers devices that based on information received by the sensors in the network calculate and provide commands to valve actuators in order to adjust the flow process and drive control node pressure to the set point much of the available studies on rtc e g campisano et al 2010 giustolisi et al 2017 page et al 2017b creaco et al 2018 have mainly invoked use of simulation approaches to demonstrate advantages of remote control as compared to local control some approaches janus and ulanicki 2018 galuppini et al 2019 consider use of sophisticated methods proper of control engineering with a focus on system design in order to control pressure signals in wdns including high frequency components such type of approach aims at accurate control of pressure signals determined by pulsed demands in the wdn however tracking such signals requires control frequency that may be incompatible with the valve operation or increase malfunctioning failure of the valve itself conversely other approaches focus on the hydraulic objective of reducing water leakages in the wdn to achieve this objective the control of the low frequency pressure component associated to the daily pattern of the water demands in the network has been recognized as sufficiently accurate campisano et al 2016 creaco et al 2019 in such a context simulations have been carried out to test performances of various control algorithms that include hydraulics based algorithms abdelmeguid et al 2011 giustolisi et al 2017 and algorithms based on the use of pid proportional integral derivative logic a complete review of available algorithms for remote rtc of pressure in wdns can be found in the recent work by creaco et al 2019 pid is probably the most widespread type of control logic in embedded programmable logic controllers plcs owing to its conceptual simplicity and the opportunity for the continuous adaptation to the controlled system åström and hägglund 1984 this type of control has been used in various modalities in the field of water engineering for the control of both urban drainage systems campisano et al 2000 schuetze et al 2004 pothof and kooij 2007 and water distribution systems results from the literature show that effective valve control in wdns can be obtained by adopting algorithms which do not necessary include all the three terms of the complete standard pid in any case accurate calibration of the used algorithm is required campisano et al 2012 ziegler and nichols 1942 creaco and franchini 2013 creaco 2017 page and creaco 2019 report improvements in the control action with algorithms that include use of simultaneous measurements of pressure and flow discharge although at higher costs and complexity of implementation although the potential for application of remote rtc in wdns was explored by various studies much of these studies were carried out using numerical approaches conversely up to now only few investigations have concerned the development of experiments to evaluate the rtc potential at the laboratory and or field scales an example of laboratory application is provided by fontana et al 2018a which developed an integral i control algorithm to adjust settings of a pilot valve operated pcv the same authors tested with success the developed algorithm in a district of the wdn of the city of benevento italy fontana et al 2018b confirming suitable pressure control and water leakage reduction in the network however the control system adopted by the authors was not fully implemented as a scheme of remote rtc in fact such control system adjusts the outlet pressure of the valve by using an empirical model of the network to estimate head losses between the site of the pcv and the remote control node a very similar approach was used by bakker et al 2014 for the dynamic control of flows and pressures in poznań poland through performing real time adjustment of pumps settings also in this case a pressure demand model of the network was calibrated offline and used for determining the settings of the pumps therefore the approaches adopted in previous papers are not based on the use of pressure measurements transmitted in real time from the network to the control site with regard to the used control such approaches make use of a closed loop scheme for controlling local pressure at the valve site while relying on the use of an open loop for the control of pressure at the remote node in principle if the relationship between local and remote pressure is not modeled properly even a good regulation of local pressure might not assure effective control at the remote node in these cases large network portions may exhibit pressure excess deficit during the day as compared to set point values the objective of this paper is twofold novel experiments were carried out in a pilot rig at the laboratory scale to verify applicability and effectiveness of remote rtc for pressure control with reference to leakage reduction in wdns remote rtc was implemented by adjusting in real time the opening degree of a motorized plunger valve differently from previous literature studies the valve control is based exclusively on pressure measurements acquired in remote and transmitted in real time using a closed loop control scheme as further objective the paper aims at demonstrating the suitability of the hypothesis of steady state conditions to simulate the rtc laboratory experiments to achieve this objective an already available numerical hydraulic model of the pilot system was upgraded with a control module and used for both the preliminary tuning of the controller and the successive simulations the paper is structured in sections first the experimental methods are presented including the description of the laboratory pilot system the implemented rtc system architecture the framework of the experiments as well as the used numerical model secondly results of the different experiments are presented with specific emphasis on the pressure control performance of the rtc system third simulation results are discussed and compared with results of the experiments to demonstrate the suitability of the steady state hypothesis for the simulation of real time pressure control for leakage reduction finally the discussion concerning the analysis of the results is reported including potential and limitations of the used approach followed by main conclusions of the research and future perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the laboratory pilot system the pilot system was installed at the laboratory of hydraulics of the department of civil engineering and architecture of the university of catania italy the system mainly consists of 4 sub systems i an upstream head tank equipped with a pump outside the laboratory room ii the adduction pipe section from the pump to the laboratory room iii the pipe section of interest for the experiments and iv the recirculation system to convey back flow to the upstream tank the upstream tank has a maximum storage capacity of about 70 m3 and is supplied by the university campus water distribution system the pump allows maximum head of about 85 m and maximum flow discharge close to 25 l s the adduction pipe is a 33 m long iron pipe with nominal diameter dn100 and conveys the pumped flow to the section of interest for the experiments the pipe shows significant internal corrosion typical of water distribution network pipes in operation by several years estimated strickler roughness coefficient close to 70 m1 3 s the section of interest for the experiments has the same geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the adduction pipe the section see the sketch of fig 1 is made of a vertical ascending segment equipped with a gate valve operated manually an intermediate sub horizontal segment 3 slope equipped with the instrumentation for pressure control and a final vertical descending segment equipped with another manual gate valve that conveys the flow to the recirculation system all monitoring and control equipment is installed in the intermediate segment in detail going from upstream to downstream the segment hosts a valve for air purge an upstream sensor of pressure later in the text indicated as us an electromagnetic flowmeter dn80 the motorized plunger valve used for controlling the pressure a ball valve dn100 a downstream pressure sensor mounted in the section that was identified as the remote control node cn an additional air purge valve pressure sensors are piezo resistive probes with a range of measurement 0 10 bar full scale error 0 003 resolution 0 1 of full scale and analogic output 4 20 ma the electromagnetic flowmeter allows measurement of the flow discharge in the range 0 8 80 l s with errors in the order of 1 and 0 5 for flow velocities between 0 1 and 0 5 m s and 0 5 10 0 m s respectively the plunger valve is dn80 mm in size although this type of valve requires higher electric power than other mechanical pcvs field experience shows that it allows accurate flow and pressure control in wdns two short conic converging and diverging trunks were used as joints between the plunger valve and the pipe dn100 fig 2 shows the curve of the valve resistivity ξ p l u n g e r as a function of the opening degree of the valve shutter a the valve provides a value of ξ p l u n g e r 3 1 when the valve is fully open an electric actuator equipped with both reduction group and multi turn device is coupled to the plunger valve the actuator enables the possibility to adjust the opening closure degree of the valve shutter by receiving signals from an external control unit for example signals sent by a remote plc specific electronic devices mounted on board also allow analogic transmission of torque values and position of the valve shutter at any instant of the control action the ball valve dn100 was used in the experiments to emulate energy losses determined by the network when the remote control node is far from the control valve site since the energy loss as induced by the ball valve varies with the conveyed flow the valve may locally replicate the impact of the distributed energy loss in wdns thus allowing emulating properly losses due to the variability of water demands finally the gate valves dn100 placed in the two vertical segments were used to setup the initial condition of the pilot system to determine appropriate flow discharge and pressure values in the system for the different experimental tests developed 2 2 control system structure and algorithm the control system was structured adopting a closed loop scheme of remote rtc to control pressures in the laboratory pilot the system includes use of a plc that collects all the measurements acquired by the pressure sensors and by the flowmeter the plc allows also addressing control commands to the actuator of the plunger valve by means of analog signals in the range 0 20 ma a digital clock supports real time operation of the control system enabling run times smaller than 0 7 ms a personal computer connected to the plc monitors the control process in real time and stores the acquired measurements i e the recorded values of pressure flow discharge and opening degree of the valve shutter labview software travis and kring 2006 was used as it allows easy implementation of algorithms for the valve control using input signals from the plc from a practical viewpoint the objective of the control algorithm is to adjust step by step the setting of the valve shutter i e determine the needed energy dissipation at the valve site in order to drive the pressure at the remote cn to the set point therefore the pressure value p t bar at time t provided by the sensor at the control node was used for the algorithm application notably at each time step δ t c of the control action the adopted algorithm adjusts the valve provides the displacement δ a of the valve shutter based on the deviation e t p t p s p bar at time t between p t and the set point pressure p s p bar as 1 δ a a t δ t c a t k e t where a t and a t δ t c are the valve shutter opening degrees at times t and t δ t c being a 100 when the valve is fully open previous equation shows the shutter displacement δ a to be proportional to e t by means of the gain parameter k percent bar therefore in principle with respect to the shutter position a eq 1 shows the characteristics of an integral type control algorithm moreover the negative sign in eq 1 allows considering the negative relationship between δ a and e t if gain k is assumed intrinsically positive in principle the integral action would ensure achievement of the set point if no derivative action is present and in presence of step reference signals and step process disturbances galuppini et al 2019 the gain k plays an important role on the dynamics of the control system and must be calibrated to assure effective control actions calibration might result in a very complex operation for wdns because of the significant non linearity in the response of the network to flow variations nodal demand changes in time and space another parameter having significant impact on the performance of the rtc system is the control time step δ t c selection of the value of this parameter strictly depends on the control objective and should be consistent with the characteristic time of the process and with the used k value galuppini et al 2020 in particular for the control of water leakage in wdns the choice of δ t c can be conveniently related to the low frequency component of the pressure signal typically varying accordingly to the hourly demand pattern in the network the new value a t δ t c as evaluated by eq 1 is prescribed to the valve in case that a m i n a t δ t c a m a x being a m i n and a m a x the smallest and the largest values allowed for the valve opening degree respectively while a m i n is normally suggested by the manufacturer in order to avoid cavitation a m a x is generally equal to 100 since the adoption of a m i n and a m a x determines the saturation of the control action an anti windup approach was implemented to avoid pressure overshoots undershoots this was obtained by prescribing a t δ t c a m i n to the valve if eq 1 provides a t δ t c a m i n and a t δ t c a m a x in the case that a t δ t c a m a x 2 3 framework of the experiments setting of the rtc system required devoting attention to several aspects that are relevant to the control performance firstly the motorized plunger valve was set in order to assure a relatively low value of the opening closing velocity of the shutter 2 2 of the total run per second thus determining pressure waves of negligible effect used setting allows a full closure of the valve in about 45 5 s in addition by default settings the valve has a sensitivity of 0 6 i e it remains inactive for values of δ a 0 6 such sensitivity is determined by the intrinsic electro mechanical accuracy of the valve and of the actuator i e the smallest possible displacement of the shutter according to reduction group and multi turn device notably this determines the occurrence of a dead band of the shutter position a with effects of various extent on the accuracy of the pressure regulation all the sensors pressure and flow discharge were calibrated to provide measurements with time step of acquisition δ t a of 1 s that is measurements of pressure and flow discharge were sent to the plc on every 1 s based on criteria discussed in the previous section and in agreement to results from the literature e g creaco et al 2018 page et al 2017b the control time δ t c for the experiments was fixed to 30 s the chosen control time is sufficiently high to reduce the number of shutter movements of the control valve thus assuring adequate lifespan of the valve itself for practical applications conversely high frequency fluctuations of the pressure signal were disregarded considering their negligible impact on leakage levels in wdns however an operator of mobile average was used in order to reduce the impact on the control performance of background noise in the pressure signal pressure fluctuation due to the turbulent flow in the pipe mounce et al 2012 campisano et al 2015 in particular the value of pressure p t used for the estimation of e t was evaluated as average of the ten final pressure values acquired by the plc during each δ t c mobile average allowed obtaining effective valve control as the regulation was little impacted by random pressure pulses in general the experiments were carried out to explore two main conditions of operation of the pilot system corresponding to tests conducted i with the ball valve fully open and ii with the ball valve partially closed details of the two types of tests are described in the next subsections 2 3 1 tests with the ball valve fully open modalities to perform such tests are described as follows preliminarily the pump was switched on and the upstream gate valve mounted in the vertical ascending segment of the pipe was fully opened contextually opening of the air purge valves in the whole pipeline allowed purging eventual air pockets residing in the section of interest then the downstream gate valve was adjusted in order to achieve stationary flow conditions characterized by values of flow discharge and pressure at the us close to 9 l s and to 7 bar respectively the set point value of the cn pressure was fixed to 3 bar for all the tests each rtc test was carried out assuming the plunger valve to be open at the beginning of the experiment the objective of the tests was to drive the pressure at the cn to the set point in a relatively quick but gradual way avoiding over under shootings of the pressure and occurrence of oscillations around the set point the tests were carried out with different values of the gain k a trial and error procedure based on preliminary experiments and simulations with the used model described later in the paper was applied to identify the proper range of k values for controller tuning accordingly 5 tests were carried out with k values of 1 2 3 4 and 5 simulations with the used model were carried out also to investigate the sampling time and to test preliminarily the stability of the scheme with different values of the flow in the pipe galuppini et al 2020 2 3 2 tests with the ball valve partially closed these tests were carried out by closing partially the ball valve in order to determine an energy dissipation that emulates the friction energy losses occurring in the network between the control valve and the remote cn the same operational modalities described at the previous sub section were adopted for these tests however this time the partial closure of the ball valve determined a drop down of the initial pressure value at the cn to about 4 5 bar globally also in this case 5 tests were carried out to evaluate the control performance obtained by use of remote rtc preliminary trials and simulations to identify the proper range of k allowed selecting gain values of 1 3 5 7 and 10 for these tests sampling time and stability of the scheme under different flow conditions were also investigated 2 4 hydraulic model for simulation analysis the adopted model is based on the use of the equation of the energy conservation and describes the evolution of the process of pressure control as a succession of stationary states hypothesis of stationary conditions used for modeling the process at each simulation time step was considered consistent to valve opening closure speed under rtc that is low enough to neglect the effects of perturbations of unsteady flow in the system the presence of the upstream pump is modeled by means of the head discharge curve 2 h α q 3 β q 2 γ q δ where h bar is the hydraulic head determined by the pump q m3 s is the flow discharge and α 9 20 10 4 β 2 05 10 2 γ 12 96 and δ 8 49 are the curve parameters the total loss of energy δ h t r u n k bar determined by the trunk of the adduction pipe as well as by several singularities from the pump to the section of the us is calculated globally as 3 δ h t r u n k c t r u n k q 2 2 g a 2 where the non dimensional coefficient c t r u n k 14 7 was determined experimentally by previous tests carried out under stationary conditions g m s2 is the gravity acceleration and a m2 is the cross sectional area of the pipe coupled use of eqs 2 and 3 allows calculating the value of the pressure p u s bar at the section of the us once that the value of q m3 s is known the model evaluates the friction losses in the various pipe segments δ h p i p e bar on the basis of the strickler relationship 4 δ h p i p e 1 01 q 2 k s 2 d 16 3 l where k s m1 3 s is the pipe friction coefficient by strickler d m is the pipe diameter and l m is the length of the segment moreover local energy losses due to pipe bends δ h b e n d bar are evaluated by the model as 5 δ h b e n d c b e n d q 2 2 g a 2 where coefficient c b e n d is assumed equal to 0 020 brater and king 1976 similarly energy losses δ h c o n v d i v bar due to the converging diverging trunks respectively upstream downstream of the plunger valve are evaluated based on the relationship 6 δ h c o n v d i v c c o n v d i v q 2 2 g a 2 where c c o n v d i v is assumed equal to 0 010 and 0 025 for the converging and the diverging trunks respectively brater and king 1976 the model allows to simulate the effect of the presence of the various types of valves installed in the pipe by considering the flow head loss δ h v a l v e bar generated locally by such devices the following general relationship is used 7 δ h v a l v e ξ q 2 2 g a 2 being ξ the valve resistivity to the flow notably ξ ξ g a t e for the two gate valves placed in the vertical segments while ξ ξ b a l l for the ball valve the values of ξ g a t e and ξ b a l l were previously determined as a function of their respective opening degrees the value of the resistivity of the plunger valve ξ p l u n g e r a was calculated as a function of the valve opening degree a fig 2 such resistivity value may change on every time step of the simulation δ t s if the rtc algorithm modifies the value of a at each simulation time step δ t s the energy conservation equation together with eqs 2 7 and eq 1 allows to determine flow discharge and pressures in the cross sections of the pipe in which pressure sensors are installed thus enabling appropriate comparison with the measurements recorded during the experiments for the application of the model the solution of the system of equations required prescribing the pressure at the downstream outlet of the pilot system the pressure value at this section was fixed equal to zero since the water freely flows out from the pipe in the recirculation open channel the value of δ t s was assumed equal to 1 s equal to δ t a for obvious reasons of comparison between model and experiments the solution of the described system of equations is based on the following steps at every δ t s 1 an initial value of the flow discharge unknown variable is assumed 2 the pressure p u s at the us is calculated by coupled use of eqs 2 and 3 3 head losses in the pipe are calculated by using eqs 4 7 and subtracted to the obtained value of p u s 4 the head loss due to the plunger valve eq 7 is determined based on the current value of the opening degree a t for times t of the simulation that do not coincide to the control time step δ t c or to a multiple of δ t c conversely the same head loss is calculated based on the new value a t δ t c as obtained by eq 1 in this case the shutter displacement for each δ t s is determined by taking into account the physical constraints due to the mechanical speed of the shutter 5 the pressure at the outlet section is calculated and steps 1 5 are repeated with new flow discharge values until the outlet pressure is equal to zero 3 results 3 1 results of the experiments 3 1 1 rtc tests with the ball valve fully open the experimental results concerning the rtc tests carried out with k 1 are reported in the graph of fig 3 the figure shows measured pressures at both us and cn during the whole experiment the pressure set point value is reported in the figure for comparison the figure also reports values of the flow discharge q and of the opening degree a of the plunger valve during the test results show that the control algorithm in this case allows to achieve the set point in approximate way since it lowers pressure at the cn from the initial value about 7 3 bar down to about 3 5 bar in about 9 min the discrepancy between the achieved pressure and the desired set point depends on the amplitude of the dead band of the valve shutter on the adopted value of the gain k and on the initial opening of the valve details on this aspect are deferred to the discussion section the cn pressure starts reducing appreciably only about 5 min after the beginning of the experiment that is after that the control system has reduced sufficiently the opening degree of the plunger valve to about 40 opening conversely during the initial minutes of the test when the valve is still rather open the plunger valve does not affect the pressure control process in a significant way the graph shows the pressure at the cn to decrease by sharp steps occurring synchronically to valve shutter closures notably for each displacement of the shutter the time of action of the valve is about 2 s long while the shutter remains inactive for the rest of the control time step for about 28 s the values of a decrease during time down to about 21 at the end of the test due to the increasing energy loss determined by the successive closure steps of the plunger valve flow discharge circulating in the pipeline decreases from about 9 2 l s to about 6 5 l s at the end of the test records at the us shows pressure to increase as the opening degree of the valve decreases the valve sustains the pressure in the upstream pipe segment however pressure increment is relatively small from 7 3 bar to about 7 8 bar as the characteristic curve of the pump is rather flat although in principle the valve control determines conditions of unsteady flow the results of the experiment do not highlight the development of pressure waves in the pipeline instead the experiment reveals the presence of noise at high frequency mainly due to the flow turbulence that disturbs experimental pressure and flow discharge signals fig 4 a shows the results obtained with k 3 the adopted value of k determines a faster reaction of the control system as compared to the case of fig 3 thus allowing a more rapid convergence to the set point in about 2 5 min incidentally this time the set point is achieved with relatively high accuracy due to a favorable combination of the effects of the dead band with the used value of k and of the initial valve opening condition moreover as expected the increased value of k determines steps of a of larger magnitude as compared to previous case fig 4b shows the results obtained with k 4 in this case the interesting result is that the used k value determines the development of pressure under over shooting around the set point with the pressure that achieves values down to about 2 5 bar at the cn however after a few oscillations the system achieves after about 4 5 min a pressure value very close to the set point results of the experiments with k 2 and k 5 are not shown in the paper for brevity as expected use of k 2 provided intermediate results between k 1 and 3 while use of k 5 further increased under over shooting of the pressure 3 1 2 rtc tests with the ball valve partially closed some of the results of the experimental tests carried out with the ball valve partially closed are summarized in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 reports the results of the test performed using the value k 3 such value enables direct comparison of the results of this test with those provided in previous fig 4a thus showing the impact of the energy losses determined by the ball valve on the control process the results show that the rtc system allows leading the initial value of the pressure at the cn from about 4 5 bar to the set point in an accurate way however the lower initial value of the pressure at the cn leads to shutter displacement corrections of lesser extent as compared to fig 4a and therefore to slow down the whole control process the set point is achieved in about 9 min fig 5 also shows that the plunger valve closes from 100 to about 23 opening degree while the flow discharge decreases from about 7 4 l s down to about 6 2 l s fig 6a and b report the results of tests obtained with k 7 and k 10 respectively both values of k increase significantly the speed of the control action in comparison to k 3 fig 6a shows that the set point value of the pressure at the cn is achieved with relatively high accuracy instead fig 6b reveals that the assigned value of k 10 is unsuitably high in fact due to an excess of control reaction the control process shows pressure oscillations to occur results of the experiments with k 1 and k 5 are not shown in the paper however while the adoption of k 1 provided unsuitably slow reaction of the controller results with k 5 are intermediate between those obtained with k 3 and k 7 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 simulation of rtc experiments with the ball valve fully open in addition to the results of the experiments the previous figures report the corresponding results obtained with the simulation model simulation with k 1 fig 3 shows very good agreement between numerical and experimental results concerning the pressure values at the us slight differences in the pressure values are observed at the cn during the closure stage of the plunger valve for values of a 30 the figure shows that the model performs well also in the evaluation of the flow discharge with simulated values of q being slightly smaller than the measured values an excellent agreement of simulated and measured pressure values is obtained at the us for the simulation with k 3 fig 4a only minor differences between model and experimental results are observed at the cn during the control process for values of a between 30 and 40 in general although the control action is much faster in this test than in the test of fig 3 the model is able to interpret well the whole control process also in terms of flow discharge and opening degree of the plunger valve the results plotted in fig 4b k 4 highlight the steady state model capability to simulate correctly also the development of pressure over under shooting the simulated curve of a fits almost perfectly the measured values during both the initial closing stage and the successive phases of opening closure of the valve shutter before the set point achievement globally the analysis of the results for all the tests shows that use of the hypothesis of steady state allows to reproduce in a good way both pressures and flow discharge in the system table 1 reports for all the tests the value of the root mean square deviation rmse between observed and simulated values of pressure at the cn and flow discharge for the whole test duration the table shows that rmse values are in general relatively small thus confirming that the model is sufficiently good in describing correctly the whole control process evolution a separate case is represented by the test carried out with k 5 for which the worst agreement between model and experiments was obtained rmse p c n 0 875 bar because of the occurrence of pressure oscillations during the experiment 3 2 2 simulation of rtc experiments with the ball valve partially closed figs 5 and 6 report the simulation results for k 3 k 7 and k 10 respectively fig 5 shows a good agreement of simulations with the experiments similarly to the case shown in fig 3 the curve of a tends to provide simulated values slightly smaller than the experimental ones correspondingly the simulated flow discharge decreases earlier than the experimental flow discharge however the value of a achieved at the set point condition is well captured by the model similar considerations can be carried out for the test shown in fig 6a k 7 the curve of the flow discharge shows the model to provide differences with the experiments for values of a close to 30 in addition small differences between model and experiments are observed in the final stage of the control process also fig 6b k 10 shows that model and experiments agree very well for the first 2 min from the beginning of the test instead the model tends to amplify oscillations around the set point occurring in the final stage of the control process table 2 summarizes main results for all the tests carried out with the ball valve partially closed the table reports values of rmse rather similar to those of table 1 thus highlighting that the model performance is not affected significantly by the energy dissipation due to the ball valve 4 discussion the obtained results demonstrate the potential of application of closed loop remote rtc schemes for pressure control in the pilot system the larger costs of installation operation of closed loop remote rtc systems in wdns would be balanced by an expected increase in pressure control performance due to the real time use of pressure measurements in this concern closed loop schemes may take also advantage of use of models that may allow improved tuning of the regulator and design of the behaviour of the system specifically use of simulations can allow verifying the stability and performance of the control system in a wide range of conditions before field implementation it has to be stressed that the rtc system scheme adopted for the experiments is relatively simple as compared to control architectures that might be required for pressure regulation of complex wdns that are likely to include multiple controllers and multiple control nodes therefore the validity of the obtained results remains confined to the conditions and to the range of values of the parameters considered for the laboratory experiments globally the experiments show that under appropriate calibration the rtc system is able to adjust valve actuators in order to obtain proper control of pressure at the control node in this concern the results of the experiments deserve specific discussion as shown by the analysis the time needed to converge to the set point is affected by the used value of k although the plunger valve at the beginning of the experiments was open this is the most disadvantaged condition to achieve the set point the results show that time to drive the system to the set point is always in the order of a few minutes for any values of k this would demonstrate potential for adequate response of the rtc system in controlling pressure of real wdns where variations of the average water demand are typically much slower the tests conducted with the ball valve partially closed required values of k normally larger than those required for the tests with the ball valve fully open this result reveals the impact of the energy losses determined by the ball valve on the controller calibration in fact all initial conditions being equal pressures at the cn are always smaller when the ball valve is partially closed this determines smaller deviations from the set point and as a consequence of the used algorithm the need of using larger values of k to obtain a sufficiently quick reaction this finding confirms the literature results that show that controller calibration is site specific and is markedly affected by the geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the wdn e g by pipe friction losses between the site of the control valve and the site of the control node the analysis of the performance of the rtc system includes the evaluation of the accuracy of the control algorithm in converging to the set point as already introduced in the previous chapter the results of the experiments reported in figs 3 6 point out that the accuracy of the control algorithm in driving the system to the set point depends on different parameters including the valve shutter dead band the initial valve opening condition as well as the adopted value of k also introduction of filters such as the used procedure of pressure moving average may affect the performance of the closed loop galuppini et al 2019 in absence of dead band the adopted algorithm eq 1 coincides with a standard integral control algorithm remarkably due to the presence of background noise in the pressure signal both algorithms would determine continuous opening closure displacements of the valve around the set point therefore the adoption of a dead band in the control is somehow necessary to reduce ineffective displacements that can unusefully undermine the life of the valve when the dead band intervenes on the control action that is usually when the pressure approximates the set point value and calculated values of δ a are small the two algorithms behave differently specifically eq 1 forces the valve to stay stably inactive until δ a 0 6 with an unavoidable but stable error of the pressure with respect to the set point as shown in a clear way in fig 3 for example instead a standard integral controller would continue cumulating errors in the pressure ultimately leading the control system to circumvent the dead band under this condition the system may determine frequent valve opening closure displacements with consequent pressure fluctuations around the set point in line of principle replacing the dead band acting on the control signal with one acting on the pressure signal would increase the ease of calibration and the quality of the control it would sum zero errors to the integral action when the measured signal is within the dead band tian and tao 1997 galuppini et al 2018 however control inaccuracy due to the intrinsic precision of the valve mechanics cannot be avoided therefore based on previous remarks the value of the sensitivity of the valve with use of eq 1 should be small enough to approximate well the set point but sufficiently large to reduce the impact of high frequency pressure pulses on the control action another point of discussion concerns the dynamics of the control action the experiments have confirmed that any excess in the value assigned to k gives rise to unsuitable control characterized by the development of permanent pressure oscillations around the set point side to the bad pressure control permanent oscillations might condemn the control valve to continuous opening closure displacements in the attempt to lead the system to the set point therefore it is suggested to discard high values of the gain k in the calibration stage although this might go to detriment of the promptness of the control reaction notably in the experiments that were carried out values of k in the range 2 3 and in the range 5 7 are suitable to obtain a performant control of the plunger valve for the two sets of experiments described at sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively simulations carried out in this paper confirmed the suitability of schematizing the pressure control process as a succession of steady state conditions for all the experiments in fact although real time pressure control generates conditions of unsteady flow relevant effects in terms of development of pressure waves in the experimental pipeline were not detected such a result is determined by the relatively small speed of the valve shutter that provides times of opening closure displacements that are much larger than the characteristic travel time of pressure waves in the experimental pipeline remarkably implementation and related simulation of remote rtc in real wdns where travel times are much longer could require to set the speed of the valve shutter differently proper setting must assure both limitation of the magnitude of pressure waves and sufficient reactivity of the control system also the increase in the value of the control time step may be required in order to assure that transients resulting from the adjustments of the valve would disappear between successive regulations galuppini et al 2020 in support of this creaco et al 2017 by comparison with results of unsteady flow modeling confirmed that the assumption of stationary conditions with proper values of the control time is adequate for rtc applications focusing on leakage reduction in wdns although globally good results were obtained with the model in reproducing the experiments the results summarized in tables 1 and 2 reveal that the increase in the value of the gain may go at detriment of model predictive performance for instance fig 6b shows that the highest value of the gain k 10 determines larger overshoot undershoot of the pressure as compared to the experimental measurement when the system is close to the set point this result reveals that the discrepancy between model and experiments is unavoidably amplified by the high values of the gain that acts as multiplier of the pressure deviation from the set point 5 conclusions in this paper the results of experiments carried out in a laboratory pilot system were analyzed in order to show potential for application of remote rtc in controlling pressure in wdns remote rtc was applied to control the pressure in the pilot system by adjusting in real time the opening closure of a motorized plunger valve based on remote measurements of pressure acquired in real time an integral type algorithm was considered for the implementation of the closed loop control of the valve a numerical model of the laboratory system was used for the preliminary setup of the pilot and for the simulation of the pressure rtc process main results of the analysis include the following points the experimental tests have shown that under appropriate calibration the considered remote rtc architecture allows for effective control of the pressure in the pilot system this result opens research perspectives to further test remote rtc systems for leakage management in real wdns using architectures of closed loop control thanks to the limited speed of the valve shutter action non stationary effects in terms of development of pressure waves during the experimental tests in the pilot system were proven negligible however the transferability of the rtc system to real wdns could require limiting further the valve speed due to the expected longer wave travel times proper rtc implementation in the field may require to increase the value of the control time to assure that the valve control would not be affected by eventual pressure wave reflections longer control time steps in the order of few minutes and adoption of a dead band for small valve displacements may allow also limiting the number of valve openings closures during the 24 h thus increasing the valve life without reducing the system effectiveness in leakage control the experiments revealed that appropriate values of k may assure a performant control with values of the achieved pressure and of the system reactivity compatible with the objective of water leakage reduction in wdns smaller values of the gain k may be required in field applications in relation to the potential increase in the control time the simulations revealed the suitability of schematizing the pressure control process as a succession of steady state conditions for all the experiments comparison between model and experiments showed high values of k may decrease the model predictive performance subject to proper selection of control time use of the proposed simulation approach may allow the evaluation of benefits of remote rtc implementation in the reduction of leakage in wdns models based on the steady state hypothesis can also be of help for

17751,experimental tests were performed to demonstrate applicability of remote real time control rtc of pressures for leakage reduction in water distribution networks wdns the experimental tests were carried out in a laboratory pilot system equipped with a motorized plunger valve a rtc system with the adoption of an integral type control algorithm was implemented in order to adjust the valve on the basis of pressure measurements acquired in real time a numerical model of the pilot system was used to verify the suitability of the hypothesis of steady state conditions in simulating the laboratory tests the results of the experiments show that under appropriate calibration of the control algorithm the rtc system is able to perform effective control of the pressure comparison between results of the simulations and experiments reveals that the steady state model describes correctly the evolution of the pressure control processes observed in the laboratory pilot system thus opening perspectives for testing remote rtc schemes for leakage management in real wdns graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution systems remote real time control pressure control control valve 1 introduction active control of pressure is considered as one of the most promising methodologies to reduce water leakages in water distribution networks wdns araujo et al 2006 creaco and walski 2017 evidence has amply proven that the increase in background losses such as the leakage from pipe breaks joints etc is markedly correlated to the increase in operational pressure in the pipes of the distribution network thornton 2002 ciaponi et al 2015 traditional pressure reduction methods generally make use of pressure control valves pcvs normal practice is to install such devices at the inlets to the districts of the wdn and to set them properly in order to lower the piezometric level of the whole district thornton 2002 typically pcvs are used for local control with the objective of achieve and maintain the desired pressure set point locally at the site of installation immediately at the outlet of the valve pressure set point can be constant or vary during the day according to prefixed time scheduling most common types of pcvs include mechanically hydraulically driven devices that need to be calibrated in situ usually by adjustment of a secondary screw based pilot valve as a function of pressure prescott and ulanicki 2008 nicolini and zovatto 2009 abdelmeguid et al 2011 alternatively the valve can be adjusted on the basis of pressure measurements using electronic controllers janus and ulanicki 2018 in principle controlling pcvs according to local values of pressure does not assure proper control of the piezometric levels of the downstream wdn in fact such a type of control is significantly affected by the uncertainty in the estimation of the spatio temporal distribution of nodal water demands leakages as well as energy losses in the wdn recently focusing on leakage reduction various researchers campisano et al 2016 berardi et al 2017 page et al 2017a have explored the potential of methodologies based on the use of remote real time control rtc for improving pressure regulation in wdns depending on the network characteristics rtc systems can suitably replace traditional pressure control strategies by moving from local to remote control technologies creaco and walski 2018 indeed remote rtc systems use distributed remote information about the current status of the wdn in order to improve the effectiveness of pressure and thus leakage control strategies typically one or more pressure sensors are installed in the network in nodes that are far remote from the valve site normally such nodes are placed in the downstream part of the district selected among those with low pressure campisano et al 2010 information obtained by the continuous acquisition of remote pressure measurements is transmitted through a specific communication infrastructure in real time normally using gsm or dedicated radio lines being finally used to adjust dynamically the upstream control valves campisano et al 2010 giustolisi et al 2017 rtc is implemented by means of controllers devices that based on information received by the sensors in the network calculate and provide commands to valve actuators in order to adjust the flow process and drive control node pressure to the set point much of the available studies on rtc e g campisano et al 2010 giustolisi et al 2017 page et al 2017b creaco et al 2018 have mainly invoked use of simulation approaches to demonstrate advantages of remote control as compared to local control some approaches janus and ulanicki 2018 galuppini et al 2019 consider use of sophisticated methods proper of control engineering with a focus on system design in order to control pressure signals in wdns including high frequency components such type of approach aims at accurate control of pressure signals determined by pulsed demands in the wdn however tracking such signals requires control frequency that may be incompatible with the valve operation or increase malfunctioning failure of the valve itself conversely other approaches focus on the hydraulic objective of reducing water leakages in the wdn to achieve this objective the control of the low frequency pressure component associated to the daily pattern of the water demands in the network has been recognized as sufficiently accurate campisano et al 2016 creaco et al 2019 in such a context simulations have been carried out to test performances of various control algorithms that include hydraulics based algorithms abdelmeguid et al 2011 giustolisi et al 2017 and algorithms based on the use of pid proportional integral derivative logic a complete review of available algorithms for remote rtc of pressure in wdns can be found in the recent work by creaco et al 2019 pid is probably the most widespread type of control logic in embedded programmable logic controllers plcs owing to its conceptual simplicity and the opportunity for the continuous adaptation to the controlled system åström and hägglund 1984 this type of control has been used in various modalities in the field of water engineering for the control of both urban drainage systems campisano et al 2000 schuetze et al 2004 pothof and kooij 2007 and water distribution systems results from the literature show that effective valve control in wdns can be obtained by adopting algorithms which do not necessary include all the three terms of the complete standard pid in any case accurate calibration of the used algorithm is required campisano et al 2012 ziegler and nichols 1942 creaco and franchini 2013 creaco 2017 page and creaco 2019 report improvements in the control action with algorithms that include use of simultaneous measurements of pressure and flow discharge although at higher costs and complexity of implementation although the potential for application of remote rtc in wdns was explored by various studies much of these studies were carried out using numerical approaches conversely up to now only few investigations have concerned the development of experiments to evaluate the rtc potential at the laboratory and or field scales an example of laboratory application is provided by fontana et al 2018a which developed an integral i control algorithm to adjust settings of a pilot valve operated pcv the same authors tested with success the developed algorithm in a district of the wdn of the city of benevento italy fontana et al 2018b confirming suitable pressure control and water leakage reduction in the network however the control system adopted by the authors was not fully implemented as a scheme of remote rtc in fact such control system adjusts the outlet pressure of the valve by using an empirical model of the network to estimate head losses between the site of the pcv and the remote control node a very similar approach was used by bakker et al 2014 for the dynamic control of flows and pressures in poznań poland through performing real time adjustment of pumps settings also in this case a pressure demand model of the network was calibrated offline and used for determining the settings of the pumps therefore the approaches adopted in previous papers are not based on the use of pressure measurements transmitted in real time from the network to the control site with regard to the used control such approaches make use of a closed loop scheme for controlling local pressure at the valve site while relying on the use of an open loop for the control of pressure at the remote node in principle if the relationship between local and remote pressure is not modeled properly even a good regulation of local pressure might not assure effective control at the remote node in these cases large network portions may exhibit pressure excess deficit during the day as compared to set point values the objective of this paper is twofold novel experiments were carried out in a pilot rig at the laboratory scale to verify applicability and effectiveness of remote rtc for pressure control with reference to leakage reduction in wdns remote rtc was implemented by adjusting in real time the opening degree of a motorized plunger valve differently from previous literature studies the valve control is based exclusively on pressure measurements acquired in remote and transmitted in real time using a closed loop control scheme as further objective the paper aims at demonstrating the suitability of the hypothesis of steady state conditions to simulate the rtc laboratory experiments to achieve this objective an already available numerical hydraulic model of the pilot system was upgraded with a control module and used for both the preliminary tuning of the controller and the successive simulations the paper is structured in sections first the experimental methods are presented including the description of the laboratory pilot system the implemented rtc system architecture the framework of the experiments as well as the used numerical model secondly results of the different experiments are presented with specific emphasis on the pressure control performance of the rtc system third simulation results are discussed and compared with results of the experiments to demonstrate the suitability of the steady state hypothesis for the simulation of real time pressure control for leakage reduction finally the discussion concerning the analysis of the results is reported including potential and limitations of the used approach followed by main conclusions of the research and future perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the laboratory pilot system the pilot system was installed at the laboratory of hydraulics of the department of civil engineering and architecture of the university of catania italy the system mainly consists of 4 sub systems i an upstream head tank equipped with a pump outside the laboratory room ii the adduction pipe section from the pump to the laboratory room iii the pipe section of interest for the experiments and iv the recirculation system to convey back flow to the upstream tank the upstream tank has a maximum storage capacity of about 70 m3 and is supplied by the university campus water distribution system the pump allows maximum head of about 85 m and maximum flow discharge close to 25 l s the adduction pipe is a 33 m long iron pipe with nominal diameter dn100 and conveys the pumped flow to the section of interest for the experiments the pipe shows significant internal corrosion typical of water distribution network pipes in operation by several years estimated strickler roughness coefficient close to 70 m1 3 s the section of interest for the experiments has the same geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the adduction pipe the section see the sketch of fig 1 is made of a vertical ascending segment equipped with a gate valve operated manually an intermediate sub horizontal segment 3 slope equipped with the instrumentation for pressure control and a final vertical descending segment equipped with another manual gate valve that conveys the flow to the recirculation system all monitoring and control equipment is installed in the intermediate segment in detail going from upstream to downstream the segment hosts a valve for air purge an upstream sensor of pressure later in the text indicated as us an electromagnetic flowmeter dn80 the motorized plunger valve used for controlling the pressure a ball valve dn100 a downstream pressure sensor mounted in the section that was identified as the remote control node cn an additional air purge valve pressure sensors are piezo resistive probes with a range of measurement 0 10 bar full scale error 0 003 resolution 0 1 of full scale and analogic output 4 20 ma the electromagnetic flowmeter allows measurement of the flow discharge in the range 0 8 80 l s with errors in the order of 1 and 0 5 for flow velocities between 0 1 and 0 5 m s and 0 5 10 0 m s respectively the plunger valve is dn80 mm in size although this type of valve requires higher electric power than other mechanical pcvs field experience shows that it allows accurate flow and pressure control in wdns two short conic converging and diverging trunks were used as joints between the plunger valve and the pipe dn100 fig 2 shows the curve of the valve resistivity ξ p l u n g e r as a function of the opening degree of the valve shutter a the valve provides a value of ξ p l u n g e r 3 1 when the valve is fully open an electric actuator equipped with both reduction group and multi turn device is coupled to the plunger valve the actuator enables the possibility to adjust the opening closure degree of the valve shutter by receiving signals from an external control unit for example signals sent by a remote plc specific electronic devices mounted on board also allow analogic transmission of torque values and position of the valve shutter at any instant of the control action the ball valve dn100 was used in the experiments to emulate energy losses determined by the network when the remote control node is far from the control valve site since the energy loss as induced by the ball valve varies with the conveyed flow the valve may locally replicate the impact of the distributed energy loss in wdns thus allowing emulating properly losses due to the variability of water demands finally the gate valves dn100 placed in the two vertical segments were used to setup the initial condition of the pilot system to determine appropriate flow discharge and pressure values in the system for the different experimental tests developed 2 2 control system structure and algorithm the control system was structured adopting a closed loop scheme of remote rtc to control pressures in the laboratory pilot the system includes use of a plc that collects all the measurements acquired by the pressure sensors and by the flowmeter the plc allows also addressing control commands to the actuator of the plunger valve by means of analog signals in the range 0 20 ma a digital clock supports real time operation of the control system enabling run times smaller than 0 7 ms a personal computer connected to the plc monitors the control process in real time and stores the acquired measurements i e the recorded values of pressure flow discharge and opening degree of the valve shutter labview software travis and kring 2006 was used as it allows easy implementation of algorithms for the valve control using input signals from the plc from a practical viewpoint the objective of the control algorithm is to adjust step by step the setting of the valve shutter i e determine the needed energy dissipation at the valve site in order to drive the pressure at the remote cn to the set point therefore the pressure value p t bar at time t provided by the sensor at the control node was used for the algorithm application notably at each time step δ t c of the control action the adopted algorithm adjusts the valve provides the displacement δ a of the valve shutter based on the deviation e t p t p s p bar at time t between p t and the set point pressure p s p bar as 1 δ a a t δ t c a t k e t where a t and a t δ t c are the valve shutter opening degrees at times t and t δ t c being a 100 when the valve is fully open previous equation shows the shutter displacement δ a to be proportional to e t by means of the gain parameter k percent bar therefore in principle with respect to the shutter position a eq 1 shows the characteristics of an integral type control algorithm moreover the negative sign in eq 1 allows considering the negative relationship between δ a and e t if gain k is assumed intrinsically positive in principle the integral action would ensure achievement of the set point if no derivative action is present and in presence of step reference signals and step process disturbances galuppini et al 2019 the gain k plays an important role on the dynamics of the control system and must be calibrated to assure effective control actions calibration might result in a very complex operation for wdns because of the significant non linearity in the response of the network to flow variations nodal demand changes in time and space another parameter having significant impact on the performance of the rtc system is the control time step δ t c selection of the value of this parameter strictly depends on the control objective and should be consistent with the characteristic time of the process and with the used k value galuppini et al 2020 in particular for the control of water leakage in wdns the choice of δ t c can be conveniently related to the low frequency component of the pressure signal typically varying accordingly to the hourly demand pattern in the network the new value a t δ t c as evaluated by eq 1 is prescribed to the valve in case that a m i n a t δ t c a m a x being a m i n and a m a x the smallest and the largest values allowed for the valve opening degree respectively while a m i n is normally suggested by the manufacturer in order to avoid cavitation a m a x is generally equal to 100 since the adoption of a m i n and a m a x determines the saturation of the control action an anti windup approach was implemented to avoid pressure overshoots undershoots this was obtained by prescribing a t δ t c a m i n to the valve if eq 1 provides a t δ t c a m i n and a t δ t c a m a x in the case that a t δ t c a m a x 2 3 framework of the experiments setting of the rtc system required devoting attention to several aspects that are relevant to the control performance firstly the motorized plunger valve was set in order to assure a relatively low value of the opening closing velocity of the shutter 2 2 of the total run per second thus determining pressure waves of negligible effect used setting allows a full closure of the valve in about 45 5 s in addition by default settings the valve has a sensitivity of 0 6 i e it remains inactive for values of δ a 0 6 such sensitivity is determined by the intrinsic electro mechanical accuracy of the valve and of the actuator i e the smallest possible displacement of the shutter according to reduction group and multi turn device notably this determines the occurrence of a dead band of the shutter position a with effects of various extent on the accuracy of the pressure regulation all the sensors pressure and flow discharge were calibrated to provide measurements with time step of acquisition δ t a of 1 s that is measurements of pressure and flow discharge were sent to the plc on every 1 s based on criteria discussed in the previous section and in agreement to results from the literature e g creaco et al 2018 page et al 2017b the control time δ t c for the experiments was fixed to 30 s the chosen control time is sufficiently high to reduce the number of shutter movements of the control valve thus assuring adequate lifespan of the valve itself for practical applications conversely high frequency fluctuations of the pressure signal were disregarded considering their negligible impact on leakage levels in wdns however an operator of mobile average was used in order to reduce the impact on the control performance of background noise in the pressure signal pressure fluctuation due to the turbulent flow in the pipe mounce et al 2012 campisano et al 2015 in particular the value of pressure p t used for the estimation of e t was evaluated as average of the ten final pressure values acquired by the plc during each δ t c mobile average allowed obtaining effective valve control as the regulation was little impacted by random pressure pulses in general the experiments were carried out to explore two main conditions of operation of the pilot system corresponding to tests conducted i with the ball valve fully open and ii with the ball valve partially closed details of the two types of tests are described in the next subsections 2 3 1 tests with the ball valve fully open modalities to perform such tests are described as follows preliminarily the pump was switched on and the upstream gate valve mounted in the vertical ascending segment of the pipe was fully opened contextually opening of the air purge valves in the whole pipeline allowed purging eventual air pockets residing in the section of interest then the downstream gate valve was adjusted in order to achieve stationary flow conditions characterized by values of flow discharge and pressure at the us close to 9 l s and to 7 bar respectively the set point value of the cn pressure was fixed to 3 bar for all the tests each rtc test was carried out assuming the plunger valve to be open at the beginning of the experiment the objective of the tests was to drive the pressure at the cn to the set point in a relatively quick but gradual way avoiding over under shootings of the pressure and occurrence of oscillations around the set point the tests were carried out with different values of the gain k a trial and error procedure based on preliminary experiments and simulations with the used model described later in the paper was applied to identify the proper range of k values for controller tuning accordingly 5 tests were carried out with k values of 1 2 3 4 and 5 simulations with the used model were carried out also to investigate the sampling time and to test preliminarily the stability of the scheme with different values of the flow in the pipe galuppini et al 2020 2 3 2 tests with the ball valve partially closed these tests were carried out by closing partially the ball valve in order to determine an energy dissipation that emulates the friction energy losses occurring in the network between the control valve and the remote cn the same operational modalities described at the previous sub section were adopted for these tests however this time the partial closure of the ball valve determined a drop down of the initial pressure value at the cn to about 4 5 bar globally also in this case 5 tests were carried out to evaluate the control performance obtained by use of remote rtc preliminary trials and simulations to identify the proper range of k allowed selecting gain values of 1 3 5 7 and 10 for these tests sampling time and stability of the scheme under different flow conditions were also investigated 2 4 hydraulic model for simulation analysis the adopted model is based on the use of the equation of the energy conservation and describes the evolution of the process of pressure control as a succession of stationary states hypothesis of stationary conditions used for modeling the process at each simulation time step was considered consistent to valve opening closure speed under rtc that is low enough to neglect the effects of perturbations of unsteady flow in the system the presence of the upstream pump is modeled by means of the head discharge curve 2 h α q 3 β q 2 γ q δ where h bar is the hydraulic head determined by the pump q m3 s is the flow discharge and α 9 20 10 4 β 2 05 10 2 γ 12 96 and δ 8 49 are the curve parameters the total loss of energy δ h t r u n k bar determined by the trunk of the adduction pipe as well as by several singularities from the pump to the section of the us is calculated globally as 3 δ h t r u n k c t r u n k q 2 2 g a 2 where the non dimensional coefficient c t r u n k 14 7 was determined experimentally by previous tests carried out under stationary conditions g m s2 is the gravity acceleration and a m2 is the cross sectional area of the pipe coupled use of eqs 2 and 3 allows calculating the value of the pressure p u s bar at the section of the us once that the value of q m3 s is known the model evaluates the friction losses in the various pipe segments δ h p i p e bar on the basis of the strickler relationship 4 δ h p i p e 1 01 q 2 k s 2 d 16 3 l where k s m1 3 s is the pipe friction coefficient by strickler d m is the pipe diameter and l m is the length of the segment moreover local energy losses due to pipe bends δ h b e n d bar are evaluated by the model as 5 δ h b e n d c b e n d q 2 2 g a 2 where coefficient c b e n d is assumed equal to 0 020 brater and king 1976 similarly energy losses δ h c o n v d i v bar due to the converging diverging trunks respectively upstream downstream of the plunger valve are evaluated based on the relationship 6 δ h c o n v d i v c c o n v d i v q 2 2 g a 2 where c c o n v d i v is assumed equal to 0 010 and 0 025 for the converging and the diverging trunks respectively brater and king 1976 the model allows to simulate the effect of the presence of the various types of valves installed in the pipe by considering the flow head loss δ h v a l v e bar generated locally by such devices the following general relationship is used 7 δ h v a l v e ξ q 2 2 g a 2 being ξ the valve resistivity to the flow notably ξ ξ g a t e for the two gate valves placed in the vertical segments while ξ ξ b a l l for the ball valve the values of ξ g a t e and ξ b a l l were previously determined as a function of their respective opening degrees the value of the resistivity of the plunger valve ξ p l u n g e r a was calculated as a function of the valve opening degree a fig 2 such resistivity value may change on every time step of the simulation δ t s if the rtc algorithm modifies the value of a at each simulation time step δ t s the energy conservation equation together with eqs 2 7 and eq 1 allows to determine flow discharge and pressures in the cross sections of the pipe in which pressure sensors are installed thus enabling appropriate comparison with the measurements recorded during the experiments for the application of the model the solution of the system of equations required prescribing the pressure at the downstream outlet of the pilot system the pressure value at this section was fixed equal to zero since the water freely flows out from the pipe in the recirculation open channel the value of δ t s was assumed equal to 1 s equal to δ t a for obvious reasons of comparison between model and experiments the solution of the described system of equations is based on the following steps at every δ t s 1 an initial value of the flow discharge unknown variable is assumed 2 the pressure p u s at the us is calculated by coupled use of eqs 2 and 3 3 head losses in the pipe are calculated by using eqs 4 7 and subtracted to the obtained value of p u s 4 the head loss due to the plunger valve eq 7 is determined based on the current value of the opening degree a t for times t of the simulation that do not coincide to the control time step δ t c or to a multiple of δ t c conversely the same head loss is calculated based on the new value a t δ t c as obtained by eq 1 in this case the shutter displacement for each δ t s is determined by taking into account the physical constraints due to the mechanical speed of the shutter 5 the pressure at the outlet section is calculated and steps 1 5 are repeated with new flow discharge values until the outlet pressure is equal to zero 3 results 3 1 results of the experiments 3 1 1 rtc tests with the ball valve fully open the experimental results concerning the rtc tests carried out with k 1 are reported in the graph of fig 3 the figure shows measured pressures at both us and cn during the whole experiment the pressure set point value is reported in the figure for comparison the figure also reports values of the flow discharge q and of the opening degree a of the plunger valve during the test results show that the control algorithm in this case allows to achieve the set point in approximate way since it lowers pressure at the cn from the initial value about 7 3 bar down to about 3 5 bar in about 9 min the discrepancy between the achieved pressure and the desired set point depends on the amplitude of the dead band of the valve shutter on the adopted value of the gain k and on the initial opening of the valve details on this aspect are deferred to the discussion section the cn pressure starts reducing appreciably only about 5 min after the beginning of the experiment that is after that the control system has reduced sufficiently the opening degree of the plunger valve to about 40 opening conversely during the initial minutes of the test when the valve is still rather open the plunger valve does not affect the pressure control process in a significant way the graph shows the pressure at the cn to decrease by sharp steps occurring synchronically to valve shutter closures notably for each displacement of the shutter the time of action of the valve is about 2 s long while the shutter remains inactive for the rest of the control time step for about 28 s the values of a decrease during time down to about 21 at the end of the test due to the increasing energy loss determined by the successive closure steps of the plunger valve flow discharge circulating in the pipeline decreases from about 9 2 l s to about 6 5 l s at the end of the test records at the us shows pressure to increase as the opening degree of the valve decreases the valve sustains the pressure in the upstream pipe segment however pressure increment is relatively small from 7 3 bar to about 7 8 bar as the characteristic curve of the pump is rather flat although in principle the valve control determines conditions of unsteady flow the results of the experiment do not highlight the development of pressure waves in the pipeline instead the experiment reveals the presence of noise at high frequency mainly due to the flow turbulence that disturbs experimental pressure and flow discharge signals fig 4 a shows the results obtained with k 3 the adopted value of k determines a faster reaction of the control system as compared to the case of fig 3 thus allowing a more rapid convergence to the set point in about 2 5 min incidentally this time the set point is achieved with relatively high accuracy due to a favorable combination of the effects of the dead band with the used value of k and of the initial valve opening condition moreover as expected the increased value of k determines steps of a of larger magnitude as compared to previous case fig 4b shows the results obtained with k 4 in this case the interesting result is that the used k value determines the development of pressure under over shooting around the set point with the pressure that achieves values down to about 2 5 bar at the cn however after a few oscillations the system achieves after about 4 5 min a pressure value very close to the set point results of the experiments with k 2 and k 5 are not shown in the paper for brevity as expected use of k 2 provided intermediate results between k 1 and 3 while use of k 5 further increased under over shooting of the pressure 3 1 2 rtc tests with the ball valve partially closed some of the results of the experimental tests carried out with the ball valve partially closed are summarized in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 reports the results of the test performed using the value k 3 such value enables direct comparison of the results of this test with those provided in previous fig 4a thus showing the impact of the energy losses determined by the ball valve on the control process the results show that the rtc system allows leading the initial value of the pressure at the cn from about 4 5 bar to the set point in an accurate way however the lower initial value of the pressure at the cn leads to shutter displacement corrections of lesser extent as compared to fig 4a and therefore to slow down the whole control process the set point is achieved in about 9 min fig 5 also shows that the plunger valve closes from 100 to about 23 opening degree while the flow discharge decreases from about 7 4 l s down to about 6 2 l s fig 6a and b report the results of tests obtained with k 7 and k 10 respectively both values of k increase significantly the speed of the control action in comparison to k 3 fig 6a shows that the set point value of the pressure at the cn is achieved with relatively high accuracy instead fig 6b reveals that the assigned value of k 10 is unsuitably high in fact due to an excess of control reaction the control process shows pressure oscillations to occur results of the experiments with k 1 and k 5 are not shown in the paper however while the adoption of k 1 provided unsuitably slow reaction of the controller results with k 5 are intermediate between those obtained with k 3 and k 7 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 simulation of rtc experiments with the ball valve fully open in addition to the results of the experiments the previous figures report the corresponding results obtained with the simulation model simulation with k 1 fig 3 shows very good agreement between numerical and experimental results concerning the pressure values at the us slight differences in the pressure values are observed at the cn during the closure stage of the plunger valve for values of a 30 the figure shows that the model performs well also in the evaluation of the flow discharge with simulated values of q being slightly smaller than the measured values an excellent agreement of simulated and measured pressure values is obtained at the us for the simulation with k 3 fig 4a only minor differences between model and experimental results are observed at the cn during the control process for values of a between 30 and 40 in general although the control action is much faster in this test than in the test of fig 3 the model is able to interpret well the whole control process also in terms of flow discharge and opening degree of the plunger valve the results plotted in fig 4b k 4 highlight the steady state model capability to simulate correctly also the development of pressure over under shooting the simulated curve of a fits almost perfectly the measured values during both the initial closing stage and the successive phases of opening closure of the valve shutter before the set point achievement globally the analysis of the results for all the tests shows that use of the hypothesis of steady state allows to reproduce in a good way both pressures and flow discharge in the system table 1 reports for all the tests the value of the root mean square deviation rmse between observed and simulated values of pressure at the cn and flow discharge for the whole test duration the table shows that rmse values are in general relatively small thus confirming that the model is sufficiently good in describing correctly the whole control process evolution a separate case is represented by the test carried out with k 5 for which the worst agreement between model and experiments was obtained rmse p c n 0 875 bar because of the occurrence of pressure oscillations during the experiment 3 2 2 simulation of rtc experiments with the ball valve partially closed figs 5 and 6 report the simulation results for k 3 k 7 and k 10 respectively fig 5 shows a good agreement of simulations with the experiments similarly to the case shown in fig 3 the curve of a tends to provide simulated values slightly smaller than the experimental ones correspondingly the simulated flow discharge decreases earlier than the experimental flow discharge however the value of a achieved at the set point condition is well captured by the model similar considerations can be carried out for the test shown in fig 6a k 7 the curve of the flow discharge shows the model to provide differences with the experiments for values of a close to 30 in addition small differences between model and experiments are observed in the final stage of the control process also fig 6b k 10 shows that model and experiments agree very well for the first 2 min from the beginning of the test instead the model tends to amplify oscillations around the set point occurring in the final stage of the control process table 2 summarizes main results for all the tests carried out with the ball valve partially closed the table reports values of rmse rather similar to those of table 1 thus highlighting that the model performance is not affected significantly by the energy dissipation due to the ball valve 4 discussion the obtained results demonstrate the potential of application of closed loop remote rtc schemes for pressure control in the pilot system the larger costs of installation operation of closed loop remote rtc systems in wdns would be balanced by an expected increase in pressure control performance due to the real time use of pressure measurements in this concern closed loop schemes may take also advantage of use of models that may allow improved tuning of the regulator and design of the behaviour of the system specifically use of simulations can allow verifying the stability and performance of the control system in a wide range of conditions before field implementation it has to be stressed that the rtc system scheme adopted for the experiments is relatively simple as compared to control architectures that might be required for pressure regulation of complex wdns that are likely to include multiple controllers and multiple control nodes therefore the validity of the obtained results remains confined to the conditions and to the range of values of the parameters considered for the laboratory experiments globally the experiments show that under appropriate calibration the rtc system is able to adjust valve actuators in order to obtain proper control of pressure at the control node in this concern the results of the experiments deserve specific discussion as shown by the analysis the time needed to converge to the set point is affected by the used value of k although the plunger valve at the beginning of the experiments was open this is the most disadvantaged condition to achieve the set point the results show that time to drive the system to the set point is always in the order of a few minutes for any values of k this would demonstrate potential for adequate response of the rtc system in controlling pressure of real wdns where variations of the average water demand are typically much slower the tests conducted with the ball valve partially closed required values of k normally larger than those required for the tests with the ball valve fully open this result reveals the impact of the energy losses determined by the ball valve on the controller calibration in fact all initial conditions being equal pressures at the cn are always smaller when the ball valve is partially closed this determines smaller deviations from the set point and as a consequence of the used algorithm the need of using larger values of k to obtain a sufficiently quick reaction this finding confirms the literature results that show that controller calibration is site specific and is markedly affected by the geometrical and hydraulic characteristics of the wdn e g by pipe friction losses between the site of the control valve and the site of the control node the analysis of the performance of the rtc system includes the evaluation of the accuracy of the control algorithm in converging to the set point as already introduced in the previous chapter the results of the experiments reported in figs 3 6 point out that the accuracy of the control algorithm in driving the system to the set point depends on different parameters including the valve shutter dead band the initial valve opening condition as well as the adopted value of k also introduction of filters such as the used procedure of pressure moving average may affect the performance of the closed loop galuppini et al 2019 in absence of dead band the adopted algorithm eq 1 coincides with a standard integral control algorithm remarkably due to the presence of background noise in the pressure signal both algorithms would determine continuous opening closure displacements of the valve around the set point therefore the adoption of a dead band in the control is somehow necessary to reduce ineffective displacements that can unusefully undermine the life of the valve when the dead band intervenes on the control action that is usually when the pressure approximates the set point value and calculated values of δ a are small the two algorithms behave differently specifically eq 1 forces the valve to stay stably inactive until δ a 0 6 with an unavoidable but stable error of the pressure with respect to the set point as shown in a clear way in fig 3 for example instead a standard integral controller would continue cumulating errors in the pressure ultimately leading the control system to circumvent the dead band under this condition the system may determine frequent valve opening closure displacements with consequent pressure fluctuations around the set point in line of principle replacing the dead band acting on the control signal with one acting on the pressure signal would increase the ease of calibration and the quality of the control it would sum zero errors to the integral action when the measured signal is within the dead band tian and tao 1997 galuppini et al 2018 however control inaccuracy due to the intrinsic precision of the valve mechanics cannot be avoided therefore based on previous remarks the value of the sensitivity of the valve with use of eq 1 should be small enough to approximate well the set point but sufficiently large to reduce the impact of high frequency pressure pulses on the control action another point of discussion concerns the dynamics of the control action the experiments have confirmed that any excess in the value assigned to k gives rise to unsuitable control characterized by the development of permanent pressure oscillations around the set point side to the bad pressure control permanent oscillations might condemn the control valve to continuous opening closure displacements in the attempt to lead the system to the set point therefore it is suggested to discard high values of the gain k in the calibration stage although this might go to detriment of the promptness of the control reaction notably in the experiments that were carried out values of k in the range 2 3 and in the range 5 7 are suitable to obtain a performant control of the plunger valve for the two sets of experiments described at sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively simulations carried out in this paper confirmed the suitability of schematizing the pressure control process as a succession of steady state conditions for all the experiments in fact although real time pressure control generates conditions of unsteady flow relevant effects in terms of development of pressure waves in the experimental pipeline were not detected such a result is determined by the relatively small speed of the valve shutter that provides times of opening closure displacements that are much larger than the characteristic travel time of pressure waves in the experimental pipeline remarkably implementation and related simulation of remote rtc in real wdns where travel times are much longer could require to set the speed of the valve shutter differently proper setting must assure both limitation of the magnitude of pressure waves and sufficient reactivity of the control system also the increase in the value of the control time step may be required in order to assure that transients resulting from the adjustments of the valve would disappear between successive regulations galuppini et al 2020 in support of this creaco et al 2017 by comparison with results of unsteady flow modeling confirmed that the assumption of stationary conditions with proper values of the control time is adequate for rtc applications focusing on leakage reduction in wdns although globally good results were obtained with the model in reproducing the experiments the results summarized in tables 1 and 2 reveal that the increase in the value of the gain may go at detriment of model predictive performance for instance fig 6b shows that the highest value of the gain k 10 determines larger overshoot undershoot of the pressure as compared to the experimental measurement when the system is close to the set point this result reveals that the discrepancy between model and experiments is unavoidably amplified by the high values of the gain that acts as multiplier of the pressure deviation from the set point 5 conclusions in this paper the results of experiments carried out in a laboratory pilot system were analyzed in order to show potential for application of remote rtc in controlling pressure in wdns remote rtc was applied to control the pressure in the pilot system by adjusting in real time the opening closure of a motorized plunger valve based on remote measurements of pressure acquired in real time an integral type algorithm was considered for the implementation of the closed loop control of the valve a numerical model of the laboratory system was used for the preliminary setup of the pilot and for the simulation of the pressure rtc process main results of the analysis include the following points the experimental tests have shown that under appropriate calibration the considered remote rtc architecture allows for effective control of the pressure in the pilot system this result opens research perspectives to further test remote rtc systems for leakage management in real wdns using architectures of closed loop control thanks to the limited speed of the valve shutter action non stationary effects in terms of development of pressure waves during the experimental tests in the pilot system were proven negligible however the transferability of the rtc system to real wdns could require limiting further the valve speed due to the expected longer wave travel times proper rtc implementation in the field may require to increase the value of the control time to assure that the valve control would not be affected by eventual pressure wave reflections longer control time steps in the order of few minutes and adoption of a dead band for small valve displacements may allow also limiting the number of valve openings closures during the 24 h thus increasing the valve life without reducing the system effectiveness in leakage control the experiments revealed that appropriate values of k may assure a performant control with values of the achieved pressure and of the system reactivity compatible with the objective of water leakage reduction in wdns smaller values of the gain k may be required in field applications in relation to the potential increase in the control time the simulations revealed the suitability of schematizing the pressure control process as a succession of steady state conditions for all the experiments comparison between model and experiments showed high values of k may decrease the model predictive performance subject to proper selection of control time use of the proposed simulation approach may allow the evaluation of benefits of remote rtc implementation in the reduction of leakage in wdns models based on the steady state hypothesis can also be of help for

17752,the footprints of microplastics in the water bodies of urban agglomerations are largely dominated by superimposed anthropogenic influences understanding these influences and how they are correlated is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different ecosystems this study longitudinally assessed the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the water bodies of urban agglomerations at the watershed scale in shanghai megacity particularly the behavior of microplastics with the impacts of drainage system overflow in wet weather wwf land uses and environmental management practices were explored wwf can greatly aggravate microplastic pollution in aquatic environments a systemic estimation based on detailed data was used to show that the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf in the watershed area was 8 50 1014 p year which was approximately six times larger than that discharged via the local wastewater treatment plant effluent findings here contribute to research concerning the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics and the extent to which they are affected by land use in descending order the highest microplastic concentrations were found in heavy industrial commercial public recreational agricultural light industrial agricultural and residential areas the longitudinal pattern of microplastics observed in the water bodies suggested that there were superimposed effects of land use and hydrodynamics this paper is the first to provide an integrated framework that demonstrates the significant role of environmental management practices in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters at a city scale improved management of wwf might be a tangible solution that would help achieve an immediate and large scale reduction of microplastics in sewage determining the optimized management practices for different weather or hydrological conditions could be an essential factor in decreasing microplastic concentrations and altering their flow path pattern in a given region graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic urban agglomeration water bodies drainage system overflow catchment land use environmental management 1 introduction microplastics are human made polymer products or residues that are less than 5 mm in diameter with microplastic pollution increasing globally they have been a focal point of emerging pollutant research over the last decade andrady 2011 overproduction of plastics as well as their widespread use and improper disposal has led to the ubiquitous presence of this tiny plastic debris in various aquatic and terrestrial systems worldwide li et al 2018a since 2010 there has been additional concern regarding microplastics in freshwater as 80 of marine microplastics are recognized to have originated in terrestrial systems andrady 2011 zhang et al 2018 it is estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million tonnes of plastic waste was transported via river to the ocean and this is expected to increase in the coming decades jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 to date microplastic pollution has been identified as a prominent environmental concern in various freshwater systems zhang et al 2018 the reported high loads of microplastics in freshwater has raised the urgency to better understand their sources and the various anthropogenic impacts that may help improve pollution management practices su et al 2020 an urban agglomeration is a large scale watershed that spans a broad land use gradient experiences considerable anthropogenic impact and that has been recognized as a hotspot of microplastic pollution dris et al 2015 fang and yu 2017 the sources or pathways of microplastics are unevenly distributed across regions and involve numerous human activities resulting in considerable spatial heterogeneity in the pollution pattern of microplastics in urban agglomeration watersheds importantly these sources provide a systematic framework for mapping the occurrence flow paths and potential abatement of microplastic pollution however there has been little research profiling the emergence of microplastics across water bodies in urban agglomerations the footprints of microplastics in water bodies in urban agglomerations are largely dominated by complex anthropogenic influences that are often superimposed understanding these influences and how they are correlated is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different ecosystems varying land use across catchments connects heterogeneous pollution sources and is a critical anthropogenic factor determining the spatial variability of microplastics and their occurrence in aquatic environments in situ microplastic heterogeneity driven by individual industrial commercial agricultural and recreational land uses has been documented andrady 2017 he et al 2019 kiessling et al 2019 mccormick et al 2014 a spatial analysis conducted in a coastal metropolis in australia preliminarily demonstrated that urban land use can magnify the abundance and transportation of microplastics su et al 2020 however the relative contributions to aquatic microplastic pollution from different land uses are still unknown due to the lack of a systematic survey a better understanding of the presence and distribution of the pollution and its relationship to land use is required to determine how to best eliminate the principal sources of microplastics another overlooked but critical source of aquatic microplastics are the fluxes from drainage system overflows in periods of wet weather wwf siegfried et al 2017 relative to the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps murphy et al 2016 to date microplastics in wwf have only been documented in the paris agglomeration france gasperi et al 2014 and leipzig germany wagner et al 2019 considering that urban land use is increasing and that sewer networks are expanding the increasing amount of polluted sewage and sediment transmitted in the drainage system is likely to cause a shift in the wwf microplastic risk relationship from a constant to an escalating trend systematic monitoring and estimation of wwf microplastics at a large spatiotemporal scale are urgently needed to identify current and future areas of high risk moreover while cities have been recognized hotspots of microplastic pollution mai et al 2019 they are also where environmental management measures are more intensively implemented and may provide insights into creative solutions for reducing microplastic pollution as yet the significant role of environmental management in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters has not been discussed this study provides a watershed scale and longitudinal assessment into the abundance and distribution of microplastics in water bodies in urban agglomerations in particular the mechanism of how microplastic pollution is linked to superimposed impacts from wwf land uses and environmental management practices is explored the study area watershed huangpu river and its tributary suzhou creek in shanghai megacity contains a diversity of land uses and is estimated to be one of the top 20 most polluted rivers in the world in terms of mismanaged plastic waste production lebreton et al 2017 this work aims to determine i the importance of wwf as a significant source of microplastics ii the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics and how they are affected by land uses and iii the significant role of environmental management practices in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites in eastern china the huangpu

samples were collected once in summer and winter in 2018 respectively the riparian catchments of these sites span a broad range of land uses table s1 two parallel sub sites were deployed additionally at 50 m upstream and downstream of each sampling site to collect representative sub samples and determine the site range deviations a total of 71 real time wwf samples were collected from the sumps of

sediment samples were sieved 5 mm mesh and dried at 50 c for 3 d to a constant weight buoyant items in the sediment were separated using a saturated nacl solution over 24 h the obtained sediment supernatant and the collected water samples were treated with 1 m naoh at 40 c in the dark for 8 h to digest biological and abiological materials then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon microfiber

computer screen at high resolution which reduces artificial error and improves the accuracy of the data all the suspected plastic like items on the filters were inspected and counted according to their morphological characteristics and detailed criteria described elsewhere dris et al 2015 the automatic area measurement function of the stereomicroscope allowed measurement of the item length fig

the annual discharge of microplastics via wwf and wwtp effluent in order to explicitly estimate the annual discharge of microplastics via wwf at the watershed scale wwf data from 6 real time monitored pump stations and 19 randomly selected pump stations were analyzed the results showed a statistically significant correlation 1 between the mean microplastic concentration and cod of wwf samples from each pump station r 2 0 64 p 0 001 fig s2 on this basis the total annual discharge of wwf microplastics c microplastic wwf was calculated in equation 2 1 c m i c r o p l a s t i c 8 0 c c o d 775 5 2

volume in shanghai 2 5 2 statistical analysis in order to quantify the variability of aquatic microplastics as they are affected by land use multi group comparisons were made using one way analysis of variance anova and pearson correlation analysis regression analysis was used to analyze the relationships of the aquatic microplastic concentration with cod and the distance of the sampling site to the city center respectively principal component analysis pca was performed to elucidate the spatial variability and correlations of aquatic microplastics with different chemical indicators the morphologic characteristics shape size and polymer compositions of aquatic microplastics were recategorized by applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering using word vector similarity based on the t stochastic neighbourhood embedding t sne approach r rtsne pujahari and sisodia 2019 tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microplastics in an urban reservoir and rivers fig 2 a indicates that significantly abundant concentrations of microplastics 28 3 4 1 p l occurred in the jinze reservoir polyethylene terephthalate pet 50 approximately and fiber 70 film 30 constituted the largest type and shape of those microplastics the smallest particle size 80 500 μm accounted for a significant proportion 45 microplastics found in the surface waters of huangpu river and suzhou creek had concentrations of 26 2 9 6 and 14 4 5 1 p l respectively fig 2b and c likewise pet 60 76 and fiber 75 95 and the smallest particle size 40 66 were the most abundant suzhou creek sediments contained a high abundance of microplastics 6233 4 1890 4 p kg fig 2d the most abundant sediment microplastics were encountered at sites sz 4 7979 5 521 0 p kg and sz 12 8505 5 1439 56 p kg which were close to the pump station outlets the dominant types were pet 40 polypropylene pp 27 and polyacrylonitrile pan 15 fiber 90 and the smallest particle size 45 accounted for the majority of samples 3 2 microplastics discharged via drainage system wwf and wwtp effluent real time monitored wwf samples with microplastic concentrations ranging from 130 30 to 8500 1241 p l were observed see the statistics in fig 3 a and real time monitoring in fig s3 considerable disparities in microplastic concentrations were apparent the highest concentrations were encountered at pump station 1 wwf 4337 8 2703 1 p l and its outlet river water 4623 8 2855 1 p l besides real time monitoring showed the peak concentrations of wwf microplastics occurring at the beginning of rainfall events at five pump stations fig s3 the most frequently occurring microplastic types were pet 50 followed by pp and polyethylene pe while the smallest particle size dominated in almost all samples from wwf and their outlet river water except for pump station 3 figs 3b and s3 in terms of the microplastic shapes granule 55 and fiber 43 accounted for the majority of shapes in wwf whereas fiber was the majority 86 in the outlet river water fig 3c shows that a massive annual load of wwf microplastics varying from 1 08 1011 to 2 19 1013 p year was discharged from the six pump stations monitored in real time wwf microplastics from the 158 pump stations reached 3546 04 1018 68 p l on average which was two orders of magnitude larger than that of the previously determined wwtp effluent microplastics 52 p l fig 3d jia et al 2019 thus the total annual discharge of microplastics via wwf from the 158 pump stations was 8 50 1014 4 72 1012 p year which was remarkably higher than that discharged via effluent from the 51 wwtps 1 43 1014 p year fig 3e the discrepancies in annual loads between pump stations were very large fig 3f 3 3 statistical analysis of aquatic microplastics pca of the investigated environmental variables in the jinze reservoir suzhou creek and huangpu river showed that three principal components encompassed the majority of the variation pc1 31 4 pc2 20 1 and pc3 13 8 fig 4 a positive pc1 correlated with tss microplastic concentrations and humic whereas negative pc1 correlated with tn tryptophan cod nh3 n and tp the statistical distribution of samples in the urban section of suzhou creek residential land use was entirely independent of other samples and was highly related to cod positive linear correlation fig 4c nh3 n and trypthophan the difference in the state of overall pollution from the jinze water samples was minor and they were highly related to humic figs 4a and s4 samples from the huangpu river followed a discernible differentiation of pollution characteristics shaped by the diverse riparian land uses which were generally related to tss and microplastics fig 4a fig 4b shows the spatial disparities of microplastic concentrations in tested surface waters which in descending order were commercial public recreational area heavy industrial area agricultural light industrial area agricultural area residential area p 0 01 however the variability in the heavy industrial and agricultural light industrial areas showed similar concentrations p 0 014 table s3 significant seasonal variations included that aquatic microplastic concentrations in summer were overall higher than those in winter especially in commercial public recreational residential and agricultural land uses figs 4b and s5 in suzhou creek and huangpu river microplastics increased linearly with the distance of the sampling site to the city center figs 4d 4e and s5 t sne cluster analyses showed that morphologic characteristics and polymer compositions in the jinze samples were markedly different from those in the huangpu river and suzhou creek fig 4f pm2 5 seemed to display a unique and roughly positive correlation with a portion of the surface water in both suzhou creek and huangpu river fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 wwf microplastics discharged in the wet weather period wwf discharged from drainage systems in wet weather is highly polluted and at high flows is a significant contribution aggravating the microplastic pollution issue in the aquatic environment this study is the first to provide a systemic estimation of detailed data collected to analyze the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf within an urban agglomeration watershed based on empirical correlation evidence it revealed a large total annual microplastic load discharged via wwf that was almost six times that discharged via local wwtp effluents this finding highlights the vital importance of wwf as a great source of microplastics compared to wwtp effluent which has been the focus of most concern to date mason et al 2016 annual wwf microplastic data observed in this study were over two orders of magnitude higher than that in the paris agglomeration 4 5 1012 fibers year about 21 million m3 year of combined system overflows csos dris et al 2018 the high ratio of toxic plastic ingredients that emerged i e pe and pp lei et al 2018 further suggest that wwf is capable of posing an immediate and considerable ecological risk to receiving waters and public health wang et al 2019 the dominance of granular and fibrous microplastics in wwf found in this study is consistent with that seen in csos occurring in the paris agglomeration dris et al 2018 generally wwf originates in surface runoff domestic sewage and sewer sediment surface runoff associated with non point pollution has been recognized as the critical source of deposited atmospheric fibers dris et al 2017 as well as contributions from granular microplastics from traffic emissions and plastic industry activities e g tire abrasion particles unice et al 2019 domestic sewage such as laundry drain water and bathing wastewater was considered as the major source of fibers and microbeads from households respectively browne et al 2011 cheung and fok 2017 these trends were also true in the wwf sites monitored here in which a large number of aggregated white granular pe microplastics were found presumably from cosmetics or facial scrubs napper et al 2015 fig s6 fibrous and granular microplastics are more likely to settle in sewer sediment during periods of drought sutton et al 2016 whereas they can be resuspended and discharged during high rainfall events the notably higher proportion of granular microplastics in wwf relative to that in the receiving waters implied that wwf was a significant source of granule budgets in water bodies similarly with regard to receiving waters affected by stormwater discharge studies in lake ontario have also shown that granules were the dominant type of microplastics ballent et al 2016 the evident spatial disparity of wwf microplastics discharged over the whole urban agglomeration provides an argument that central urban areas are the most intense producer of microplastics wwf discharge can drive the significant enrichment pattern of microplastic abundance in receiving waters in short term rainfall events the densely distributed pump stations along the suzhou creek a 23 8 km urban section with a total of 53 pump stations their wwf discharges low velocity current in drought season 6 m3 s as well as bio fouling and other processes which reduced the microplastic buoyancy galloway et al 2017 are the essential factors that contribute to the mass accumulation of microplastics in suzhou creek sediment on a long term scale in this regard the sediment microplastic budgets tested in this research were higher relative to those that occurred in other rivers around the world klein et al 2015 lenaker et al 2019 the prominent proportion of pp polymer generally used to manufacture household products quinn et al 2017 in both sediment and wwf implies an active link between wwf and sediment microplastics in suzhou creek shifts in environmental and anthropogenic factors such as the regional weather or climate population density community practices and local policies sewage production and collection and the treatment capacity of wwtps can significantly alter wwf volumes and microplastic loads the sewer configurations and their maintenance are also responsible for variations in load for example illicitly connected or damaged sewer infrastructure can result in abundant granular microplastics entering the stormwater network dris et al 2018 have also outlined that the fibers observed in separated storm runoff 1 0 103 fibers l were considerably less than those in csos 1 9 104 fibers l 4 2 spatial variability of aquatic microplastics affected by land use this research added evidence that the increasing urbanization and human population density or the distance to city center within a catchment can promote microplastic abundance in proximal receiving waters which has also been shown in other study sites such as the great lakes tributaries laurentian great lakes and estuaries of the chesapeake bay usa baldwin et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 in this background the surface waters of the huangpu river are affected by diverse land uses that range from low to highly urbanized areas that showed concurrent features of non point source pollution highly correlated to tss microplastic and humic hosen et al 2014 it reveals that currently occurring urban microplastic pollution in drought periods have been dominated by non point sources which is entirely consistent with results from previous research conducted in coastal cities in australia su et al 2020 microplastics are ubiquitous across all land uses however on a global scale including in shanghai megacity the commercial public recreational and heavy industrial land uses were observed to contribute more plastic pollutants to aquatic environments than other land uses eo et al 2019 zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 a positive correlation between the percentage of industrial area and microplastic pollution was found in estuarine rivers in the chesapeake bay usa yonkos et al 2014 in the greater melbourne area and the western port area microplastic pollution in both water and sediment was strongly related to transport industrial and commercial land uses in the long term su et al 2020 recreational land use along urban rivers has also been recognized as a direct source of microplastics kiessling et al 2019 by contrast residential areas are generally densely populated although their receiving waters sometimes present significant microplastic pollution e g in huangpu river partial sites and brisbane river he et al 2020 there are generally not high concentrations the pollution pattern in the urban section of suzhou creek seems to be unique its remarkable association with cod nh3 n and tryptophan zhou et al 2016 as well as the significant proportion of fibers 90 auta et al 2017 mintenig et al 2017 indicated that domestic pollution was still the dominant source in drought period despite that the concentration of aquatic microplastics was low these spatial variabilities were similar to those found in australian coastal cities and the river danube in austria i e aquatic microplastics were greater in catchments that had a higher proportion of industrial land use and decreased in catchments with higher residential densities lechner and ramler 2015 townsend et al 2019 the larger landscape of microplastic dynamics in this study should also consider the implementation of any environmental management practices in the urban section of suzhou creek in terms of unique morphologic characteristics and polymer compositions which could be associative links for source identification auta et al 2017 aquatic microplastics in the jinze reservoir strongly reflect the influence of the agricultural light industry land use pet and fibrous microplastics were the dominant types and most likely originated in light industrial factories as the production of apparel was reported to account for approximately half of the end use of pet fibers carr 2017 the large proportion of pe and film microplastics were likely to be from intensive farmland activities e g plastic film mulching ng et al 2018 while the influence of land use types in the large watershed was evident in the flowing water systems it was challenging to define the longitudinal pattern of microplastics from upstream land uses on downstream water quality status as a corollary this suggests that the prevalence of microplastics in flowing water systems reflects the superimposed effects of both land use and hydrodynamics for example lentic water bodies were favorable as a microplastic sink because of the decreased wave energy allowing particles transmitted from upstream river and riparian land use to accumulate such as happened in the jinze and three gorges reservoirs zhang et al 2017 the seasonal factor affecting temporal variability further revealed the influence of hydrology and seasonality of anthropogenic sources or transport patterns barrows et al 2018 eo et al 2019 the extent which aerial deposition contributed to the spatial patterns found in this studied watershed and elsewhere is unclear dris et al 2015 4 3 microplastic pollution occurring in conjunction with regional environmental management whether it is by direct abatement on output loads or indirect abatement through altering the material flow path pattern kawecki et al 2018 environmental management practices play a significant role in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters as well as complicate the understanding of the superimposed influences although domestic sewage has been recognized as the critical source of aquatic microplastics dris et al 2015 in large developed cities such as shanghai where rigorous pollution management practices collect 95 of sewage volume and 100 of industry wastewater pretreated in drainage systems xu et al 2019 only 5 of sewage by volume can be discharged directly to water bodies similar policies deployed in developed areas globally e g cities in europe australia and the usa have also demonstrated significant improvement in the water quality of urban rivers barrows et al 2018 chapra 2008 su et al 2020 by contrast the water bodies located in areas with lower socioeconomic development e g the saigon river lahens et al 2018 and north african rivers siegfried et al 2017 the low sewage collection rate and wwtp treatment capacity has caused severe sewage volumes to be discharged and a huge abundance of plastic waste and microplastics some research projects a decreasing trend by 2050 in the river export of microplastics in europe north africa due to the anticipated improvement in wwtp siegfried et al 2017 however there are great financial and technical difficulties in increasing the efficiency and capacity of wwtp china s investments in wwtps reached 148 6 billion rmb in 2016 accounting for 1 2 of the nation s gdp xu et al 2019 even so wwtps in shanghai still have a very low microplastic removal efficiency rate 63 3 in bailonggang jia et al 2019 managing wwf pollution volume might be a more tangible solution to achieve an immediate and large scale abatement of sewage microplastics in this regard the first flush wwf from the majority of drainage systems in shanghai has been intercepted and precipitated using stormwater detention tanks which has already reduced the number of solid pollutants that are discharged 45 of annual wwf tss todeschini et al 2012 yan 2010 including microplastics a considerable proportion of sewage microplastics will be retained and disposed of in the form of sewer sediment or the excess sludge in wwtp which can retain approximately 60 98 of the incoming microplastic load jia et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 improper management of the sewer network maintenance sewage sludge treatment and recycling policy makes the sludge a significant source of land microplastics mahon et al 2017 the average amount of sludge microplastics entering into the environment was estimated to be 1 56 1014 p year in china 2015 li et al 2018b yang et al 2015 the non point source microplastics occurring in the background of environmental management are challenging to estimate notwithstanding this it is still clear that the intensively constructed impervious ecological riverbanks and green infrastructure rehabilitation projects since 1998 built along suzhou creek that retain or reduce surface runoff microplastics have considerable impact for example storm water bio retention tss removal rate of 47 99 permeable pavement 58 94 and grass swale 30 97 are all very effective at removing large percentages of solid pollutants ahiablame et al 2012 townsend et al 2019 showed that urban wetlands were efficient for removing microplastics before stormwater can enter receiving environments with retained sediment microplastics of 45 65 45 59 items kg of note an end of system structure may be a priority to ensure that the retained microplastics cannot again be released into downstream ecosystems other impactful management policies that can further alleviate the input load of microplastics in receiving waters during drought include routine inspection regimes officeholder contract system for river sections and a daily plastic waste clearing regime as well as a legal prohibition on garbage dumping and untreated industry wastewater tailoring the implementation of different environmental management measures to different weather or hydrological conditions should be an essential consideration when attempting to decrease microplastic budgets or alter their flow path pattern in the given region the significant seasonal patterns in sewage microplastics discharged between winter and summer in suzhou creek were mainly caused by the large discharge of wwf in the wet season summer fig s7 the green infrastructure implemented in the riparian catchments along suzhou creek was used to intercept the first flush of surface runoff during wet weather in contrast the daily deployed municipal measures statutory bans and the high sewage collection rate in the sewer system along the urban section of suzhou creek during drought are an essential reason why the aquatic microplastics there were surprisingly low management plans for controlling water pollution issued by chinese governments in 2015 and 2016 li et al 2018b mepc 2017 have strengthened the ability of the network of multiple facilities and systems to work together and better cope with domestic pollution agricultural pollution coastal pollution and ship port pollution over the next five decades globally from 2015 to 2020 the plastic microbead free waters act was launched in many countries in asia europe and south america unep 2017 the norwegian government has further introduced policies such as fishing for litter and the beverage bottle recycling system zhou 2019 these current key areas of microplastic pollution have been the subject of intense scientific focus and the relevant current policy outcomes seem optimistic for instance the strict garbage sorting recycling regime implemented in shanghai since june 2019 has driven changes in consumer behavior and by the end of august the daily recyclable waste with a high percentage of plastics collected had reached 4500 tonnes official data which was a five fold increase over the end of 2018 a ban on single use plastic bags introduced in the australian capital territory in 2011 has reduced consumption of conventional polyethylene bags by 2600 tonnes over the subsequent seven years macintosh et al 2020 and this kind of policy based measure has also been introduced in approximately 90 countries nielsen et al 2019 zhu 2011 given that diverse environmental management measures have been implemented in urban agglomerations globally it is important to track their mechanisms efficacies and sustainability in follow up studies as well as how their microplastic flow path patterns may have changed further examining successes and failures in different study areas may spark new innovation and provide feasible and specific solutions on how to control microplastic pollution and achieve cuts in the microplastic budget in the near future 5 conclusion this study provides new insights into the crucial link between microplastic pollution occurring in the water bodies of urban agglomerations and the relative impacts from wwf land use and environmental management these findings contribute to bridging the knowledge gap in better understanding the sources transport fate and even risk of microplastics at the systemic watershed scale significantly this work is the first to provide detailed data and systemic estimation to unveil the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf and to provide an integrated framework that demonstrates the positive impact of environmental management implemented at different scales in an urban agglomeration the main findings showed that 1 wwf is a great source of microplastics in receiving waters total annual discharge of 8 50 1014 p year 2 the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics is largely affected by the land use within the catchment 3 the longitudinal pattern of microplastics in flowing waters suggested superimposed effects of land use and hydrodynamics 4 environmental management played a significant role in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics and 5 the implementation of different environmental management measures under different weather or hydrological conditions was apparent in the load of

17752,the footprints of microplastics in the water bodies of urban agglomerations are largely dominated by superimposed anthropogenic influences understanding these influences and how they are correlated is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different ecosystems this study longitudinally assessed the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the water bodies of urban agglomerations at the watershed scale in shanghai megacity particularly the behavior of microplastics with the impacts of drainage system overflow in wet weather wwf land uses and environmental management practices were explored wwf can greatly aggravate microplastic pollution in aquatic environments a systemic estimation based on detailed data was used to show that the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf in the watershed area was 8 50 1014 p year which was approximately six times larger than that discharged via the local wastewater treatment plant effluent findings here contribute to research concerning the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics and the extent to which they are affected by land use in descending order the highest microplastic concentrations were found in heavy industrial commercial public recreational agricultural light industrial agricultural and residential areas the longitudinal pattern of microplastics observed in the water bodies suggested that there were superimposed effects of land use and hydrodynamics this paper is the first to provide an integrated framework that demonstrates the significant role of environmental management practices in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters at a city scale improved management of wwf might be a tangible solution that would help achieve an immediate and large scale reduction of microplastics in sewage determining the optimized management practices for different weather or hydrological conditions could be an essential factor in decreasing microplastic concentrations and altering their flow path pattern in a given region graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic urban agglomeration water bodies drainage system overflow catchment land use environmental management 1 introduction microplastics are human made polymer products or residues that are less than 5 mm in diameter with microplastic pollution increasing globally they have been a focal point of emerging pollutant research over the last decade andrady 2011 overproduction of plastics as well as their widespread use and improper disposal has led to the ubiquitous presence of this tiny plastic debris in various aquatic and terrestrial systems worldwide li et al 2018a since 2010 there has been additional concern regarding microplastics in freshwater as 80 of marine microplastics are recognized to have originated in terrestrial systems andrady 2011 zhang et al 2018 it is estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million tonnes of plastic waste was transported via river to the ocean and this is expected to increase in the coming decades jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 to date microplastic pollution has been identified as a prominent environmental concern in various freshwater systems zhang et al 2018 the reported high loads of microplastics in freshwater has raised the urgency to better understand their sources and the various anthropogenic impacts that may help improve pollution management practices su et al 2020 an urban agglomeration is a large scale watershed that spans a broad land use gradient experiences considerable anthropogenic impact and that has been recognized as a hotspot of microplastic pollution dris et al 2015 fang and yu 2017 the sources or pathways of microplastics are unevenly distributed across regions and involve numerous human activities resulting in considerable spatial heterogeneity in the pollution pattern of microplastics in urban agglomeration watersheds importantly these sources provide a systematic framework for mapping the occurrence flow paths and potential abatement of microplastic pollution however there has been little research profiling the emergence of microplastics across water bodies in urban agglomerations the footprints of microplastics in water bodies in urban agglomerations are largely dominated by complex anthropogenic influences that are often superimposed understanding these influences and how they are correlated is essential to better understand the occurrence and variability of microplastics in different ecosystems varying land use across catchments connects heterogeneous pollution sources and is a critical anthropogenic factor determining the spatial variability of microplastics and their occurrence in aquatic environments in situ microplastic heterogeneity driven by individual industrial commercial agricultural and recreational land uses has been documented andrady 2017 he et al 2019 kiessling et al 2019 mccormick et al 2014 a spatial analysis conducted in a coastal metropolis in australia preliminarily demonstrated that urban land use can magnify the abundance and transportation of microplastics su et al 2020 however the relative contributions to aquatic microplastic pollution from different land uses are still unknown due to the lack of a systematic survey a better understanding of the presence and distribution of the pollution and its relationship to land use is required to determine how to best eliminate the principal sources of microplastics another overlooked but critical source of aquatic microplastics are the fluxes from drainage system overflows in periods of wet weather wwf siegfried et al 2017 relative to the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps murphy et al 2016 to date microplastics in wwf have only been documented in the paris agglomeration france gasperi et al 2014 and leipzig germany wagner et al 2019 considering that urban land use is increasing and that sewer networks are expanding the increasing amount of polluted sewage and sediment transmitted in the drainage system is likely to cause a shift in the wwf microplastic risk relationship from a constant to an escalating trend systematic monitoring and estimation of wwf microplastics at a large spatiotemporal scale are urgently needed to identify current and future areas of high risk moreover while cities have been recognized hotspots of microplastic pollution mai et al 2019 they are also where environmental management measures are more intensively implemented and may provide insights into creative solutions for reducing microplastic pollution as yet the significant role of environmental management in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters has not been discussed this study provides a watershed scale and longitudinal assessment into the abundance and distribution of microplastics in water bodies in urban agglomerations in particular the mechanism of how microplastic pollution is linked to superimposed impacts from wwf land uses and environmental management practices is explored the study area watershed huangpu river and its tributary suzhou creek in shanghai megacity contains a diversity of land uses and is estimated to be one of the top 20 most polluted rivers in the world in terms of mismanaged plastic waste production lebreton et al 2017 this work aims to determine i the importance of wwf as a significant source of microplastics ii the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics and how they are affected by land uses and iii the significant role of environmental management practices in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites in eastern china the huangpu river watershed and its tributary suzhou creek flows through the shanghai city agglomeration population of over 24 million and is a typical river plain network area fig 1 the watershed drains an area

huangpu river 132 surface water samples 16 sites in suzhou creek 13 sites with 78 surface water samples and 78 sediment samples and three more sites from which 18 sediment samples were taken all these samples were collected once in summer and winter in 2018 respectively the riparian catchments of these sites span a broad range of land uses table s1 two parallel sub sites were deployed additionally at 50 m upstream and downstream of each sampling site to collect representative sub samples and determine the site range deviations a total of 71 real time wwf samples were collected from the sumps of six pump stations located along suzhou creek during rainfall events summer wet season 2018 concurrently a sample was taken from the corresponding river water adjacent to each pump station outlet pump station 1 was a stormwater pump station in a sizeable separated drainage system illicit connections exist in storm sewers pump stations 2 6 were the combined drainage system pump stations from residential catchments wwf samples from 19 randomly selected pump stations located in urban and peri urban areas were additionally collected 2 2 sampling campaigns a stainless steel net 80 μm mesh size was immersed into the midstream channel 30 cm below the water surface during each deployment for sampling surface waters the current velocity was captured synchronously by a flow meter the sampling duration lasted 20 min the used net was then thoroughly rinsed three times and all residues were transferred into clean glass containers using ultrapure water all the samples from each site were collected three times during daylight hours at 3 h intervals also 1 l of site water was collected for laboratory analysis sediment samples from suzhou creek were collected using cylindrical sediment grab samplers in dry weather during a cruise sediment sampling covered a volume of 50 cm depth and 0 4 m2 in each site real time wwf samples 3 l per sample were collected by large flow automatic samplers from the beginning to the end of the pump during each rainfall event synchronously the corresponding river water samples from the pump station outlets were manually collected 5 l per sample the rainfall intensity mm h and overflow rate m3 s were auto monitored by skada system wwf samples 3 l per sample from the 19 pump stations were collected in real time at 15 min intervals and then composited based on the flow volume ratio all samples were put into a car cooler and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c until analysis 2 3 microplastic identification sediment samples were sieved 5 mm mesh and dried at 50 c for 3 d to a constant weight buoyant items in the sediment were separated using a saturated nacl solution over 24 h the obtained sediment supernatant and the collected water samples were treated with 1 m naoh at 40 c in the dark for 8 h to digest biological and abiological materials then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon microfiber filter under vacuum sample filters were examined visually under high speed stereomicroscope vhx 6000 keyence japan with 100 200 magnification the stereomicroscope showed the full sample filter on the computer screen at high resolution which reduces artificial error and improves the accuracy of the data all the suspected plastic like items on the filters were inspected and counted according to their morphological characteristics and detailed criteria described elsewhere dris et al 2015 the automatic area measurement function of the stereomicroscope allowed measurement of the item length fig

the annual discharge of microplastics via wwf and wwtp effluent in order to explicitly estimate the annual discharge of microplastics via wwf at the watershed scale wwf data from 6 real time monitored pump stations and 19 randomly selected pump stations were analyzed the results showed a statistically significant correlation 1 between the mean microplastic concentration and cod of wwf samples from each pump station r 2 0 64 p 0 001 fig s2 on this basis the total annual discharge of wwf microplastics c microplastic wwf was calculated in equation 2 1 c m i c r o p l a s t i c 8 0 c c o d 775 5 2

volume in shanghai 2 5 2 statistical analysis in order to quantify the variability of aquatic microplastics as they are affected by land use multi group comparisons were made using one way analysis of variance anova and pearson correlation analysis regression analysis was used to analyze the relationships of the aquatic microplastic concentration with cod and the distance of the sampling site to the city center respectively principal component analysis pca was performed to elucidate the spatial variability and correlations of aquatic microplastics with different chemical indicators the morphologic characteristics shape size and polymer compositions of aquatic microplastics were recategorized by applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering using word vector similarity based on the t stochastic neighbourhood embedding t sne approach r rtsne pujahari and sisodia 2019 tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microplastics in an urban reservoir and rivers fig 2 a indicates that significantly abundant concentrations of microplastics 28 3 4 1 p l occurred in the jinze reservoir polyethylene terephthalate pet 50 approximately and fiber 70 film 30 constituted the largest type and shape of those microplastics the smallest particle size 80 500 μm accounted for a significant proportion 45 microplastics found in the surface waters of huangpu river and suzhou creek had concentrations of 26 2 9 6 and 14 4 5 1 p l respectively fig 2b and c likewise pet 60 76 and fiber 75 95 and the smallest particle size 40 66 were the most abundant suzhou creek sediments contained a high abundance of microplastics 6233 4 1890 4 p kg fig 2d the most abundant sediment microplastics were encountered at sites sz 4 7979 5 521 0 p kg and sz 12 8505 5 1439 56 p kg which were close to the pump station outlets the dominant types were pet 40 polypropylene pp 27 and polyacrylonitrile pan 15 fiber 90 and the smallest particle size 45 accounted for the majority of samples 3 2 microplastics discharged via drainage system wwf and wwtp effluent real time monitored wwf samples with microplastic concentrations ranging from 130 30 to 8500 1241 p l were observed see the statistics in fig 3 a and real time monitoring in fig s3 considerable disparities in microplastic concentrations were apparent the highest concentrations were encountered at pump station 1 wwf 4337 8 2703 1 p l and its outlet river water 4623 8 2855 1 p l besides real time monitoring showed the peak concentrations of wwf microplastics occurring at the beginning of rainfall events at five pump stations fig s3 the most frequently occurring microplastic types were pet 50 followed by pp and polyethylene pe while the smallest particle size dominated in almost all samples from wwf and their outlet river water except for pump station 3 figs 3b and s3 in terms of the microplastic shapes granule 55 and fiber 43 accounted for the majority of shapes in wwf whereas fiber was the majority 86 in the outlet river water fig 3c shows that a massive annual load of wwf microplastics varying from 1 08 1011 to 2 19 1013 p year was discharged from the six pump stations monitored in real time wwf microplastics from the 158 pump stations reached 3546 04 1018 68 p l on average which was two orders of magnitude larger than that of the previously determined wwtp effluent microplastics 52 p l fig 3d jia et al 2019 thus the total annual discharge of microplastics via wwf from the 158 pump stations was 8 50 1014 4 72 1012 p year which was remarkably higher than that discharged via effluent from the 51 wwtps 1 43 1014 p year fig 3e the discrepancies in annual loads between pump stations were very large fig 3f 3 3 statistical analysis of aquatic microplastics pca of the investigated environmental variables in the jinze reservoir suzhou creek and huangpu river showed that three principal components encompassed the majority of the variation pc1 31 4 pc2 20 1 and pc3 13 8 fig 4 a positive pc1 correlated with tss microplastic concentrations and humic whereas negative pc1 correlated with tn tryptophan cod nh3 n and tp the statistical distribution of samples in the urban section of suzhou creek residential land use was entirely independent of other samples and was highly related to cod positive linear correlation fig 4c nh3 n and trypthophan the difference in the state of overall pollution from the jinze water samples was minor and they were highly related to humic figs 4a and s4 samples from the huangpu river followed a discernible differentiation of pollution characteristics shaped by the diverse riparian land uses which were generally related to tss and microplastics fig 4a fig 4b shows the spatial disparities of microplastic concentrations in tested surface waters which in descending order were commercial public recreational area heavy industrial area agricultural light industrial area agricultural area residential area p 0 01 however the variability in the heavy industrial and agricultural light industrial areas showed similar concentrations p 0 014 table s3 significant seasonal variations included that aquatic microplastic concentrations in summer were overall higher than those in winter especially in commercial public recreational residential and agricultural land uses figs 4b and s5 in suzhou creek and huangpu river microplastics increased linearly with the distance of the sampling site to the city center figs 4d 4e and s5 t sne cluster analyses showed that morphologic characteristics and polymer compositions in the jinze samples were markedly different from those in the huangpu river and suzhou creek fig 4f pm2 5 seemed to display a unique and roughly positive correlation with a portion of the surface water in both suzhou creek and huangpu river fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 wwf microplastics discharged in the wet weather period wwf discharged from drainage systems in wet weather is highly polluted and at high flows is a significant contribution aggravating the microplastic pollution issue in the aquatic environment this study is the first to provide a systemic estimation of detailed data collected to analyze the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf within an urban agglomeration watershed based on empirical correlation evidence it revealed a large total annual microplastic load discharged via wwf that was almost six times that discharged via local wwtp effluents this finding highlights the vital importance of wwf as a great source of microplastics compared to wwtp effluent which has been the focus of most concern to date mason et al 2016 annual wwf microplastic data observed in this study were over two orders of magnitude higher than that in the paris agglomeration 4 5 1012 fibers year about 21 million m3 year of combined system overflows csos dris et al 2018 the high ratio of toxic plastic ingredients that emerged i e pe and pp lei et al 2018 further suggest that wwf is capable of posing an immediate and considerable ecological risk to receiving waters and public health wang et al 2019 the dominance of granular and fibrous microplastics in wwf found in this study is consistent with that seen in csos occurring in the paris agglomeration dris et al 2018 generally wwf originates in surface runoff domestic sewage and sewer sediment surface runoff associated with non point pollution has been recognized as the critical source of deposited atmospheric fibers dris et al 2017 as well as contributions from granular microplastics from traffic emissions and plastic industry activities e g tire abrasion particles unice et al 2019 domestic sewage such as laundry drain water and bathing wastewater was considered as the major source of fibers and microbeads from households respectively browne et al 2011 cheung and fok 2017 these trends were also true in the wwf sites monitored here in which a large number of aggregated white granular pe microplastics were found presumably from cosmetics or facial scrubs napper et al 2015 fig s6 fibrous and granular microplastics are more likely to settle in sewer sediment during periods of drought sutton et al 2016 whereas they can be resuspended and discharged during high rainfall events the notably higher proportion of granular microplastics in wwf relative to that in the receiving waters implied that wwf was a significant source of granule budgets in water bodies similarly with regard to receiving waters affected by stormwater discharge studies in lake ontario have also shown that granules were the dominant type of microplastics ballent et al 2016 the evident spatial disparity of wwf microplastics discharged over the whole urban agglomeration provides an argument that central urban areas are the most intense producer of microplastics wwf discharge can drive the significant enrichment pattern of microplastic abundance in receiving waters in short term rainfall events the densely distributed pump stations along the suzhou creek a 23 8 km urban section with a total of 53 pump stations their wwf discharges low velocity current in drought season 6 m3 s as well as bio fouling and other processes which reduced the microplastic buoyancy galloway et al 2017 are the essential factors that contribute to the mass accumulation of microplastics in suzhou creek sediment on a long term scale in this regard the sediment microplastic budgets tested in this research were higher relative to those that occurred in other rivers around the world klein et al 2015 lenaker et al 2019 the prominent proportion of pp polymer generally used to manufacture household products quinn et al 2017 in both sediment and wwf implies an active link between wwf and sediment microplastics in suzhou creek shifts in environmental and anthropogenic factors such as the regional weather or climate population density community practices and local policies sewage production and collection and the treatment capacity of wwtps can significantly alter wwf volumes and microplastic loads the sewer configurations and their maintenance are also responsible for variations in load for example illicitly connected or damaged sewer infrastructure can result in abundant granular microplastics entering the stormwater network dris et al 2018 have also outlined that the fibers observed in separated storm runoff 1 0 103 fibers l were considerably less than those in csos 1 9 104 fibers l 4 2 spatial variability of aquatic microplastics affected by land use this research added evidence that the increasing urbanization and human population density or the distance to city center within a catchment can promote microplastic abundance in proximal receiving waters which has also been shown in other study sites such as the great lakes tributaries laurentian great lakes and estuaries of the chesapeake bay usa baldwin et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 in this background the surface waters of the huangpu river are affected by diverse land uses that range from low to highly urbanized areas that showed concurrent features of non point source pollution highly correlated to tss microplastic and humic hosen et al 2014 it reveals that currently occurring urban microplastic pollution in drought periods have been dominated by non point sources which is entirely consistent with results from previous research conducted in coastal cities in australia su et al 2020 microplastics are ubiquitous across all land uses however on a global scale including in shanghai megacity the commercial public recreational and heavy industrial land uses were observed to contribute more plastic pollutants to aquatic environments than other land uses eo et al 2019 zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 a positive correlation between the percentage of industrial area and microplastic pollution was found in estuarine rivers in the chesapeake bay usa yonkos et al 2014 in the greater melbourne area and the western port area microplastic pollution in both water and sediment was strongly related to transport industrial and commercial land uses in the long term su et al 2020 recreational land use along urban rivers has also been recognized as a direct source of microplastics kiessling et al 2019 by contrast residential areas are generally densely populated although their receiving waters sometimes present significant microplastic pollution e g in huangpu river partial sites and brisbane river he et al 2020 there are generally not high concentrations the pollution pattern in the urban section of suzhou creek seems to be unique its remarkable association with cod nh3 n and tryptophan zhou et al 2016 as well as the significant proportion of fibers 90 auta et al 2017 mintenig et al 2017 indicated that domestic pollution was still the dominant source in drought period despite that the concentration of aquatic microplastics was low these spatial variabilities were similar to those found in australian coastal cities and the river danube in austria i e aquatic microplastics were greater in catchments that had a higher proportion of industrial land use and decreased in catchments with higher residential densities lechner and ramler 2015 townsend et al 2019 the larger landscape of microplastic dynamics in this study should also consider the implementation of any environmental management practices in the urban section of suzhou creek in terms of unique morphologic characteristics and polymer compositions which could be associative links for source identification auta et al 2017 aquatic microplastics in the jinze reservoir strongly reflect the influence of the agricultural light industry land use pet and fibrous microplastics were the dominant types and most likely originated in light industrial factories as the production of apparel was reported to account for approximately half of the end use of pet fibers carr 2017 the large proportion of pe and film microplastics were likely to be from intensive farmland activities e g plastic film mulching ng et al 2018 while the influence of land use types in the large watershed was evident in the flowing water systems it was challenging to define the longitudinal pattern of microplastics from upstream land uses on downstream water quality status as a corollary this suggests that the prevalence of microplastics in flowing water systems reflects the superimposed effects of both land use and hydrodynamics for example lentic water bodies were favorable as a microplastic sink because of the decreased wave energy allowing particles transmitted from upstream river and riparian land use to accumulate such as happened in the jinze and three gorges reservoirs zhang et al 2017 the seasonal factor affecting temporal variability further revealed the influence of hydrology and seasonality of anthropogenic sources or transport patterns barrows et al 2018 eo et al 2019 the extent which aerial deposition contributed to the spatial patterns found in this studied watershed and elsewhere is unclear dris et al 2015 4 3 microplastic pollution occurring in conjunction with regional environmental management whether it is by direct abatement on output loads or indirect abatement through altering the material flow path pattern kawecki et al 2018 environmental management practices play a significant role in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics to receiving waters as well as complicate the understanding of the superimposed influences although domestic sewage has been recognized as the critical source of aquatic microplastics dris et al 2015 in large developed cities such as shanghai where rigorous pollution management practices collect 95 of sewage volume and 100 of industry wastewater pretreated in drainage systems xu et al 2019 only 5 of sewage by volume can be discharged directly to water bodies similar policies deployed in developed areas globally e g cities in europe australia and the usa have also demonstrated significant improvement in the water quality of urban rivers barrows et al 2018 chapra 2008 su et al 2020 by contrast the water bodies located in areas with lower socioeconomic development e g the saigon river lahens et al 2018 and north african rivers siegfried et al 2017 the low sewage collection rate and wwtp treatment capacity has caused severe sewage volumes to be discharged and a huge abundance of plastic waste and microplastics some research projects a decreasing trend by 2050 in the river export of microplastics in europe north africa due to the anticipated improvement in wwtp siegfried et al 2017 however there are great financial and technical difficulties in increasing the efficiency and capacity of wwtp china s investments in wwtps reached 148 6 billion rmb in 2016 accounting for 1 2 of the nation s gdp xu et al 2019 even so wwtps in shanghai still have a very low microplastic removal efficiency rate 63 3 in bailonggang jia et al 2019 managing wwf pollution volume might be a more tangible solution to achieve an immediate and large scale abatement of sewage microplastics in this regard the first flush wwf from the majority of drainage systems in shanghai has been intercepted and precipitated using stormwater detention tanks which has already reduced the number of solid pollutants that are discharged 45 of annual wwf tss todeschini et al 2012 yan 2010 including microplastics a considerable proportion of sewage microplastics will be retained and disposed of in the form of sewer sediment or the excess sludge in wwtp which can retain approximately 60 98 of the incoming microplastic load jia et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 improper management of the sewer network maintenance sewage sludge treatment and recycling policy makes the sludge a significant source of land microplastics mahon et al 2017 the average amount of sludge microplastics entering into the environment was estimated to be 1 56 1014 p year in china 2015 li et al 2018b yang et al 2015 the non point source microplastics occurring in the background of environmental management are challenging to estimate notwithstanding this it is still clear that the intensively constructed impervious ecological riverbanks and green infrastructure rehabilitation projects since 1998 built along suzhou creek that retain or reduce surface runoff microplastics have considerable impact for example storm water bio retention tss removal rate of 47 99 permeable pavement 58 94 and grass swale 30 97 are all very effective at removing large percentages of solid pollutants ahiablame et al 2012 townsend et al 2019 showed that urban wetlands were efficient for removing microplastics before stormwater can enter receiving environments with retained sediment microplastics of 45 65 45 59 items kg of note an end of system structure may be a priority to ensure that the retained microplastics cannot again be released into downstream ecosystems other impactful management policies that can further alleviate the input load of microplastics in receiving waters during drought include routine inspection regimes officeholder contract system for river sections and a daily plastic waste clearing regime as well as a legal prohibition on garbage dumping and untreated industry wastewater tailoring the implementation of different environmental management measures to different weather or hydrological conditions should be an essential consideration when attempting to decrease microplastic budgets or alter their flow path pattern in the given region the significant seasonal patterns in sewage microplastics discharged between winter and summer in suzhou creek were mainly caused by the large discharge of wwf in the wet season summer fig s7 the green infrastructure implemented in the riparian catchments along suzhou creek was used to intercept the first flush of surface runoff during wet weather in contrast the daily deployed municipal measures statutory bans and the high sewage collection rate in the sewer system along the urban section of suzhou creek during drought are an essential reason why the aquatic microplastics there were surprisingly low management plans for controlling water pollution issued by chinese governments in 2015 and 2016 li et al 2018b mepc 2017 have strengthened the ability of the network of multiple facilities and systems to work together and better cope with domestic pollution agricultural pollution coastal pollution and ship port pollution over the next five decades globally from 2015 to 2020 the plastic microbead free waters act was launched in many countries in asia europe and south america unep 2017 the norwegian government has further introduced policies such as fishing for litter and the beverage bottle recycling system zhou 2019 these current key areas of microplastic pollution have been the subject of intense scientific focus and the relevant current policy outcomes seem optimistic for instance the strict garbage sorting recycling regime implemented in shanghai since june 2019 has driven changes in consumer behavior and by the end of august the daily recyclable waste with a high percentage of plastics collected had reached 4500 tonnes official data which was a five fold increase over the end of 2018 a ban on single use plastic bags introduced in the australian capital territory in 2011 has reduced consumption of conventional polyethylene bags by 2600 tonnes over the subsequent seven years macintosh et al 2020 and this kind of policy based measure has also been introduced in approximately 90 countries nielsen et al 2019 zhu 2011 given that diverse environmental management measures have been implemented in urban agglomerations globally it is important to track their mechanisms efficacies and sustainability in follow up studies as well as how their microplastic flow path patterns may have changed further examining successes and failures in different study areas may spark new innovation and provide feasible and specific solutions on how to control microplastic pollution and achieve cuts in the microplastic budget in the near future 5 conclusion this study provides new insights into the crucial link between microplastic pollution occurring in the water bodies of urban agglomerations and the relative impacts from wwf land use and environmental management these findings contribute to bridging the knowledge gap in better understanding the sources transport fate and even risk of microplastics at the systemic watershed scale significantly this work is the first to provide detailed data and systemic estimation to unveil the annual load of microplastics discharged via wwf and to provide an integrated framework that demonstrates the positive impact of environmental management implemented at different scales in an urban agglomeration the main findings showed that 1 wwf is a great source of microplastics in receiving waters total annual discharge of 8 50 1014 p year 2 the spatial variability of aquatic microplastics is largely affected by the land use within the catchment 3 the longitudinal pattern of microplastics in flowing waters suggested superimposed effects of land use and hydrodynamics 4 environmental management played a significant role in controlling the production and transmission of microplastics and 5 the implementation of different environmental management measures under different weather or hydrological conditions was apparent in the load of

17753,sunlight can be an effective tool for inactivating pathogens in water disinfection processes in clear water photoinactivation of viruses is driven by the absorption of uvb radiation and it is more efficient at shorter wavelengths moreover the temperature can significantly improve the efficiency of the process to date no kinetic model has been reported that describes the simultaneous thermal and spectral effects that occur during the solar inactivation of viruses this work presents a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the solar inactivation of ms2 coliphage as a function of the water temperature irradiance and spectral distribution of the incident radiation the model is based on a combination of the modified arrhenius equation a wavelength dependent first order inactivation model with the quantum yield and thermal parameters estimated from laboratory data model predictions have a 9 error with respect to experiments in the temperature range from 30 to 50 c and uv irradiance range from 15 to 50 w m2 moreover the model was validated in three scenarios using different plastic materials that modify the spectral range of the radiation reaching the water confirming an accurate prediction of inactivation rates for real solar disinfection systems worldwide using containers made of any material graphical abstract image 1 keywords water temperature solar irradiance quantum yield ms2 virus sodis household water treatment 1 introduction waterborne viruses are still a global challenge especially for drinking water supply in low income countries the presence of viruses in drinking water sources is problematic due to their high resistance to disinfection processes compared to bacteria several factors have been found to influence the survival of viruses being the most important i water characteristics ii water temperature and iii solar irradiance davies colley et al 2000 fisher et al 2012 2008 gómez couso et al 2010 maynard et al 1999 mcguigan et al 2012 sinton et al 2002 the disinfection of water by exposure to sunlight is called sodis process and it has been considered as a potential household water treatment for low income countries during solar exposure water temperature can significantly increase above 30 40 c with an observed synergistic effect between solar irradiation and water temperature castro alférez et al 2017 2018 fisher et al 2008 gómez couso et al 2010 mcguigan et al 1998 romero et al 2011 solar inactivation of microbial pathogens can take place through three types of damaging mechanisms i direct endogenous damage ii indirect endogenous damage and iii indirect exogenous damage nelson et al 2018 endogenous damage i and ii is based on intracellular processes while the direct damage i is caused by absorption of radiation by some of the microorganism constituents indirect damage ii is the result of attacks to the microbial components by photo produced reactive intermediates ppri such as hydroxyl carbonate and superoxide radicals singlet oxygen carbonate radical or triplet state organic matter which have been generated by sensitizers activated by solar photons nelson et al 2018 in the case of the viruses due to their simple structure consisting of a genome surrounded by a protein capsid this indirect endogenous damage mechanism can be neglected finally the indirect exogenous damage iii is based on the harmful effects of the external ppri generated by external sensitizers present in unclear water therefore photoinactivation of viruses in clear water can be reasonably assumed to take place mainly through direct endogenous damage based on the absorption of uv b solar radiation love et al 2010 viruses have been demonstrated to be very sensitive to wavelengths from 280 to 320 nm and in general the shorter the wavelength the more harmful the damage the action spectra of photoinactivation closely keep the shape of the absorption spectra of the nucleic acids and proteins lytle and sagripanti 2005 one example of this is coliphage ms2 a single stranded rna virus that infects escherichia coli bacteria and other enterobacteriaceae which is commonly used as an indicator of photoinactivation due to its higher resistance in comparison with other viruses or bacteria love et al 2010 theitler et al 2012 in this regard the selection of the material employed for the manufacturing of the solar disinfection systems in particular its transmittance in the uv b range is a critical factor for the efficacy of the process garcía gil et al 2020a in the literature many efforts have been made to develop kinetic models of the inactivation using biological weighting functions considering the spectral sensitivity of ms2 fisher et al 2011 pioneered the measurement of the action spectra for ms2 fitting wavelength dependent experimental results with a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization function mattle et al 2015a calculated the inactivation as a function of the rate of photon

concluded that the best kinetic model was that of mattle et al 2015a with a new quantum yield optimized within a larger batch of experiments as yet however no model has taken into account the combined thermal photonic synergistic effect with the action spectra for the coliphage ms2 solar inactivation this work presents a novel approach for the kinetic modeling of the thermal and wavelength

upside down at 37 c for 24 h the detection limit of this method was 2 pfu ml 1 2 2 experimental design three sets of experiments were conducted firstly experiments were carried out at different water temperatures 30 40 45 and 50 c under dark conditions in order to estimate the contribution of the water temperature effect in the dark thermal inactivation of ms2 virus secondly inactivation experiments were carried out under different uv 280 400 nm irradiances 15 20 30 40 and 50 w m 2 and water temperatures 30 40 45 and 50 c to calibrate the irradiance effect and its synergistic effect with water temperature as a reference the uv 280 400 nm irradiance of the astm g173 a m 1 5 standard solar spectrum is 46 1 w m 2 finally experiments for the validation of the model predictions were carried out using plastic materials with different uv b transmittance plastic sheets were placed between the radiation source and the water to assess the effect of the spectral distribution on the efficacy of the inactivation the sheets materials comprised polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp and poly methylmethacrylate pmma these plastics were selected due to the fact that they are potential materials for the manufacturing of sodis containers garcía gil et al 2020a for the three scenarios experiments were conducted at 15 and 50 w m 2 of uv 280 400 nm radiation and water temperatures of 30 40 and 50 c inactivation of the ms2 virus was studied in autoclaved distilled water with sodium chloride 0 9 w v at an initial ms2 concentration of 105 pfu ml 1 experiments were carried out in a solar simulator atlas suntest xls usa equipped with a xenon lamp and a combination of filters to simulate the outdoors solar radiation spectrum the emission spectrum and the irradiance were measured with an avaspec uls2048 200 800 nm the reactor used for these experiments was an open glass vessel with a diameter of 19 cm and a total volume of 700 ml the exterior of the vessel was completely black to avoid uncontrolled light reflections and guarantee that only the measured direct radiation participates in the process constant stirring of 250 rpm was kept during the experiments to ensure a homogeneous concentration of ms2 virus 2 3 kinetic modeling the kinetic analysis of the experimental data was carried out through the estimation of the kinetic parameters for the different sub models according to the following sequential steps i dark thermal inactivation ii global uv irradiance and thermal synergistic effect iii wavelength dependent spectral action and iv spectral thermal synergistic effect 2 4 dark thermal inactivation no kinetic description was required for the dark inactivation since the experimental data recorded in the potential environmental temperature range up to 50 c showed negligible inactivation results fig s1 2 5 uv irradiance and thermal synergistic effect the inactivation data were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 1 1 d c d t k c 2 ln c c 0 k t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the ms2 virus pfu ml 1 c is the concentration at a specific time t and k is the kinetic constant in the case of linear dependence on the inactivation with the irradiance the kinetic constant would be explicitly proportional to the global uv 280 400 nm irradiance i according to eq 3 3 ln c c 0 k i t despite the negligible effect of temperature in the dark inactivation a thermal radiation synergistic effect was considered to describe the influence of temperature on the photoinactivation of ms2 a modified arrhenius equation with a threshold temperature was used to describe the effect of the water temperature t on the photoinactivation kinetic constant k 4 k k 0 t t 0 n exp e a r 1 t 1 t 0 where k 0 is the temperature independent pre exponential factor n is a constant e a is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant and t 0 is the threshold temperature as peleg et al 2012 demonstrated the threshold temperature can be omitted leading to a different value of k 0 for the same value of k however the present model kept the t 0 as a conceptual threshold to account for the limit temperature above which the synergistic effects are observed the kinetic parameters of the model k 0 n and e a r have been calculated by minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed kinetic constant in the experiments using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization algorithm microsoft excel solver 2 6 wavelength dependent spectral action the kinetic model proposed by mattle et al 2015a was used for modeling the sunlight inactivation of ms2 considering a biological weighting function to describe the spectral action eqs 5 7 the inactivation rate can be expressed as 5 d c d t φ v p v where φ v is the quantum yield of virus inactivation pfu photon 1 and p v is the volumetric rate of photon absorption by the virus photon s 1 ml 1 calculated as 6 p v λ p 0 λ ε v λ c d λ p 0 λ is the spectral photon flux density photon s 1 m2 nm 1 that in clear water and short optical pathway can be assumed to be constant and equivalent to that in the inlet surface ε v λ is the spectral extinction coefficient of the virus ml pfu 1 cm 1 whose values in the range from 240 to 400 nm can be obtained from the literature mattle et al 2015a by combining eq 2 with eq 6 the kinetic constant of inactivation takes the form 7 k φ v λ ε v λ i λ λ h c d λ where λ h c photon j 1 converts the energy units of the spectral irradiance i λ to the photonic units of p 0 λ being h the planck s constant and c the speed of light in vacuum the values of the quantum yield were calculated by minimizing the nrmse between the predicted and observed kinetic constant of experimental data with negligible thermal synergy effects obtained by nonlinear optimization with microsoft excel solver 2 7 spectral thermal synergistic effect at this point the first order kinetic constant for the ms2 photoinactivation is defined by two different processes i kinetic constant as a function of water temperature and radiation eq 4 and ii kinetic constant as a function of action spectra eq 7 in order to develop a model that involves both processes in a single expression the quantum yield was defined as a function of water temperature eq 8 8 φ v φ v 0 t t 0 n exp e a r 1 t 1 t 0 where n e a r and t 0 took the values previously calculated and φ v 0 was estimated by minimizing the nrmse between the predicted and observed kinetic constant by nonlinear optimization 3 results and discussion 3 1 dark thermal inactivation experiments under dark conditions were carried out at 30 40 45 and 50 c in order to study the effect of water temperature on the ms2 inactivation fig s1 in all cases the reduction in the concentration of viable viruses is negligible and lower than the experimental error therefore dark thermal inactivation alone can be discarded this is in agreement with romero et al 2011 who found that direct photolysis was responsible for ms2 solar inactivation in the 14 42 c temperature range in the absence of external sensitizers 3 2 uv irradiance and thermal synergistic effect data from ms2 inactivation experiments under illuminated conditions 15 20 30 40 and 50 w m 2 at different water temperatures 30 40 45 and 50 c were fitted with eq 2 first order kinetic model table s1 shows the observed average values of the kinetic constant for the different experimental conditions calculated from at least two replicates in all cases and with a fitting correlation factor higher than 0 99 an obvious relation between the values of the kinetic constant and the irradiance can be clearly observed fig 1 a the higher the irradiance the higher the value of k this dependence is proved to be linear as expressed in eq 3 when plotting the values of the calculated kinetic constant k min 1 divided by the irradiance k m2 w 1 min 1 fig 1b and it shows that the values are similar for each temperature with differences in the range of the experimental error in contrast with the results of dark thermal inactivation fig s1 fig 1 shows that water temperature clearly affects the photoinactivation rate at t 40 c this synergistic effect has been included in the model by means of the temperature dependence of the kinetic constant according to the modified arrhenius equation using a value of 40 c 313 k for the temperature threshold t 0 as shown in fig 1 this is the value above which the photoinactivation kinetics seems to be affected by temperature in any case the value of t 0 is arbitrary leading to different values of k 0 and n for the same values of k as shown by peleg et al 2012 calculation of the kinetic parameters n 423 k 0 3 84 10 3 min 1 and e a r 1 30 105 k was carried out by simultaneous fitting of the experimental data for the entire range of irradiances and temperatures with an nrmse of 10 3 see fig s2 1 s2 2 s2 3 and s2 4 3 3 wavelength dependent spectral action the model developed so far satisfactorily reproduces the solar inactivation of ms2 virus as a combination of uv irradiance and thermal effects however this model can only be applied to water disinfection processes using radiation with the exact spectral distribution of the solar light if the spectral distribution of the incident radiation is modified but the global uv remains the same the effective damage can change dramatically therefore the wavelength dependent spectral action of the ms2 photoinactivation needs to be modeled in order to predict the behavior of solar disinfection containers with different transmission spectra as suggested by mattle et al 2015a the ms2 inactivation rate can be calculated by multiplying the quantum yield the concentration of viruses and the volumetric rate of photon absorption calculated as the integration in wavelength of the spectral virus extinction coefficient by the spectral irradiance for each wavelength ms2 virus extinction coefficients were taken from the literature mattle et al 2015a whereas the quantum yield was calculated from experimental data of the inactivation at 30 c in which thermal effects can be neglected fig 1 spectral data of the incident light from 280 nm below which solar irradiance is negligible to 400 nm above which radiation absorption by ms2 virus can also be neglected were used see table s3 the calculated quantum yield was φ v 2 07 10 3 pfu inactivated per absorbed photon with an error value of 11 nrmse as a reference the error values calculated between the observed ms2 photoinactivation kinetic constant and the prediction of action spectra models using the quantum yield values reported by mattle et al 2015a and silverman et al 2019 were 43 and 92 respectively fig 2 and table s2 although the three models use the same type of biological weighting function based on the virus absorption spectra the observed discrepancies are the result of different experimental sets and calculation procedures the new quantum yield calculated in this work was found to be between the quantum yields calculated by other authors but closer to the one reported by mattle et al 2015a that used the same spectral range from 280 to 400 nm for the calculation in contrast silverman et al 2019 considered irradiance data from 290 nm although the irradiance in the 280 300 nm range is very low the sensitivity of the ms2 virus at these wavelengths is very high which is reflected in the extinction coefficient the reason for these apparent discrepancies is the high sensibility of the results to the experimental data provided by the spectroradiometer small variations of spectral irradiance in the range from 280 to 300 nm could lead to significant differences in the calculation of the global quantum yield 3 4 spectral thermal synergistic effect finally the complete model was developed by combining the radiation and thermal synergistic model with the action spectra previously described in general it is expected that due to the thermal sensitivity of the virus demonstrated above more viruses will be inactivated per absorbed photon if the water temperature is higher using the values of the thermal parameters calculated previously t 0 313 k n 423 and e a r 1 3 105 k the value of the pre exponential quantum yield φ v 0 in eq 8 was calculated from the simultaneous fitting of all the experimental data i e 2 15 10 3 pfu were inactivated per absorbed photon the nrmse fitting error was 9 2 which is lower than the 10 3 found in the thermal synergistic model considering the total uv irradiance this fact confirms the meaningful enhancement of the model when the action spectrum is considered and the improved prediction capabilities of the complete model represented by the first order kinetics constant calculated by eq 9 9 k φ v 0 t t 0 n exp e a r 1 t 1 t 0 λ ε v λ i λ λ h c d λ predicted inactivation kinetic constants were compared to the observed values in fig 3 and showed a very good agreement with a random distribution of the fitting error moreover when the values of the kinetic constants are divided by the irradiance all the curves clearly overlap figure 1 b as expected from the linear dependence of the reaction rate with the irradiance 3 5 validation of the model the remarkable strength of the developed model is its capability of predicting the ms2 photoinactivation rate under different solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for different locations worldwide moreover for the specific application of solar water disinfection the model allows accurate calculation of the expected inactivation rate as a function of the transmission spectra of the container the validation of the model predictions was carried out using plastic materials of different uv b transmittance i e pet pp and pmma the transmission of the materials in the global uv b range is 1 44 and 57 and in the uv a range 59 60 and 86 respectively the radiation transmitted by the plastics for a global uv 280 400 nm irradiance of 50 w m 2 and the extinction coefficients that describe the spectral sensibility of the ms2 virus to the photoinactivation are shown in fig 4 see the data in table s3 as can be observed the uv b is the critical region in which the virus absorption overlaps with the available incident radiation fig 5 shows the comparison between the observed and the predicted kinetic constants for pet pp and pmma scenarios if we consider the fully predictive nature of the kinetic constants calculated by the model they are not fitting values but predictions from the model using kinetic parameters calculated in a completely different experimental set of data the agreement can be considered to be very good with reasonable values of nrmse of 28 and 18 for pp and pmma respectively in the case of pet the nrmse is much higher 60 due to the very low values of the inactivation rates achieved by this low uv b transmission material for the pp and pmma scenarios the observed inactivation rates were obviously lower than those without plastic due to their partial transmittance however despite the higher transmittance of the pmma in the global uv b range the kinetic constants were higher in the pp scenario the reason is that pp transmission is slightly higher in the 280 290 nm range where the photons produce greater damage however as shown in fig 4 the emission of the solar simulator overestimates the irradiance of the standard am 1 5 solar spectrum especially in the 280 300 nm range where the process is especially sensitive consequently under real sunlight pp would be expected to perform similarly or even slightly worse than pmma model validation confirms the remarkable potential of the spectral thermal synergistic model to predict ms2 photoinactivation with sunlight under different spectral and global irradiance values and temperatures around the world specifically for the application of solar water disinfection processes with any kind of container moreover the methodology and mathematical model presented can easily be extrapolated to other viruses and pathogens with the obvious recalculation of the specific kinetic parameters however this model has been developed for clear water and in real conditions water could contain naturally occurring substances that can act as external sensitizers i e natural organica matter nom and or attenuating factors i e turbidity several ppri have been found to participate in the virus inactivation such as hydroxyl radicals mattle et al 2015b triplet state organic matter rosado lausell et al 2013 carbonate radicals mattle et al 2015b and especially singlet oxygen kohn et al 2007 kohn and nelson 2007 rosado lausell et al 2013 although most of these substances can be removed by a previous household filtration using cloth or ceramic filters or by the spontaneous decantation during sodis process who 2002 if their presence in water cannot be neglected they should be considered in the model to enhance the prediction of field conditions kohn et al 2016 furthermore in the case of using high volume containers the damage produced by the external ppri can be completely overshadowed by the role of the sensitizers as attenuators of radiation garcía gil et al 2020 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the ms2 inactivation in clear water at ambient conditions has been developed as a function of the water temperature irradiance and spectral response of the virus the model predictions show a great agreement average error of 9 with experimental data obtained in a solar simulator the developed model considers for the first time the effect of water temperature on the virus inactivation showing no effect in the dark but a strong thermal photonic synergy under solar illumination at temperatures above 40 c regarding the irradiance and the spectral distribution of the incident light the model reproduces the expected biological spectral action according to the radiation absorption spectra of the viral dna taking into account explicitly the spectrum of the light the model can predict the ms2 inactivation rate at different locations around the world and using containers made of materials with different transmission spectra employed to disinfect water by the sodis process at the household level model predictions were validated using pet pp and pmma materials with errors of 28 and 18 for pp and pmma respectively and insignificant inactivation for pet the material most widely used for sodis processes in any case application of the model to field conditions could require recalibration of the kinetic parameters to account for the specific substances present in the water that could either enhance the process acting as sensitizers for the generation of ppri or to the contrary diminish the efficiency by their role as attenuators of radiation declaration of competing interest the

17753,sunlight can be an effective tool for inactivating pathogens in water disinfection processes in clear water photoinactivation of viruses is driven by the absorption of uvb radiation and it is more efficient at shorter wavelengths moreover the temperature can significantly improve the efficiency of the process to date no kinetic model has been reported that describes the simultaneous thermal and spectral effects that occur during the solar inactivation of viruses this work presents a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the solar inactivation of ms2 coliphage as a function of the water temperature irradiance and spectral distribution of the incident radiation the model is based on a combination of the modified arrhenius equation a wavelength dependent first order inactivation

an accurate prediction of inactivation rates for real solar disinfection systems worldwide using containers made of any material graphical abstract image 1 keywords water temperature solar irradiance quantum yield ms2 virus sodis household water treatment 1 introduction waterborne viruses are still a global challenge especially for drinking water supply in low income countries the presence of viruses in drinking water sources is problematic due to their high resistance to disinfection processes compared to bacteria several factors have been found to influence the survival of viruses being the most important i water characteristics ii water temperature and iii solar irradiance davies colley et al 2000 fisher et al 2012 2008 gómez couso et al 2010 maynard et al 1999 mcguigan et al 2012 sinton et al 2002 the disinfection of water by exposure to sunlight is called sodis process and it has been considered as a potential household water treatment for low income countries during solar exposure water temperature can significantly increase above 30 40 c with an observed synergistic effect between solar irradiation and water temperature castro alférez et al 2017 2018 fisher et al 2008 gómez couso et al 2010 mcguigan et al 1998 romero et al 2011 solar inactivation of microbial pathogens can take place through three types of damaging mechanisms i direct endogenous damage ii indirect endogenous damage and iii indirect exogenous damage nelson et al 2018 endogenous damage i and ii is based on intracellular processes while the direct damage i is caused by absorption of radiation by some of the microorganism constituents indirect damage ii is the result of attacks to the microbial components by photo produced reactive intermediates ppri such as hydroxyl carbonate and superoxide radicals singlet oxygen carbonate radical or triplet state organic matter which have been generated by sensitizers activated by solar photons nelson et al 2018 in the case of the viruses due to their simple structure consisting of a genome surrounded by a protein capsid this indirect endogenous damage mechanism can be neglected finally the indirect exogenous damage iii is based on the harmful effects of the external ppri generated by external sensitizers present in unclear water therefore photoinactivation of viruses in clear water can be reasonably assumed to take place mainly through direct endogenous damage based on the absorption of uv b solar radiation love et al 2010 viruses have been demonstrated to be very sensitive to wavelengths from 280 to 320 nm and in general the shorter the wavelength the more harmful the damage the action spectra of photoinactivation closely keep the shape of the absorption spectra of the nucleic acids and proteins lytle and sagripanti 2005 one example of this is coliphage ms2 a single stranded rna virus that infects escherichia coli bacteria and other enterobacteriaceae which is commonly used as an indicator of photoinactivation due to its higher resistance in comparison with other viruses or bacteria love et al 2010 theitler et al 2012 in this regard the selection of the material employed for the manufacturing of the solar disinfection systems in particular its transmittance in the uv b range is a critical factor for the efficacy of the process garcía gil et al 2020a in the literature many efforts have been made to develop kinetic models of the inactivation using biological weighting functions considering the spectral sensitivity of ms2 fisher et al 2011 pioneered the measurement of the action spectra for ms2

photoinactivation rate at t 40 c this synergistic effect has been included in the model by means of the temperature dependence of the kinetic constant according to the modified arrhenius equation using a value of 40 c 313 k for the temperature threshold t 0 as shown in fig 1 this is the value above which the photoinactivation kinetics seems to be affected by temperature in any case the value of t 0 is arbitrary leading to different values of k 0 and n for the same values of k as shown by peleg et al 2012 calculation of the kinetic parameters n 423 k 0 3 84 10 3 min 1 and e a r 1 30 105 k was carried out by simultaneous fitting of the experimental data for the entire range of irradiances and temperatures with an nrmse of 10 3 see fig s2 1 s2 2 s2 3 and s2 4 3 3 wavelength dependent spectral action the model developed so far satisfactorily reproduces the solar inactivation of ms2 virus as a combination of uv irradiance and thermal effects however this model can only be applied to water disinfection processes using radiation with the exact spectral distribution of the solar light if the spectral distribution of the incident radiation is modified but the global uv remains the same the effective damage can change dramatically therefore the wavelength dependent spectral action of the ms2 photoinactivation needs to be modeled in order to predict the behavior of solar disinfection containers with different transmission spectra as suggested by mattle et al 2015a the ms2 inactivation rate can be calculated by multiplying the quantum yield the concentration of viruses and the volumetric rate of photon absorption calculated as the integration in wavelength of the spectral virus extinction coefficient by the spectral irradiance for each wavelength ms2 virus extinction coefficients were taken from the literature mattle et al 2015a whereas the quantum yield was calculated from experimental data of the inactivation at 30 c in which thermal effects can be neglected fig 1 spectral data of the incident light from 280 nm below which solar irradiance is negligible to 400 nm above which radiation absorption by ms2 virus can also be neglected were used see table s3 the calculated quantum yield was φ v 2 07 10 3 pfu inactivated per absorbed photon with an error value of 11 nrmse as a reference the error values calculated between the observed ms2 photoinactivation kinetic constant and the prediction of action spectra models using the quantum yield values reported by mattle et al 2015a and silverman et al 2019 were 43 and 92 respectively fig 2 and table s2 although the three models use the same type of biological weighting function based on the virus absorption spectra the observed discrepancies are the result of different experimental sets and calculation procedures the new quantum yield calculated in this work was found to be between the quantum yields calculated by other authors but closer to the one reported by mattle et al 2015a that used the same spectral range from 280 to 400 nm for the calculation in contrast silverman et al 2019 considered irradiance data from 290 nm although the irradiance in the 280 300 nm range is very low the sensitivity of the ms2 virus at these wavelengths is very high which is reflected in the extinction coefficient the reason for these apparent discrepancies is the high sensibility of the results to the experimental data provided by the spectroradiometer small variations of spectral irradiance in the range from 280 to 300 nm could lead to significant differences in the calculation of the global quantum yield 3 4 spectral thermal synergistic effect finally the complete model was developed by combining the radiation and thermal synergistic model with the action spectra previously described in general it is expected that due to the thermal sensitivity of the virus demonstrated above more viruses will be inactivated per absorbed photon if the water temperature is higher using the values of the thermal parameters calculated previously t 0 313 k n 423 and e a r 1 3 105 k the value of the pre exponential quantum yield φ v 0 in eq 8 was calculated from the simultaneous fitting of all the experimental data i e 2 15 10 3 pfu were inactivated per absorbed photon the nrmse fitting error was 9 2 which is lower than the 10 3 found in the thermal synergistic model considering the total uv irradiance this fact confirms the meaningful enhancement of the model when the action spectrum is considered and the improved prediction capabilities of the complete model represented by the first order kinetics constant calculated by eq 9 9 k φ v 0 t t 0 n exp e a r 1 t 1 t 0 λ ε v λ i λ λ h c d λ predicted inactivation kinetic constants were compared to the observed values in fig 3 and showed a very good agreement with a random distribution of the fitting error moreover when the values of the kinetic constants are divided by the irradiance all the curves clearly overlap figure 1 b as expected from the linear dependence of the reaction rate with the irradiance 3 5 validation of the model the remarkable strength of the developed model is its capability of predicting the ms2 photoinactivation rate under different solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for different locations worldwide moreover for the specific application of solar water disinfection the model allows accurate calculation of the expected inactivation rate as a function of the transmission spectra of the container the validation of the model predictions was carried out using plastic materials of different uv b transmittance i e pet pp and pmma the transmission of the materials in the global uv b range is 1 44 and 57 and in the uv a range 59 60 and 86 respectively the radiation transmitted by the plastics for a global uv 280 400 nm irradiance of 50 w m 2 and the extinction coefficients that describe the spectral sensibility of the ms2 virus to the photoinactivation are shown in fig 4 see the data in table s3 as can be observed the uv b is the critical region in which the virus absorption overlaps with the available incident radiation fig 5 shows the comparison between the observed and the predicted kinetic constants for pet pp and pmma scenarios if we consider the fully predictive nature of the kinetic constants calculated by the model they are not fitting values but predictions from the model using kinetic parameters calculated in a completely different experimental set of data the agreement can be considered to be very good with reasonable values of nrmse of 28 and 18 for pp and pmma respectively in the case of pet the nrmse is much higher 60 due to the very low values of the inactivation rates achieved by this low uv b transmission material for the pp and pmma scenarios the observed inactivation rates were obviously lower than those without plastic due to their partial transmittance however despite the higher transmittance of the pmma in the global uv b range the kinetic constants were higher in the pp scenario the reason is that pp transmission is slightly higher in the 280 290 nm range where the photons produce greater damage however as shown in fig 4 the emission of the solar simulator overestimates the irradiance of the standard am 1 5 solar spectrum especially in the 280 300 nm range where the process is especially sensitive consequently under real sunlight pp would be expected to perform similarly or even slightly worse than pmma model validation confirms the remarkable potential of the spectral thermal synergistic model to predict ms2 photoinactivation with sunlight under different spectral and global irradiance values and temperatures around the world specifically for the application of solar water disinfection processes with any kind of container moreover the methodology and mathematical model presented can easily be extrapolated to other viruses and pathogens with the obvious recalculation of the specific kinetic parameters however this model has been developed for clear water and in real conditions water could contain naturally occurring substances that can act as external sensitizers i e natural organica matter nom and or attenuating factors i e turbidity several ppri have been found to participate in the virus inactivation such as hydroxyl radicals mattle et al 2015b triplet state organic matter rosado lausell et al 2013 carbonate radicals mattle et al 2015b and especially singlet oxygen kohn et al 2007 kohn and nelson 2007 rosado lausell et al 2013 although most of these substances can be removed by a previous household filtration using cloth or ceramic filters or by the spontaneous decantation during sodis process who 2002 if their presence in water cannot be neglected they should be considered in the model to enhance the prediction of field conditions kohn et al 2016 furthermore in the case of using high volume containers the damage produced by the external ppri can be completely overshadowed by the role of the sensitizers as attenuators of radiation garcía gil et al 2020 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the ms2 inactivation in clear water at ambient conditions has been developed as a function of the water temperature irradiance and spectral response of the virus the model predictions show a great agreement average error of 9 with experimental data obtained in a solar simulator the developed model considers for the first time the effect of water temperature on the virus inactivation showing no effect in the dark but a strong thermal photonic synergy under solar illumination at temperatures above 40 c regarding the irradiance and the spectral distribution of the incident light the model reproduces the expected biological spectral action according to the radiation absorption spectra of the viral dna taking into account explicitly the spectrum of the light the model can predict the ms2 inactivation rate at different locations around the world and using containers made of materials with different transmission spectra employed to disinfect water by the sodis process at the household level model predictions were validated using pet pp and pmma materials with errors of 28 and 18 for pp and pmma respectively and insignificant inactivation for pet the material most widely used for sodis processes in any case application of the model to field conditions could require recalibration of the kinetic parameters to account for the specific substances present in the water that could either enhance the process acting as sensitizers for the generation of ppri or to the contrary diminish the efficiency by their role as attenuators of radiation declaration of competing interest the

17754,this study investigates the effect of physicochemical conditions on the partial nitritation and anammox treatment by immobilized ammonia oxidizers under ammonium deplete conditions the impact of oxygen and temperature was studied by measuring the activity of immobilized aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing organisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa and anammox bacteria embedded in polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa beads and in thin layer poly ethylene glycol hydrogels beads and flat hydrogels were incubated in a fluidized bed reactor fbr and in two flow cells respectively both systems were fed with synthetic wastewater 15 mg n nh4 l at different temperatures 20 c and or 30 c and different dissolved oxygen do concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 5 and or 1 mg l over 152 and 207 days respectively the fbr system had a maximum removal rate of 1 7 g n m3 d at 0 1 mg o2 l corresponding to 80 removal efficiency while a high aerobic ammonia oxidizing activity but a partial oxygen inhibition of anammox bacteria were observed at higher do concentrations in both flow cells nitrogen removal efficiency was highest 80 at 30 c and 1 mg o2 l while removal was less favorable at lower do and lower temperature our results indicate a potential use of hydrogel beads for an energy efficient technology with reduced aeration demand for treating low ammonia wastewater while layered hydrogels are a possible first step for biological treatments of wastewater using tangential flow in addition we provide blueprint drawings of the flow cells which may be used to 3d print the apparatus for other applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords cell immobilization aob aoa anammox flow cell temperature dissolved oxygen 1 introduction the discharge of nitrogen rich wastewater into receiving water bodies contributes to eutrophication oxygen depletion and associated degradation of environmental quality ahn 2006 the ammonium concentration in typical untreated domestic wastewaters fluctuates between 10 and 45 mg l tchobanoglous et al 2003 but can be as high as 600 1000 mg l in the reject water sidestream of anaerobic digesters fux et al 2002 the removal of ammonium as nitrogen gas via conventional nitrification and denitrification is an energy intensive process metcalf 2003 winkler and straka 2019 but the combination of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria respectively can reduce this aeration demand by 60 winkler et al 2012b delgado vela et al 2015 aob are chemolitho autotrophic microorganisms that oxidize ammonia to nitrite which is used by anammox along with ammonium to anaerobically form dinitrogen gas ding et al 2013 however in order to successfully pair aob and anammox the conversion of nitrite into nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob must be suppressed the different strategies for suppressing nitrite oxidation in sidestream wastewater have included maintaining do concentration at microaerophilic levels blackburne et al 2008 operating at high ph values ph 7 5 8 to take advantage of free ammonia inhibition of nob park et al 2010 or operating at a high temperature ca 30 c and short hydraulic retention time hellinga et al 1998 while anammox has been successfully applied in sidestream processes the implementation in the cold ammonium depleted mainstream remains a bottleneck straka et al 2019a thus the use of higher biomass concentrations ali et al 2015 or ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa having a much higher affinity for ammonia konneke et al 2005 stahl and de la torre 2012 offer new opportunities for mainstream operations while the implementation of anammox with aoa is not yet established the co localization of aob and anammox in dense biofilms such as granular sludge reactor is common practice in sidestream treatment van dongen et al 2001 winkler et al 2012b natural granule formation in sludge reactors is promoted by operating conditions that select for the natural aggregation of slow growing microorganisms such as anammox bacteria and aob into near spherical granules of bacteria bound together by a matrix of exopolysaccharides liu et al 2009 in comparison to activated sludge as granular sludge offers several advantages such as better sludge settleability higher retention time and greater resistance to treatment fluctuations winkler et al 2018 however autotrophic microorganisms are slow growing with a doubling time of up to 11 days prosser 1990 strous et al 1998 isaka et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 which will be lowered even further under mainstream conditions hence presenting a challenge to reactor start up lotti et al 2014 soliman and eldyasti 2018 thus there is a clear need for alternative strategies for establishing high biomass retention of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers in the recent years cell entrapment in polymer matrices has been well documented as an alternative to natural granules due to the capacity of hydrogels to retain high metabolic activity be produced rapidly offer good diffusion of substrates and metabolites and retain biomass at the high concentrations required for treating high ammonia loadings at low temperature rathore et al 2013 straka et al 2019a several strategies using carriers with different combinations of polymers and geometries have been investigated for the treatment of

while the effect of operating parameters on performances is known for high strength wastewater the functioning of hydrogels remains poorly described for ammonium deplete conditions qiao et al 2013 xu

samarasinghe et al 2016 in the present study we describe the fabrication and analysis of hydrogels formed as beads or as a thin layer immobilized on an oxygen impermeable surface with embedded ammonia

reached ca 90 of net ammonia removal they were disaggregated with a tissue grinder and used for cell immobilization 2 3 cell immobilization and culture conditions 2 3 1 fabrication of hydrogel beads

entrapped ammonia oxidizers anammox bacteria in pva sa hydrogel beads the do concentration is a key process parameter in wastewater treatment that greatly influences ammonia removal efficiency holenda et al 2008 while response to oxygen has been extensively studied in granular and activated sludge systems stenstrom and poduska 1980 van dongen et al 2001 sliekers et al 2003 jianlong and ning 2004 park and noguera 2004 guo et al 2009 less is known about the response within the hydrogel matrix chen et al 2011 xu et al 2017 especially in low strength wastewater jo et al 2020 therefore we examined the relationship between do and the activity of sludge embedded in hydrogel beads fig 1 prior to embedding days 5 0 period 0 do 0 3 mg o2 l natural granules established in the mini fbr were very active removing up to 87 of ammonium corresponding to a nitrogen removal rate nrr of ca 1 9 g n m3 d on day 0 while only a transient presence of nitrite and no nitrate were detected indicating that nob were not active in the system the natural granules were then embedded in hydrogel beads during the first 43 days of startup period 1 do 0 3 mg o2 l ammonia removal efficiency by embedded ammonia oxidizers dropped to 7 before slowly stabilizing around 31 by day 43 the initial depression of activity presumably reflected the dilution of biomass in the gels as well as the stress due to the nitrite accumulation up to ca 8 2 mg no2 n l on day 24 and gel immobilization process kalvelage et al 2011 lotti et al 2012 an increase in the initial anammox biomass during fabrication would likely improve performance by reducing nitrite inhibition in the early stages of the operation possibly achieving removal rates higher than natural granules ali et al 2015 nitrate was not detectable during this period indicating successful inhibition of nob after increasing the do to 0 5 mg o2 l days 44 68 period 2 net ammonia removal continuously increased in the system until it plateaued at 50 nrr 1 g n m3 d towards the end of the period during this phase all nitrite was utilized while nitrate production by anammox and nob rose to ca 0 8 g no3 m3 d on day 68 representing 40 of the nlr this result is not surprising given that nob have a lower oxygen affinity compared to aob thus requiring a higher oxygen concentration to become active blackburne et al 2008 although as expected nob activity increased at higher do the net ammonia removal also increased in the system possibly due to the protective effect of nob that scavenged the remaining oxygen that would otherwise be toxic for anammox bacteria as previously reported by vlaeminck et al 2010 and lotti et al 2015 for granules in lab and pilot scale nitritation anammox systems in order to improve the anammox activity and inhibit nob growth the oxygen concentration was lowered to 0 1 mg o2 l during the final period days 69 152 period 3 following an initial loss of net ammonia removal down to 11 during the first 11 days of operation at the lower do there was a rapid recovery by day 114 ammonia removal efficiencies of 70 80 corresponding to an nrr of up to 1 7 g n m3 d were then maintained throughout the duration of the run suggesting successful out competition of nob and selection for nitritation anammox this do is consistent with the lab results of yin et al 2016 but lower than the optimal do 0 5 0 6 mg o2 l reported for natural nitritation anammox granules similarly do required to suppress nob growth was lower than previously suggested 0 3 mg o2 l by blackburne et al 2008 this can be attributed to the slightly greater diffusion of oxygen into hydrogels relative to natural granules sun et al 1989 beyenal and tanyolac 1994 chiu et al 2006 the ammonium oxidation by aerobic ammonia oxidizers remained high when the do was lower with 1 93 g nh4 m3 d oxidized at 0 1 mg o2 l versus 1 8 g nh4 m3 d at 0 5 mg o2 l these results suggest that cell immobilization in hydrogels would likely decrease the aeration demand of a full scale treatment process for ammonium depleted wastewater nitrite remained close to 0 until the final 15 days of operation increasing to ca 0 33 g no2 m3 d produced before termination of the run nitrite accumulation likely reflected a more rapid loss of nob activity at low oxygen than could be compensated for by a corresponding increase in the slower growing anammox bacteria blackburne et al 2008 the increase in nitrite was accompanied by a reduction in the nitrate production decreasing to ca 0 2 g no3 m3 d towards the end of the experiment as anammox produces nitrate in its anabolic metabolism nh4 1 32 no2 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 we estimate that 70 of the nitrate was produced by anammox and the remainder by nob overall the hydrogel displayed good stability over 150 days as previously observed in different types of reactors cao et al 2002 quan et al 2011 magri et al 2012 qiao et al 2013 ali et al 2015 xu et al 2017 suggesting that they are a viable option for ammonium depleted wastewater treatment the measured removal efficiencies up to 80 are also similar to those previously observed with pva beads 76 90 qiao et al 2013 ali et al 2015 xu et al 2017 jo et al 2020 and other configurations of hydrogels 58 80 isaka et al 2013 bae et al 2017 in both ammonium rich and depleted wastewater at higher do in addition we anticipate that hydrogels would reach a higher capacity than natural granules ng at lower initial biomass concentrations ali et al 2015 higher diffusivity of hydrogels may be beneficial to obtain high ammonia conversions if compared to natural biofilms at low do contributing to a more efficient do utilization and hence reduced aeration demand hydrogel separation can be expected to behave similar to natural biofilms as settling velocities of pva beads 177 m h and granular sludge 130 m h are comparable khanh et al 2011 winkler et al 2012a additionally unlike granular sludge the stability of hydrogels does not depend on the production of eps by heterotrophs de kreuk et al 2007 subramanian et al 2010 making it less sensitive to environmental conditions or operating upsets therefore it represents a potential candidate for applications in ammonium depleted wastewater 3 2 influence of culture conditions on net ammonia removal by entrapped ammonia oxidizers anammox bacteria in thin layer peg hydrogels we further evaluated two additional reactor configurations hosting thin layer hydrogels two types of flow cells were designed to operate as plugflow frontal feeding or as complete mix lateral feeding mini reactors fig 2 dispersed granules were embedded in hydrogels using a variation of the method described for fabrication of hydrogel beads based on the photoclick reaction during the first period days 0 50 under standard conditions do 1 mg o2 l 30 c the net ammonium removal steadily increased and stabilized to ca 1750 μg nh4 n l in both flow cells on the other hand no nitrite or nitrate production was detected in the effluents as observed throughout the run excepted during period 4 based on partial nitritation anammox reaction stoichiometry approximately 80 of the theoretical maximum ammonium removal efficiency was reached during this period with yields close to previously reported gel carriers under similar conditions qiao et al 2013 following a reduction in the do to 0 5 mg o2 l period 2 days 51 81 the net removal immediately decreased to ca 800 μg nh4 n l 72 efficiency for the remainder of period 2 in both flow cells as the ammonia conversion likely became limited by oxygen delivery into the gel due to a high consumption rate this behavior is not surprising as the growth rate of ammonia oxidizers proportionally increases with do within the range 0 1 1 mg o2 l as reported by park and noguera 2004 at the beginning of period 3 days 82 120 do was set back to 1 mg o2 l this resulted in a rapid increase in net ammonia removal in both flow cells reaching ca 1650 μg nh4 n l 75 4 efficiency in the plug flow reactor cell and 1500 μg nh4 n l 68 6 efficiency in the completely mixed reactor cell the rapid recovery in activity strongly suggests that the immobilization of cells in hydrogels provides system resiliency allowing cells to be retained during periods of stress and to rapidly recover when conditions become favorable again for growth kimura et al 2011 magri et al 2012 decreasing the temperature to 20 c in period 4 days 121 163 resulted in a sharp drop in ammonium removal ca 250 μg nh4 n l 11 4 efficiency in both flow cells this sharp decrease 84 of period 3 net removal highlights the importance of temperature control in maintaining activity de man et al 1988 matsushige et al 1990 grant and lin 1995 during this period ammonium oxidation remained high ca 0 7 mg no2 n l data not shown suggesting that anammox bacteria were differentially affected by the lower temperature related studies have reported an order of magnitude decrease in anammox activity when the temperature was reduced from 30 to 10 c isaka et al 2008 wang and li 2015 and a significant loss of activity in a system operating at 25 c when temperature was lowered to 20 c de almeida fernandes et al 2018 the observed temperature sensitivity of anammox is fully consistent with other studies demonstrating that reduced activity at lower temperature is an important bottleneck for partial nitritation anammox application to mainstream wastewater treatment cao et al 2017 straka et al 2019a in the final period period 5 days 164 211 setting operating conditions back to those of period one induced a sharp increase of net ammonium removal up to 1750 and 1500 μg nh4 n l 80 and 68 6 efficiency respectively on day 170 that finally stabilized around 1500 and 1000 μg nh4 n l 68 6 and 45 7 efficiency respectively in the side and front flow cells respectively the decrease in ammonia removal observed later during period 3 and 5 do 1 mg o2 l 30 c was especially significant in the plug flow cell after 165 days of culture 43 compared to period 1 net removal likely reflecting the degradation of the leading portion of this hydrogel with continuous plug flow operation gong 2006 this observation is in opposition with the stability observed with peg cubes isaka et al 2007 2013 2017 and might be a consequence of the very thin geometry of these hydrogels no nitrate was detected in the effluents indicating the absence of active nob in the system the effluent cell concentration remained stable throughout the culture at approximately 5 105 cells ml with 2 noticeable differences for the mixed flow cell during period 1 5 5 105 cells ml and plug flow cell during period 5 4 105 cells ml attributed to sampling bias de almeida fernandes et al 2018 the absence of significant changes in effluent cell concentrations and the dominance of heterotrophic populations in the effluent suppl 3 and 4 indicate that most of ammonia removal activity was retained in the gel matrix likely located in the peripheral layer as predicted by mathematical models picioreanu et al 1998 vogelsang et al 2002 hydrogel sampling during reactor operation would have terminated the experiment and therefore community analysis had to rely on sequencing data from the effluent based on the effluent community composition suppl 3 we conclude that suspended aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers were only minor contributors to reactor activity and that these functional guilds were primarily retained in the gels an endpoint analysis of the community failed due to extraction issues from the gel hence leaving the question of aoa survival in the gel unanswered however given the high ammonia removal activity under low ammonia concentrations fig 2 it is likely that aoa survived in deeper layers of the gel where concentrations are lowest hence allowing aoa to unfold their genetic potential to better thrive at very low oxygen and ammonia concentrations unlike their bacterial counterpart straka et al 2019b any organisms growing in deeper layers of the gel is less likely to shed into the effluent which would be reflected by the below detection numbers of aoa in effluent samples suppl 3 overall the gel immobilized ammonia oxidizers displayed a resilience to physicochemical changes suitable for treatment application with an optimal activity at the highest do 1 mg o2 l and 30 c as expected from previous studies on natural granules sudarno et al 2011 cao et al 2017 meng et al 2019 alisawi 2020 and hydrogels cao et al 2002 khanh et al 2011 the theoretical removal efficiency observed in standard conditions ca 80 is similar or higher than previously reported for peg cubes 58 82 furukawa et al 2009 isaka et al 2013 2017 additionally the hydrogels remained stable for over 200 days which is in alignment with previous research with peg cubes that were reported to yield stable operation for over a year in a full scale setup isaka et al 2017 however even though this result is promising performances still need to be investigated in a large scale setup and under constant aeration for a subsequent application in wastewater treatment in addition since no full scale installations are currently adapted for this technology the development of new setups using tangential flows possibly adapted from membrane reactors melin et al 2006 kim et al 2011 or tubular structures li et al 2018 would be needed a better control of ammonium delivery in such setups using ammonium sensors and a volumetric flow based control loop to balance ammonia supply and consumption rates would also help to maintain a high treatment capacity flux while keeping the concentrations low 4 conclusion aob aoa anammox were embedded in synthetic beads and thin layer hydrogels and removed up to 80 of the nitrogen load which is comparable to natural granules a long colonization phase and a strict control of dissolved oxygen at 0 1 mg o2 l is crucial as the combination of high oxygen diffusion and low initial cell concentration in hydrogel beads lead to nitratation by nob and oxygen inhibition of anammox the higher diffusivity of hydrogels may be beneficial to obtain high ammonia conversions if compared to natural biofilms at low do which may result in a more efficient do utilization and hence reduced aeration demand hydrogel beads can be used to treat ammonium depleted wastewater while flat hydrogels represent an advance in biological treatments with tangential flow flow cell devices have the potential to be used to study the physiology of a variety of

17754,this study investigates the effect of physicochemical conditions on the partial nitritation and anammox treatment by immobilized ammonia oxidizers under ammonium deplete conditions the impact of oxygen and temperature was studied by measuring the activity of immobilized aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing organisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa and anammox bacteria embedded in polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate pva sa beads and in thin layer poly ethylene glycol hydrogels beads and flat hydrogels were incubated in a fluidized bed reactor fbr and in two flow cells respectively both systems were fed with synthetic wastewater 15 mg n nh4 l at different temperatures 20 c and or 30 c and different dissolved oxygen do concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 5 and or 1 mg l over 152 and 207 days respectively the fbr system had a maximum removal rate of 1 7 g n m3 d at 0 1 mg o2 l corresponding to 80 removal efficiency while a high aerobic ammonia oxidizing activity but a partial oxygen inhibition of anammox bacteria were observed at higher do concentrations in both flow cells nitrogen removal efficiency was highest 80 at 30 c and 1 mg o2 l while removal was less favorable at lower do and lower temperature our results indicate a potential use of hydrogel beads for an energy efficient technology with reduced aeration demand for treating low ammonia wastewater while layered hydrogels are a possible first step for biological treatments of wastewater using tangential flow in addition we provide blueprint drawings of the flow cells which may be used to 3d

wastewater into receiving water bodies contributes to eutrophication oxygen depletion and associated degradation of environmental quality ahn 2006 the ammonium concentration in typical untreated domestic wastewaters fluctuates between 10 and 45 mg l tchobanoglous et al 2003 but can be as high as 600 1000 mg l in the reject water sidestream of anaerobic digesters fux et al 2002 the removal of ammonium as nitrogen gas via conventional nitrification and denitrification is an energy intensive process metcalf 2003 winkler and straka 2019 but the combination of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria respectively can reduce this aeration demand by 60 winkler et al 2012b delgado vela et al 2015 aob are chemolitho autotrophic microorganisms that oxidize ammonia to nitrite which is used by anammox along with ammonium to anaerobically form dinitrogen gas ding et al 2013 however in order to successfully pair aob and anammox the conversion of nitrite into nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob must be suppressed the different strategies for suppressing nitrite oxidation in sidestream wastewater have included maintaining do concentration at microaerophilic levels blackburne et al 2008 operating at high ph values ph 7 5 8 to take advantage of free ammonia inhibition of nob park et al 2010 or operating at a high temperature ca 30 c and short hydraulic retention time hellinga et al 1998 while anammox has been successfully applied in sidestream processes the implementation in the cold ammonium depleted mainstream remains a bottleneck straka et al 2019a thus the use of higher biomass concentrations ali et al 2015 or ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa having a much higher affinity for ammonia konneke et al 2005 stahl and de la torre 2012 offer new opportunities for mainstream operations while the implementation of anammox with aoa is not yet established the co localization of aob and anammox in dense biofilms such as granular sludge reactor is common practice in sidestream treatment van dongen et al 2001 winkler et al 2012b natural granule formation in sludge reactors is promoted by operating conditions that select for the natural aggregation of slow growing microorganisms such as anammox bacteria and aob into near spherical granules of bacteria bound together by a matrix of exopolysaccharides liu et al 2009 in comparison to activated sludge as granular sludge offers several advantages such as better sludge settleability higher retention time and greater resistance to treatment fluctuations winkler et al 2018 however autotrophic microorganisms are slow growing with a doubling time of up to 11 days prosser 1990 strous et al 1998 isaka et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 which will be lowered even further under mainstream conditions hence presenting a challenge to reactor start up lotti et al 2014 soliman and eldyasti 2018 thus there is a clear need for alternative strategies for establishing high biomass retention of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers in the recent years cell entrapment in polymer matrices has been well documented as an alternative to natural granules due to the capacity of hydrogels to retain high metabolic activity be produced rapidly offer good diffusion of substrates and metabolites and retain biomass at the high concentrations required for treating high ammonia loadings at low temperature rathore et al 2013 straka et al 2019a several strategies using carriers with different combinations of polymers and geometries have been investigated for the treatment of wastewater including single ali et al 2015 and double layered pva beads bae et al 2017 pva discs boušková et al 2011 or peg cubes isaka et al 2007 2013 2017 furukawa et al 2009 overall studies

while the effect of operating parameters on performances is known for high strength wastewater the functioning of hydrogels remains poorly described for ammonium deplete conditions qiao et al 2013 xu et al 2017 jo et al 2020 in addition few studies have reported the use of thin gel geometry for controlled delivery of ammonia and oxygen to the nitritation anammox process chen et al 2015 samarasinghe et al 2016 in the present study we describe the fabrication and analysis of hydrogels formed as beads or as a thin layer immobilized on an oxygen impermeable surface with embedded ammonia oxidizing microorganisms the ammonium removal performances of immobilized ammonia oxidizers were assessed in response to temperature and or do concentration in low strength ammonium wastewater in

reached ca 90 of net ammonia removal they were disaggregated with a tissue grinder and used for cell immobilization 2 3 cell immobilization and culture conditions 2 3 1 fabrication of hydrogel beads

entrapped ammonia oxidizers anammox bacteria in pva sa hydrogel beads the do concentration is a key process parameter in wastewater treatment that greatly influences ammonia removal efficiency holenda et al 2008 while response to oxygen has been extensively studied in granular and activated sludge systems stenstrom and poduska 1980 van dongen et al 2001 sliekers et al 2003 jianlong and ning 2004 park and noguera 2004 guo et al 2009 less is known about the response within the hydrogel matrix chen et al 2011 xu et al 2017 especially in low strength wastewater jo et al 2020 therefore we examined the relationship between do and the activity of sludge embedded in hydrogel beads fig 1 prior to embedding days 5 0 period 0 do 0 3 mg o2 l natural granules established in the mini fbr were very active removing up to 87 of ammonium corresponding to a nitrogen removal rate nrr of ca 1 9 g n m3 d on day 0 while only a transient presence of nitrite and no nitrate were detected indicating that nob were not active in the system the natural granules were then embedded in hydrogel beads during the first 43 days of startup period 1 do 0 3 mg o2 l ammonia removal efficiency by embedded ammonia oxidizers dropped to 7 before slowly stabilizing around 31 by day 43 the initial depression of activity presumably reflected the dilution of biomass in the gels as well as the stress due to the nitrite accumulation up to ca 8 2 mg no2 n l on day 24 and gel immobilization process kalvelage et al 2011 lotti et al 2012 an increase in the initial anammox biomass during fabrication would likely improve performance by reducing nitrite inhibition in the early stages of the operation possibly achieving removal rates higher than natural granules ali et al 2015 nitrate was not detectable during this period indicating successful inhibition of nob after increasing the do to 0 5 mg o2 l days 44 68 period 2 net ammonia removal continuously increased in the system until it plateaued at 50 nrr 1 g n m3 d towards the end of the period during this phase all nitrite was utilized while nitrate production by anammox and nob rose to ca 0 8 g no3 m3 d on day 68 representing 40 of the nlr this result is not surprising given that nob have a lower oxygen affinity compared to aob thus requiring a higher oxygen concentration to become active blackburne et al 2008 although as expected nob activity increased at higher do the net ammonia removal also increased in the system possibly due to the protective effect of nob that scavenged the remaining oxygen that would otherwise be toxic for anammox bacteria as previously reported by vlaeminck et al 2010 and lotti et al 2015 for granules in lab and pilot scale nitritation anammox systems in order to improve the anammox activity and inhibit nob growth the oxygen concentration was lowered to 0 1 mg o2 l during the final period days 69 152 period 3 following an initial loss of net ammonia removal down to 11 during the first 11 days of operation at the lower do there was a rapid recovery by day 114 ammonia removal efficiencies of 70 80 corresponding to an nrr of up to 1 7 g n m3 d were then maintained throughout the duration of the run suggesting successful out competition of nob and selection for nitritation anammox this do is consistent with the lab results of yin et al 2016 but lower than the optimal do 0 5 0 6 mg o2 l reported for natural nitritation anammox granules similarly do required to suppress nob growth was lower than previously suggested 0 3 mg o2 l by blackburne et al 2008 this can be attributed to the slightly greater diffusion of oxygen into hydrogels relative to natural granules sun et al 1989 beyenal and tanyolac 1994 chiu et al 2006 the ammonium oxidation by aerobic ammonia oxidizers remained high when the do was lower with 1 93 g nh4 m3 d oxidized at 0 1 mg o2 l versus 1 8 g nh4 m3 d at 0 5 mg o2 l these results suggest that cell immobilization in hydrogels would likely decrease the aeration demand of a full scale treatment process for ammonium depleted wastewater nitrite remained close to 0 until the final 15 days of operation increasing to ca 0 33 g no2 m3 d produced before termination of the run nitrite accumulation likely reflected a more rapid loss of nob activity at low oxygen than could be compensated for by a corresponding increase in the slower growing anammox bacteria blackburne et al 2008 the increase in nitrite was accompanied by a reduction in the nitrate production decreasing to ca 0 2 g no3 m3 d towards the end of the experiment as anammox produces nitrate in its anabolic metabolism nh4 1 32 no2 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 we estimate that 70 of the nitrate was produced by anammox and the remainder by nob overall the hydrogel displayed good stability over 150 days as previously observed in different types of reactors cao et al 2002 quan et al 2011 magri et al 2012 qiao et al 2013 ali et al 2015 xu et al 2017 suggesting that they are a viable option for ammonium depleted wastewater treatment the measured removal efficiencies up to 80 are also similar to those previously observed with pva beads 76 90 qiao et al 2013 ali et al 2015 xu et al 2017 jo et al 2020 and other configurations of hydrogels 58 80 isaka et al 2013 bae et al 2017 in both ammonium rich and depleted wastewater at higher do in addition we anticipate that hydrogels would reach a higher capacity than natural granules ng at lower initial biomass concentrations ali et al 2015 higher diffusivity of hydrogels may be beneficial to obtain high ammonia conversions if compared to natural biofilms at low do contributing to a more efficient do utilization and hence reduced aeration demand hydrogel separation can be expected to behave similar to natural biofilms as settling velocities of pva beads 177 m h and granular sludge 130 m h are comparable khanh et al 2011 winkler et al 2012a additionally unlike granular sludge the stability of hydrogels does not depend on the production of eps by heterotrophs de kreuk et al 2007 subramanian et al 2010 making it less sensitive to environmental conditions or operating upsets therefore it represents a potential candidate for applications in ammonium depleted wastewater 3 2 influence of culture conditions on net ammonia removal by entrapped ammonia oxidizers anammox bacteria in thin layer peg hydrogels we further evaluated two additional reactor configurations hosting thin layer hydrogels two types of flow cells were designed to operate as plugflow frontal feeding or as complete mix lateral feeding mini reactors fig 2 dispersed granules were embedded in hydrogels using a variation of the method described for fabrication of hydrogel beads based on the photoclick reaction during the first period days 0 50 under standard conditions do 1 mg o2 l 30 c the net ammonium removal steadily increased and stabilized to ca 1750 μg nh4 n l in both flow cells on the other hand no nitrite or nitrate production was detected in the effluents as observed throughout the run excepted during period 4 based on partial nitritation anammox reaction stoichiometry approximately 80 of the theoretical maximum ammonium removal efficiency was reached during this period with yields close to previously reported gel carriers under similar conditions qiao et al 2013 following a reduction in the do to 0 5 mg o2 l period 2 days 51 81 the net removal immediately decreased to ca 800 μg nh4 n l 72 efficiency for the remainder of period 2 in both flow cells as the ammonia conversion likely became limited by oxygen delivery into the gel due to a high consumption rate this behavior is not surprising as the growth rate of ammonia oxidizers proportionally increases with do within the range 0 1 1 mg o2 l as reported by park and noguera 2004 at the beginning of period 3 days 82 120 do was set back to 1 mg o2 l this resulted in a rapid increase in net ammonia removal in both flow cells reaching ca 1650 μg nh4 n l 75 4 efficiency in the plug flow reactor cell and 1500 μg nh4 n l 68 6 efficiency in the completely mixed reactor cell the rapid recovery in activity strongly suggests that the immobilization of cells in hydrogels provides system resiliency allowing cells to be retained during periods of stress and to rapidly recover when conditions become favorable again for growth kimura et al 2011 magri et al 2012 decreasing the temperature to 20 c in period 4 days 121 163 resulted in a sharp drop in ammonium removal ca 250 μg nh4 n l 11 4 efficiency in both flow cells this sharp decrease 84 of period 3 net removal highlights the importance of temperature control in maintaining activity de man et al 1988 matsushige et al 1990 grant and lin 1995 during this period ammonium oxidation remained high ca 0 7 mg no2 n l data not shown suggesting that anammox bacteria were differentially affected by the lower temperature related studies have reported an order of magnitude decrease in anammox activity when the temperature was reduced from 30 to 10 c isaka et al 2008 wang and li 2015 and a significant loss of activity in a system operating at 25 c when temperature was lowered to 20 c de almeida fernandes et al 2018 the observed temperature sensitivity of anammox is fully consistent with other studies demonstrating that reduced activity at lower temperature is an important bottleneck for partial nitritation anammox application to mainstream wastewater treatment cao et al 2017 straka et al 2019a in the final period period 5 days 164 211 setting operating conditions back to those of period one induced a sharp increase of net ammonium removal up to 1750 and 1500 μg nh4 n l 80 and 68 6 efficiency respectively on day 170 that finally stabilized around 1500 and 1000 μg nh4 n l 68 6 and 45 7 efficiency respectively in the side and front flow cells respectively the decrease in ammonia removal observed later during period 3 and 5 do 1 mg o2 l 30 c was especially significant in the plug flow cell after 165 days of culture 43 compared to period 1 net removal likely reflecting the degradation of the leading portion of this hydrogel with continuous plug flow operation gong 2006 this observation is in opposition with the stability observed with peg cubes isaka et al 2007 2013 2017 and might be a consequence of the very thin geometry of these hydrogels no nitrate was detected in the effluents indicating the absence of active nob in the system the effluent cell concentration remained stable throughout the culture at approximately 5 105 cells ml with 2 noticeable differences for the mixed flow cell during period 1 5 5 105 cells ml and plug flow cell during period 5 4 105 cells ml attributed to sampling bias de almeida fernandes et al 2018 the absence of significant changes in effluent cell concentrations and the dominance of heterotrophic populations in the effluent suppl 3 and 4 indicate that most of ammonia removal activity was retained in the gel matrix likely located in the peripheral layer as predicted by mathematical models picioreanu et al 1998 vogelsang et al 2002 hydrogel sampling during reactor operation would have terminated the experiment and therefore community analysis had to rely on sequencing data from the effluent based on the effluent community composition suppl 3 we conclude that suspended aerobic and anaerobic ammonia oxidizers were only minor contributors to reactor activity and that these functional guilds were primarily retained in the gels an endpoint analysis of the community failed due to extraction issues from the gel hence leaving the question of aoa survival in the gel unanswered however given the high ammonia removal activity under low ammonia concentrations fig 2 it is likely that aoa survived in deeper layers of the gel where concentrations are lowest hence allowing aoa to unfold their genetic potential to better thrive at very low oxygen and ammonia concentrations unlike their bacterial counterpart straka et al 2019b any organisms growing in deeper layers of the gel is less likely to shed into the effluent which would be reflected by the below detection numbers of aoa in effluent samples suppl 3 overall the gel immobilized ammonia oxidizers displayed a resilience to physicochemical changes suitable for treatment application with an optimal activity at the highest do 1 mg o2 l and 30 c as expected from previous studies on natural granules sudarno et al 2011 cao et al 2017 meng et al 2019 alisawi 2020 and hydrogels cao et al 2002 khanh et al 2011 the theoretical removal efficiency observed in standard conditions ca 80 is similar or higher than previously reported for peg cubes 58 82 furukawa et al 2009 isaka et al 2013 2017 additionally the hydrogels remained stable for over 200 days which is in alignment with previous research with peg cubes that were reported to yield stable operation for over a year in a full scale setup isaka et al 2017 however even though this result is promising performances still need to be investigated in a large scale setup and under constant aeration for a subsequent application in wastewater treatment in addition since no full scale installations are currently adapted for this technology the development of new setups using tangential flows possibly adapted from membrane reactors melin et al 2006 kim et al 2011 or tubular structures li et al 2018 would be needed a better control of ammonium delivery in such setups using ammonium sensors and a volumetric flow based control loop to balance ammonia supply and consumption rates would also help to maintain a high treatment capacity flux while keeping the concentrations low 4 conclusion aob aoa anammox were embedded in synthetic beads and thin layer hydrogels and removed up to 80 of the nitrogen load which is comparable to natural granules a long colonization phase and a strict control of dissolved oxygen at 0 1 mg o2 l is crucial as the combination of high oxygen diffusion and low initial cell concentration in hydrogel beads lead to nitratation by nob and oxygen inhibition of anammox the higher diffusivity of hydrogels may be beneficial to obtain high ammonia conversions if compared to natural biofilms at low do which may result in a more efficient do utilization and hence reduced aeration demand hydrogel beads can be used to treat ammonium depleted wastewater while flat hydrogels represent an advance in biological treatments with tangential flow flow cell devices have the potential to be used to study the physiology of a variety of
