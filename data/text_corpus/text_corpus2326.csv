11630,the world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health pollution and ecosystem damage maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long term demographic transition would achieve sustainability this study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system najjembe town water supply scheme uganda results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0 01 to 2 36 m s the pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario and pipes never run full flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity 0 6 m s the negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand the proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure tpip and velocity tpiv to 89 9 99 3 and 80 9 99 5 respectively the implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals sdgs interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation sdg 6 supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger sdg 2 promoting good human health and well being sdg 3 promoting gender equality sdg 5 and economic growth sdg 8 defining the linkage between water supply management planning and sdgs would assist in the long term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost efficient manner addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy makers in the sector in making well informed decisions graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydraulic modeling performance evaluation sustainable development water demand water management plan water supply network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply networks are significant infrastructures for providing essential water supply services to communities accordingly the worldwide level of investment in water supply schemes is noticeably high almheiri et al 2021 engineered water supply schemes in developing countries face various functional and structural changes over their lifespan resulting from development pressures therefore future changes in socioeconomic developments the capacity of hydraulic infrastructure population climatic conditions urbanization industrialization agricultural practices and water pollution from domestic and industrial sources are key drivers for the system s performance over time rihendyh et al 2020 almheiri et al 2021 due to hydraulic systems complexity central governments cities municipalities and town councils require sustainable approaches for upgrading and operating existing water supply schemes to guarantee a sufficient service level at all times zischg et al 2017 in uganda most water supply infrastructures are managed and operated by a national parastatal body of the national water and sewerage corporation nwsc mwe 2017 the corporation is a fully government owned body established under the nwsc statute 1995 to provide water and sewerage services murungi and blokland 2016 the body currently has 258 towns of which najjembe town is part najjembe town has recently experienced momentous growth in buildings land developments markets and residential and commercial buildings these development are projected to increase steadily ubos 2020 the najjembe town water supply system was constructed in 2014 to serve about 10 503 people however the water network currently supplies water to a population of 4900 out of the target population this leaves no assurance of the reliability and efficiency of the existing water supply system to continuously meet the present and future water demand the high population of 10 503 people and the annual growth rate of 3 8 in najjembe town will automatically cause an upsurge in daily cleaning and drinking water requirements ubos 2020 modeling and predicting the system s performance is largely necessitated due to expected population growth the annexation of areas urbanization and industrialization agudelo vera et al 2014 modeling water distribution networks have been central to overcoming the hydraulic challenges seyoum and tanyimboh 2017 for instance it s applied in detecting leakages in the network monitoring and evaluating water quality assessing the system s capacity to meet future demands due to new developments in the supply area and annexing new areas with water distribution services herve et al 2014 sardinha lourenço et al 2018 vasant et al 2021 the epanet hydraulic model developed by rossman 2000 is a vital modeling tool for gaining insight into the real time status of the water distribution system by consideration of the present condition and also forecasting the future performance of the supply network based on an ideal condition moreover uncertainties in the distribution systems can be addressed by the epanet model with the automatic creation of stochastic future network structures for various loading scenarios le quiniou et al 2014 zischg et al 2017 predicting the future performance of a distribution network smoothens planning activities and scheduling maintenance sessions to ensure the long term service of the system agudelo vera et al 2014 achieving precise predictions regarding the performance of water supply systems can immensely improve efficiency and foster sustainable development the concept of sustainability in terms of sustainable development goals sdgs has recently been interlinked with water and wastewater management delanka pedige et al 2020 the sustainable development goals sdgs of agenda 2030 of the united nations un are comprised of seventeen goals and their corresponding targets 169 https sdgs un org goals specifically targets 6 1 6 2 and 6 4 of sdg 6 are addressed to achieve access to adequate water and sustainable withdrawal of freshwater to address water scarcity challenges and eventually reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity united nations 2015 the sdgs focus on promoting social dignity and prosperity while protecting the environment from pollution and the planet from deprivation between 2016 and 2030 investments associated with fulfilling sdgs for water and wastewater management were estimated at us 46 and us 25 billion for urban and rural areas respectively delanka pedige et al 2020 however low income countries struggle to achieve the above water supply related targets for most sdgs especially those related to sdg 6 attributed to financial constraints thus within this context the evaluation and prediction of the drinking water supply network through modeling are fundamental for effective decision making and investment in the sector however the linkage between water supply systems modeling outputs and related sdgs for effective support and financing of the developed management plans has not yet been revealed in the literature this is the first study demonstrating the linkage between the modeling outputs of water distribution networks and sdgs in particular the objectives of this study are fourfold 1 to model the drinking water supply network using epanet software under different demand loading scenarios 2 to evaluate the performance of the water supply system in its present state based on the global technical performance indicators 3 to predict the performance of the water supply system after a long term transition based on the global technical performance indexes and 4 to determine the interactions between the implementation of the management plan for drinking water supply systems and achievable sdgs 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the study area is located in the central part of uganda in lugazi municipality buikwe district this area was nominated for this study due to its high annual population growth attributed to the boom in economic activities especially the najjembe market the town has a population of 10 503 people with an annual growth rate of about 3 8 ubos 2020 topographically the town is approximately 1265m above sea level at 36n 501089 10 me 43426 61 mn see supplementary fig s1 the current water demand supply population and total connections on the system are 598 m3 day 4900 people and 205 connections respectively 2 2 data collection and description the secondary data for the water distribution system in its present state were obtained through initial design details from responsible institutions the water supply system comprises two boreholes i e bh1 dwd and bh2 dwd borehole bh1 has a safe yield of 2 5 m3 h and 9 m3 h for borehole bh2 giving a total safe yield of 11 5 m3 h twin reservoir circular tank with a storage capacity of about 60 m3 and diameter of 4 6 m the height of each tank is 3 543 m located at a base elevation of 1295 676 m above datum the pipe network has a total length of 3 6 km transmission line and a 14 0 km distribution network the transmission line comprises hdpe pipes of pressure rating pn16 whereas the distribution line comprises hdpe pipes of pn16 and pn10 the pipe sizes of dn 90 75 63 and 40 were used in the distribution network the water distribution network of this present study is of a branched type the pipelines installed throughout the pipe network are high density polyethylene hdpe totaling 11 2 km the nominal diameters for the already existing pipelines are 40 63 75 and 90 mm there are currently 18 valves i e 8 pressure reducing valves prv and 14 control valves the 90 dn mm pipe is fed by the 60 m3 capacity twin reservoir under gravity via dn 110 mm gi pipes after the water is sent out to the dn 63 mm pipelines through a reducer fitting to reach the far served points topographical data for the future annexed areas were estimated using google earth following the previously reported procedure ragade et al 2018 briefly the spatially bound network model of the predicted status was created using arcview gis software by manipulating the polyline theme the network model was developed following the road pattern of the case study area the developed network was then imported from arcview gis into the epanet nodal elevations were obtained from generated topographical profiles see supplementary table s1 2 3 water demand forecasting for modeling of systems future scenarios the input nodal demand data were based on the input data of the current scenario projected using eq 1 mekonnen 2018 the future nodal daily water demand was determined using eq 2 1 p n p o 1 g r n 2 d f p 2035 p c d f u t u r e where p n is the projected population after the nth year from the base year p o is the population in the base year g r is the average annual population growth rate 3 8 n are the years between p o and p n d f is the predicted nodal demand p 2035 is the predicted population served by that node and p c d f u t u r e is the future per capita demand for medium income households mwe 2017 2 4 framework for hydraulic modeling of the water supply network some rural water utilities with the competence of maintaining and updating real time models have used hydraulic imitation models in conjunction with gis permitting them to perform criticality studies with higher precision goovaerts 2017 this can be cost effective as it provides decision support in operating and maintaining their systems hydraulic modeling tools are capable of imitating the behavior of a real time system they have the aptitude to forecast the performance of the same system for future what if scenarios seyoum and tanyimboh 2017 computer simulations are usually cheaper and safer than conducting experiments with a final product prototype simulations can often be performed faster than in real time goovaerts 2017 this allows using them for efficient alternative analyses particularly when the required information to set the simulation can be easily obtained from the operational data the hydraulic modeling tool used in pipe network analysis was epanet software this program was selected for the following reasons a epanet is a window based public domain model that can be freely copied and distributed and b it offers different ways of modeling the network the user can physically draw the network if the drawings and the dimensions are available similarly the user can import data files from autocad steps followed in executing the simulation of the hydraulic network were 1 drawing the pipe network or importing a text file describing the network 2 editing the objects properties of the network system 3 definition of the operation parameters of the system 4 choosing a set of analysis options 5 running a hydraulic water quality analysis and 6 analysis and interpretation of results rossman 2000 epanet iteratively calculates the nodal heads and pipe flows by instantaneously solving each node s mass conservation equation and energy loss equation for each pipe in the network the program uses a gradient algorithm to calculate the nodal heads by iteratively resolving a linearized set of equations till a specific convergence criterion that may be user defined is fulfilled rossman 2000 the flow chart in fig 1 summarizes the executed logical steps the developed model was then calibrated by the adjustment of i roughness coefficient values ii demand at specified nodes and iii minor loss coefficients for the considered valves in the system agudelo vera et al 2014 in the first instance the baseline analysis was performed in the program to determine the current system behavior based on available system topographical and demographic data obtained after the water demand prediction was conducted following a methodology described by authorities mwe 2013 then the future scenarios for 2035 were simulated following the previously reported procedure by agudelo vera et al 2014 2 5 evaluating the performance of the water supply scheme the performance evaluation of the water network in terms of hydraulic components behavior nodes and pipes was established using the technical performance indexes tpi as reported elsewhere muranho et al 2014 zischg et al 2017 the global technical performance indexes tpip and tpiv for pressure and velocity respectively the tpis range between 0 poor performance and 100 efficient performance muranho et al 2014 the tpis for the velocity and pressure state variables were computed using weighted averages which consider the weights for the respective pipes proportional to their conveyance water volume and nodes concerning their loads demand the global technical performance index for pressure tpip was computed by eq 3 desta and befkadu 2020 this index was determined following criteria adopted by muranho et al 2014 and zischg et al 2017 thus the nodal pressures heads were selected as p min 10 and p max 100 m which characterize adequate pressure states as stipulated by the water supply schemes design standards mwe 2013 3 t p i p i 1 n c q i t p i i i 1 n c q i where nc is the number of system nodes q i defines the nodal demand and t p i i is represented by eq 4 garcía ávila et al 2019 4 t p i i 0

in abrasion and consequently lead to head loss i e vmin 0 6 vmax 2 m s mwe 2013 while considering this design criterion tpiv was determined by eq 5 muranho et al 2014 5 t p i v i 1 n p q i t p i i i 1

project purpose as defined by the study area s demographic characteristics topological characteristics and water demand behavior the following restriction was considered in epanet mwe 2013 1 mass conservation in each water network node 2 energy conservation in the network pipelines 3 compliance with maximum and minimum operating pressures and 4 compliance with maximum and minimum operating system flow velocities due to large sized tanks and low safe yield by one of the wells 2 5 m3 h filling these tanks takes a long time besides these tanks needed to remain quarter filled to maintain the necessary pressures since both tanks were on the same ground elevation with the same inlet and outlet pipes they had the same rule based controls set as 1 if the tank water level is above 2 943 m then pump pmp 1 status is closed 2 if the tank water level is above 2 943 m then pump pmp 2 status is closed 3 if tank water level below 0 74 m then pump pmp 1 status is open 4 if tank water level below 0 74 m then pump pmp 2 status is open 3 results and discussion 3 1 water demand pattern and peak hour factors the water scheme continuously experiences varying demands daily weekly and monthly fig 2 illustrates a typical diurnal curve of daily water use and peak hour factors for najjembe town it was observed that the town s maximum demand took place between 7 and 11 a m morning hours and 7 9 p m night hours the lowest consumption was from midnight to 6 a m early morning hours it is worth noting that the difference between consumption at night was almost half of the daily average water consumption in the town these results are related to those reported in the case studies of nagpur india gupta and kulat 2018 surabaya city indonesia rihendyh et al 2020 detroit usa goovaerts 2017 and andean city usa garcía ávila et al 2019 3 2 model exploration fig 3 shows the simulated water network in epanet software for steady state analysis of the network four 04 water demand loading scenarios were well thought out and assigned to the nodes specifically 1 average hourly demand ahd 2 daily peak demand dpd 3 hourly peak demand hpd and 4 daily peak demand dpd fire flow ff the peak hour factor of 1 5 was considered for computing the peak hour demand m3 day the per capita water demand l c d was considered 35 l d for towns with 5000 20 000 persons mwe 2013 a fire flow of 8 l s was added to the maximum day demand mdd of node j 1 to cater for firefighting with these considerations catered for the spatial distribution of predicted water demand at each node in the water distribution network is shown in fig 4 3 2 1 system flow velocity investigating the flow velocity in the developed hydraulic model enables us to establish whether there are sections of the network whose diameter is oversized teichmann et al 2020 fig 5 a shows flow velocities for the simulations conducted during ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff the town s velocity range under steady state flow conditions was 0 01 2 36 m s the evaluation of the hydraulic model depicts that pipeline velocities are generally unfavorable in the farthest sections of the distribution network and the pipes never run full because of high demand exceeding water supply in the predicted future state the simulation results indicated that velocities in some areas are less than mwe s recommended minimum velocity 0 6 m s at the start of the network the highest velocities are present the pipeline velocities at the twin reservoir outlet ranged between 0 50 and 1 0 m s besides the pipeline velocity tends to decrease in the farthest parts of the twin reservoir tank moreover the high pipeline velocities were established at the start of the network at the twin tank with velocities ranging between 0 82 and 2 36 m s besides velocities in the system network s farthest regions tend to drop below 0 01 m s therefore it can be inferred from the flow velocity analysis of the developed hydraulic model that under the predicted state of the system there are low velocities in the distribution network due to excessive demand in the upstream areas of the town near the reservoir tank even during the peak demand periods the flow velocities did not satisfy the recommended minimum velocity value of 0 6 m s the supply system s low velocities in the yet to be annexed areas indicate that the supply system will not meet the required flows by 2035 as projected by this present study although it has been previously reported that low velocities are due to oversized pipes barton et al 2019 for the case of the present system in its future state it was attributed to the excessive water demand in the upstream areas of the network restricting water flow at far points sediments accumulate at the bottom of the distribution pipes at low velocities especially over long distances posing a risk of bacterial proliferation moreover kara et al 2016 reported that low flow velocity in the water distribution system was responsible for the gradual decrease in the active diameter of the pipe due to the continuous deposition of particles therefore during the annexation of new areas by the system operators the flow velocity should be within the recommended range 0 6 2 m s by the authorities mwe 2013 flow velocities in the distribution systems have been reported to range from 0 3 to 2 5 m s depending on the pipeline diameter barton et al 2019 for self cleaning purposes a flow velocity of 1 5 m s has been recommended to transport sediments in the distribution pipeline 3 2 2 nodal pressure variation the simulation results of pressure variation within the distribution network model are shown in fig 5 b evidently the pressure was strongly connected to the area topography i e the nodes in low land areas were subjected to larger pressures than those relatively located in high level topographical areas based on the water supply design standards the maximum pressure at consumer service connections should be 60 m while the residual pressure should not be 10 m mwe 2013 previous studies reported optimal pressure in the water distribution network between 10 and 75 m kara et al 2016 for the case of the present study the future performance of the system under steady state analysis showed the minimum pressure within the distribution network as 15 38 m during ahd 2 09 m during dpd 15 75 m during hpd and 23 97 m during dpd ff while the maximum pressure within the distribution network as 80 47 m during ahd 76 32 m during dpd 72 74 m during hpd and 54 45 m during dpd ff it can be observed that the negative pressure occurred at junction node j 15 during the dpd simulation junction nodes j 11 j 12 j 13 j 14 j 15 during hpd simulations and junction nodes j 10 j 11 j 12 j 13 j 14 j 15 during dpd ff simulation the minimal pressures are experienced in far areas of kitoola kafutanu and bati camp the minimum residual pressure in these areas is attributed to their height above the reservoir tank thus they could not be supplied by gravity moreover garcía ávila et al 2019 reported that it was impossible for places located at a higher height above sea level than the reservoir tank to be supplied by the gravity system however excessive pressure was observed at j 3 j 7 and j 17 under the ahd scenario j 3 j 7 j 16 and j 17 for the dpd scenario and j 3 j 7 and j 17 for the hpd scenario at the observed nodes with pressure above 60 m a phenomenon of pipe rapture could occur under different studied scenarios barton et al 2019 teichmann et al 2020 thus it is recommended to install pressure reducing valves in such areas if they are to be annexed in the future by the water authorities therefore it is recommended that the water authority develop a maintenance and annexation plan for the system while considering the four demand scenarios to ensure its sustainability 3 3 performance of the water supply system to assess the performance of the water supply network both in its present and future state pressure and velocity values obtained by the epanet program were integrated into eq 3 and eq 5 respectively fig 6 shows the technological performance indexes for pressure and velocity in the distribution network both in the present and future associated with demand growth and the annexation of new supply areas the tpip and tpiv values variation for the four scenarios considered under the predicted state are depicted in fig 6 a tpip values of 18 66 16 46 14 10 and 11 49 of pressure for simulated scenarios of ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff were obtained respectively the tpiv values were 5 94 8 54 14 25 and 19 43 for ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively although it has been previously reported by zischg et al 2017 that low tpiv values are due to oversized pipes in the water distribution system the low tpiv for the future state of this present study could be directly attributed to relatively low flow in the network compared to the demand the water distribution network was highly efficient in its predicted state after the addition of three boreholes with an average yield of 5 75 m3 h in the model producing tpip values of 99 25 96 45 94 34 and 89 85 under ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively fig 6 b however in the simulation of the model with four fire hydrants installed across the dn 75 mm pipeline 2 along nsakya a and the other 2 along nsakya b pipeline the respective value of the tpip for the considered scenarios reduced by 15 41 25 63 the simulation of the model network in its present state with the installation of two prv on the dn 75 mm along p 2 and p 3 with two fire hydrants along each pipeline showed no significant change in the tpip values p 0 05 at 5 significance level these results therefore echo the requirement for the installation of prv to improve the tpip in case more fire hydrants are to be installed along p 2 and p 3 pipelines located in the major town centers moreover garcía ávila et al 2019 reported that installing the prv along water pipelines would improve the tpip by more than 17 concerning the system velocity the values obtained from epanet under the current state of the water distribution network were applied in eq 3 results disclosed that the performance of the water distribution network based on flow velocity produced tpiv values of 80 94 87 54 93 25 and 99 49 for the ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively fig 6 b on simulating with three additional pumps this indicated that the system performs efficiently in its present state without adding excessive load demand subjected to the nodes therefore it is recommended that a sustainable management plan for the supply system including the functional and structural changes in the infrastructure over time to attain sustainability 3 4 evaluation of the water scheme operation in terms of maximizing appropriate pressures in the predicted state of the water distribution network it was determined that the appropriate pressure be maximized to meet the demand requirements in the future diurnal analysis results from the network model under the predicted state showed that the hourly water demand exceeds what is produced this implied that the current supplied flow from the two system boreholes would be far less than the projected in 2035 hourly demand necessitating additional boreholes to supply the network presently the system operates with two underground boreholes i e bh1 and bh2 producing safe yields of 2 5 and 9 m3 h respectively the dual boreholes supply a safe yield of 11 5 m3 hr far less than the projected water demand this was projected to create a balance of supply of 14 361 m3 h by 2035 based on the objective function for maximization of adequate pressures and flow in the network it is suggested that three additional boreholes with an average yield of 5 75 m3 h if the current system is to meet the future demand and also allow the annexation of new areas currently not being served the aforementioned recommendations would tackle the entire complexity of network transition over time due to demographic changes once the management and extension plans are successfully developed further studies should be conducted on redesigning and rehabilitating the existing water supply network considering model outputs several sustainable development goals sdgs related to implementing the water supply management plan could be achieved the related sdgs are presented in the succeeding section of this paper 3 5 sustainable water supply management plan the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted by world leaders in 2015 comprises 17 sdgs associated with 169 targets and 232 indicators united nations 2015 the three fundamental but interconnected pillars of sustainable development i e economic environmental and social dimensions are acknowledged by experts and multi stakeholders globally browne 2015 based on the performance evaluation and final flow balance requirement results a substantial part of the study area would be exposed to water scarcity by 2035 if the water authority undertakes no extension or system modification plans in other areas the responsible authorities have established water supply management and extension plans to meet and maintain sdg 6 un water 2018 water scarcity has been attributed to anthropogenic human practices or and natural factors previous studies conducted on sdgs reported that there are linkages with sustainable water supply management which could be classified as reinforcing in support of water supply management enabling that facilitates water supply management constraining counteracting and conflicting negatively impact drinking water supply management bhaduri et al 2016 taka et al 2021 drinking water supply and extension management plans should be adopted through sustainable strategies to abate possible water scarcity challenges in the study area or worldwide for instance zischg et al 2017 and rihendyh et al 2020 introduced appropriate sustainable drinking water supply management plans to lessen the negative consequences associated with pipe network failure low yields inadequate storage low velocities and low pressures in the distribution network which would consequently result into water scarcity although these drinking water supply management plans were conceptualized mainly to sdg 6 of clean water and sanitation the present study disclosed that proper management of water supply systems could be linked with several economic environmental and social related sustainable development goals of the un agenda 2030 previously these linkages were classified as direct indirect and dependent diep et al 2021 implementing the developed drinking water management plans by authorities would achieve several sdgs in developed and low developing countries table 1 shows relevant achieved sdgs while fig 7 depicts the percentage target contribution per goal corresponding to this study the sdg targets related to goal 6 showed direct linkages to developing and implementing a sustainable management plan for drinking water hydraulic systems via several practices for instance properly managing water supply systems promotes sustainable water withdrawal from underground and surface water sources to address the possible challenges of limited water resources this addresses target 6 4 ensure sustainable water withdraws moreover low water tariffs charges could be applied in the highly vulnerable zones to ensure access to potable water for everyone in the community meeting target 6 1 equitable access to water the objectives of the developed hydraulic model obtained in the present study could be broadened to simulate and optimize water quality and pumping discharges for groundwater under different stress scenarios stress events which may include a shortage in subsurface recharge uncontrolled water withdrawal from boreholes or insufficient rainfall should be adequately monitored meeting target 6 6 protect groundwater aquifers accordingly it is recommended that stringent laws that govern the practices of drilling private underground wells in the study area particularly in the low aquifer zones be developed and implemented the previously mentioned targets and the sustainable supply of drinking water in the study area could be strengthened through various activities such as 1 the application of strict laws towards deforestation to ensure adequate recharge of underground aquifers 2 sensitization of water consumers on the potential effects of wastage 3 drill additional boreholes to cater for the projected increase in population in the area 4 adopt timely wastewater treatment and recycling technique as an artificial source for the recharge of aquifers and 5 promote the installation of rainwater harvesting systems among residents the execution of these actions would protect groundwater sources and the possible yield reduction the reliable water supply in the area would support intensive agricultural practices by applying modern irrigation systems such as subsurface drip and sprinkler techniques on agricultural lands obura et al 2022 furthermore fully functioning water supply schemes regularly supply water to poultry and animal farms adequate water supply via irrigation would promote more crop yield production without intensifying or expanding cultivated land this guarantees agricultural sustainability and the possibility of abating food insecurity achieving target 2 1 end hunger and target 2 3 increase agricultural productivity in the same context sustainable water supply facilitates the growth of income generating activities that use water as raw material directly relating to targets 1 1 eradication of extreme poverty and 1 2 reduction in the proportion of people living under poverty particularly for people in poor communities the provision of employment to majorly the youth would meet sdg targets 8 5 and 8 6 creation of employment opportunities the improved water security would ensure its reliable supply to industries as a raw material for enhancing productivity sdg target 8 4 accordingly this would synergize sdg targets 8 5 and 8 6 moreover time and money saved from walking long distances to collect water can be used for other productive uses due to the adequate and reliable supply of the water schemes furthermore implementing such actions would combat desertification through appropriate irrigation practices achieving target 15 3 combat desertification and restoration of degraded land soil the recommended strategies of targets 6 1 and 6 4 could maximize humans good health and well being and positively contribute to sdgs for instance secure and reliable water supply benefited livelihoods and decreased the socioeconomic status of the diarrheal burden as observed in countries like india bangladesh uganda kenya and ethiopia un water 2018 adequate water availability for household uses can impact the water consumed and the available time to care for children the reduction of long distances required to collect water is related to the lesser occurrence of diarrhea better nutrition and decreases in child mortality consequently improving children s health hutton and chase 2016 these actions meet target 3 9 reduce the number of water related deaths and illnesses moreover an adequate water supply promotes sustainable food production which directly reduces child deaths a nutritious diet directly links to a reduction in the spread of non communicable diseases the good health of young children would enable them to attend school meeting target 4 2 and 4 7 access to education improved water supply would provide people with increased convenience safety dignity comfort and status the aforementioned benefits have been reported among the most significant attributes of reliable water supply and could apply to women reliable water supply to households would provide greater well being to household members especially young girls and women traditionally responsible for fetching water fisher 2006 un water 2018 long distances to water sources might increase the time women would have spent carrying out income generating activities in this context reliable piped water supply in the communities directly relates to improved gender equality achieving sdg target 5 5 promote gender equality implementing the water supply plan would reinforce the loop for designing and constructing resilient infrastructures in the economy meeting sdg target 9 1 develop quality reliable sustainable and resilient infrastructure moreover reliable piped water is connected to increased usage safety and comfort life in towns and cities achieving sdg target 11 1 adequate safe and affordable basic services the sustainability of drinking water schemes is directly influenced by community participation reliability of the hydraulic infrastructure and technical planning fig 8 a logical framework based on this relationship could be applied to assess the sustainability of water supply systems in any low developing country with or without major modification masduqi et al 2010 the considered sustainability approaches would be beneficial to planners decision makers in the water supply sector local authorities and officials responsible for drinking water schemes in implementing water supply extension related projects accordingly it is highly suggested that sdgs and their related targets be considered during the planning stages for future activities concerning the extension or upgrade of the water supply network and its performance management furthermore it is suggested that groundwater recharge and the extent of water quality variations within the distribution network should be estimated because both water quantity and quality are crucial for establishing appropriate management strategies rihendyh et al 2020 implementing the aforementioned recommendations in future studies would support attaining other sdg targets 3 6 supporting the implementation process of sdgs the complexity of implementing sdgs especially goal 6 arises from majorly inadequate budgets and dysfunctional water governance challenges in the low developing countries lack of institutional capacity contributes to the poor performance of water governance in most developing countries un water 2018 therefore implementing a water supply development plan should support institutional capacity building to achieve sdgs the water governance strategy should embrace transparency efficiency and effectiveness participatory equitable and inclusive accountability and respect for the country s laws fostering good water governance and institutional capacity requires the engagement of different stakeholders of the water supply network and the formulation of incentives that would promote harmonized regulations and policies gumeta gómez et al 2021 moreover it is significant to recognize that implementing a water supply management plan is a community development process that requires political will and public acceptance browne 2015 therefore the aforementioned key issues must be addressed at all planning stages for implementing a sustainable water supply management plan 3 7 financing the development and implementation of the water supply management plan most developing countries struggle to implement targets set for most sdgs especially those related to sdg 6 water and sanitation due to financial limitations un water 2018 the annual investments for meeting sdgs related to water and wastewater have previously been valued at 25 billion us dollars for rural areas and 46 billion us dollars for urban areas from 2016 to 2030 delanka pedige et al 2020 successfully implementing water supply management plans requires innovative and holistic approaches for financing the designed projects that would turn present plans into hydrological and hydraulic infrastructures for achieving sustainable development goals projects implemented through external aid have been reported to be less sustainable yet consumer paid ways of financing such as taxes bonds and tariffs can be more feasible options un water 2018 before choosing the financing plan addressing the evaluation and accounting for the planned projects is vital in applying different paths to achieve sdgs related to water supply management it is suggested that financing models generating a unique set of incentives that could be attractive for the different relevant stakeholders of the water supply system be studied in future studies this could endorse further investments in the existing water supply schemes to meet future demand requirements 4 conclusion this study revealed that the performance of the water supply scheme is currently hydraulically sound but will not have the potential to serve the whole town by 2035 the yield from the current two existing wells 11 5 m3 h is far less than the projected water demand of 25 86 m3 h thus there is a need for an additional yield 14 m3 h to supplement the current supply overall improvements on the hydraulic infrastructures and other appurtenances could be carried out following this study on a basis considering the town s growth in the future after analyzing the simulation results we suggest drilling extra wells to supplement the two existing boreholes before 2035 an additional storage reservoir with a capacity of 190 m3 should be constructed to meet the required storage capacity of the system water quality must be incorporated into the modeling and simulation of the water system to develop a holistic management plan improving the desertification system s performance in alignment with future requirements would assist in promoting attributes required for meeting the water supply related sdgs the obtained model outputs would promote better management practices for the water distribution networks which reveal direct indirect linkages with sdgs that are relevant to water security poverty eradication zero hunger economic growth sustainable cities and communities good health and well being and conservation of life on land the proposed model approach could be upgraded by incorporating water quality performance for the system to ensure effective and robust future management plans authors contributions dd methodology

11630,the world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health pollution and ecosystem damage maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long term demographic transition would achieve sustainability this study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system najjembe town water supply scheme uganda results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0 01 to 2 36 m s the pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario and pipes never run full flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity 0 6 m s the negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand the proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure tpip and velocity tpiv to 89 9 99 3 and 80 9 99 5 respectively the implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals sdgs interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation sdg 6 supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger sdg 2 promoting good human health and well being sdg 3 promoting gender equality sdg 5 and economic growth sdg 8 defining the linkage between water supply management planning and sdgs would assist in the long term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost efficient manner addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers

plan water supply network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply networks are significant infrastructures for providing essential water supply services to communities accordingly the worldwide level of investment in water supply schemes is noticeably high almheiri et al 2021 engineered water supply schemes in developing countries face various functional and structural changes over their lifespan resulting from development pressures therefore future changes in socioeconomic developments the capacity of hydraulic infrastructure population climatic conditions urbanization industrialization agricultural practices and water pollution from domestic and industrial sources are key drivers for the system s performance over time rihendyh et al 2020 almheiri et al 2021 due to hydraulic systems complexity central governments cities municipalities and town councils require sustainable approaches for upgrading and operating existing water supply schemes to guarantee a sufficient service level at all times zischg et al 2017 in uganda most water supply infrastructures are managed and operated by a national parastatal body of the national water and sewerage corporation nwsc mwe 2017 the corporation is a fully government owned body established under the nwsc statute 1995 to provide water and sewerage services murungi and blokland 2016 the body currently has 258 towns of which najjembe town is part najjembe town has recently experienced momentous growth in buildings land developments markets and residential and commercial buildings these development are projected to increase steadily ubos 2020 the najjembe town water supply system was constructed in 2014 to serve about 10 503 people however the water network currently supplies water to a population of 4900 out of the target population this leaves no assurance of the reliability and efficiency of the existing water supply system to continuously meet the present and future water demand the high population of 10 503 people and the annual growth rate of 3 8 in najjembe town will automatically cause an upsurge in daily cleaning and drinking water requirements ubos 2020 modeling and predicting the system s performance is largely necessitated due to expected population growth the annexation of areas urbanization and industrialization agudelo vera et al 2014 modeling water distribution networks have been central to overcoming the hydraulic challenges seyoum and tanyimboh 2017 for instance it s applied in detecting leakages in the network monitoring and evaluating water quality assessing the system s capacity to meet future demands due to new developments in the supply area and annexing new areas with water distribution services herve et al 2014 sardinha lourenço et al 2018 vasant et al 2021 the epanet hydraulic model developed by rossman 2000 is a vital modeling tool for gaining insight into the real time status of the water distribution system by consideration of the present condition and also forecasting the future performance of the supply network based on an ideal condition moreover uncertainties in the distribution systems can be addressed by the epanet model with the automatic creation of stochastic future network structures for various loading scenarios le quiniou et al 2014 zischg et al 2017 predicting the future performance of a distribution network smoothens planning activities and scheduling maintenance sessions to ensure the long term service of the system agudelo vera et al 2014 achieving precise predictions regarding the performance of water supply systems can immensely improve efficiency and foster sustainable development the concept of sustainability in terms of sustainable development goals sdgs has recently been interlinked with water and wastewater management delanka pedige et al 2020 the sustainable development goals sdgs of agenda 2030 of the united nations un are comprised of seventeen goals and their corresponding targets 169 https sdgs un org goals specifically targets 6 1 6 2 and 6 4 of sdg 6 are addressed to achieve access to adequate water and sustainable withdrawal of freshwater to address water scarcity challenges and eventually reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity united nations 2015 the sdgs focus on promoting social dignity and prosperity while protecting the environment from pollution and the planet from deprivation between 2016 and 2030 investments associated with fulfilling sdgs for water and wastewater management were estimated at us 46 and us 25 billion for urban and rural areas respectively delanka pedige et al 2020 however low income countries struggle to achieve the above water supply related targets for most sdgs especially those related to sdg 6 attributed to financial constraints thus within this context the evaluation and prediction of the drinking water supply network through modeling are fundamental for effective decision making and investment in the sector however the linkage between water supply systems modeling outputs and related sdgs for effective support and financing of the developed management plans has not yet been revealed in the literature this is the first study demonstrating the linkage between the modeling outputs of water distribution networks and sdgs in particular the objectives of this study are fourfold 1 to model the drinking water supply network using epanet software under different demand loading scenarios 2 to evaluate the performance of the water supply system in its present state based on the global technical performance indicators 3 to predict the performance of the water supply system after a long term transition based on the global technical performance indexes and 4 to determine the interactions between the implementation of the management plan for drinking water supply systems and achievable sdgs 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the study area is located in the central part of uganda in lugazi municipality buikwe district this area was nominated for this study due to its high annual population growth attributed to the boom in economic activities especially the najjembe market the town has a population of 10 503 people with an annual growth rate of about 3 8 ubos 2020 topographically the town is approximately 1265m above sea level at 36n 501089 10 me 43426 61 mn see supplementary fig s1 the current water demand supply population and total connections on the system are 598 m3 day 4900 people and 205 connections respectively 2 2 data collection and description the secondary data for the water distribution system in its present state were obtained through initial design details from responsible institutions the water supply system comprises two boreholes i e bh1 dwd and bh2 dwd borehole bh1 has a safe yield of 2 5 m3 h and 9 m3 h for borehole bh2 giving a total safe yield of 11 5 m3 h twin reservoir circular tank with a storage capacity of about 60 m3 and diameter of 4 6 m the height of each tank is 3 543 m located at a base elevation of 1295 676 m above datum the pipe network has a total length of 3 6 km transmission line and a 14 0 km distribution network the transmission line comprises hdpe pipes of pressure rating pn16 whereas the distribution line comprises hdpe pipes of pn16 and pn10 the pipe sizes of dn 90 75 63 and 40 were used in the distribution network the water distribution network of this present study is of a branched type the pipelines installed throughout the pipe network are high density polyethylene hdpe totaling 11 2 km the nominal diameters for the already existing pipelines are 40 63 75 and 90 mm there are currently 18 valves i e 8 pressure reducing valves prv and 14 control valves the 90 dn mm pipe is fed by the 60 m3 capacity twin reservoir under gravity via dn 110 mm gi pipes after the water is sent out to the dn 63 mm pipelines through a reducer fitting to reach the far served points topographical data for the future annexed areas were estimated using google earth following the previously reported procedure ragade et al 2018 briefly the spatially bound network model of the predicted status was created using arcview gis software by manipulating the polyline theme the network model was developed following the road pattern of the case study area the developed network was then imported from arcview gis into the epanet nodal elevations were obtained from generated topographical profiles see supplementary table s1 2 3 water demand forecasting for modeling of systems future scenarios the input nodal demand data were based on the input data of the current scenario projected using eq 1 mekonnen 2018 the future nodal daily water demand was determined using eq 2 1 p n p o 1 g r n 2 d f p 2035 p c d f u t u r e where p n is the projected population after the nth year from the base year p o is the population in the base year g r is the average annual population

medium income households mwe 2017 2 4 framework for hydraulic modeling of the water supply network some rural water utilities with the competence of maintaining and updating real time models have used hydraulic imitation models in conjunction with gis permitting them to perform criticality studies with higher precision goovaerts 2017 this can be cost effective as it provides decision support in operating and maintaining their systems hydraulic modeling tools are capable of imitating the behavior of a real time system they have the aptitude to forecast the performance of the same system for future what if scenarios seyoum and tanyimboh 2017 computer simulations are usually cheaper and safer than conducting experiments with a final product prototype simulations can often be performed faster than in real time goovaerts 2017 this allows using them for efficient alternative analyses particularly when the required information to set the simulation can be easily obtained from the operational data the hydraulic modeling tool used in pipe network analysis was epanet software this program was selected for the following reasons a epanet is a window based public domain model that can be freely copied and distributed and b it offers different ways of modeling the network the user can physically draw the network if the drawings and the dimensions are available similarly the user can import data files from autocad steps followed in executing the simulation of the hydraulic network were 1 drawing the pipe network or importing a text file describing the network 2 editing the objects properties of the network system 3 definition of the operation parameters of the system 4 choosing a set of analysis options 5 running a hydraulic water quality analysis and 6 analysis and interpretation of results rossman 2000 epanet iteratively calculates the nodal heads and pipe flows by instantaneously solving each node s mass conservation equation and energy loss equation for each pipe in the network the program uses a gradient algorithm to calculate the nodal heads by iteratively resolving a linearized set of equations till a specific convergence criterion that may be user defined is fulfilled rossman 2000 the flow chart in fig 1 summarizes the executed logical steps the developed model was then calibrated by the adjustment of i roughness coefficient values ii demand at specified nodes and iii minor loss coefficients for the considered valves in the system agudelo vera et al 2014 in the first instance the baseline analysis was performed in the program to determine the current system behavior based on available system topographical and demographic data obtained after the water demand prediction was conducted following a methodology described by authorities mwe 2013 then the future scenarios for 2035 were simulated following the previously reported procedure by agudelo vera et al 2014 2 5 evaluating the performance of the water supply scheme the performance evaluation of the water network in terms of hydraulic components behavior nodes and pipes was established using the technical performance indexes tpi as reported elsewhere muranho et al 2014 zischg et al 2017 the global technical performance indexes tpip and tpiv for pressure and velocity respectively the tpis range between 0 poor performance and 100 efficient performance muranho et al 2014 the tpis for the velocity and pressure state variables were computed using weighted averages which consider the weights for the respective pipes proportional to their conveyance water volume and nodes concerning their loads demand the global technical performance index for pressure tpip was computed by eq 3 desta and befkadu 2020 this index was determined following criteria adopted by muranho et al 2014 and zischg et al 2017 thus the nodal pressures heads were selected as p min 10 and p max 100 m which characterize adequate pressure states as stipulated by the water supply schemes design standards mwe 2013 3 t p i p i 1 n c q i t p i i i 1 n c q i where nc is the number of system nodes q i defines the nodal demand and t p i i is represented by eq 4 garcía ávila et al 2019 4 t p i i 0

project purpose as defined by the study area s demographic characteristics topological characteristics and water demand behavior the following restriction was considered in epanet mwe 2013 1 mass conservation in each water network node 2 energy conservation in the network pipelines 3 compliance with maximum and minimum operating pressures and 4 compliance with maximum and minimum operating system flow velocities due to large sized tanks and low safe yield by one of the wells 2 5 m3 h filling these tanks takes a long time besides these tanks needed to remain quarter filled to maintain the necessary pressures since both tanks were on the same ground elevation with the same inlet and outlet pipes they had the same rule based controls set as 1 if the tank water level is above 2 943 m then pump pmp 1 status is closed 2 if the tank water level is above 2 943 m then pump pmp 2 status is closed 3 if tank water level below 0 74 m then pump pmp 1 status is open 4 if tank water level below 0 74 m then pump pmp 2 status is open 3 results and discussion 3 1 water demand pattern and peak hour factors the water scheme continuously experiences varying demands daily weekly and monthly fig 2 illustrates a typical diurnal curve of daily water use and peak hour factors for najjembe town it was observed that the town s maximum demand took place between 7 and 11 a m morning hours and 7 9 p m night hours the lowest consumption was from midnight to 6 a m early morning hours it is worth noting that the difference between consumption at night was almost half of the daily average water consumption in the town these results are related to those reported in the case studies of nagpur india gupta and kulat 2018 surabaya city indonesia rihendyh et al 2020 detroit usa goovaerts 2017 and andean city usa garcía ávila et al 2019 3 2 model exploration fig 3 shows the simulated water network in epanet software for steady state analysis of the network four 04 water demand loading scenarios were well thought out and assigned to the nodes specifically 1 average hourly demand ahd 2 daily peak demand dpd 3 hourly peak demand hpd and 4 daily peak demand dpd fire flow ff the peak hour factor of 1 5 was considered for computing the peak hour demand m3 day the per capita water demand l c d was considered 35 l d for towns with 5000 20 000 persons mwe 2013 a fire flow of 8 l s was added to the maximum day demand mdd of node j 1 to cater for firefighting with these considerations catered for the spatial distribution of predicted water demand at each node in the water distribution network is shown in fig 4 3 2 1 system flow velocity investigating the flow velocity in the developed hydraulic model enables us to establish whether there are sections of the network whose diameter is oversized teichmann et al 2020 fig 5 a shows flow velocities for the simulations conducted during ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff the town s velocity range under steady state flow conditions was 0 01 2 36 m s the evaluation of the hydraulic model depicts that pipeline velocities are generally unfavorable in the farthest sections of the distribution network and the pipes never run full because of high demand exceeding water supply in the predicted future state the simulation results indicated that velocities in some areas are less than mwe s recommended minimum velocity 0 6 m s at the start of the network the highest velocities are present the pipeline velocities at the twin reservoir outlet ranged between 0 50 and 1 0 m s besides the pipeline velocity tends to decrease in the farthest parts of the twin reservoir tank moreover the high pipeline velocities were established at the start of the network at the twin tank with velocities ranging between 0 82 and 2 36 m s besides velocities in the system network s farthest regions tend to drop below 0 01 m s therefore it can be inferred from the flow velocity analysis of the developed hydraulic model that under the predicted state of the system there are low velocities in the distribution network due to excessive demand in the upstream areas of the town near the reservoir tank even during the peak demand periods the flow velocities did not satisfy the recommended minimum velocity value of 0 6 m s the supply system s low velocities in the yet to be annexed areas indicate that the supply system will not meet the required flows by 2035 as projected by this present study although it has been previously reported that low velocities are due to oversized pipes barton et al 2019 for the case of the present system in its future state it was attributed to the excessive water demand in the upstream areas of the network restricting water flow at far points sediments accumulate at the bottom of the distribution pipes at low velocities especially over long distances posing a risk of bacterial proliferation moreover kara et al 2016 reported that low flow velocity in the water distribution system was responsible for the gradual decrease in the active diameter of the pipe due to the continuous deposition of particles therefore during the annexation of new areas by the system operators the flow velocity should be within the recommended range 0 6 2 m s by the authorities mwe 2013 flow velocities in the distribution systems have been reported to range from 0 3 to 2 5 m s depending on the pipeline diameter barton et al 2019 for self cleaning purposes a flow velocity of 1 5 m s has been recommended to transport sediments in the distribution pipeline 3 2 2 nodal pressure variation the simulation results of pressure variation within the distribution network model are shown in fig 5 b evidently the pressure was strongly connected to the area topography i e the nodes in low land areas were subjected to larger pressures than those relatively located in high level topographical areas based on the water supply design standards the maximum pressure at consumer service connections should be 60 m while the residual pressure should not be 10 m mwe 2013 previous studies reported optimal pressure in the water distribution network between 10 and 75 m kara et al 2016 for the case of the present study the future performance of the system under steady state analysis showed the minimum pressure within the distribution network as 15 38 m during ahd 2 09 m during dpd 15 75 m during hpd and 23 97 m during dpd ff while the maximum pressure within the distribution network as 80 47 m during ahd 76 32 m during dpd 72 74 m during hpd and 54 45 m during dpd ff it can be observed that the negative pressure occurred at junction node j 15 during the dpd simulation junction nodes j 11 j 12 j 13 j 14 j 15 during hpd simulations and junction nodes j 10 j 11 j 12 j 13 j 14 j 15 during dpd ff simulation the minimal pressures are experienced in far areas of kitoola kafutanu and bati camp the minimum residual pressure in these areas is attributed to their height above the reservoir tank thus they could not be supplied by gravity moreover garcía ávila et al 2019 reported that it was impossible for places located at a higher height above sea level than the reservoir tank to be supplied by the gravity system however excessive pressure was observed at j 3 j 7 and j 17 under the ahd scenario j 3 j 7 j 16 and j 17 for the dpd scenario and j 3 j 7 and j 17 for the hpd scenario at the observed nodes with pressure above 60 m a phenomenon of pipe rapture could occur under different studied scenarios barton et al 2019 teichmann et al 2020 thus it is recommended to install pressure reducing valves in such areas if they are to be annexed in the future by the water authorities therefore it is recommended that the water authority develop a maintenance and annexation plan for the system while considering the four demand scenarios to ensure its sustainability 3 3 performance of the water supply system to assess the performance of the water supply network both in its present and future state pressure and velocity values obtained by the epanet program were integrated into eq 3 and eq 5 respectively fig 6 shows the technological performance indexes for pressure and velocity in the distribution network both in the present and future associated with demand growth and the annexation of new supply areas the tpip and tpiv values variation for the four scenarios considered under the predicted state are depicted in fig 6 a tpip values of 18 66 16 46 14 10 and 11 49 of pressure for simulated scenarios of ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff were obtained respectively the tpiv values were 5 94 8 54 14 25 and 19 43 for ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively although it has been previously reported by zischg et al 2017 that low tpiv values are due to oversized pipes in the water distribution system the low tpiv for the future state of this present study could be directly attributed to relatively low flow in the network compared to the demand the water distribution network was highly efficient in its predicted state after the addition of three boreholes with an average yield of 5 75 m3 h in the model producing tpip values of 99 25 96 45 94 34 and 89 85 under ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively fig 6 b however in the simulation of the model with four fire hydrants installed across the dn 75 mm pipeline 2 along nsakya a and the other 2 along nsakya b pipeline the respective value of the tpip for the considered scenarios reduced by 15 41 25 63 the simulation of the model network in its present state with the installation of two prv on the dn 75 mm along p 2 and p 3 with two fire hydrants along each pipeline showed no significant change in the tpip values p 0 05 at 5 significance level these results therefore echo the requirement for the installation of prv to improve the tpip in case more fire hydrants are to be installed along p 2 and p 3 pipelines located in the major town centers moreover garcía ávila et al 2019 reported that installing the prv along water pipelines would improve the tpip by more than 17 concerning the system velocity the values obtained from epanet under the current state of the water distribution network were applied in eq 3 results disclosed that the performance of the water distribution network based on flow velocity produced tpiv values of 80 94 87 54 93 25 and 99 49 for the ahd dpd hpd and dpd ff scenarios respectively fig 6 b on simulating with three additional pumps this indicated that the system performs efficiently in its present state without adding excessive load demand subjected to the nodes therefore it is recommended that a sustainable management plan for the supply system including the functional and structural changes in the infrastructure over time to attain sustainability 3 4 evaluation of the water scheme operation in terms of maximizing appropriate pressures in the predicted state of the water distribution network it was determined that the appropriate pressure be maximized to meet the demand requirements in the future diurnal analysis results from the network model under the predicted state showed that the hourly water demand exceeds what is produced this implied that the current supplied flow from the two system boreholes would be far less than the projected in 2035 hourly demand necessitating additional boreholes to supply the network presently the system operates with two underground boreholes i e bh1 and bh2 producing safe yields of 2 5 and 9 m3 h respectively the dual boreholes supply a safe yield of 11 5 m3 hr far less than the projected water demand this was projected to create a balance of supply of 14 361 m3 h by 2035 based on the objective function for maximization of adequate pressures and flow in the network it is suggested that three additional boreholes with an average yield of 5 75 m3 h if the current system is to meet the future demand and also allow the annexation of new areas currently not being served the aforementioned recommendations would tackle the entire complexity of network transition over time due to demographic changes once the management and extension plans are successfully developed further studies should be conducted on redesigning and rehabilitating the existing water supply network considering model outputs several sustainable development goals sdgs related to implementing the water supply management plan could be achieved the related sdgs are presented in the succeeding section of this paper 3 5 sustainable water supply management plan the 2030 agenda for sustainable development adopted by world leaders in 2015 comprises 17 sdgs associated with 169 targets and 232 indicators united nations 2015 the three fundamental but interconnected pillars of sustainable development i e economic environmental and social dimensions are acknowledged by experts and multi stakeholders globally browne 2015 based on the performance evaluation and final flow balance requirement results a substantial part of the study area would be exposed to water scarcity by 2035 if the water authority undertakes no extension or system modification plans in other areas the responsible authorities have established water supply management and extension plans to meet and maintain sdg 6 un water 2018 water scarcity has been attributed to anthropogenic human practices or and natural factors previous studies conducted on sdgs reported that there are linkages with sustainable water supply management which could be classified as reinforcing in support of water supply management enabling that facilitates water supply management constraining counteracting and conflicting negatively impact drinking water supply management bhaduri et al 2016 taka et al 2021 drinking water supply and extension management plans should be adopted through sustainable strategies to abate possible water scarcity challenges in the study area or worldwide for instance zischg et al 2017 and rihendyh et al 2020 introduced appropriate sustainable drinking water supply management plans to lessen the negative consequences associated with pipe network failure low yields inadequate storage low velocities and low pressures in the distribution network which would consequently result into water scarcity although these drinking water supply management plans were conceptualized mainly to sdg 6 of clean water and sanitation the present study disclosed that proper management of water supply systems could be linked with several economic environmental and social related sustainable development goals of the un agenda 2030 previously these linkages were classified as direct indirect and dependent diep et al 2021 implementing the developed drinking water management plans by authorities would achieve several sdgs in developed and low developing countries table 1 shows relevant achieved sdgs while fig 7 depicts the percentage target contribution per goal corresponding to this study the sdg targets related to goal 6 showed direct linkages to developing and implementing a sustainable management plan for drinking water hydraulic systems via several practices for instance properly managing water supply systems promotes sustainable water withdrawal from underground and surface water sources to address the possible challenges of limited water resources this addresses target 6 4 ensure sustainable water withdraws moreover low water tariffs charges could be applied in the highly vulnerable zones to ensure access to potable water for everyone in the community meeting target 6 1 equitable access to water the objectives of the developed hydraulic model obtained in the present study could be broadened to simulate and optimize water quality and pumping discharges for groundwater under different stress scenarios stress events which may include a shortage in subsurface recharge uncontrolled water withdrawal from boreholes or insufficient rainfall should be adequately monitored meeting target 6 6 protect groundwater aquifers accordingly it is recommended that stringent laws that govern the practices of drilling private underground wells in the study area particularly in the low aquifer zones be developed and implemented the previously mentioned targets and the sustainable supply of drinking water in the study area could be strengthened through various activities such as 1 the application of strict laws towards deforestation to ensure adequate recharge of underground aquifers 2 sensitization of water consumers on the potential effects of wastage 3 drill additional boreholes to cater for the projected increase in population in the area 4 adopt timely wastewater treatment and recycling technique as an artificial source for the recharge of aquifers and 5 promote the installation of rainwater harvesting systems among residents the execution of these actions would protect groundwater sources and the possible yield reduction the reliable water supply in the area would support intensive agricultural practices by applying modern irrigation systems such as subsurface drip and sprinkler techniques on agricultural lands obura et al 2022 furthermore fully functioning water supply schemes regularly supply water to poultry and animal farms adequate water supply via irrigation would promote more crop yield production without intensifying or expanding cultivated land this guarantees agricultural sustainability and the possibility of abating food insecurity achieving target 2 1 end hunger and target 2 3 increase agricultural productivity in the same context sustainable water supply facilitates the growth of income generating activities that use water as raw material directly relating to targets 1 1 eradication of extreme poverty and 1 2 reduction in the proportion of people living under poverty particularly for people in poor communities the provision of employment to majorly the youth would meet sdg targets 8 5 and 8 6 creation of employment opportunities the improved water security would ensure its reliable supply to industries as a raw material for enhancing productivity sdg target 8 4 accordingly this would synergize sdg targets 8 5 and 8 6 moreover time and money saved from walking long distances to collect water can be used for other productive uses due to the adequate and reliable supply of the water schemes furthermore implementing such actions would combat desertification through appropriate irrigation practices achieving target 15 3 combat desertification and restoration of degraded land soil the recommended strategies of targets 6 1 and 6 4 could maximize humans good health and well being and positively contribute to sdgs for instance secure and reliable water supply benefited livelihoods and decreased the socioeconomic status of the diarrheal burden as observed in countries like india bangladesh uganda kenya and ethiopia un water 2018 adequate water availability for household uses can impact the water consumed and the available time to care for children the reduction of long distances required to collect water is related to the lesser occurrence of diarrhea better nutrition and decreases in child mortality consequently improving children s health hutton and chase 2016 these actions meet target 3 9 reduce the number of water related deaths and illnesses moreover an adequate water supply promotes sustainable food production which directly reduces child deaths a nutritious diet directly links to a reduction in the spread of non communicable diseases the good health of young children would enable them to attend school meeting target 4 2 and 4 7 access to education improved water supply would provide people with increased convenience safety dignity comfort and status the aforementioned benefits have been reported among the most significant attributes of reliable water supply and could apply to women reliable water supply to households would provide greater well being to household members especially young girls and women traditionally responsible for fetching water fisher 2006 un water 2018 long distances to water sources might increase the time women would have spent carrying out income generating activities in this context reliable piped water supply in the communities directly relates to improved gender equality achieving sdg target 5 5 promote gender equality implementing the water supply plan would reinforce the loop for designing and constructing resilient infrastructures in the economy meeting sdg target 9 1 develop quality reliable sustainable and resilient infrastructure moreover reliable piped water is connected to increased usage safety and comfort life in towns and cities achieving sdg target 11 1 adequate safe and affordable basic services the sustainability of drinking water schemes is directly influenced by community participation reliability of the hydraulic infrastructure and technical planning fig 8 a logical framework based on this relationship could be applied to assess the sustainability of water supply systems in any low developing country with or without major modification masduqi et al 2010 the considered sustainability approaches would be beneficial to planners decision makers in the water supply sector local authorities and officials responsible for drinking water schemes in implementing water supply extension related projects accordingly it is highly suggested that sdgs and their related targets be considered during the planning stages for future activities concerning the extension or upgrade of the water supply network and its performance management furthermore it is suggested that groundwater recharge and the extent of water quality variations within the distribution network should be estimated because both water quantity and quality are crucial for establishing appropriate management strategies rihendyh et al 2020 implementing the aforementioned recommendations in future studies would support attaining other sdg targets 3 6 supporting the implementation process of sdgs the complexity of implementing sdgs especially goal 6 arises from majorly inadequate budgets and dysfunctional water governance challenges in the low developing countries lack of institutional capacity contributes to the poor performance of water governance in most developing countries un water 2018 therefore implementing a water supply development plan should support institutional capacity building to achieve sdgs the water governance strategy should embrace transparency efficiency and effectiveness participatory equitable and inclusive accountability and respect for the country s laws fostering good water governance and institutional capacity requires the engagement of different stakeholders of the water supply network and the formulation of incentives that would promote harmonized regulations and policies gumeta gómez et al 2021 moreover it is significant to recognize that implementing a water supply management plan is a community development process that requires political will and public acceptance browne 2015 therefore the aforementioned key issues must be addressed at all planning stages for implementing a sustainable water supply management plan 3 7 financing the development and implementation of the water supply management plan most developing countries struggle to implement targets set for most sdgs especially those related to sdg 6 water and sanitation due to financial limitations un water 2018 the annual investments for meeting sdgs related to water and wastewater have previously been valued at 25 billion us dollars for rural areas and 46 billion us dollars for urban areas from 2016 to 2030 delanka pedige et al 2020 successfully implementing water supply management plans requires innovative and holistic approaches for financing the designed projects that would turn present plans into hydrological and hydraulic infrastructures for achieving sustainable development goals projects implemented through external aid have been reported to be less sustainable yet consumer paid ways of financing such as taxes bonds and tariffs can be more feasible options un water 2018 before choosing the financing plan addressing the evaluation and accounting for the planned projects is vital in applying different paths to achieve sdgs related to water supply management it is suggested that financing models generating a unique set of incentives that could be attractive for the different relevant stakeholders of the water supply system be studied in future studies this could endorse further investments in the existing water supply schemes to meet future demand requirements 4 conclusion this study revealed that the performance of the water supply scheme is currently hydraulically sound but will not have the potential to serve the whole town by 2035 the yield from the current two existing wells 11 5 m3 h is far less than the projected water demand of 25 86 m3 h thus there is a need for an additional yield 14 m3 h to supplement the current supply overall improvements on the hydraulic infrastructures and other appurtenances could be carried out following this study on a basis considering the town s growth in the future after analyzing the simulation results we suggest drilling extra wells to supplement the two existing boreholes before 2035 an additional storage reservoir with a capacity of 190 m3 should be constructed to meet the required storage capacity of the system water quality must be incorporated into the modeling and simulation of the water system to develop a holistic management plan improving the desertification system s performance in alignment with future requirements would assist in promoting attributes required for meeting the water supply related sdgs the obtained model outputs would promote better management practices for the water distribution networks which reveal direct indirect linkages with sdgs that are relevant to water security poverty eradication zero hunger economic growth sustainable cities and communities good health and well being and conservation of life on land the proposed model approach could be upgraded by incorporating water quality performance for the system to ensure effective and robust future management plans authors contributions dd methodology

from ground and surface water al othman et al 2012 human cannot get harmful diseases only by consuming contaminated water but also by plants that have been irrigated with contaminated water and also by freshwater organisms due to their contaminated environment which is mostly because of chemical pollution lohse et al 2009 saleh 2022 the water bodies which are mostly chemically contaminated are highly rich in nutrients that are responsible for toxic algal blooms oxygen depletion and primary production of biomass rind et al 2023 ali et al 2022 the sources of water pollution include domestic sewage agricultural wastes acid rain global warming and industrial wastewater water pollution is increasing to an alarming condition because of industrialization and urbanization pollutants like heavy metal ions and synthetic dyes are resultant of these activities the effluent coming from industries enter into water bodies and affect water quality the complex organic chemicals industry iron industries food processing industry steel industries mining and processing chemicals nuclear industry pulp and paper industry discharge an amount of wastewater which then directly contributes to water pollution as a significant pollutant generated from industrial processes soil and water system mostly get deteriorated due to the discharge of industrial waste or effluent into them this mostly takes place with the fast development of various industries gruber and galloway 2008 water pollution can make the water unable for using and thus a shortage of water take place water pollution hurts human

uses as a result they are often found in the environment due to which they can be toxic and carcinogenic the organisms van der oost et al 2003 synthetic dyes are organic molecules that easily color wastewater and are also considered to be recalcitrant and these are widely utilized in petroleum products textile and paper industries renge et al 2012 most synthetic dyes are recalcitrant organic molecules that strongly color wastewater commercially 105 types of dyes are available and annually seven lakh tons of dyes are produced about 10 25 of dyes leach during use and around 2 20 of dyes

water in the laboratories of analytical chemistry mo is known as an acid base indicator ph value of the dye solution is around 6 5 5 0 g l h2o at 20 c and can act as weak acid azo dyes are cancer causing substances mo can easily enter the human body by ingestion in which microorganisms of the intestine metabolize the aromatic amines abdominal cancer is caused by the aromatic amines that are produced by the reductive cleavage of the azo linkage by the reductive enzymes chung et al 1992 mo is dangerous to life and its removal from water sources is compulsory yan et al 2010 dyes are destructive to organisms and need to be removed from wastewater eradication of dyes from water is challenging because of aromatic structure and anthropogenic source and in addition they are biologically non degradable the dyes need to be eliminated from industrial effluent before releasing in water sources the most effective method for dye removal so far is known to be adsorption with different adsorbents there is diverse interaction between dyes and adsorbents and this is due to variations in dye structure and their chemistries robinson et al 2001 type number molecular structure and substituent are the main features that influence dye adsorption nigam et al 2000 for water purification adsorption is considered as most effective method dąbrowski 2001 commercially existing activated carbon ac is capable to be used in the purification of different water sources and particularly industrial wastewater colored effluents the adsorption process results in high quality effluent without any harmful substances and adsorption is also capable to deal with large flow rates jain et al 2010 adsorption has huge pollution control and has significant applications in wastewater treatment alkenani and saleh 2022 saleh 2022 through adsorption inorganic and organic contaminants can be eradicated from water adsorption is a versatile process in the organic pollutants removal from water foo and hameed 2010 alazab and saleh 2022 nonetheless the adsorbents high cost is a challenge for industries to use in the adsorption process for wastewater treatment but synthesizing a low cost adsorbent can tackle this problem saleh 2021 alothman et al 2013 an agricultural waste product is an economically and environmentally best option to be used for water purification through adsorption due to its abundance and its chemistry agriculture wastes are rich contents of carbon and can be used for ac production because of their hard texture and low ash content ahmedna et al 2000 all these characteristics are favorable for the utilization of agro waste products as adsorbents bhatnagar and sillanpää 2010 agriculture waste products are composed of generally proteins lignin lipids and cellulose in adsorption polar functional groups play a key role that are ether alcohol aldehyde phenolic carboxylic and ketone are significant for adsorption through forming complexes functional groups participate in adsorption pagnanelli et al 2003 using agricultural wastes like almond shells pea shells and peanut shells waste as adsorbent is a simple technique and little processing is needed for it and it is easily available has low cost and results in good adsorption efficiency but untreated plant wastes result in low adsorption capacity and increase in cod level bod level and toc level because of the discharge of soluble organic compounds from plants gaballah et al 1997 nakajima and sakaguchi 1990 higher level of cod bod and toc can decrease the oxygen concentration of water which directly affect aquatic organisms hence it is important to modify plant wastes to use them as adsorbents it is important to modify adsorbents to enhance their functionalities of the adsorbent chemically and physically bhatnagar et al 2013 the modification of adsorbent surface acidity pore structure and functionality on their surface enhances because it increases the removal efficiency and adsorption selectivity during adsorption qiao et al 2005 surface modification of adsorbent involves acid treatment base treatment and metal metal oxide impregnation srivastava et al 2015 with the surface impregnation of adsorbent with metals or metal oxides the surface to volume ratio increases of the adsorbent modification of surface with metal and its oxides deposit onto the surface of adsorbent without occupying the pores as a result of metal and metal oxides the pore volume and adsorbent area of the surface also enhance hence the efficiency of the adsorbent increases zncl2 acharya et al 2009 oxychloride of zirconium biswas et al 2008 and oxides of magnesium saleh and gupta 2012 are known metal and metal oxides for surface impregnation srivastava et al 2015 for wastewater treatment acs are universal adsorbents bansal and goyal 2005 particular characteristics of ac influence the capacity for water purification for the eradication of dyes strelko and malik 2002 ac adsorption is less expensive has known as a low cost wastewater treatment technology ac possesses porous structures and a high surface area various contaminants can be eradicated by ac adsorption hameed 2009 because of the high adsorptive capacity of ac rao popuri et al 2007 researchers are concerned to use a low cost substituent for ac synthesis such as agriculture byproducts saleh 2020 agricultural wastes are a renewable cheap and economical precursor for ac synthesis the metal binding capacity of agricultural wastes makes them capable of adsorption hence agricultural wastes are used as a precursor for the production of ac ali et al 2016 an alternative to commercial activities is the center of research and agricultural wastes are the best alternative using agricultural wastes for ac synthesis can eliminate environmental damage as well ac can be reused and regenerated and still possess good adsorption capacity dong et al 2014 ac is used in many fields including the chemical industry environmental protection and the food industry wu et al 2019 in this study three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 were used for the adsorption of methyl orange mo from water for the first time the study involves a comprehensive investigation of the related parameters mechanism and model analysis 2 experimental section 2 1 adsorbent preparation for the synthesis of ac almond shells pea shells and peanut shells were used almond peanuts and peas were purchased from the local market of turbat and then they were peeled the shells obtained were then kept in shadow pea shells were kept for drying while almond shells and peanut shells were already dried pea shells were completely dried after 3 weeks after that all the shells of almond peanut and peas were washed thoroughly several times so that any dirt or dust could fade away from them after that they were again dried in shadow after drying they all were subjected to grinding to make a powder after getting the shells in powder form they were subjected to carbonization at first chemical activation of the samples was done by zncl2 solution samples were soaked in 1000 ml zncl2 solution for 24 h samples to zncl2 solution were soaked in a ratio of 1 1 5 after that they were filtered and the residue was kept in the oven for drying for an h after that samples were kept in the electrical furnace at 500 c for 2 h then the samples were cooled and washed with 0 5m hcl and distilled water many times the carbonized material was dried in the oven and kept in a desiccator for further impregnation the obtained samples were ac and they were named asac almond shell ac psac pea shell ac and pnsac peanut shell ac all three samples were then subjected to impregnation with alumina for alumina doping aluminum nitrate al2 no3 2 was used alumina doping on ac was done with three different ratios aluminum nitrate to the ac impregnation was with a ratio of 1 1 with samples psac asac and pnsac respectively first of all each sample of ac asac psac and pnsac was dispersed in ethanol and then sonicated for about 20 min al2 no3 2 was also dispersed in ethanol under sonicated for around 20 min sonication was done at room temperature when both the solutions ac ethanol and al2 no3 2 ethanol were sonicated they were mixed gradually and then sonicated for 20 min after that ethanol was evaporated from the mixture these samples were calcined at 350 c for 1 h the materials were then cooled and alumina doped ac thus obtained alumina doped ac of each sample was named asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 2 2 characterization of adsorbent the characterization of the materials was done using x ray diffraction xrd to analyze the crystalline structure of adsorbents and ft ir analysis was done for analyzing the surface functional groups 2 3 adsorption studies the methyl orange mo adsorption tests were performed at different parameters and the mo concentration was 60 ppm adsorption was studied at different times i e 10 60 min and the temperature range was set between 25 and 50 c a dose of adsorbent asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 was taken between 0 1 g and 0 5 g ph range was at 4 10 all the reactions with these parameters were carried out with the constant stirring rate on a magnetic stirrer at 140 rpm at each parameter at different intervals concentration was observed through uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis spectrophotometer uv752 d at 467 nm at first the mo adsorption was evaluated at various time intervals the time intervals at which the mo adsorption on alumina doped ac was observed were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min at each interval adsorption was examined by checking the concentration through uv vis spectrophotometer after that adsorption was examined at various solution ph which was altered with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl at 4 6 7 8 and 10 are the ph ranges at which adsorption was examined adsorption of mo onto alumina doped ac was evaluated at different temperatures and the temperature ranges at which adsorption was observed were 25 30 40 and 50 c whereas the effect of ac al2o3 doses of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 or 0 5 g was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization ftir technique was used to characterize the functional groups that are present on the surface of the adsorbent along with the porosity adsorptive capacity is affected by the surface chemical reactivity and functional groups at 1900 2000 cm 1 ccc stretching vibrations were observed and assigned to allene groups in the samples fig 1 a weak ncs stretching vibration attributed to isothiocyanate appeared in the range of 1990 2140 furthermore strong bands at 2100 2140 cm 1 for the cc stretching vibration reveals the presence of alkyne in the samples yadav 2005 a stretching vibration was at 629 cm 1 and 723 cm 1 ascribed to the c br stretching halo compound and c cl stretching halo compound the bands in the range above 400 to 800 cm 1 can be ascribed al o bond structures the significance of phase interactions inside the adsorbent is inevitable and the formation of more enhancing terminals species and restorability of alumina doped ac adsorbents therefore to study these phases x ray diffraction xrd profiles have been investigated and shown in fig 2 all the samples reveal amorphous characters revealing the typical ac pattern the ac phases intensity peaks at 2θ 25 5ο and 44ο for pnsac al2o3 adsorbent are higher compared to asac al2o3 and psac al2o3 adsorbents displaying the complete conversion of non ac to ac kalyani and anitha 2013 furthermore weak al2o3 peaks at 2θ 37 5ο 46 7ο and 68ο were observed attributed to gamma alumina and directly relate to the molar concentration of al2o3 lee et al 2013 srivastava et al 2015 3 2 variance investigation using anova anova analysis explains the accidental error of experiments and usually spreads using a constant variation the results are considered as significant if p value is 0 05 and it is considered not significant if p value is 0 05 mazen et al 2022 anova data table demonstrated that all variables such as ph the dose of adsorbents ultrasound time and reaction temperature and their values were below 0 05 which are important data on the model which is summarized in table 1 the table exposed the combined effects shown by all the variables 3 3 methyl orange adsorption experiments onto ac al2o3 mo was prepared by preparing the stock solution of 100 ppm mo solution in water the 10 ppm solution of mo was arranged from the stock solutions the λ max of mo is 467 nm and the absorbance of mo was examined by uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 467 nm the concentration of mo before and after the treatment with different adsorbents was analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer 3 3 1 contact time effect the contact time impact was investigated at various time intervals in this study the optimal time to reach equilibrium was analyzed which describes mo adsorption onto different ac al2o3 adsorbents it is carried out by introducing asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 adsorbents in mo dye solution 50 ml with pre concentration of 60 ppm at room temperature for different time intervals the obtained results indicate that with increasing contact time adsorption increases fig 3 at first active sites are available on the surface because of which dye adsorption was fast in the present study maximum removal of mo was observed by asac al2o3 up to 84 after 60 min of continuous stirring at 140 rpm responsible for 55 40 mg g of mo adsorption capacity as compared to asac al2o3 adsorbent pnsac al2o3 and psac al2o3 achieved 82 8 and 77 of adsorption capacity which is responsible for the 51 3 mg g and 46 mg g mo removal efficiency respectively 3 3 2 ph effect the ph effect on adsorption was determined by all three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 separately and shown in fig 4 to analyze the effect of ph 0 1g of each adsorbent ac al2o3 was introduced to 50 ml of series of mo dye solution at the ph ranges of 4 6 7 8 and 10 the solution ph changes the mode and intensity of adsorption to the adsorbent surface consequently the ph affects the properties of the adsorbent and dye chemistry arellano cárdenas et al 2013 mahdavinia et al 2013 the results display that adsorbent asac al2o3 achieves a high removal efficiency as compared to the other two adsorbents high removal efficiency for all adsorbents was observed at ph 7 asac al2o3 showed the highest 85 adsorption removal efficiency responsible for the 56 mg g mo adsorption as compared to asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 achieved 81 and 77 mo removal capacity accountable for the 52 and 45 mg g adsorption efficiency respectively thus the removal of mo increased from ph 4 to ph 7 and decrease from ph 7 to ph 10 3 3 3 temperature effect temperature effect on adsorption is known to be complex and average effects are analyzed by adsorbate adsorbent interactions singh and srivastava 1999 the temperature effect on adsorption resulted in bond formation as a result of chemisorption between adsorbent and adsorbate but at the same time physisorption is not negligible on the site of adsorption the area of the surface is known to be heterogeneous not uniform and not specific in many adsorbents tran et al 1999 ravi et al 1998 in the present analysis of determining the temperature effect on mo dye adsorption experiments have been evaluated at various temperatures 25 30 40 and 50 c with introducing 0 1 g of each alumina doped ac ac al2o3 in 50 ml of 60 ppm mo solution and shown in fig 5 minimum removal of mo dye was 85 onto the surface of asac al2o3 adsorbent at 40 c as compared to psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 adsorbents achieved respectively 75 9 and 62 adsorption removal capacities the increased of adsorbed mass increase with temperature which can be due to intermolecular forces between water molecules water molecules are adsorbed at the portion of the interface of the adsorbent which results in the adsorbent surface being more active this leads to the diffusion of molecules of dyes towards the adsorbent surface hence adsorption increases with an increase in temperature asfour et al 1985 physical adsorption leads to stronger intermolecular forces at low temperatures and increased adsorption at low temperatures agglomeration of dye molecules takes place doğan and alkan 2003 yildiz and çalimli 2002 the agglomeration state can increase the adsorption efficiency of dyes 3 3 4 effect of adsorbent dosage dye removal efficiencies of different adsorbents were investigated for various dosages from 0 1 to 0 5 g with a dye concentration of 60 ppm temperature 40 c and ph was kept constant at 7 the dye removal efficiency was summarized in fig 6 amongst these adsorbents asac al2o3 shows a high adsorption efficiency compared to the other two catalysts adsorption enhanced with increasing adsorbent dose a little reduction in removal can be attributed to the desorption phenomenon of ac al2o3 adsorbent the increase in the adsorbent dose from 0 1 g to 0 5 g increased the mo dye elimination which is due to the increased surface area of the adsorbent and thus more available sites for adsorption with an increase in the adsorbent amount garg et al 2003 asac al2o3 shows the highest adsorption efficiency of 85 compared to psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 revealing compromising adsorption removal capacities up to 77 and 62 4 respectively 3 4 screening design residual curves indicated the variation between expected responses along with experimental response which is considered to be generally and independently distributed with continuous difference reveals as zero santos nobre and da motta singer 2007 fig 7 b demonstrates point drops nearby to the standard known to be irrelevant fig 7 represented the fitted values vs standardized residuals curves also according to the obtained graph residuals are distributed about the reference line at random where most of the points are very close to the line which is known as a substantial result the histogram fig 7 b displayed rectangular bars that are dispersed in the range of 2 to 2 with zero values randomly and the negative and positive values it is equally distributed fig 7 b explains the residual distribution of the standard line at random but most of the values fall away from the line that is considered significant effects the pareto chart explains the significant and insignificant effect of variables as the pareto chart emphasizes the effect and chemistry of interactions in the variables as shown in fig 7 a when the variables cross the standard reference line the effect is considered to be important while the variables not crossing the reference line are called to be insignificant and the analysis shows no effects salgado et al 2020 the pareto chart explained the variables d c and b cross the considered reference line and these variables presented substantial effects other variables such as a does not cross the 2 13 reference line and the effect is known as unimportant 3 5 methyl orange adsorptive mechanism on asac al2o3 adsorbent the mo adsorptive removal mechanism was investigated by the formation of a heterojunction between dye and ac al2o3 adsorbent fig 8 the adsorptive mechanism of mo molecules on gamma alumina doped ac was observed as nonphysical but rather due to a chemical interaction between the ac al2o3 adsorbent surface and mo which follow three major steps 1 synthesis of ac from waste shells and doped gamma alumina 2 in the ph 7 the h was released from the ac which undergoes chemical ion exchange reaction with the terminal dimethyl nitrogen and produces positive charge on methylene orange 3 through different charge transfer reaction on the methylene blue and alumina doped ac catalyzes the adsorption process the positive charge on the dye s terminal nitrogen is significantly reactive toward the negatively charged ac al2o3 surface 3 6 comparison with literature mo adsorptive study on ac al2o3 adsorbent was also compared with those adsorbents reported in the literature table 2 ac al2o3 adsorbent shows 86 adsorptive removal efficiency corresponding to 56 5 mg g adsorption capacity in 60mins on alumina doped ac synthesized from organic municipal waste the adsorbent efficacy of the ac al2o3 adsorbent is enhanced by the h which is released from the ac and undergoes a chemical ion exchange reaction with the terminal dimethyl nitrogen and produces a positive charge on methylene orange these different charge transfer reactions on the methylene blue and alumina doped ac catalyze the adsorption process 4 conclusion the quality of water can be enhanced by treating it with particular adsorbents like activated carbon impregnated with alumina metal and metal oxide impregnation can increase the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents in this study three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 were applied to analyze the methyl orange adsorption the removal efficiency of all three adsorbents was analyzed at different parameters adsorption of alumina impregnated was analyzed at various contact time 10 60 min ph 4 10 at temperatures 25 30 40 and 50 c and by using different amount of adsorbent 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g the maximum adsorption was shown by asac al2o3 which was 86 3 at ph 7 temperature 40 c and by applying 0 4 g of adsorbent adsorbent asac al2o3 was added to a methyl orange solution of 60 ppm and from that asac al2o3 removed 57 63 mg g of dye solution as compared to the asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 achieved compromised adsorption removal of 80 6 and 62 responsible for 54 5 and 46 mg g adsorption removal capacity respectively asac al2o3 shows more adsorption efficiency than

by freshwater organisms due to their contaminated environment which is mostly because of chemical pollution lohse et al 2009 saleh 2022 the water bodies which are mostly chemically contaminated are highly rich in nutrients that are responsible for toxic algal blooms oxygen depletion and primary production of biomass rind et al 2023 ali et al 2022 the sources of water pollution include domestic sewage agricultural wastes acid rain global warming and industrial wastewater water pollution is increasing to an alarming condition because of industrialization and urbanization pollutants like heavy metal ions and synthetic dyes are resultant of these activities the effluent coming from industries enter into water bodies and affect water quality the complex organic chemicals industry iron industries food processing industry steel industries mining and processing chemicals nuclear industry pulp and paper industry discharge an amount of wastewater which then directly contributes to water pollution as a significant pollutant generated from industrial processes soil and water system mostly get deteriorated due to the discharge of industrial waste or effluent into them this mostly takes place with the fast development of various industries gruber and galloway 2008 water pollution can make the water unable for using and thus a shortage of water take place water pollution hurts human health 884 million people face scarcity of safe water wastewater contains pollutants like organic compounds cationic and anionic ions and oil and which produce toxic and toxic effects on the

wastewater and are also considered to be recalcitrant and these are widely utilized in petroleum products textile and paper industries renge et al 2012 most synthetic dyes are recalcitrant organic molecules that strongly color wastewater commercially 105 types of dyes are available and annually seven lakh tons of dyes are produced about 10 25 of dyes leach during use and around 2 20 of dyes

water in the laboratories of analytical chemistry mo is known as an acid base indicator ph value of the dye solution is around 6 5 5 0 g l h2o at 20 c and can act as weak acid azo dyes are cancer causing substances mo can easily enter the human body by ingestion in which microorganisms of the intestine metabolize the aromatic amines abdominal cancer is caused by the aromatic amines that are produced by the reductive cleavage of the azo linkage by the reductive enzymes chung et al 1992 mo is dangerous to life and its removal from water sources is compulsory yan et al 2010 dyes are destructive to organisms and need to be removed from wastewater eradication of dyes from water is challenging because of aromatic structure and anthropogenic source and in addition they are biologically non degradable the dyes need to be eliminated from industrial effluent before releasing in water sources the most effective method for dye removal so far is known to be adsorption with different adsorbents there is diverse interaction between dyes and adsorbents and this is due to variations in dye structure and their chemistries robinson et al 2001 type number molecular structure and substituent are the main features that influence dye adsorption nigam et al 2000 for water purification adsorption is considered as most effective method dąbrowski 2001 commercially existing activated carbon ac is capable to be used in the purification of different water sources and particularly industrial wastewater colored effluents the adsorption process results in high quality effluent without any harmful substances and adsorption is also capable to deal with large flow rates jain et al 2010 adsorption has huge pollution control and has significant applications in wastewater treatment alkenani and saleh 2022 saleh 2022 through adsorption inorganic and organic contaminants can be eradicated from water adsorption is a versatile process in the organic pollutants removal from water foo and hameed 2010 alazab and saleh 2022 nonetheless the adsorbents high cost is a challenge for industries to use in the adsorption process for wastewater treatment but synthesizing a low cost adsorbent can tackle this problem saleh 2021 alothman et al 2013 an agricultural waste product is an economically and environmentally best option to be used for water purification through adsorption due to its abundance and its chemistry agriculture wastes are rich contents of carbon and can be used for ac production because of their hard texture and low ash content ahmedna et al 2000 all these characteristics are favorable for the utilization of agro waste products as adsorbents bhatnagar and sillanpää 2010 agriculture waste products are composed of generally proteins lignin lipids and cellulose in adsorption polar functional groups play a key role that are ether alcohol aldehyde phenolic carboxylic and ketone are significant for adsorption through forming complexes functional groups participate in adsorption pagnanelli et al 2003 using agricultural wastes like almond shells pea shells and peanut shells waste as adsorbent is a simple technique and little processing is needed for it and it is easily available has low cost and results in good adsorption efficiency but untreated plant wastes result in low adsorption capacity and increase in cod level bod level and toc level because of the discharge of soluble organic compounds from plants gaballah et al 1997 nakajima and sakaguchi 1990 higher level of cod bod and toc can decrease the oxygen concentration of water which directly affect aquatic organisms hence it is important to modify plant wastes to use them as adsorbents it is important to modify adsorbents to enhance their functionalities of the adsorbent chemically and physically bhatnagar et al 2013 the modification of adsorbent surface acidity pore structure and functionality on their surface enhances because it increases the removal efficiency and adsorption selectivity during adsorption qiao et al 2005 surface modification of adsorbent involves acid treatment base treatment and metal metal oxide impregnation srivastava et al 2015 with the surface impregnation of adsorbent with metals or metal oxides the surface to volume ratio increases of the adsorbent modification of surface with metal and its oxides deposit onto the surface of adsorbent without occupying the pores as a result of metal and metal oxides the pore volume and adsorbent area of the surface also enhance hence the efficiency of the adsorbent increases zncl2 acharya et al 2009 oxychloride of zirconium biswas et al 2008 and oxides of magnesium saleh and gupta 2012 are known metal and metal oxides for surface impregnation srivastava et al 2015 for wastewater treatment acs are universal adsorbents bansal and goyal 2005 particular characteristics of ac influence the capacity for water purification for the eradication of dyes strelko and malik 2002 ac adsorption is less expensive has known as a low cost wastewater treatment technology ac possesses porous structures and a high surface area various contaminants can be eradicated by ac adsorption hameed 2009 because of the high adsorptive capacity of ac rao popuri et al 2007 researchers are concerned to use a low cost substituent for ac synthesis such as agriculture byproducts saleh 2020 agricultural wastes are a renewable cheap and economical precursor for ac synthesis the metal binding capacity of agricultural wastes makes them capable of adsorption hence agricultural wastes are used as a precursor for the production of ac ali et al 2016 an alternative to commercial activities is the center of research and agricultural wastes are the best alternative using agricultural wastes for ac synthesis can eliminate environmental damage as well ac can be reused and regenerated and still possess good adsorption capacity dong et al 2014 ac is used in many fields including the chemical industry environmental protection and the food industry wu et al 2019 in this study three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 were used for the adsorption of methyl orange mo from water for the first time the study involves a comprehensive investigation of the related parameters mechanism and model analysis 2 experimental section 2 1 adsorbent preparation for the synthesis of ac almond shells pea shells and peanut shells were used almond peanuts and peas were purchased from the local market of turbat and then they were peeled the shells obtained were then kept in shadow pea shells were kept for drying while almond shells and peanut shells were already dried pea shells were completely dried after 3 weeks after that all the shells of almond peanut and peas were washed thoroughly several times so that any dirt or dust could fade away from them after that they were again dried in shadow after drying they all were subjected to grinding to make a powder after getting the shells in powder form they were subjected to carbonization at first chemical activation of the samples was done by zncl2 solution samples were soaked in 1000 ml zncl2 solution for 24 h samples to zncl2 solution were soaked in a ratio of 1 1 5 after that they were filtered and the residue was kept in the oven for drying for an h after that samples were kept in the electrical furnace at 500 c for 2 h then the samples were cooled and washed with 0 5m hcl and distilled water many times the carbonized material was dried in the oven and kept in a desiccator for further impregnation the obtained samples were ac and they were named asac almond shell ac psac pea shell ac and pnsac peanut shell ac all three samples were then subjected to impregnation with alumina for alumina doping aluminum nitrate al2 no3 2 was used alumina doping on ac was done with three different ratios aluminum nitrate to the ac impregnation was with a ratio of 1 1 with samples psac asac and pnsac respectively first of all each sample of ac asac psac and pnsac was dispersed in ethanol and then sonicated for about 20 min al2 no3 2 was also dispersed in ethanol under sonicated for around 20 min sonication was done at room temperature when both the solutions ac ethanol and al2 no3 2 ethanol were sonicated they were mixed gradually and then sonicated for 20 min after that ethanol was evaporated from the mixture these samples were calcined at 350 c for 1 h the materials were then cooled and alumina doped ac thus obtained alumina doped ac of each sample was named asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 2 2 characterization of adsorbent the characterization of the materials was done using x ray diffraction xrd to analyze the crystalline structure of adsorbents and ft ir analysis was done for analyzing the surface functional groups 2 3 adsorption studies the methyl orange mo adsorption tests were performed at different parameters and the mo concentration was 60 ppm adsorption was studied at different times i e 10 60 min and the temperature range was set between 25 and 50 c a dose of adsorbent asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 was taken between 0 1 g and 0 5 g ph range was at 4 10 all the reactions with these parameters were carried out with the constant stirring rate on a magnetic stirrer at 140 rpm at each parameter at different intervals concentration was observed through uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis spectrophotometer uv752 d at 467 nm at first the mo adsorption was evaluated at various time intervals the time intervals at which the mo adsorption on alumina doped ac was observed were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min at each interval adsorption was examined by checking the concentration through uv vis spectrophotometer after that adsorption was examined at various solution ph which was altered with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl at 4 6 7 8 and 10 are the ph ranges at which adsorption was examined adsorption of mo onto alumina doped ac was evaluated at different temperatures and the temperature ranges at which adsorption was observed were 25 30 40 and 50 c whereas the effect of ac al2o3 doses of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 or 0 5 g was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization ftir technique was used to characterize the functional groups that are present on the surface of the adsorbent along with the porosity adsorptive capacity is affected by the surface chemical reactivity and functional groups at 1900 2000 cm 1 ccc stretching vibrations were observed and assigned to allene groups in the samples fig 1 a weak ncs stretching vibration attributed to isothiocyanate appeared in the range of 1990 2140 furthermore strong bands at 2100 2140 cm 1 for the cc stretching vibration reveals the presence of alkyne in the samples yadav 2005 a stretching vibration was at 629 cm 1 and 723 cm 1 ascribed to the c br stretching halo compound and c cl stretching halo compound the bands in the range above 400 to 800 cm 1 can be ascribed al o bond structures the significance of phase interactions inside the adsorbent is inevitable and the formation of more enhancing terminals species and restorability of alumina doped ac adsorbents therefore to study these phases x ray diffraction xrd profiles have been investigated and shown in fig 2 all the samples reveal amorphous characters revealing the typical ac pattern the ac phases intensity peaks at 2θ 25 5ο and 44ο for pnsac al2o3 adsorbent are higher compared to asac al2o3 and psac al2o3 adsorbents displaying the complete conversion of non ac to ac kalyani and anitha 2013 furthermore weak al2o3 peaks at 2θ 37 5ο 46 7ο and 68ο were observed attributed to gamma alumina and directly relate to the molar concentration of al2o3 lee et al 2013 srivastava et al 2015 3 2 variance investigation using anova anova analysis explains the accidental error of experiments and usually spreads using a constant variation the results are considered as significant if p value is 0 05 and it is considered not significant if p value is 0 05 mazen et al 2022 anova data table demonstrated that all variables such as ph the dose of adsorbents ultrasound time and reaction temperature and their values were below 0 05 which are important data on the model which is summarized in table 1 the table exposed the combined effects shown by all the variables 3 3 methyl orange adsorption experiments onto ac al2o3 mo was prepared by preparing the stock solution of 100 ppm mo solution in water the 10 ppm solution of mo was arranged from the stock solutions the λ max of mo is 467 nm and the absorbance of mo was examined by uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 467 nm the concentration of mo before and after the treatment with different adsorbents was analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer 3 3 1 contact time effect the contact time impact was investigated at various time intervals in this study the optimal time to reach equilibrium was analyzed which describes mo adsorption onto different ac al2o3 adsorbents it is carried out by introducing asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 adsorbents in mo dye solution 50 ml with pre concentration of 60 ppm at room temperature for different time intervals the obtained results indicate that with increasing contact time adsorption increases fig 3 at first active sites are available on the surface because of which dye adsorption was fast in the present study maximum removal of mo was observed by asac al2o3 up to 84 after 60 min of continuous stirring at 140 rpm responsible for 55 40 mg g of mo adsorption capacity as compared to asac al2o3 adsorbent pnsac al2o3 and psac al2o3 achieved 82 8 and 77 of adsorption capacity which is responsible for the 51 3 mg g and 46 mg g mo removal efficiency respectively 3 3 2 ph effect the ph effect on adsorption was determined by all three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 separately and shown in fig 4 to analyze the effect of ph 0 1g of each adsorbent ac al2o3 was introduced to 50 ml of series of mo dye solution at the ph ranges of 4 6 7 8 and 10 the solution ph changes the mode and intensity of adsorption to the adsorbent surface consequently the ph affects the properties of the adsorbent and dye chemistry arellano cárdenas et al 2013 mahdavinia et al 2013 the results display that adsorbent asac al2o3 achieves a high removal efficiency as compared to the other two adsorbents high removal efficiency for all adsorbents was observed at ph 7 asac al2o3 showed the highest 85 adsorption removal efficiency responsible for the 56 mg g mo adsorption as compared to asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 achieved 81 and 77 mo removal capacity accountable for the 52 and 45 mg g adsorption efficiency respectively thus the removal of mo increased from ph 4 to ph 7 and decrease from ph 7 to ph 10 3 3 3 temperature effect temperature effect on adsorption is known to be complex and average effects are analyzed by adsorbate adsorbent interactions singh and srivastava 1999 the temperature effect on adsorption resulted in bond formation as a result of chemisorption between adsorbent and adsorbate but at the same time physisorption is not negligible on the site of adsorption the area of the surface is known to be heterogeneous not uniform and not specific in many adsorbents tran et al 1999 ravi et al 1998 in the present analysis of determining the temperature effect on mo dye adsorption experiments have been evaluated at various temperatures 25 30 40 and 50 c with introducing 0 1 g of each alumina doped ac ac al2o3 in 50 ml of 60 ppm mo solution and shown in fig 5 minimum removal of mo dye was 85 onto the surface of asac al2o3 adsorbent at 40 c as compared to psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 adsorbents achieved respectively 75 9 and 62 adsorption removal capacities the increased of adsorbed mass increase with temperature which can be due to intermolecular forces between water molecules water molecules are adsorbed at the portion of the interface of the adsorbent which results in the adsorbent surface being more active this leads to the diffusion of molecules of dyes towards the adsorbent surface hence adsorption increases with an increase in temperature asfour et al 1985 physical adsorption leads to stronger intermolecular forces at low temperatures and increased adsorption at low temperatures agglomeration of dye molecules takes place doğan and alkan 2003 yildiz and çalimli 2002 the agglomeration state can increase the adsorption efficiency of dyes 3 3 4 effect of adsorbent dosage dye removal efficiencies of different adsorbents were investigated for various dosages from 0 1 to 0 5 g with a dye concentration of 60 ppm temperature 40 c and ph was kept constant at 7 the dye removal efficiency was summarized in fig 6 amongst these adsorbents asac al2o3 shows a high adsorption efficiency compared to the other two catalysts adsorption enhanced with increasing adsorbent dose a little reduction in removal can be attributed to the desorption phenomenon of ac al2o3 adsorbent the increase in the adsorbent dose from 0 1 g to 0 5 g increased the mo dye elimination which is due to the increased surface area of the adsorbent and thus more available sites for adsorption with an increase in the adsorbent amount garg et al 2003 asac al2o3 shows the highest adsorption efficiency of 85 compared to psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 revealing compromising adsorption removal capacities up to 77 and 62 4 respectively 3 4 screening design residual curves indicated the variation between expected responses along with experimental response which is considered to be generally and independently distributed with continuous difference reveals as zero santos nobre and da motta singer 2007 fig 7 b demonstrates point drops nearby to the standard known to be irrelevant fig 7 represented the fitted values vs standardized residuals curves also according to the obtained graph residuals are distributed about the reference line at random where most of the points are very close to the line which is known as a substantial result the histogram fig 7 b displayed rectangular bars that are dispersed in the range of 2 to 2 with zero values randomly and the negative and positive values it is equally distributed fig 7 b explains the residual distribution of the standard line at random but most of the values fall away from the line that is considered significant effects the pareto chart explains the significant and insignificant effect of variables as the pareto chart emphasizes the effect and chemistry of interactions in the variables as shown in fig 7 a when the variables cross the standard reference line the effect is considered to be important while the variables not crossing the reference line are called to be insignificant and the analysis shows no effects salgado et al 2020 the pareto chart explained the variables d c and b cross the considered reference line and these variables presented substantial effects other variables such as a does not cross the 2 13 reference line and the effect is known as unimportant 3 5 methyl orange adsorptive mechanism on asac al2o3 adsorbent the mo adsorptive removal mechanism was investigated by the formation of a heterojunction between dye and ac al2o3 adsorbent fig 8 the adsorptive mechanism of mo molecules on gamma alumina doped ac was observed as nonphysical but rather due to a chemical interaction between the ac al2o3 adsorbent surface and mo which follow three major steps 1 synthesis of ac from waste shells and doped gamma alumina 2 in the ph 7 the h was released from the ac which undergoes chemical ion exchange reaction with the terminal dimethyl nitrogen and produces positive charge on methylene orange 3 through different charge transfer reaction on the methylene blue and alumina doped ac catalyzes the adsorption process the positive charge on the dye s terminal nitrogen is significantly reactive toward the negatively charged ac al2o3 surface 3 6 comparison with literature mo adsorptive study on ac al2o3 adsorbent was also compared with those adsorbents reported in the literature table 2 ac al2o3 adsorbent shows 86 adsorptive removal efficiency corresponding to 56 5 mg g adsorption capacity in 60mins on alumina doped ac synthesized from organic municipal waste the adsorbent efficacy of the ac al2o3 adsorbent is enhanced by the h which is released from the ac and undergoes a chemical ion exchange reaction with the terminal dimethyl nitrogen and produces a positive charge on methylene orange these different charge transfer reactions on the methylene blue and alumina doped ac catalyze the adsorption process 4 conclusion the quality of water can be enhanced by treating it with particular adsorbents like activated carbon impregnated with alumina metal and metal oxide impregnation can increase the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents in this study three adsorbents asac al2o3 psac al2o3 pnsac al2o3 were applied to analyze the methyl orange adsorption the removal efficiency of all three adsorbents was analyzed at different parameters adsorption of alumina impregnated was analyzed at various contact time 10 60 min ph 4 10 at temperatures 25 30 40 and 50 c and by using different amount of adsorbent 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g the maximum adsorption was shown by asac al2o3 which was 86 3 at ph 7 temperature 40 c and by applying 0 4 g of adsorbent adsorbent asac al2o3 was added to a methyl orange solution of 60 ppm and from that asac al2o3 removed 57 63 mg g of dye solution as compared to the asac al2o3 psac al2o3 and pnsac al2o3 achieved compromised adsorption removal of 80 6 and 62 responsible for 54 5 and 46 mg g adsorption removal capacity respectively asac al2o3 shows more adsorption efficiency than

11632,a novel adsorbent has been developed by modifying iron oxide fe2o3 surface using humic acid ha biopolymer and reduced graphene oxide rgo resulting in a highly efficient composite rgo ha fe2o3 with magnetic property for removal of fluoride the surface area of the composite is found to be 455 6 m2 g which has been enhanced around five times after modification with rgo and ha batch adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the optimal conditions for fluoride adsorption the study found that the maximum fluoride adsorption occurred at adsorbent dose of 0 3 g l ph 7 contact time of 120 min equilibrium adsorption study data best fitted for the freundlich isotherm model whereas kinetic studies follow second order kinetics which demonstrates multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface with chemisorption type interaction the adsorption process was found to be feasible spontaneous endothermic in nature and also the adsorbent was capable of removing around 99 of fluoride at 100 ppm initial fluoride concentration the composite demonstrated a fluoride removal capacity of 376 46 and 395 32 mg g at 30 and 50 c respectively at ph 7 and also exhibited antibacterial properties the composite was successfully regenerated using a 0 1 m alkaline solution with 98 efficiency and can be reused up to four cycles with an efficiency of 83 1 the antibacterial property of the composite was assessed using solutions of escherichia coli in water this study is unique in its use of humic biopolymer in fluoride adsorption studies with graphene oxide incorporating iron oxide to maintain a neutral ph during the adsorption process the high surface area of the rgo ha fe2o3 facilitates for removal of fluoride up to a very high level fluoride concentration broadening its practical applications in various aspects moreover this adsorbent is cost effective as the precursors are easily and abundantly available in the natural environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption humic acid iron oxide reduced graphene oxide magnetic fluoride data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fluoride is classified as a trace element and is considered as essential for both humans and animals mondal et al 2015 according to the who standards 1 5 mg l fluoride concentration is permissible for the humans intake the excessive intake of fluoride by human causes several diseases such as dental fluorosis hypomineralization of tooth enamel skeletal fluorosis bone deformation and many more like thyroid and neurological problem etc tang and zhang 2016 so the removal of fluoride from the water is prime necessity for the water researcher and thus many techniques such as chemical precipitation ion exchange adsorption electrolysis reverse osmosis and nano filtration have been utilized for the removal of fluoride from the water tang and zhang 2016 kochar et al 2023a damtie et al 2019a 2019b ben grich et al 2019 lópez guzmán et al 2019 amongst them adsorption is considered as the most efficient and universal option than the other reported techniques jaafari et al 2018 azari et al 2017 azari et al 2021 rezaeikalantary et al 2014 zazouli et al 2016 yegane badi et al 2015 due to the recycling of the adsorbent and the low generation of residues this technique has the most advantages over other fluoride removal methods pandi and viswanathan 2016a pan et al 2013 jing et al 2012 many adsorbents have been reported for the removal of fluoride from water such as metal organic frameworks mofs jeyaseelan et al 2021 metal oxide mono dhillon et al 2016 di raghav et al 2019 or trimetalic wang et al 2017 oxides adsorbents carbon based adsorbents yadav et al 2013 biopolymer based adsorbents prabhu and meenakshi 2015 clay adsorbents uddin et al 2019 hydroxyapatite based adsorbents raghavsapna and kumar 2018 go based adsorbents lin et al 2018 and many more due to its excellent physical chemical and mechanical properties graphene based adsorbents display promising results in removing contaminants from water some of go based adsorbents are reported in literature such as mohan and its co authors synthesized reduced graphene oxide incorporated with zirconium oxide rgo zro2 with adsorption capacity of 45 70 mg g for fluoride removal mohan et al 2017 similarly sun et al synthesized alooh rgo with 118 70 mg g adsorption capacity for fluoride removal sun et al 2016 wang et al incorporated go nanocomposite in zro2 al2o3 which shows fluoride adsorption capacity of 62 20 mg g wang et al 2020 nevertheless the propensity of graphene sheets to re stack and agglomerate is evident as a consequence of the aromatic rings robust π π interactions this phenomenon undeniably results in reduced specific surface area and compromised adsorption capabilities of go graphene oxide bulin et al 2020 therefore modifying the go layer through polymer mixing or incorporation of metal oxide into the go matrix improves the adsorption results dehghani et al 2020 mahmoudi et al 2019 this modification not only improves adsorption performance but also adsorbent stability and pollutant selectivity several adsorbents based on graphene oxide have been reported in literature which exhibit a high adsorption capacity achieved through the combination of metal oxide and biopolymers kuang et al synthesized iron oxy hydroxide modified with go feooh go for fluoride removal with 19 82 mg g adsorption capacity with surface area of 202 60 m2 g kuang et al 2017 recently iron oxides have gained significant research attention due to their favourable characteristics such as fast kinetics easy synthesis easy separation and reusability kochar et al 2023b amongst other iron oxides fe2o3 is an environmental friendly chemically stable and inexpensive iron oxide however pure fe2o3 agglomerates as do many nanoparticles therefore loading iron oxide fe2o3 over the matrix such as rgo and humic acid can overcome this problem in the present study a novel composite have been utilized based on humic acid polymer with abundant functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl group etc in its structure liu et al 2016a which has ability to form chelate with the various metal ions the objective of this research paper is focused on development and utilization of a novel adsorbent by surface modification of fe2o3 with humic acid and reduced graphene oxide with the goal of investigating its suitability as a fluoride removal adsorbent viable to work at a normal ph value the study has been carried out utilizing the novel adsorbent for defluoridation of the real water sample and the synthetic fluoride sample with higher fluoride concentration of 100 ppm thus the prepared adsorbent was characterized by various analytical techniques to understand the surface properties of the adsorbents which helps to understand the process of adsorption such as bet ftir sem tem edx tga and xrd to evaluate the adsorption capacity and determine the optimal parameters for batch experiments various influencing factors such as the effect of adsorbent dosage stirring contact time fluoride concentration in the synthetic fluoride solution and ph of the solution has been analyzed the novel adsorbent s antibacterial properties were tested using escherichia coli solutions the novelty of rgo humic acid and fe2o3 composite for fluoride removal lies in the combination of different materials with unique properties that enhance the efficiency of fluoride removal reduced graphene oxide rgo has a high surface area and electrical conductivity which improves the adsorption capacity of the composite humic acid ha is an organic substance that can form complexes with metal ions such as fe2o3 and enhance their stability and reactivity fe2o3 is a well known adsorbent for fluoride due to its high surface area and strong adsorption affinity the incorporation of iron oxide salt into the composite enables the adsorbent to respond to an external magnetic field allowing for easy separation and recovery after the adsorption process this property significantly reduces the time and cost required for separation and purification steps making the composite an efficient and cost effective option for fluoride removal from water the composite material can effectively remove fluoride from water by adsorption and co precipitation processes which makes it a promising candidate for water treatment applications additionally the use of environmentally friendly and cost effective materials such as rgo and ha makes this composite a sustainable solution for fluoride removal iron oxide can act as a buffer during the adsorption process by maintaining the ph value close to neutral this is because iron oxide surfaces have a point of zero charge pzc at a ph value close to neutral at this ph the iron oxide surface is electrically neutral and can readily attract and retain oppositely charged ions such as fluoride from the surrounding solution in addition iron oxide can act as a source or sink of protons depending on the ph of the solution when the solution is acidic iron oxide surfaces can release protons thereby increasing the ph of the solution towards neutrality similarly when the solution is basic iron oxide surfaces can adsorb protons thereby decreasing the ph of the solution towards neutrality this buffering capacity of iron oxide helps to stabilize the ph of the solution during the adsorption process which is important for ensuring the effectiveness of the process and minimizing any adverse effects on the environment 2 material and methods during the preparation process and adsorption study all chemicals used were sourced from sigma aldrich of analytical grade and were used without any further purification for the synthesis of rgo ha fe2o3 composite graphene powder humic acid ethanol ferric and ferrous salt of iron glutaraldehyde double distilled di water and sodium hydroxide were used for the fluoride adsorption process sodium fluoride sodium hydroxide nitrite acid hydrochloric acid sodium chloride sodium carbonate sodium phosphate sodium nitrate and sodium hydrogen carbonate were used the stock solution of fluoride was prepared by mixing 2 21 g of naf in 1000 ml of di water in a volumetric flask other solutions for analysis were prepared by series dilution method for the antibacterial study tryptone yeast extract and e coli straind3 were used 2 1 preparation method the synthesis of the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was carried out into three steps step i initially a homogeneous solution of reduced graphene oxide rgo and humic acid ha was prepared separately the rgo solution was prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of rgo in 100 ml of ethanol which was then subjected to ultrasonication for a period of 3 h the ha solution on the other hand was prepared by dissolving 2 g of ha in di water with a few drops of dilute hcl acid and stirring the mixture for 31 min until a uniform solution was achieved step ii both the solution of rgo and ha were mixed with each other and 2 ml of glutraldehyde was added as crosslinker the resulting mixture was stirred for 3 h to create a rgo ha template next a 1 m solution of iron salt was introduced into the rgo ha solution and followed by the addition of 0 5 m naoh solution which led to the formation of iron hydroxide precipitates on the rgo ha template step iii the solution was stirred for a period of 5 6 h and subjected to deep freezing for 48 h to facilitate crystallization following the deep freezing step the solution was washed several times with di water to eliminate any water soluble impurities and free ions the resulting precipitates were then dried at room temperature and subsequently in a muffle furnace to maintain their porosity and remove volatile gases the final product obtained was the named as rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the prepared composite was then characterized using different techniques such as xrd fesem edx and ftir etc in order to understand the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent which favours the fluoride adsorption 2 2 adsorbent characterization the surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were measured with nitrogen chemisorption measurement with surface analyzer quantachromeautosorbiq for the surface anlaysis in order to maintain the porosity and to remove the volatile gases the sample was first degassed in the thermal chamber up to 300 c the surface morphology of adsorbents was analyzed by fesem field emission scanning electron microscopy for the fesem analysis surface must be conducting so in order to make this firstly sample was coated on the carbon tape then placed in the chamber where beam of electron fall on it and the surface analysis is done the main functional groups present on the adsorbent surface which are responsible for the adsorption process were analyzed by the ftir the crystal structure of iron oxide in the humic rgo template was observed by the xrd x ray diffraction analysis the thermal stability of the adsorbent was characterized by the tga thermogravimetric analysis the magnetic property of the adsorbent was analyzed by vsm vibrating sample magnetometer study 2 3 batch studies for the optimization of standard parameters for adsorption

t a g e a d s o r p t i o n a c i c e c i 100 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c i c e m v where ci is the initial concentration of fluoridein mg l ce is remaining concentration of fluorideafter adsorption in mg l v is the volume of solution and m is the mass of adsorbent utilized during adsorption experiment in g l nehra et al 2019 in order to optimize the adsorption process various parameters including ph adsorbent dose and contact time were varied at room temperature the ph was varied from 3 to 11 the adsorbent dose was varied from 0 05 g l to 0 4 g l and the contact time was varied from 15 to 150 min throughout the optimization of all parameters the initial concentration of fluoride was kept fixed at 10 mg l after adsorption residual fluoride was then analyzed using an ion chromatography ic system since the water samples contain a range of anions and cations it is essential to assess the impact of other anions typically found in water such as chloride sulfate phosphate bicarbonate and nitrate on the adsorption efficiency of fluoride by the adsorbent to examine this each co ion solution with concentration ranging from 1 to 50 ppm was added to 100 mg l fluoride solution after completing the adsorption analysis the spent adsorbent was regenerated by mixing it with various strengths of naoh solution including 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m 2 4 quality assurance of the data determination of fluoride and other anions concentration present in the solution was carried out using ion chromatography system and ion selective electrode initially the method was validated for checking of the detection limit quantification limit recovery linearity repeatability reproducibility of the instrument then the instruments were calibrated using certified reference materials crms bharatiya nirdeshak dravyas bnds by external calibration and standard addition method with quality control standard analyzed as quality check the certified property value of bnd 1034 for fluoride is of 1000 7 mg kg 998 7 mg l and the tracecert standard 1000 4 mg l were considered and successive dilution of aliquot were prepared gravimetrically the aliquot were analyzed in triplicate with the calibration regression r2 0 98 and recovery with 5 2 5 antibacterial response of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the bactericidal effect towards rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was determined by the modified taguchi method e coli strain de3 was inoculated from a stock vial in 50 ml luria bertini broth lb broth composition 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract 10 g nacl in 1 l distilled water at ph 7 and incubated at 37 c shaker incubator for 10 12 h log phase e coli culture was pellet down at 4000 rpm for 10mins at rt and supernatant solution was decanted and re suspended in freshly prepared pbs solution and bacterial cells were washed twice finally cells were re suspended in 5 ml lb broth at a final concentration of 106 e coli cells ml compound rgo ha fe2o3 was added finally in different concentrations such as 20 μg ml 50 μg ml etc then cells were incubated at 37 c in a shaker incubator at 200 rpm for 15mins simultaneously the control experiment was executed without rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite total viable count tvc technique was employed to determine the no of bacterial cells pre and post compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment after 15 min 1 ml of supernatant from both control and treated sample was taken and serial dilutions were carried out then 100ul sample from final dilution was plated on lb agar plates in triplicate and incubated at 37 c plate incubator for 12 14 h prior to quantification finally viable cells colonies were quantitated including dilution factor manually and expressed in terms of mean colony forming units cfu per milliliter 2 5 1 facs based analysis post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment 200ul of supernatant from 50 mg treated sample was taken and 2 μl pi 2 mg ml was added in solution and incubated at rt for 1min and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis mfi was calculated for both treated versus untreated samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 bet the surface area and pore size analysis of the adsorbent was performed at 77 k in nitrogen atmosphere fig 1 shows the hysteresis plot for the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite which shows the hysteresis loop of type h4 and type iv isotherm indicating mesoporous texture liu et al 2016a the surface area of fe2o3 is usually less than 100 m2 g waseem et al 2014 nanostructured α 2022 which has been enhanced to 455 6 m2 g after modification with rgo and ha which is approximately five time of the virgin precursor a detail study has been carried out with the multipoint surface area of the composite before and after fluoride adsorption and found to be 455 6 m2 g and 219 75 m2 g respectively inset figure a in 1 shows da plot for the pore size distribution of composite before and after adsorption i e found 14 4 a before adsorption and 12 8 a after adsorption after the adsorption of fluoride pore radii decreases that might be due to blocking of pores by fluoride ions the bjh pore size distribution was found to be in range of 10 50 nm range pore size 2 nm indicating mesoporous structure shown in fig s1 taneja et al 2021 the go based adsorbents shows larger surface but smaller pore distribution which are beneficial for the adsorption small size ions such as fluoride so the synthesized composite performed very well for the fluoride removal studies other surface parameters of the composite before and after fluoride adsorption are tabulated in table 1 and shown in figs 1 2 and s1 3 1 2 sem edx tem the morphology of the composite surface was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy upon observing the surface composite it appeared to have small circular rods and spheres of large size that had agglomerated due to the magnetic iron oxide bulin et al 2020 kuang et al 2017 the composite possessed a unique property of being hygroscopic meaning that after being left in an open environment for a few min the sample absorbed moisture as a result the shapes appeared to have melted into each other and agglomerated as demonstrated in fig 3 a c after the adsorption of fluoride the shapes of the composite vanished due to the excessive adsorption of fluoride onto it as shown in fig s2 a b furthermore the edx study confirmed the adsorption of fluoride onto the adsorbent as seen in the edx image where no peak for fluoride was observed before adsorption but after adsorption the spectra contained a peak for fluoride as depicted in fig 4 a b based on the tem image in fig s3 it was clear that the composite was needle shaped with particle sizes ranged from 15 to 30 nm raul et al 2012 3 1 3 ftir the ftir spectra of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite before and after adsorption is shown in fig 5 the spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 a broad band around 3600 3700 cm 1 represented the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl group of adsorbed water molecule on the composite taneja et al 2021 after adsorption the oh stretching peak shifted toward higher wavelength 3635 30 3714 34 cm 1 due to h bonding between hydroxyl and fluoride ion the peak at 2940 79 cm 1 is due to c h stretching peak of humic acid the peak around 2363 cm 1 corresponds to characteristic peak for fe2o3oxide farahmandjou and soflaee 2015 the peak at 1271 57 and 1085 cm 1 is due to c n amine group and c o stretching of humic acid respectively the peak appear at 1661 cm 1 is c o stretching of carbonyl group present in the both rgo and humic acid peak at 788 51 and 563 32 cm 1 is assigned to fe o h bending vibration and fe o bending peak of iron oxide respectively kuang et al 2017 peaks observed below 500 cm 1 are attributed to bending vibration of fluoride bonds such as c f fe f etc which appear after the adsorption process and confirm the interaction of fluoride with the composite 3 1 4 tga the tga curve in fig 6 reveals four distinct weight loss steps the first step accounting for approximately 7 weight loss occurred up to 220 c and was attributed to moisture loss the second weight loss step around 18 occurred up to 300 c which may be due to adsorbed water molecules sahu et al 2020 the third weight loss step approximately 10 continued up to 500 c which was attributed to the rupture of polymer chains or graphene oxide layer the fourth weight loss step was due to dihydroxylation leading to the decomposition of metal oxide ekka et al 2017 3 1 5 xrd xrd pattern of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite is shown in fig 7 the peak at around 26 2 corresponds to 002 plane of reduced graphene oxide soomro et al 2019 the peaks at 32 04 38 12 39 96 46 84 49 48 53 12 and 64 36 corresponds to 104 110 113 024 116 018 and 300 planes respectively of fe2o3 which is in accordance with jcpds card no 39 1346 bhosale et al 2015 3 1 6 vsm the m h curve in the range of 20 k to 20 k has been shown in fig 8 the s shaped have been observed in the studied material such behaviour points towards the magnetic interaction prevailing in the material azari et al 2015 takmil et al 2020 3 2 batch mode adsorption experimental study 3 2 1 influence of ph the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is significantly affected by the ph of the solution as it influences the surface charge of the adsorbent the experiment was conducted with an initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l over a ph range of 2 10 the results depicted in fig 9 show that the fluoride removal is almost constant between ph 3 7 this could be due to the positively charged surface of the adsorbent at acidic ph range which results in a strong interaction between fluoride ions and the adsorbent surface which carries a positive charge taneja et al 2021 beyond ph 7 the percentage of adsorption sharply decreases from 98 55 to 93 and this could be attributed to the negatively charged surface of the composite at basic ph range which repels fluoride ions thus decreasing the adsorption tendency taneja et al 2021 however adsorption can occur through ion exchange between surface hydroxyl group and fluoride ion liu et al 2016a raghav and kumar 2018a therefore to achieve optimal results the ph range was maintained between 6 and 7 throughout the experiment and ph 7 was chosen as the optimal ph value for the adsorption study this result is favourable for the adsorption process since naturally found water is also typically in the ph range of 6 8 3 2 2 adsorbent dose study for fluoride the effect of adsorbent dose was studied at three different ph 3 5 and 7 at all the three ph values the adsorbent displayed similar trend for fluoride removal as the adsorbent dose was increased from 0 05 to 0 5 g l the percentage ofadsorption also increased fig s3 shows the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption tendency of the composite in general as the amount of dose increases the number of active sites for the adsorption increase and so forth the percentage removal increases yadav et al 2022 but this increase up to a level of saturation of active sites and further no ions are left in the solution for adsorption kochar et al 2023b once equilibrium is reached further increases in adsorbent dose do not result in any increase in percentage removal of fluoride the removal percentage increased from 67 to 97 1 68 85 98 22 and 65 97 9 for doses ranging from 0 05 to 0 25 g l at ph 3 5 and 7 respectively after a further increase in the amount of adsorbent used the rate of increase in percentage adsorption slows down significantly due to the saturation of active sites the results indicate that when the adsorbent dose was increased from 0 25 to 0 3 g l there was only a slight increase in percentage adsorption with values ranging from 97 7 to 98 1 98 22 98 67 and 97 9 98 56 at ph 3 5 and 7 respectively based on these findings an optimal adsorbent dose of 0 3 g l at ph 7 was chosen for further adsorption experiments 3 3 adsorption isotherm analysis several isotherms has been studied to confirm the equilibrium studies of fluoride removal from the solution phase the isotherms such as langmuir freundlich temkin and redlich peterson are all describe the solid liquid systems at equilibrium langmuir curve was plotted between ce qe vs ce as shown in fig 10 a d from the intercept of these curves the monolayer adsorption capacity was found to be 376 4 390 8 and 395 3 mg g at 30 40 and 50 c for fluoride indicating that the adsorption process is favoured by higher temperatures and is endothermic in nature the calculated value of rl for fluoride was found to be less than 1 indicating that the adsorption process is feasible the temkin isotherm was plotted by plotting qe vs ln ce fig 10d the slope of the graph gives the value of heat of adsorption which was found to be 23 55 24 05 and 24 18 kj mol at 30 40 and 50 c for fluoride respectively the temkin constant which represents the equilibrium binding was also calculated and found to be 2 43 2 37 and 2 13 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the redlich peterson isotherm was obtained by plotting ln ce qe vs ln ce fig 10c and the slope of the curve gives the value of α from the entire isotherm studies it was found that the freundlich isotherm provided the best fit for the adsorption experimental data based on the residual square r2 value see table 2 based on the r2 value the freundlich model is a better fit than the redlich model while the langmuir and temkin models poorly fit the adsorption experiment data for both models the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 376 4 mg g for fluoride which is higher compared to other go based adsorbents and their combinations the superior performance of the present synthesized composite could be attributed to the presence of a humic acid polymer template a comparison of the present adsorbent with other adsorbents is tabulated in table 3 3 4 contact time and kinetics of the adsorption process the contact time study was carried out from 15 to 150 min for the adsorption of fluoride by rgo ha fe2o3 initially the adsorption capacity for fluoride increases rapidly with time with an increase from 44 to 98 1 observed between 10 and 90 min of contact time after 90 min the rate of increase slows down due to saturation of adsorption sites saini et al 2020 further increases in contact time from 90 to 120 min result in a slight increase in adsorption capacity from 98 1 to 98 7 at equilibrium no significant increase in the adsorption percentage is observed with further increases in contact time as shown in fig 11 to study the rate of adsorption various kinetic models were applied the pso model was found to be the best fit for the experimental data with an r2 value of 0 99 for both fluoride concentrationsi e 50 and 100 mg l fig s5 the rate constant for the adsorption process was calculated as 0 0003 and 0 002 for fluoride concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l respectively the experimental adsorption capacity was determined using the second order model and found to be 172 42 and 333 33 mg g for fluoride concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l the detailed experimental kinetic data are provided in table 4 3 5 thermodynamics of the adsorption process the experiment was conducted at three different temperatures 303 k 313 k and 323 k and three different fluoride concentrations 10 mg l 20 mg l and 30 mg l to determine the thermodynamics of the adsorption process the van t hoff plot was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters and the linear equation of the curve is as follows kochar et al 2023a ln k d δ s r δ h r t where kd is solute coefficient distribution represented as k d q e c e while δs and δ h are change in entropy and change in enthalpy of the process calculated by van t hoff curve plotted against ln kd vs 1 t fig s6 the slope of the curve gives the enthalpy value while intercept gives the entropy of the process the gibbs free energy calculated from the maxwell equation by using the value of δs and δ h the linear equation is δ g δ h t δ s the calculated values for all three thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 5 obtained from the three equations mentioned above a positive value for enthalpy indicates an endothermic nature of the process whereas a negative value for gibbs free energy signifies the feasibility of the adsorption process the change in enthalpy value ranges between 10 and 40 kj mol indicating that both physical and chemical type of interactions take place between the fluoride and composite raghavsapna and kumar 2018 raghav and kumar 2018a 3 6 effect of co ions various anions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 2 are present in natural groundwater or drinking water which affect the adsorption of fluoride onto the composite surface in the coa experiment we tested the effect of four different co ions at varying concentrations on the adsorption of fluoride as the concentration of co ions increased the adsorption percentage of fluoride decreased due to competition for the active sites chloride ions reduced the percentage adsorption of fluoride from 89 to 81 with an increase in concentration from 1 to 50 ppm nitrate decreased the percentage adsorption from 86 9 to 75 carbonate from 84 to 70 1 sulfate from 84 to 70 1 and phosphate from 84 9 to 68 5 with an increase in concentration from 1 to 50 ppm fig 12 the composite surface acts as a lewis acid and the anions act as lewis bases raghav et al 2019 raghavsapna and kumar 2018 raghav and kumar 2018b based on the hard and soft acids and bases hsab concept anions with larger negative charges have a stronger influence on fluoride adsorption due to stronger interactions therefore po4 3 has the greatest effect on fluoride adsorption followed by so4 2 and co3 2 and then cl and no3 between so4 2 and co3 2 sulfate has a greater effect due to its higher lewis character similarly no3 has a greater effect than cl and no3 the overall order of anions that influence fluoride adsorption is all ion phosphate sulfate carbonate nitrate chloride 3 7 regeneration and reusability based on the ph studies it was observed that the composite had low adsorption capacity at high ph values due to the negatively charged surface of the composite which repelled fluoride ions and affected electrostatic interactions thus to desorb fluoride from the spent adsorbent a dilute solution of alkali such as sodium hydroxide was used firstly the fluoride adsorbed composite was washed several times with distilled water and then subjected to different concentrations of alkali solution ranging from 0 0001 to 0 1 for 24 h the desorption results are shown in table s1 while fig s7 shows that the 0 2 m concentration of naoh was the most effective for regenerating the fluoride exhausted adsorbent achieving up to 98 41 desorption after conducting the desorption studies it was found that 0 2 m naoh concentration was best suited for desorbing fluoride from the fluoride exhausted composite the composite was regenerated for up to four cycles and the percentage of adsorption decreased from 93 to 83 1 fig 13 this decrease in percentage adsorption may be related to the destruction of surface functional groups during the regeneration process liu et al 2016b 3 8 elucidation of antibacterial response of go ha fe2o3 oxide composite bactericidal activity of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was investigated based on delgadillo velasco et al 2017 study where the test compound was directly exposed to e coli cells in standard culture media in our experiment different concentrations of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite such as 4 mg 10 mg and 20 mg etc were incubated in 5 ml of log phased e coli culture for 15mins post treatment 100ul of supernatant was plated on lb agar plate upon serial dilution from each concentration after 24 h mean colony forming units cfu cfu count was calculated as shown in fig s8 represents that there is a gradual decrease in cfu count from the 4 mg treatment condition up to the final 20 mg treatment condition fig s9 therefore upon calculation of total viable cells ml depicts the significant change in no of cells post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment in the 4 mg treatment condition there was a 0 5 log fold difference but in 10 and 20 mg treatment conditions there is approx 1 2 1 4 log fold difference in no of total viable cells post compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment as compared to control condition fig 14 another facs based experiment was conducted to monitor the efficacy of the antibacterial property of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite in a real time manner post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment cells were subjected to propidium iodide staining and followed to flow cytometry analysis propidium iodide pi stains the dna and rna content of the membrane disintegrated cells preferentially due to compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment data represents that there is approx 30 increase in mean fluorescence intensity mfi in the 10 mg rgo ha fe2o3 oxide treatment condition as compared to the control sample fig s10 mfi is an indicator for percent cell dead population respectively which shows an increase in percent cell death in the treated sample versus the control sample despite the addition of almost double the amount of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite in 20 mg treatment condition as compared to 10 mg treatment condition there is not much change in terms of cells survival post treatment literature suggests that e coli or other bacterial cells can adsorb on solid surfaces due to multiple forces that came into play such as hydrophobic interactions or electrostatic interactions or both ista et al 2004 and an and friedman 1998 therefore it might be one of the reasons that lead to the reduction of antibacterial effect of compound rgo ha fe2o3 in 20 mg treatment condition it may be due to the accumulation of dead cells or cell debris on the surface of compound rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite hence we hypothesized that regeneration of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite post treatment would might leads towards the restoration of its antibacterial activity but with experimental limitation besides all the study shows that in a short duration of treatment of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite shows colossal antibacterial response towards gram negative bacteria like e coli 3 9 sterilisation procedure for rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the bactericidal effect towards rgo ha fe2o3oxide composite was determined by themodified taguchi method and conducted in biosafety level 2 conditions rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was stored at room temperature rt 25 c and in anhydrous conditions control experiment was executed with rgo ha fe2o3oxide composite in absence of bacterial cells to determine external contamination which was indicated from clean lb agar plate post 24 h with undetected bacterial colonies 3 10 adsorption mechanism in general the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 can be attributed to a combination of chemical and physical processes including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding fe3o4 has a high surface area and a large number of active sites which can facilitate the adsorption of fluoride ions through ion exchange and electrostatic interactions the positively charged surface of rgo ha fe2o3 can attract the negatively charged fluoride ions through electrostatic attraction while the iron oxide surface can also form chemical bonds with fluoride ions through ion exchange humic acid is a natural organic matter with a complex molecular structure that contains various functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and alcoholic groups these functional groups can interact with fluoride ions through hydrogen bonding and ion exchange the carboxylic groups in particular can form strong hydrogen bonds with fluoride ions leading to the adsorption of fluoride the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 can be attributed to a combination of electrostatic attraction pi pi stacking and hydrogen bonding the pi pi stacking interaction between the aromatic rings in the rgo structure and fluoride ions can facilitate the adsorption process while the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups on the rgo surface and the fluoride ions can also contribute to the adsorption mechanism in summary the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 involves multiple mechanisms including ion exchange electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding and pi pi stacking interaction which are influenced by various factors such as ph concentration temperature and the chemical composition of the adsorbent and adsorbate liu et al 2016a sahoo and hota 2018 3 11 field testing for validation of the developed adsorbent field testing was done using water samples collected from one of village of sonipat haryana fluoride concentration was found to be 5 2 mg l ph of 6 8 in collected samples adsorbent dose of 0 03 g was taken in 100 ml of collected water sample the samples were shaken for 120 min at room temperature after the adsorption experiment the concentration of fluoride was reduced to 0 06 mg l it reveals that the adsorbent is quite viable for the defluoridation in the area mentioned above even though the water sample was containing many other ions such as nitrate chloride sulfate etc 4 conclusion the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite having magnetic property was successfully synthesized simply by modifying the surface of iron oxide with rgo and humic acid using co precipitation and freeze drying process the synthesized composite was characterized by sem bet xrd ftir and tga to known the surface properties which are responsible for the favourable fluoride adsorption process the synthesized composite had a surface area of 455 62 m2 g and showed better results than other rgo or fe2o3 based adsorbents due to the presence of humic acid polymer the newly developed adsorbent is highly appropriate for purifying drinking water as it can maintain a ph value of 7 throughout the adsorption process additionally even a very small amount of this adsorbent can effectively remove fluoride at a 0 3 g l adsorbent dose and temperatures of 30 and 50 c the maximum fluoride removal capacity of rgo ha fe2o3 was found to be 376 46 and 395 32 mg g respectively the adsorption data fits best with the freundlich isotherm indicating a multilayer type of adsorption with an endothermic nature the kinetics data was best fitted by second order kinetic model the spent adsorbent was efficiently regenerated using a 0 1 m alkaline solution with a good efficiency rate of 83 1 for up to four cycles of reuse the exceptional magnetic properties of the rgo ha fe2o3 composite make it an extremely appealing option for practical fluoride adsorption applications the strong magnetic properties and high surface area of the composite allow for efficient and effective removal of fluoride from drinking water this feature significantly reduces the cost and time needed for purification and separation procedures making it a highly efficient and cost effective option for fluoride removal from water as a result the rgo ha fe2o3 composite is an ideal choice for large scale water treatment applications moreover in a short treatment duration the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite displayed a remarkable antibacterial response against gram negative bacteria such as e coli declaration of competing interest the authors declare

applications in various aspects moreover this adsorbent is cost effective as the precursors are easily and abundantly available in the natural environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption humic acid iron oxide reduced graphene oxide magnetic fluoride data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fluoride is classified as a trace element and is considered as essential for both humans and animals mondal et al 2015 according to the who standards 1 5 mg l fluoride concentration is permissible for the humans intake the excessive intake of fluoride by human causes several diseases such as dental fluorosis hypomineralization of tooth enamel skeletal fluorosis bone deformation and many more like thyroid and neurological problem etc tang and zhang 2016 so the removal of fluoride from the water is prime necessity for the water researcher and thus many techniques such as chemical precipitation ion exchange adsorption electrolysis reverse osmosis and nano filtration have been utilized for the removal of fluoride from the water tang and zhang 2016 kochar et al 2023a damtie et al 2019a 2019b ben grich et al 2019

with 118 70 mg g adsorption capacity for fluoride removal sun et al 2016 wang et al incorporated go nanocomposite in zro2 al2o3 which shows fluoride adsorption capacity of 62 20 mg g wang et al 2020 nevertheless the propensity of graphene sheets to re stack and agglomerate is evident as a consequence of the aromatic rings robust π π interactions this phenomenon undeniably results in reduced specific surface area and compromised adsorption capabilities of go graphene oxide bulin et al 2020 therefore modifying the go layer through polymer mixing or incorporation of metal oxide into the go matrix improves the adsorption results dehghani et al 2020 mahmoudi et al 2019 this modification not only improves adsorption performance but also adsorbent stability and pollutant selectivity several adsorbents based on graphene oxide have been reported in literature which exhibit a high adsorption capacity achieved through the combination of metal oxide and biopolymers kuang et al synthesized iron oxy hydroxide modified with go feooh go for fluoride removal with 19 82 mg g adsorption capacity with surface area of 202 60 m2 g kuang et al 2017 recently iron oxides have gained significant research attention due to their favourable characteristics such as fast kinetics easy synthesis easy separation and reusability kochar et al 2023b amongst other iron oxides fe2o3 is an environmental friendly chemically stable and inexpensive iron oxide however pure fe2o3 agglomerates as do many nanoparticles therefore loading iron oxide fe2o3 over the matrix such as rgo and humic acid can overcome this problem in the present study a novel composite have been utilized based on humic acid polymer with abundant functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl group etc in its structure liu et al 2016a which has ability to form chelate with the various metal ions the objective of this research paper is focused on development and utilization of a novel adsorbent by surface modification of fe2o3 with humic acid and reduced graphene oxide with the goal of investigating its suitability as a fluoride removal adsorbent viable to work at a normal ph value the study has been carried out utilizing the novel adsorbent for defluoridation of the real water sample and the synthetic fluoride sample with higher fluoride concentration of 100 ppm thus the prepared adsorbent was characterized by various analytical techniques to understand the surface properties of the adsorbents which helps to understand the process of adsorption such as bet ftir sem tem edx tga and xrd to evaluate the adsorption capacity and determine the optimal parameters for batch experiments various influencing factors such as the effect of adsorbent dosage stirring contact time fluoride concentration in the synthetic fluoride solution and ph of the solution has been analyzed the novel adsorbent s antibacterial properties were tested using escherichia coli solutions the novelty of rgo humic acid and fe2o3 composite for fluoride removal lies in the combination of different materials with unique properties that enhance the efficiency of fluoride removal reduced graphene oxide rgo has a high surface area and electrical conductivity which improves the adsorption capacity of the composite humic acid ha is an organic substance that can form complexes with metal ions such as fe2o3 and enhance their stability and reactivity fe2o3 is a well known adsorbent for fluoride due to its high surface area and strong adsorption affinity the incorporation of iron oxide salt into the composite enables the adsorbent to respond to an external magnetic field allowing for easy separation and recovery after the adsorption process this property significantly reduces the time and cost required for separation and purification steps making the composite an efficient and cost effective option for fluoride removal from water the composite material can effectively remove fluoride from water by adsorption and co precipitation processes which makes it a promising candidate for water treatment applications additionally the use of environmentally friendly and cost effective materials such as rgo and ha makes this composite a sustainable solution for fluoride removal iron oxide can act as a buffer during the adsorption process by maintaining the ph value close to neutral this is because iron oxide surfaces have a point of zero charge pzc at a ph value close to neutral at this ph the iron oxide surface is electrically neutral and can readily attract and retain oppositely charged ions such as fluoride from the surrounding solution in addition iron oxide can act as a source or sink of protons depending on the ph of the solution when the solution is acidic iron oxide surfaces can release protons thereby increasing the ph of the solution towards neutrality similarly when the solution is basic iron oxide surfaces can adsorb protons thereby decreasing the ph of the solution towards neutrality this buffering capacity of iron oxide helps to stabilize the ph of the solution during the adsorption process which is important for ensuring the effectiveness of the process and minimizing any adverse effects on the environment 2 material and methods during the preparation process and adsorption study all chemicals used were sourced from sigma aldrich of analytical grade and were used without any further purification for the synthesis of rgo ha fe2o3 composite graphene powder humic acid ethanol ferric and ferrous salt of iron glutaraldehyde double distilled di water and sodium hydroxide were used for the fluoride adsorption process sodium fluoride sodium hydroxide nitrite acid hydrochloric acid sodium chloride sodium carbonate sodium phosphate sodium nitrate and sodium hydrogen carbonate were used the stock solution of fluoride was prepared by mixing 2 21 g of naf in 1000 ml of di water in a volumetric flask other solutions for analysis were prepared by series dilution method for the antibacterial study tryptone yeast extract and e coli straind3 were used 2 1 preparation method the synthesis of the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was carried out into three steps step i initially a homogeneous solution of reduced graphene oxide rgo and humic acid ha was prepared separately the rgo solution was prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of rgo in 100 ml of ethanol which was then subjected to ultrasonication for a period of 3 h the ha solution on the other hand was prepared by dissolving 2 g of ha in di water with a few drops of dilute hcl acid and stirring the mixture for 31 min until a uniform solution was achieved step ii both the solution of rgo and ha were mixed with each other and 2 ml of glutraldehyde was added as crosslinker the resulting mixture was stirred for 3 h to create a rgo ha template next a 1 m solution of iron salt was introduced into the rgo ha solution and followed by the addition of 0 5 m naoh solution which led to the formation of iron hydroxide precipitates on the rgo ha template step iii the solution was stirred for a period of 5 6 h and subjected to deep freezing for 48 h to facilitate crystallization following the deep freezing step the solution was washed several times with di water to eliminate any water soluble impurities and free ions the resulting precipitates were then dried at room temperature and subsequently in a muffle furnace to maintain their porosity and remove volatile gases the final product obtained was the named as rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the prepared composite was then characterized using different techniques such as xrd fesem edx and ftir etc in order to understand the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent which favours the fluoride adsorption 2 2 adsorbent characterization the surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were measured with nitrogen chemisorption measurement with surface analyzer quantachromeautosorbiq for the surface anlaysis in order to maintain the porosity and to remove the volatile gases the sample was first degassed in the thermal chamber up to 300 c the surface morphology of adsorbents was analyzed by fesem field emission scanning electron microscopy for the fesem analysis surface must be conducting so in order to make this firstly sample was coated on the carbon tape then placed in the chamber where beam of electron fall on it and the surface analysis is done the main functional groups present on the adsorbent surface which are responsible for the adsorption process were analyzed by the ftir the crystal structure of iron oxide in the humic rgo template was observed by the xrd x ray diffraction analysis the thermal stability of the adsorbent was characterized by the tga thermogravimetric analysis the magnetic property of the adsorbent was analyzed by vsm vibrating sample magnetometer study 2 3 batch studies for the optimization of standard parameters for adsorption studies batch studies has been performed thrice to remove the possible errors the percentage adsorption and adsorption capacity was calculated by the following standard equations 1 and 2 1 p e r c e n t a g e a d s o r p t i o n a c i c e c i 100 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c i c e m v where ci is the initial concentration of fluoridein mg l ce is remaining concentration of fluorideafter adsorption in mg l v is the volume of solution and m is the mass of adsorbent utilized during adsorption experiment in g l nehra et al 2019 in order to optimize the adsorption process various parameters including ph adsorbent dose and contact time were varied at room temperature the ph was varied from 3 to 11 the adsorbent dose was varied from 0 05 g l to 0 4 g l and the contact time was varied from 15 to 150 min throughout the optimization of all parameters the initial concentration of fluoride was kept fixed at 10 mg l after adsorption residual fluoride was then analyzed using an ion chromatography ic system since the water samples contain a range of anions and cations it is essential to assess the impact of other anions typically found in water such as chloride sulfate phosphate bicarbonate and nitrate on the adsorption efficiency of fluoride by the adsorbent to examine this each co ion solution with concentration ranging from 1 to 50 ppm was added to 100 mg l fluoride solution after completing the adsorption analysis the spent adsorbent was regenerated by mixing it with various strengths of naoh solution including 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 0 2 m 2 4 quality assurance of the data determination of fluoride and other anions concentration present in the solution was carried out using ion chromatography system and ion selective electrode initially the method was validated for checking of the detection limit quantification limit recovery linearity repeatability reproducibility of the instrument then the instruments were calibrated using certified reference materials crms bharatiya nirdeshak dravyas bnds by external calibration and standard addition method with quality control standard analyzed as quality check the certified property value of bnd 1034 for fluoride is of 1000 7 mg kg 998 7 mg l and the tracecert standard 1000 4 mg l were considered and successive dilution of aliquot were prepared gravimetrically the aliquot were analyzed in triplicate with the calibration regression r2 0 98 and recovery with 5 2 5 antibacterial response of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the bactericidal effect towards rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was determined by the modified taguchi method e coli strain de3 was inoculated from a stock vial in 50 ml luria bertini broth lb broth composition 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract 10 g nacl in 1 l distilled water at ph 7 and incubated at 37 c shaker incubator for 10 12 h log phase e coli culture was pellet down at 4000 rpm for 10mins at rt and supernatant solution was decanted and re suspended in freshly prepared pbs solution and bacterial cells were washed twice finally cells were re suspended in 5 ml lb broth at a final concentration of 106 e coli cells ml compound rgo ha fe2o3 was added finally in different concentrations such as 20 μg ml 50 μg ml etc then cells were incubated at 37 c in a shaker incubator at 200 rpm for 15mins simultaneously the control experiment was executed without rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite total viable count tvc technique was employed to determine the no of bacterial cells pre and post compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment after 15 min 1 ml of supernatant from both control and treated sample was taken and serial dilutions were carried out then 100ul sample from final dilution was plated on lb agar plates in triplicate and incubated at 37 c plate incubator for 12 14 h prior to quantification finally viable cells colonies were quantitated including dilution factor manually and expressed in terms of mean colony forming units cfu per milliliter 2 5 1 facs based analysis post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment 200ul of supernatant from 50 mg treated sample was taken and 2 μl pi 2 mg ml was added in solution and incubated at rt for 1min and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis mfi was calculated for both treated versus untreated samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 bet the surface area and pore size analysis of the adsorbent was performed at 77 k in nitrogen atmosphere fig 1 shows the hysteresis plot for the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite which shows the hysteresis loop of type h4 and type iv isotherm indicating mesoporous texture liu et al 2016a the surface area of fe2o3 is usually less than 100 m2 g waseem et al 2014 nanostructured α 2022 which has been enhanced to 455 6 m2 g after modification with rgo and ha which is approximately five time of the virgin precursor a detail study has been carried out with the multipoint surface area of the composite before and after fluoride adsorption and found to be 455 6 m2 g and 219 75 m2 g respectively inset figure a in 1 shows da plot for the pore size distribution of composite before and after adsorption i e found 14 4 a before adsorption and 12 8 a after adsorption after the adsorption of fluoride pore radii decreases that might be due to blocking of pores by fluoride ions the bjh pore size distribution was found to be in range of 10 50 nm range pore size 2 nm indicating mesoporous structure shown in fig s1 taneja et al 2021 the go based adsorbents shows larger surface but smaller pore distribution which are beneficial for the adsorption small size ions such as fluoride so the synthesized composite performed very well for the fluoride removal studies other surface parameters of the composite before and after fluoride adsorption are tabulated in table 1 and shown in figs 1 2 and s1 3 1 2 sem edx tem the morphology of the composite surface was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy upon observing the surface composite it appeared to have small circular rods and spheres of large size that had agglomerated due to the magnetic iron oxide bulin et al 2020 kuang et al 2017 the composite possessed a unique property of being hygroscopic meaning that after being left in an open environment for a few min the sample absorbed moisture as a result the shapes appeared to have melted into each other and agglomerated as demonstrated in fig 3 a c after the adsorption of fluoride the shapes of the composite vanished due to the excessive adsorption of fluoride onto it as shown in fig s2 a b furthermore the edx study confirmed the adsorption of fluoride onto the adsorbent as seen in the edx image where no peak for fluoride was observed before adsorption but after adsorption the spectra contained a peak for fluoride as depicted in fig 4 a b based on the tem image in fig s3 it was clear that the composite was needle shaped with particle sizes ranged from 15 to 30 nm raul et al 2012 3 1 3 ftir the ftir spectra of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite before and after adsorption is shown in fig 5 the spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 a broad band around 3600 3700 cm 1 represented the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl group of adsorbed water molecule on the composite taneja et al 2021 after adsorption the oh stretching peak shifted toward higher wavelength 3635 30 3714 34 cm 1 due to h bonding between hydroxyl and fluoride ion the peak at 2940 79 cm 1 is due to c h stretching peak of humic acid the peak around 2363 cm 1 corresponds to characteristic peak for fe2o3oxide farahmandjou and soflaee 2015 the peak at 1271 57 and 1085 cm 1 is due to c n amine group and c o stretching of humic acid respectively the peak appear at 1661 cm 1 is c o stretching of carbonyl group present in the both rgo and humic acid peak at 788 51 and 563 32 cm 1 is assigned to fe o h bending vibration and fe o bending peak of iron oxide respectively kuang et al 2017 peaks observed below 500 cm 1 are attributed to bending vibration of fluoride bonds such as c f fe f etc which appear after the adsorption process and confirm the interaction of fluoride with the composite 3 1 4 tga the tga curve in fig 6 reveals four distinct weight loss steps the first step accounting for approximately 7 weight loss occurred up to 220 c and was attributed to moisture loss the second weight loss step around 18 occurred up to 300 c which may be due to adsorbed water molecules sahu et al 2020 the third weight loss step approximately 10 continued up to 500 c which was attributed to the rupture of polymer chains or graphene oxide layer the fourth weight loss step was due to dihydroxylation leading to the decomposition of metal oxide ekka et al 2017 3 1 5 xrd xrd pattern of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite is shown in fig 7 the peak at around 26 2 corresponds to 002 plane of reduced graphene oxide soomro et al 2019 the peaks at 32 04 38 12 39 96 46 84 49 48 53 12 and 64 36 corresponds to 104 110 113 024 116 018 and 300 planes respectively of fe2o3 which is in accordance with jcpds card no 39 1346 bhosale et al 2015 3 1 6 vsm the m h curve in the range of 20 k to 20 k has been shown in fig 8 the s shaped have been observed in the studied material such behaviour points towards the magnetic interaction prevailing in the material azari et al 2015 takmil et al 2020 3 2 batch mode adsorption experimental study 3 2 1 influence of ph the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is significantly affected by the ph of the solution as it influences the surface charge of the adsorbent the experiment was conducted with an initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l over a ph range of 2 10 the results depicted in fig 9 show that the fluoride removal is almost constant between ph 3 7 this could be due to the positively charged surface of the adsorbent at acidic ph range which results in a strong interaction between fluoride ions and the adsorbent surface which carries a positive charge taneja et al 2021 beyond ph 7 the percentage of adsorption sharply decreases from 98 55 to 93 and this could be attributed to the negatively charged surface of the composite at basic ph range which repels fluoride ions thus decreasing the adsorption tendency taneja et al 2021 however adsorption can occur through ion exchange between surface hydroxyl group and fluoride ion liu et al 2016a raghav and kumar 2018a therefore to achieve optimal results the ph range was maintained between 6 and 7 throughout the experiment and ph 7 was chosen as the optimal ph value for the adsorption study this result is favourable for the adsorption process since naturally found water is also typically in the ph range of 6 8 3 2 2 adsorbent dose study for fluoride the effect of adsorbent dose was studied at three different ph 3 5 and 7 at all the three ph values the adsorbent displayed similar trend for fluoride removal as the adsorbent dose was increased from 0 05 to 0 5 g l the percentage ofadsorption also increased fig s3 shows the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption tendency of the composite in general as the amount of dose increases the number of active sites for the adsorption increase and so forth the percentage removal increases yadav et al 2022 but this increase up to a level of saturation of active sites and further no ions are left in the solution for adsorption kochar et al 2023b once equilibrium is reached further increases in adsorbent dose do not result in any increase in percentage removal of fluoride the removal percentage increased from 67 to 97 1 68 85 98 22 and 65 97 9 for doses ranging from 0 05 to 0 25 g l at ph 3 5 and 7 respectively after a further increase in the amount of adsorbent used the rate of increase in percentage adsorption slows down significantly due to the saturation of active sites the results indicate that when the adsorbent dose was increased from 0 25 to 0 3 g l there was only a slight increase in percentage adsorption with values ranging from 97 7 to 98 1 98 22 98 67 and 97 9 98 56 at ph 3 5 and 7 respectively based on these findings an optimal adsorbent dose of 0 3 g l at ph 7 was chosen for further adsorption experiments 3 3 adsorption isotherm analysis several isotherms has been studied to confirm the equilibrium studies of fluoride removal from the solution phase the isotherms such as langmuir freundlich temkin and redlich peterson are all describe the solid liquid systems at equilibrium langmuir curve was plotted between ce qe vs ce as shown in fig 10 a d from the intercept of these curves the monolayer adsorption capacity was found to be 376 4 390 8 and 395 3 mg g at 30 40 and 50 c for fluoride indicating that the adsorption process is favoured by higher temperatures and is endothermic in nature the calculated value of rl for fluoride was found to be less than 1 indicating that the adsorption process is feasible the temkin isotherm was plotted by plotting qe vs ln ce fig 10d the slope of the graph gives the value of heat of adsorption which was found to be 23 55 24 05 and 24 18 kj mol at 30 40 and 50 c for fluoride respectively the temkin constant which represents the equilibrium binding was also calculated and found to be 2 43 2 37 and 2 13 at 30 40 and 50 c respectively the redlich peterson isotherm was obtained by plotting ln ce qe vs ln ce fig 10c and the slope of the curve gives the value of α from the entire isotherm studies it was found that the freundlich isotherm provided the best fit for the adsorption experimental data based on the residual square r2 value see table 2 based on the r2 value the freundlich model is a better fit than the redlich model while the langmuir and temkin models poorly fit the adsorption experiment data for both models the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 376 4 mg g for fluoride which is higher compared to other go based adsorbents and their combinations the superior performance of the present synthesized composite could be attributed to the presence of a humic acid polymer template a comparison of the present adsorbent with other adsorbents is tabulated in table 3 3 4 contact time and kinetics of the adsorption process the contact time study was carried out from 15 to 150 min for the adsorption of fluoride by rgo ha fe2o3 initially the adsorption capacity for fluoride increases rapidly with time with an increase from 44 to 98 1 observed between 10 and 90 min of contact time after 90 min the rate of increase slows down due to saturation of adsorption sites saini et al 2020 further increases in contact time from 90 to 120 min result in a slight increase in adsorption capacity from 98 1 to 98 7 at equilibrium no significant increase in the adsorption percentage is observed with further increases in contact time as shown in fig 11 to study the rate of adsorption various kinetic models were applied the pso model was found to be the best fit for the experimental data with an r2 value of 0 99 for both fluoride concentrationsi e 50 and 100 mg l fig s5 the rate constant for the adsorption process was calculated as 0 0003 and 0 002 for fluoride concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l respectively the experimental adsorption capacity was determined using the second order model and found to be 172 42 and 333 33 mg g for fluoride concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l the detailed experimental kinetic data are provided in table 4 3 5 thermodynamics of the adsorption process the experiment was conducted at three different temperatures 303 k 313 k and 323 k and three different fluoride concentrations 10 mg l 20 mg l and 30 mg l to determine the thermodynamics of the adsorption process the van t hoff plot was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters and the linear equation of the curve is as follows kochar et al 2023a ln k d δ s r δ h r t where kd is solute coefficient distribution represented as k d q e c e while δs and δ h are change in entropy and change in enthalpy of the process calculated by van t hoff curve plotted against ln kd vs 1 t fig s6 the slope of the curve gives the enthalpy value while intercept gives the entropy of the process the gibbs free energy calculated from the maxwell equation by using the value of δs and δ h the linear equation is δ g δ h t δ s the calculated values for all three thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 5 obtained from the three equations mentioned above a positive value for enthalpy indicates an endothermic nature of the process whereas a negative value for gibbs free energy signifies the feasibility of the adsorption process the change in enthalpy value ranges between 10 and 40 kj mol indicating that both physical and chemical type of interactions take place between the fluoride and composite raghavsapna and kumar 2018 raghav and kumar 2018a 3 6 effect of co ions various anions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 2 are present in natural groundwater or drinking water which affect the adsorption of fluoride onto the composite surface in the coa experiment we tested the effect of four different co ions at varying concentrations on the adsorption of fluoride as the concentration of co ions increased the adsorption percentage of fluoride decreased due to competition for the active sites chloride ions reduced the percentage adsorption of fluoride from 89 to 81 with an increase in concentration from 1 to 50 ppm nitrate decreased the percentage adsorption from 86 9 to 75 carbonate from 84 to 70 1 sulfate from 84 to 70 1 and phosphate from 84 9 to 68 5 with an increase in concentration from 1 to 50 ppm fig 12 the composite surface acts as a lewis acid and the anions act as lewis bases raghav et al 2019 raghavsapna and kumar 2018 raghav and kumar 2018b based on the hard and soft acids and bases hsab concept anions with larger negative charges have a stronger influence on fluoride adsorption due to stronger interactions therefore po4 3 has the greatest effect on fluoride adsorption followed by so4 2 and co3 2 and then cl and no3 between so4 2 and co3 2 sulfate has a greater effect due to its higher lewis character similarly no3 has a greater effect than cl and no3 the overall order of anions that influence fluoride adsorption is all ion phosphate sulfate carbonate nitrate chloride 3 7 regeneration and reusability based on the ph studies it was observed that the composite had low adsorption capacity at high ph values due to the negatively charged surface of the composite which repelled fluoride ions and affected electrostatic interactions thus to desorb fluoride from the spent adsorbent a dilute solution of alkali such as sodium hydroxide was used firstly the fluoride adsorbed composite was washed several times with distilled water and then subjected to different concentrations of alkali solution ranging from 0 0001 to 0 1 for 24 h the desorption results are shown in table s1 while fig s7 shows that the 0 2 m concentration of naoh was the most effective for regenerating the fluoride exhausted adsorbent achieving up to 98 41 desorption after conducting the desorption studies it was found that 0 2 m naoh concentration was best suited for desorbing fluoride from the fluoride exhausted composite the composite was regenerated for up to four cycles and the percentage of adsorption decreased from 93 to 83 1 fig 13 this decrease in percentage adsorption may be related to the destruction of surface functional groups during the regeneration process liu et al 2016b 3 8 elucidation of antibacterial response of go ha fe2o3 oxide composite bactericidal activity of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was investigated based on delgadillo velasco et al 2017 study where the test compound was directly exposed to e coli cells in standard culture media in our experiment different concentrations of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite such as 4 mg 10 mg and 20 mg etc were incubated in 5 ml of log phased e coli culture for 15mins post treatment 100ul of supernatant was plated on lb agar plate upon serial dilution from each concentration after 24 h mean colony forming units cfu cfu count was calculated as shown in fig s8 represents that there is a gradual decrease in cfu count from the 4 mg treatment condition up to the final 20 mg treatment condition fig s9 therefore upon calculation of total viable cells ml depicts the significant change in no of cells post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment in the 4 mg treatment condition there was a 0 5 log fold difference but in 10 and 20 mg treatment conditions there is approx 1 2 1 4 log fold difference in no of total viable cells post compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment as compared to control condition fig 14 another facs based experiment was conducted to monitor the efficacy of the antibacterial property of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite in a real time manner post rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite treatment cells were subjected to propidium iodide staining and followed to flow cytometry analysis propidium iodide pi stains the dna and rna content of the membrane disintegrated cells preferentially due to compound rgo ha fe2o3 treatment data represents that there is approx 30 increase in mean fluorescence intensity mfi in the 10 mg rgo ha fe2o3 oxide treatment condition as compared to the control sample fig s10 mfi is an indicator for percent cell dead population respectively which shows an increase in percent cell death in the treated sample versus the control sample despite the addition of almost double the amount of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite in 20 mg treatment condition as compared to 10 mg treatment condition there is not much change in terms of cells survival post treatment literature suggests that e coli or other bacterial cells can adsorb on solid surfaces due to multiple forces that came into play such as hydrophobic interactions or electrostatic interactions or both ista et al 2004 and an and friedman 1998 therefore it might be one of the reasons that lead to the reduction of antibacterial effect of compound rgo ha fe2o3 in 20 mg treatment condition it may be due to the accumulation of dead cells or cell debris on the surface of compound rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite hence we hypothesized that regeneration of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite post treatment would might leads towards the restoration of its antibacterial activity but with experimental limitation besides all the study shows that in a short duration of treatment of rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite shows colossal antibacterial response towards gram negative bacteria like e coli 3 9 sterilisation procedure for rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite the bactericidal effect towards rgo ha fe2o3oxide composite was determined by themodified taguchi method and conducted in biosafety level 2 conditions rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite was stored at room temperature rt 25 c and in anhydrous conditions control experiment was executed with rgo ha fe2o3oxide composite in absence of bacterial cells to determine external contamination which was indicated from clean lb agar plate post 24 h with undetected bacterial colonies 3 10 adsorption mechanism in general the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 can be attributed to a combination of chemical and physical processes including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding fe3o4 has a high surface area and a large number of active sites which can facilitate the adsorption of fluoride ions through ion exchange and electrostatic interactions the positively charged surface of rgo ha fe2o3 can attract the negatively charged fluoride ions through electrostatic attraction while the iron oxide surface can also form chemical bonds with fluoride ions through ion exchange humic acid is a natural organic matter with a complex molecular structure that contains various functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and alcoholic groups these functional groups can interact with fluoride ions through hydrogen bonding and ion exchange the carboxylic groups in particular can form strong hydrogen bonds with fluoride ions leading to the adsorption of fluoride the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 can be attributed to a combination of electrostatic attraction pi pi stacking and hydrogen bonding the pi pi stacking interaction between the aromatic rings in the rgo structure and fluoride ions can facilitate the adsorption process while the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups on the rgo surface and the fluoride ions can also contribute to the adsorption mechanism in summary the adsorption of fluoride on rgo ha fe2o3 involves multiple mechanisms including ion exchange electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding and pi pi stacking interaction which are influenced by various factors such as ph concentration temperature and the chemical composition of the adsorbent and adsorbate liu et al 2016a sahoo and hota 2018 3 11 field testing for validation of the developed adsorbent field testing was done using water samples collected from one of village of sonipat haryana fluoride concentration was found to be 5 2 mg l ph of 6 8 in collected samples adsorbent dose of 0 03 g was taken in 100 ml of collected water sample the samples were shaken for 120 min at room temperature after the adsorption experiment the concentration of fluoride was reduced to 0 06 mg l it reveals that the adsorbent is quite viable for the defluoridation in the area mentioned above even though the water sample was containing many other ions such as nitrate chloride sulfate etc 4 conclusion the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite having magnetic property was successfully synthesized simply by modifying the surface of iron oxide with rgo and humic acid using co precipitation and freeze drying process the synthesized composite was characterized by sem bet xrd ftir and tga to known the surface properties which are responsible for the favourable fluoride adsorption process the synthesized composite had a surface area of 455 62 m2 g and showed better results than other rgo or fe2o3 based adsorbents due to the presence of humic acid polymer the newly developed adsorbent is highly appropriate for purifying drinking water as it can maintain a ph value of 7 throughout the adsorption process additionally even a very small amount of this adsorbent can effectively remove fluoride at a 0 3 g l adsorbent dose and temperatures of 30 and 50 c the maximum fluoride removal capacity of rgo ha fe2o3 was found to be 376 46 and 395 32 mg g respectively the adsorption data fits best with the freundlich isotherm indicating a multilayer type of adsorption with an endothermic nature the kinetics data was best fitted by second order kinetic model the spent adsorbent was efficiently regenerated using a 0 1 m alkaline solution with a good efficiency rate of 83 1 for up to four cycles of reuse the exceptional magnetic properties of the rgo ha fe2o3 composite make it an extremely appealing option for practical fluoride adsorption applications the strong magnetic properties and high surface area of the composite allow for efficient and effective removal of fluoride from drinking water this feature significantly reduces the cost and time needed for purification and separation procedures making it a highly efficient and cost effective option for fluoride removal from water as a result the rgo ha fe2o3 composite is an ideal choice for large scale water treatment applications moreover in a short treatment duration the rgo ha fe2o3 oxide composite displayed a remarkable antibacterial response against gram negative bacteria such as e coli declaration of competing interest the authors declare

11633,despite the usage of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas since the 1940s concerns about their growing environmental issue have only been acknowledged lately these emerging contaminants pose detrimental risks to human health and the environment and research pertaining to this persistent organic pollutant has grown rapidly in recent years this review provides an overview of pfas research in asia and the occurrence of pfoa and pfos in the water media of southeast asia although the relationships between pfas research in asia with the total population and gdp in respective countries are inconclusive the lack of pfas research in asia is mainly due to the lack of funding from governments the findings on the occurrence of pfas in groundwater surface water and drinking water have been very limited until the turn of the century due to a lack of analytical procedures certain components of pfas such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulphonic acid pfos have been critically characterised but new components of pfas have yet to be fully studied the characteristics of pfas make it highly persistent non biodegradable and highly mobile in water the combination of these characteristics along with the toxicity and adverse health effects of pfas has made it a significant issue in groundwater and drinking water resources the acceptable level of pfoa in drinking water should not exceed 70 ng l as recommended by usepa despite limited pfas studies in selected countries in southeast asia this region is also threatened with pfas pollution as confirmed by publications that have detected the presence of pfas in water media including in drinking water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfas pfaas pfoa pfos emerging contaminants toxicity fate and transport asia data availability data will be made available on request acronyms gdp gross domestic produce pfas per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid pfos perfluorooctane sulfonic acid 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as pfas are a group of synthetic chemicals with oil and water repelling properties that have been used in various industries since the 1940s to date there are more than 1400 types of pfas neagu et al 2021 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulphonic acid pfos are per fluoroalkyl acids pfaas and the most studied compounds among pfas due to their toxicity and persistency in the environment and human body pfoa and pfos are listed in the stockholm convention as persistent organic pollutants in 2019 and 2009 respectively pinas et al 2020 significantly highlighting their threat to the environment since the 1980s pfas have been studied extensively by researchers around the world however the study of pfas in asia only picked up after the turn of the century since the studies conducted are scarce and non comprehensive references to such studies rare and difficult to come by due to the lack of systematically collated information thus this paper aimed to review the findings of existing research on pfas in asia by focusing on the presence in water media namely surface water drinking water and groundwater in order to fill the gaps in pfas related studies in asia 2 global issues and challenges in pfas research since the discovery of pfas understanding its toxicity and environmental impacts has been challenging this is because studies on the compounds and their toxicity were not prioritised when the global community was unaware of their detrimental impacts towards the environment besides monitoring these compounds was not possible without reliable and advanced detection technology thus it was not until two decades ago that pfas could be studied in detail after developing appropriate sampling and analytical methodologies as many countries race to develop guidelines and regulations to manage pfas fenton et al 2021 believed that governments around the world will need to address major data gaps before they can assess the toxicology of risks posed by pfas to protect public health in the united states of america the us epa has developed their drinking water guidelines for pfoa and pfos but these guidelines are based on references doses that have four fold ranges in values 8 35 ng l pfoa and 10 40 ng l pfos post 2021 as a result pfoa and pfos remain the most studied compounds of pfas the review by post 2021 suggested that more studies are required to focus on other pfas compounds besides pfoa and pfos the studies of pfas toxicology epidemiology have been closely related to endocrine functions the potential classification of pfas as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs will bring up another set of challenges for researchers la merrill et al 2020 identified a list of uncertainties related to the effects of pfas as edc such as their responses to different organs and cells as well as their latency periods however despite all the recent studies the understanding on how pfas disrupts the endocrine system is still incomplete which calls for further research braun 2017 the health impacts of pfas have not been fully characterised and understood and consistent and accurate conclusions on their effects are yet to be documented burman et al 2020 white et al 2011 and gore et al 2015 mentioned that comprehensive studies are required to understand the effects of pfas on various organs and cells within the endocrine system various models should also be used to understand the exposure of pfas and their detrimental effects on the endocrine system alofe et al 2019 the development of laboratory analytical methods has been a major challenge for pfas research throughout the years while there are more than 9000 known pfas chemicals laboratory methods have only been developed for the detection of 2 of them hagstrom et al 2021 hagstrom et al 2021 highlighted that methods published by the us epa only cover drinking water analysis and do not include methods for analysing other complex matrices such as serum or soil implying significant gaps in the research of pfas globally to compare with the rest of the world asia has often been associated with high levels of exposure to environmental pollution thus the region is also highly vulnerable to the detrimental impacts from pfas contamination 3 methodology this review consisted of two sections the first section focused on pfas research conducted in asia all articles related to pfas research from countries in asia that address topics such as the occurrence of pfas pfas effects on human plants and animals pfas characteristics chemistry and toxicology pfas in food chain and others were selected to be included in this study review articles on pfas research were excluded from this study the second section of this review focused on the occurrence of pfoa and pfos in groundwater surface water and coastal water in asia the review focused on pfoa and pfos as they are the two most studied compounds of pfas the occurrence of pfoa and pfos in water sources are the most common way for humans to ingest pfas therefore it is the main focus of this review the pfas research in asia was obtained through searches of sources such as science direct scopus and springer publications a total of 310 research articles were reviewed and information derived from the article was compiled and analysed for its relevance to the total population gross domestic products and the presence of pfoa and pfos in groundwater surface water and coastal water the reviewed articles used in this study ranged from 2005 to 2021 a schematic diagram of the methodology is presented in fig 1 4 overview on pfas research in asia asia consists of five regions namely east asia south asia southeast asia central asia and west asia with a total of 50 countries out of the 50 countries in asia 24 countries 48 have conducted research on pfas in their respective countries while the remaining 26 countries 52 have not conducted any research on pfas fig 1 presents the pfas research in asian countries based on the geographical location east asia dominated the landscape of pfas research in asia countries in east asia including china taiwan hong kong japan and south korea accounted for 82 3 of the total pfas research in asia this was followed by south asia and southeast asia which contributed to 6 1 each of the total pfas research in their respective regions west asia was closely behind with 5 2 of pfas research while central asia had the lowest contribution with only 0 3 of the total pfas research in asia in terms of country specific statistics china led by contributing more than half 52 6 of the total pfas research in asia this was followed by other east asian countries such as south korea 11 9 japan 8 7 taiwan 5 5 and hong kong 3 5 all other countries contributed less than 10 pfas research in their respective countries india contributed nine pfas research accounting for 2 9 of the total pfas research in asia while the remaining 18 countries contributed an average 0 8 fig 2 presents the country specific pfas research in asia from this data it was obvious that much research is yet to be conducted in asia including the urgent need for monitoring information and baseline studies 4 1 types of pfas research in asia pfas research conducted by asian countries covers a wide range of topics including the occurrence and distribution of pfas as well as their effects to human beings fig 3 presents the different types of pfas research conducted in asia research on the occurrence and distribution of pfas in the environment contributed to almost half 47 of the total pfas research conducted in asia these studies concluded that pfas was detected in almost all samples tested in asia including soil groundwater river water coastal water industrial wastewater and landfill leachate despite contributing to almost half of the total research on pfas in asia this area of research is still insufficient in providing adequate information for the healthy expansion of pfas studies without ample and accurate data a reliable database cannot be created which is essential for the development of advanced research in any sector the second most prominent pfas research in asia is the research on pfas effects on human being which contributed to 28 of the total pfas research in asia followed by research on its characteristics 7 its effects on plants 3 its presence in food source 3 and another research 4 this area of research is still inadequate given the urgency need to understand the impact of pfas on human health thus it is highly imperative that more research is conducted to gain a better understanding towards the impacts of pfas on human health 4 2 relationship of total population with pfas research in asia the relationship between the total population of asian countries and the total pfas research was reviewed fig 4 which indicated a low incident rate compared to the global research worldwide in relation to the population ratio table 1 the average publications per million of population in asia ranged from 0 0927 to 1 4673 implying the urgent need for more research in this area to ensure public safety and reduce health risks since the existing research has not even capture the real situation of pfas in asia a comprehensive understanding of environmental and health related issues cannot be properly established this may have negative implications in setting priority in policy and decision making since the situation is not fully understood and may be considered to be less serious than the actual condition china with a total population of 1 43 billion in 2020 led with 163 pfas research japan with a total population of 126 47 million contributed 27 pfas research however the relationship between the total population and pfas research was not conclusive for the remaining countries india was an apparent example with population at 1 38 billion but only contributed nine pfas research in the country south korea with a population of only 51 26 million contributed 37 pfas research the ratio of pfas publications per million of population revealed a slightly different picture as presented in table 1 hong kong had the highest ratio of pfas publications per million of population with south korea coming in the second place with almost half the ratio china which produced the most pfas research only ranked ninth and was behind other smaller developed countries such as south korea japan and singapore the absence of sufficient data in the area of research calls for immediate attention especially in densely populated areas since the release of pfas into the environment can have disastrous consequences a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour and distribution patterns of pfas will enable the prediction of its fate and prevent environmental disaster that can affect a large population history has proved that ignorance and neglect of such issues can lead to serious loss of life which could be seen in past incidents such as minamata disease and itai itai disease the total population of a region or country can have a significant impact on pfas research in several ways firstly a larger population can lead to a higher demand for consumer and industrial products that contain pfas resulting in increased production and use of these chemicals this can increase the potential for exposure to pfas and raise public awareness of the environmental and health impacts related to these chemicals secondly a larger population can also increase the demand for research into pfas and alternatives to pfas as more people are exposed to pfas and become concerned about their environmental and health impacts there may be greater political and public pressure to regulate and reduce the use of pfas this can result in increased investment in pfas research and the development of new regulations and policies which can reduce the use of pfas thirdly a larger population can make it harder for researchers to assess and study pfas in the environment for example in highly populated areas researchers may find it challenging to assess certain areas for sampling and testing or to gather data on the levels of pfas in the environment it is important to note that the relationship between population and pfas research is complex and depends on various factors including specific policies and regulations in place the level of public awareness and concern about pfas and the level of investment in alternative technologies however larger populations are likely to be associated with increased demand for pfas research and the development of more sustainable alternatives 4 3 relationship of gross domestic product gdp with pfas research in asia hypothetically financial constrain would be the major influencing factor that affects the research community in a country a strong financial capability in a country normally leads to healthy and progressive research and development activities the relationship between the gross domestic product gdp of asian countries and the total pfas research is illustrated in fig 5 china and japan showed a correlation between gdp and the total pfas research in their respective countries with china reporting a gdp of usd 14 3 billion and contributing 163 pfas research while japan reported a gdp of usd 5 1 billion and contributed 27 pfas research south korea reported a gdp of usd 1 6 billion and contributed 37 pfas research however countries like india and indonesia only contributed nine and three pfas research respectively despite reporting a gdp of usd 2 8 billion and usd 1 1 billion respectively nevertheless the statistics of pfas publications per billion gdp revealed a different picture among the twelve ranked countries in asia nepal afghanistan and hong kong claimed the first three ranks as shown in tables 2 and 3 based on table 2 china ranked twelfth while taiwan and south korea ranked fourth and sixth respectively japan failed to make the top twelve positions this explained two things firstly low gdp countries such as afghanistan jordan and uzbekistan received scientific funding from international organisations to conduct research on the occurrence of pfas in their respective countries secondly high gdp countries such as china taiwan hong kong south korea and japan have not invested sufficiently in scientific funding for pfas research despite leading in asia with the most pfas publications and research a country s gdp can directly impact pfas research by determining the level of funding available for scientific research and the level of investment in new technologies for example countries with higher gdps are likely to have more resources available for pfas research and alternatives to pfas this can lead to increased understanding of environmental and health impacts towards pfas as well as the development of new technologies that are safer and more sustainable in addition to direct impacts gdp can also indirectly impact pfas research by affecting the level of public and political attention given to pfas as along with other environmental issues for example in countries with high gdps there may be greater public awareness of environmental issues and greater political pressure to regulate and reduce the use of pfas this can lead to increased investment in pfas research as well as the development of new regulations and policies which aim to reduce the use of pfas it is important to note that the relationship between gdp and pfas research is complex and depends on a number of factors including specific policies and regulations in place the level of public awareness and concern about pfas and the level of investment in alternative technologies however higher gdps are likely to be associated with increased investment in pfas research and the development of more sustainable alternatives regardless of the limitations faced by many countries in asia the existing research on pfas is crucially important to comprehend the threat and risk posed by these chemicals the consecutive sections discussed the presence of pfas in water media in asia 5 pfoa and pfos research in asia s water the presence of pfas in groundwater can create significant health issues for people who rely on groundwater for drinking purposes studies have indicated these chemicals can migrate both vertically and horizontally in the aquifer and sediment samples collected from three different locations downstream from firefighting and training facilities were found to contain pfos concentrations between 35 ng g and 88 ng g respectively kärrman et al 2011 the authors concluded that the environment in and around these facilities is highly contaminated with pfas especially pfos in 2016 us environmental protection agency us epa issued drinking water health advisories for pfoa and pfos at 70 ng l each or for both compounds pontius 2019 moving beyond asia it is worth noting that pfas presence in groundwater has also been reported in other parts of the world for instance in france boiteux et al 2012 reported that pfas presence has been more frequently detected in groundwater than surface water since 2012 in usa a study of untreated drinking water sources in new jersey reported that pfoa was the most frequent component of pfas detected bureau of safe drinking water 2014 both surface water and groundwater resources were collected for drinking water with surface water reporting more pfoa compared to groundwater hu et al 2016 conducted a study on pfas presence in the united states and concluded that pfas detection in drinking water sourced from groundwater was twice as frequent as in surface water in the next section pfas occurrences in asia would be discussed based on three categories of water bodies namely groundwater surface water as well as coastal and seawater the range of pfoa and pfos results which was related to the number of sampling location would also be presented 5 1 occurrence in groundwater research on pfas in groundwater has been conducted in five countries in asia namely china south korea vietnam thailand and india among these countries china particularly in changshu reported the highest pfoa concentration in groundwater at 475 ng l with the source from wastewater discharged by changshu fluorochemical industrial park chen et al 2016 out of 29 sampling locations 4 of them reported pfoa concentrations to be exceeded the us epa drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l which could be seen in fig 6 meanwhile in hubei province china the highest pfos concentration in groundwater was reported at 844 ng l among 24 sampling locations according to gao et al 2019 the source of contaminants at this sampling location was from a pfsa manufacturing facility 4 out of 24 sampling locations reported pfos concentrations exceeding 70 ng l fig 6 based on the reviews of collated studies in asia china reported the highest concentration of pfoa and pfos in its groundwater samples which exceeded the limit allowed by us epa drinking water health advisory 5 2 occurrence in surface water pfas research in asia s surface water bodies was more common compared to groundwater with china leading the way besides china 11 other countries conducted pfas research in surface water bodies based on fig 7 majority of the pfoa and pfos concentrations in various sampling locations were reported to be below the drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l 28 sampling locations reported pfoa concentrations above the advisory level whereas 14 sampling locations reported pfos level above 70 ng l the detection of pfoa and pfos in surface water showed that industrial effluent containing pfas substances were released into surface water prior to treatment the xiaoqing river in china which receives wastewater from a fluoropolymer manufacturer reported an exceptionally high pfoa concentration of 320 000 ng l joerss et al 2020 l meng et al 2021 the highest pfos results among studies conducted in china were reported at the pingshan river at 598 66 ng l an et al 2021 the contamination of pfos at these sites was contributed by effluent from nearby automobile plants aside from sampling data from china most countries reported the presence of pfoa and pfo to be below 570 ng l however in the katsura river at yodo river basin in japan pfoa was recorded at 2568 ng l lien et al 2008 lien et al 2008 suggested that the main source of pfoa is discharges of effluent from a sewage treatment plant into the katsura river in taiwan pfos concentrations of 6050 ng l were reported downstream of the effluent discharge point to the receiving nanmen river lin et al 2010 the high pfos concentration at this sampling location was mainly due to the input from an industrial wastewater treatment plant that is located in the hsinchu science park lin et al 2010 5 3 occurrence in coastal and seawater in comparison with surface water there have been less studies carried out on coastal and seawater fig 8 however significant pfoa impact was found at laizhou bay in the bohai sea china with concentrations at 591 7 ng l l meng et al 2021 laizhou bay which is located near the xiaoqing river estuary receives effluent from a fluoropolymer manufacturer joerss et al 2020 y meng et al 2021 leading to high accumulation of pfoa and its compounds in the water on the other hand pfos concentrations of 450 ng l were reported in the asan reservoir which is located in an industrial area of south korea naile et al 2010 6 conclusion and recommendations the research of pfas in asia began after the year of 2000 and has since increased especially in east asia this demonstrates a heightened awareness and interest in pfas in this region compared to the rest of asia however pfas research in asia is still in its early stages and most studies focus on the occurrence and distribution of pfas in the environment it is crucial for countries in east asia to move towards research on other pfas related topics such as removal and remediation while the rest of asian countries should start with studying the occurrence of pfas in their environment and step up their pfas research efforts the relationship between total population and gdp of asian countries with the total of pfas research is inconclusive although halpenny et al 2010 mentioned using gdp is more meaningful in their research it may not be fully accurate in the case of pfas publications some high ranking countries with fewer pfas research received foreign research funds such as nepal tan et al 2014 afghanistan hemat et al 2010 bahrain bersuder et al 2020 jordan shigei et al 2020 s ri lanka guruge et al 2005 2008 uzbekistan hanssen et al 2013 and bangladesh habibullah al mamun et al 2016 2017 the lack of pfas research in asia is mainly due to the high cost of pfas laboratory analysis and the insufficient funding from the government based on the published pfas research in asia pfoa and pfos concentrations have been reported in groundwater surface water and coastal seawater in asian countries most of the concentrations were reported to be below us epa drinking water limits the detected pfoa and pfos concentrations were mostly traced back to pfas manufacturing facilities discharge of industrial effluent containing untreated pfas had contaminated surface water and eventually channeled to coastal waters the presence of pfas in water environment negatively impacted aquatic organisms regardless of concentration bioaccumulation of pfas in aquatic creatures poses potential health concerns for end consumers which are humans thus it is crucial to study the source migration pathway and ways to prevent pfas from releasing into water environment the challenges of pfas research in asia are slightly different from those faced by developed countries the lack of awareness and interest among researchers in asia regarding pfas issues is a major reason for the lack of pfas research in asia despite most asian countries had ratified the stockholm convention the awareness of pfas issues in the general population remains low thus leading to a lack of interest in researching the topic although laboratory analytical methods have been developed for around 200 pfas substances many laboratories in asia have not yet established methods for pfas analysis chemical analyses of pfas compounds are mostly conducted in universities and academic institutions the lack of local commercial laboratories has been a challenge for private sectors to conduct pfas studies on their facilities due to the elevated cost of sample shipment to overseas laboratories governments in asian countries will have a vital role in creating awareness among both public and academics as well as in promoting more pfas research in their respective countries although it may take several years to implement regulations regarding pfas it is crucial for asian countries to take proactive steps in studying detecting and gathering information on the potential widespread contamination of pfas compounds several recommendations were proposed in this study to increase the quantity and quality of pfas research in asia firstly the government in respective countries in asia should promote the awareness of pfas contamination effects and preventive measures besides increased research funding should be allocated to include studies on the occurrence of pfas their effects on human and ecological health as well as development of effective remediation technologies lastly the creation and participation of a regional pfas working group would be beneficial for asia to advance their knowledge and technology on pfas research working closely with counterparts in europe and america will facilitate knowledge and technology transfer as well as the sharing of regulatory frameworks

asia followed by research on its characteristics 7 its effects on plants 3 its presence in food source 3 and another research 4 this area of research is still inadequate given the urgency need to understand the impact of pfas on human health thus it is highly imperative that more research is conducted to gain a better understanding towards the impacts of pfas on human health 4 2 relationship of total population with pfas research in asia the relationship between the total population of asian countries and the total pfas research was reviewed fig 4 which indicated a low incident rate compared to the global research worldwide in relation to the population ratio table 1 the average publications per million of population in asia ranged from 0 0927 to 1 4673 implying the urgent need for more research in this area to ensure public safety and reduce health risks since the existing research has not even capture the real situation of pfas in asia a comprehensive understanding of environmental and health related issues cannot be properly established this may have negative implications in setting priority in policy and decision making since the situation is not fully understood and may be considered to be less serious than the actual condition china with a total population of 1 43 billion in 2020 led with 163 pfas research japan with a total population of 126 47 million contributed 27 pfas research however the relationship between the total population and pfas research was not conclusive for the remaining countries india was an apparent example with population at 1 38 billion but only contributed nine pfas research in the country south korea with a population of only 51 26 million contributed 37 pfas research the ratio of pfas publications per million of population revealed a slightly different picture as presented in table 1 hong kong had the highest ratio of pfas publications per million of population with south korea coming in the second place with almost half the ratio china which produced the most pfas research only ranked ninth and was behind other smaller developed countries such as south korea japan and singapore the absence of sufficient data in the area of research calls for immediate attention especially in densely populated areas since the release of pfas into the environment can have disastrous consequences a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour and distribution patterns of pfas will enable the prediction of its fate and prevent environmental disaster that can affect a large population history has proved that ignorance and neglect of such issues can lead to serious loss of life which could be seen in past incidents such as minamata disease and itai itai disease the total population of a region or country can have a significant impact on pfas research in several ways firstly a larger population can lead to a higher demand for consumer and industrial products that contain pfas resulting in increased production and use of these chemicals this can increase the potential for exposure to pfas and raise public awareness of the environmental and health impacts related to these chemicals secondly a larger population can also increase the demand for research into pfas and alternatives to pfas as more people are exposed to pfas and become concerned about their environmental and health impacts there may be greater political and public pressure to regulate and reduce the use of pfas this can result in increased investment in pfas research and the development of new regulations and policies which can reduce the use of pfas thirdly a larger population can make it harder for researchers to assess and study pfas in the environment for example in highly populated areas researchers may find it challenging to assess certain areas for sampling and testing or to gather data on the levels of pfas in the environment it is important to note that the relationship between population and pfas research is complex and depends on various factors including specific policies and regulations in place the level of public awareness and concern about pfas and the level of investment in alternative technologies however larger populations are likely to be associated with increased demand for pfas research and the development of more sustainable alternatives 4 3 relationship of gross domestic product gdp with pfas research in asia hypothetically financial constrain would be the major influencing factor that affects the research community in a country a strong financial capability in a country normally leads to healthy and progressive research and development activities the relationship between the gross domestic product gdp of asian countries and the total pfas research is illustrated in fig 5 china and japan showed a correlation between gdp and the total pfas research in their respective countries with china reporting a gdp of usd 14 3 billion and contributing 163 pfas research while japan reported a gdp of usd 5 1 billion and contributed 27 pfas research south korea reported a gdp of usd 1 6 billion and contributed 37 pfas research however countries like india and indonesia only contributed nine and three pfas research respectively despite reporting a gdp of usd 2 8 billion and usd 1 1 billion respectively nevertheless the statistics of pfas publications per billion gdp revealed a different picture among the twelve ranked countries in asia nepal afghanistan and hong kong claimed the first three ranks as shown in tables 2 and 3 based on table 2 china ranked twelfth while taiwan and south korea ranked fourth and sixth respectively japan failed to make the top twelve positions this explained two things firstly low gdp countries such as afghanistan jordan and uzbekistan received scientific funding from international organisations to conduct research on the occurrence of pfas in their respective countries secondly high gdp countries such as china taiwan hong kong south korea and japan have not invested sufficiently in scientific funding for pfas research despite leading in asia with the most pfas publications and research a country s gdp can directly impact pfas research by determining the level of funding available for scientific research and the level of investment in new technologies for example countries with higher gdps are likely to have more resources available for pfas research and alternatives to pfas this can lead to increased understanding of environmental and health impacts towards pfas as well as the development of new technologies that are safer and more sustainable in addition to direct impacts gdp can also indirectly impact pfas research by affecting the level of public and political attention given to pfas as along with other environmental issues for example in countries with high gdps there may be greater public awareness of environmental issues and greater political pressure to regulate and reduce the use of pfas this can lead to increased investment in pfas research as well as the development of new regulations and policies which aim to reduce the use of pfas it is important to note that the relationship between gdp and pfas research is complex and depends on a number of factors including specific policies and regulations in place the level of public awareness and concern about pfas and the level of investment in alternative technologies however higher gdps are likely to be associated with increased investment in pfas research and the development of more sustainable alternatives regardless of the limitations faced by many countries in asia the existing research on pfas is crucially important to comprehend the threat and risk posed by these chemicals the consecutive sections discussed the presence of pfas in water media in asia 5 pfoa and pfos research in asia s water the presence of pfas in groundwater can create significant health issues for people who rely on groundwater for drinking purposes studies have indicated these chemicals can migrate both vertically and horizontally in the aquifer and sediment samples collected from three different locations downstream from firefighting and training facilities were found to contain pfos concentrations between 35 ng g and 88 ng g respectively kärrman et al 2011 the authors concluded that the environment in and around these facilities is highly contaminated with pfas especially pfos in 2016 us environmental protection agency us epa issued drinking water health advisories for pfoa and pfos at 70 ng l each or for both compounds pontius 2019 moving beyond asia it is worth noting that pfas presence in groundwater has also been reported in other parts of the world for instance in france boiteux et al 2012 reported that pfas presence has been more frequently detected in groundwater than surface water since 2012 in usa a study of untreated drinking water sources in new jersey reported that pfoa was the most frequent component of pfas detected bureau of safe drinking water 2014 both surface water and groundwater resources were collected for drinking water with surface water reporting more pfoa compared to groundwater hu et al 2016 conducted a study on pfas presence in the united states and concluded that pfas detection in drinking water sourced from groundwater was twice as frequent as in surface water in the next section pfas occurrences in asia would be discussed based on three categories of water bodies namely groundwater surface water as well as coastal and seawater the range of pfoa and pfos results which was related to the number of sampling location would also be presented 5 1 occurrence in groundwater research on pfas in groundwater has been conducted in five countries in asia namely china south korea vietnam thailand and india among these countries china particularly in changshu reported the highest pfoa concentration in groundwater at 475 ng l with the source from wastewater discharged by changshu fluorochemical industrial park chen et al 2016 out of 29 sampling locations 4 of them reported pfoa concentrations to be exceeded the us epa drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l which could be seen in fig 6 meanwhile in hubei province china the highest pfos concentration in groundwater was reported at 844 ng l among 24 sampling locations according to gao et al 2019 the source of contaminants at this sampling location was from a pfsa manufacturing facility 4 out of 24 sampling locations reported pfos concentrations exceeding 70 ng l fig 6 based on the reviews of collated studies in asia china reported the highest concentration of pfoa and pfos in its groundwater samples which exceeded the limit allowed by us epa drinking water health advisory 5 2 occurrence in surface water pfas research in asia s surface water bodies was more common compared to groundwater with china leading the way besides china 11 other countries conducted pfas research in surface water bodies based on fig 7 majority of the pfoa and pfos concentrations in various sampling locations were reported to be below the drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng l 28 sampling locations reported pfoa concentrations above the advisory level whereas 14 sampling locations reported pfos level above 70 ng l the detection of pfoa and pfos in surface water showed that industrial effluent containing pfas substances were released into surface water prior to treatment the xiaoqing river in china which receives wastewater from a fluoropolymer manufacturer reported an exceptionally high pfoa concentration of 320 000 ng l joerss et al 2020 l meng et al 2021 the highest pfos results among studies conducted in china were reported at the pingshan river at 598 66 ng l an et al 2021 the contamination of pfos at these sites was contributed by effluent from nearby automobile plants aside from sampling data from china most countries reported the presence of pfoa and pfo to be below 570 ng l however in the katsura river at yodo river basin in japan pfoa was recorded at 2568 ng l lien et al 2008 lien et al 2008 suggested that the main source of pfoa is discharges of effluent from a sewage treatment plant into the katsura river in taiwan pfos concentrations of 6050 ng l were reported downstream of the effluent discharge point to the receiving nanmen river lin et al 2010 the high pfos concentration at this sampling location was mainly due to the input from an industrial wastewater treatment plant that is located in the hsinchu science park lin et al 2010 5 3 occurrence in coastal and seawater in comparison with surface water there have been less studies carried out on coastal and seawater fig 8 however significant pfoa impact was found at laizhou bay in the bohai sea china with concentrations at 591 7 ng l l meng et al 2021 laizhou bay which is located near the xiaoqing river estuary receives effluent from a fluoropolymer manufacturer joerss et al 2020 y meng et al 2021 leading to high accumulation of pfoa and its compounds in the water on the other hand pfos concentrations of 450 ng l were reported in the asan reservoir which is located in an industrial area of south korea naile et al 2010 6 conclusion and recommendations the research of pfas in asia began after the year of 2000 and has since increased especially in east asia this demonstrates a heightened awareness and interest in pfas in this region compared to the rest of asia however pfas research in asia is still in its early stages and most studies focus on the occurrence and distribution of pfas in the environment it is crucial for countries in east asia to move towards research on other pfas related topics such as removal and remediation while the rest of asian countries should start with studying the occurrence of pfas in their environment and step up their pfas research efforts the relationship between total population and gdp of asian countries with the total of pfas research is inconclusive although halpenny et al 2010 mentioned using gdp is more meaningful in their research it may not be fully accurate in the case of pfas publications some high ranking countries with fewer pfas research received foreign research funds such as nepal tan et al 2014 afghanistan hemat et al 2010 bahrain bersuder et al 2020 jordan shigei et al 2020 s ri lanka guruge et al 2005 2008 uzbekistan hanssen et al 2013 and bangladesh habibullah al mamun et al 2016 2017 the lack of pfas research in asia is mainly due to the high cost of pfas laboratory analysis and the insufficient funding from the government based on the published pfas research in asia pfoa and pfos concentrations have been reported in groundwater surface water and coastal seawater in asian countries most of the concentrations were reported to be below us epa drinking water limits the detected pfoa and pfos concentrations were mostly traced back to pfas manufacturing facilities discharge of industrial effluent containing untreated pfas had contaminated surface water and eventually channeled to coastal waters the presence of pfas in water environment negatively impacted aquatic organisms regardless of concentration bioaccumulation of pfas in aquatic creatures poses potential health concerns for end consumers which are humans thus it is crucial to study the source migration pathway and ways to prevent pfas from releasing into water environment the challenges of pfas research in asia are slightly different from those faced by developed countries the lack of awareness and interest among researchers in asia regarding pfas issues is a major reason for the lack of pfas research in asia despite most asian countries had ratified the stockholm convention the awareness of pfas issues in the general population remains low thus leading to a lack of interest in researching the topic although laboratory analytical methods have been developed for around 200 pfas substances many laboratories in asia have not yet established methods for pfas analysis chemical analyses of pfas compounds are mostly conducted in universities and academic institutions the lack of local commercial laboratories has been a challenge for private sectors to conduct pfas studies on their facilities due to the elevated cost of sample shipment to overseas laboratories governments in asian countries will have a vital role in creating awareness among both public and academics as well as in promoting more pfas research in their respective countries although it may take several years to implement regulations regarding pfas it is crucial for asian countries to take proactive steps in studying detecting and gathering information on the potential widespread contamination of pfas compounds several recommendations were proposed in this study to increase the quantity and quality of pfas research in asia firstly the government in respective countries in asia should promote the awareness of pfas contamination effects and preventive measures besides increased research funding should be allocated to include studies on the occurrence of pfas their effects on human and ecological health as well as development of effective remediation technologies lastly the creation and participation of a regional pfas working group would be beneficial for asia to advance their knowledge and technology on pfas research working closely with counterparts in europe and america will facilitate knowledge and technology transfer as well as the sharing of regulatory frameworks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this

11634,groundwater pollution is a major environmental concern and may persist under diverse ecological conditions this study describes the seasonal impacts on pollution characteristics coupled with the degree of human health risks in groundwater for this purpose a highly populated city of pakistan lahore was planned and about 50 groundwater samples were collected during the summer and winter seasons in 2021 and 2022 various physiochemical parameters ph ec tds and hardness cations anions and toxic metals as cd co cr mn ni and pb were analyzed to evaluate the seasonal impacts on the groundwater quality besides a monte carlo simulation model and sensitivity analysis were performed to obtain a high level accuracy in cancer risk estimation results revealed that physiochemical parameters cations

cd and ni has exceeded from safer limits consequently winter season was perceived more sensitive owing to the substantial increase of pollutants proclamation in groundwater and posturing a serious threat to humans hence instant remedial actions are suggested to ensure safe drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal toxicity water quality multivariate analysis health risk hazard

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is considered as an outstanding natural resource that plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem in both residential and commercial sectors shah et al 2012 groundwater quality is mainly affected by geochemical cycles and various anthropogenic activities including mining sewage disposal and other agro industrial operations are overwhelmed kadam et al 2021 however seasonal fluctuations wind rain and precipitation are accounted for the significant factor that alter the groundwater quality subba rao et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2016 thus it is essential to evaluate the effect of seasonal fluctuations on the quality of groundwater for its beneficial usage in densely populated and water deficient regions ashraf et al 2021 heavy metals hms are natural components of the earth s crust and a class of inorganic contaminants that have risen to prominence as primary toxicants due to their increased solubility in water heavy metals in groundwater are harmful to human health because of their unique properties such as toxicity biodegradability and biochemistry altaf et al 2021 a few heavy metals disrupt human metabolism by interfering with enzymes and protein components teng et al 2022 these heavy metals persist in the water and are absorbed by the human body through a variety of mechanisms including direct ingestion and dermal contact mouth eyes and nose aslam et al 2022 the health risk evaluation of a specific residential area by consuming polluted water is based on an assumption carcinogenic or non carcinogenic altaf et al 2020 therefore drinking water quality assessment is essential prior to its administration the chemical study of groundwater is critical in hydrological investigations groundwater contamination caused by heavy metals is now a major concern globally especially in pakistan according to previous research as ca mg co ni pb cd cr mn cu cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 are the most prominent compounds observed in pakistani groundwater razzaq et al 2022 hussain et al 2019 murtaza et al 2020 khan et al 2021a heavy metal concentrations in water have been linked to a variety of disorders including abdominal pain heart disease immune system dysfunction high blood pressure liver and kidney damage ur rehman et al 2022 as a result various researchers throughout the world perform studies to determine the risk to human health from drinking contaminated water tripathee et al 2016 jehan et al 2019 2020 nkpaa et al 2018 tabassum et al 2019 in general the uncertainty of the environment and the inability of global leaders to make decisions have resulted in tough situations in developing nations such as pakistan the decline in precipitation rate has an effect on the protection of freshwater resources zhu et al 2019 pak epa pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa 2010 indicates that heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater of punjab s major metropolitan areas are high razzaq et al 2022 in lahore the provincial capital of punjab groundwater recharge has decreased because of high rates of groundwater abstraction water is a good solvent due to its strong hydrogen bonding and polarity which allow it to dissolve a wide variety of bacterial and natural substances consequently natural water is always contaminated by biological and anthropogenic activities above and below the surface batool et al 2019 this study was designed to identify heavy metals in various regions of the city and assess water quality in both seasons using drinking water quality indices dwqi heavy metal evaluation indices hmei potential ecological risk index peri and pollution load index pli these methods were widely used in the previous study and were quite useful in determining groundwater quality indices nkpaa et al 2018 zakir et al 2020 wu et al 2020 varol and davraz 2015 some studies just provide the health risk as a single number ignoring uncertainty the following outcomes were derived from input variables body weight consumption rate etc without knowledge of the correlation and contribution of each assumption consequently this paper uses probabilistic risk assessment which is more refined and precise than the health risk assessment approach employed over the past few decades the monte carlo simulation mcs model investigates the distribution of a variable by simulating random numbers actual conditions and accompanying risk analysis results are shown through site specific data from questionnaires and interviews the purpose of this study was to 1 examine groundwater quality 2 assess the health risk of heavy metals exposure in groundwater through ingestion and dermal adsorption and 3 use monte carlo simulation to determine the probability of non cancer and cancer risks and the main influencing factors this research is important for improving and evaluating water protection policies as well as estimating the prevalence of serious cancer and noncancer related health concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 the geographic location of sampling sites lahore is located between 31 15 31 45 n latitude and 74 01 74 39 e longitude it is bordered to the north by sheikhupura to the east by the wagah border india and to the south by kasur ashraf et al 2021 the ravi river flows on the northern side forming an administrative border between shahdara and lahore lahore is a semitropical lowland with a droughty climate temperature and precipitation rates varied seasonally reducing rainfall in lahore the temperature can reach 40 c in the summer and 5 c in the winter groundwater recharge might reach 40 mm with 75 annual precipitation after monsoon periods khan et al 2021b several studies have demonstrated that different alloy deposits make lahore s aquifers more sloppy unclean and projecting khan et al 2021b despite this the city s water requirements are being met by the river ravi which is currently in a declining condition due to the low rainfall a total of 47 of the city s overall usage was made up of untreated municipal and industrial wastewater akhtar and zhonghua 2013 the water and sanitation authority wasa in lahore has installed over 500 tube wells with depths ranging from 120 to 245 m to supply water and has tested the chemical physical and bacterial qualities of groundwater to ensure access to safe drinking water basharat and rizvi 2013 in recent years the degradation of groundwater class has caused major health problems in surrounding areas private associations or industries or government officials meet domestic and industrial water demand by pumping groundwater khan et al 2021b 2 2 collection of groundwater samples and analysis 50 groundwater samples were collected from various urban areas of lahore during the summer september 2021 and winter december 2021 fig 1 represents the geological location of collecting groundwater all samples were collected from the tube wells established in these regions in acid washed polyethylene bottles to avoid precipitation and metal adsorption in the bottle acidify the sample the samples are transported to the chemical laboratory in a refrigerator processed within one day and stored at 4 c for further examination an atomic adsorption spectrometer is used to protect and evaluate heavy metals according to the procedures outlined in the american public health association apha23rd edition rice 2017 aa240 ph ecs and tds were calculated immediately upon collection the hardness of water was determined using ca and mg which were measured titrimetrically with a na2 edta solution the amount of na and k measured using a flame emission spectrometer jenway singh s spectrophotometric method buurman et al 1996 was used to determine chloride carbonate bicarbonate sulphate and phosphate for heavy metal assessment using aas the apparatus is run with blank samples each metal is measured in triplicate and the metal concentration is determined via a calibration curve 2 3 water quality and pollution indices the contamination level in drinking water due to heavy metals was determined by using pli dwqi hmei and peri the valuation of water quality due to these parameters is classified according to the values given in table s1 2 3 1 pollution load index pli the pollution load index pli was used to assess the heavy metals pollution in groundwater by using equation 1 1 p l i c f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f n 1 n where c f represents the contamination factor of heavy metal the c f is the ratio obtained by dividing the concentration of each metal in the groundwater by the standard value and it can be calculated by using equation 2 2 c f c s where c and s represent the mean heavy metals concentration and standard values of that metal given in table 1 in groundwater respectively 2 3 2 drinking water quality index dwqi dwqi was calculated via sener s method şener et al 2017 which gives the suitability of water sources for drinking purposes 17 parameters are used to find out the dwqi hardness co3 and hco3 were omitted due to the absence of standard values step i relative weight w i was determined by

for single and multi element set by usepa us epa 2011 2 4 4 monte carlo simulation mcs the monte carlo simulation method is a probabilistic simulation method that is widely used in parameter selection for risk uncertainty analysis and risk assessment the procedure uses the definitions of the variables to make assumptions fig 8 out a probabilistic model of the chosen parameters chooses the cells for the prediction and uses the results of several random simulation experiments as a rough solution to the problem to get the value risky mesa frias et al 2013 uncertainty in health risk assessment is mostly caused by exposure characteristics such body weight consumption and skin surface area and the variation in pollutant concentrations between research areas and the model selection these factors influence the calculation of the actual risk value to varying degrees resulting in uncertainties in the health risk assessment chen and liao 2006 oracle s crystal ball 11 1 2 4 software for a monte carlo simulation is used which uses the probability distribution of each parameter to calculate estimate the frequency of non carcinogenic risk assessments for the stability of the test results variable independent runs are performed at 10 000 iterations where each variable randomly chooses values shown in table s3 which based on their distribution function to estimate non cancer risk 2 5 analytical quality assurance crm certified reference material analysis data for various cations and heavy metals is shown in table 1 the concentration values of the certified reference material were used to assess the acceptability of the quality and analytical data crm all analytical data that fell within the crm material s acceptability ranges were deemed valid these metals were quantified in each sample by atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu aa 670 japan under optimum analytical conditions by employing calibration line procedure freshly prepared working standards of the metals by successive dilutions of 1000 mg l stock solution were used for the metal analyses any possible contamination while processing preserving the samples was determined by analyzing the reagent blanks triplicate measurements were made for all the samples and blanks 2 6 statistical analysis spss 2 0 ibm armonk usa was used for statistical data analysis excel 2018 was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation the pearson coefficient method with a significance level of 0 05 was calculated to assess ca among physiochemical and heavy metals pca principal component analysis is used to identify potential sources of heavy metals in water the bs bartlet sphericity and kmo kaiser meyer olkin tests extract essential pcs and assess the data s applicability using pca normalized variables the heavy metals are divided into several sets to understand the distribution of heavy metals by gathering full information about the data set and discovering similarities and differences using origin

measurements were collected for this study this study was approved by the responders as well as the university s health research ethics committee all responders are locals who have lived in the vicinity of the collection site for at least a year the questionnaires were utilized for this study which is detailed in the supplementary data 3 3 result and discussion 3 1 3 1 physiochemical parameters of groundwater groundwater quality was assessed using who who guideline for drinking water quality 2011 and pak epa pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa 2010 standards and statistical data is shown in table 2 in the summer ph values ranged from 6 54 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 29 while in the winter ph values ranged from 6 85 to 8 71 with a mean value of 7 70 the measured ph levels have been found to be within the who and pak epa limits in comparison only 6 of winter samples exceeded the allowed limit indicating the alkaline character of the water the ph values in this study slightly deviate from those in a previous study conducted by khan in the same region khan et al 2021b in which the mean ph values in summer and winter are 7 92 and 8 03 respectively most studies conducted in distinct cultures of this region such as bangladesh huq et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 india gaikwad et al 2020 tirkey et al 2017 china altaf et al 2021 tabassum et al 2019 and indonesia mallongi et al 2022 have the same ph range electrical conductivity ecs values ranged from 1 01 ms cm to 1 91 ms cm with a mean value of 1 40 ms cm in summer while it ranged from 1 14 ms cm to 1 98 ms cm with mean value of 1 60 ms cm in winter which were found within the permissible range the ecs values are relatively low with the previous study conduct in the same area whose mean ecs values are 6 70 and 15 46 in summer and winter respectively khan et al 2021b while ecs values resembles with the other study conduct in bangladesh huq et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 similarly the tds values ranged from 249 mg l to 946 mg l with mean value of 495 mg l in summer while it ranged from 294 mg l to 994 mg l with mean value

results to those of a recent study khan et al 2021b conducted on ground water samples from the city of lahore the physiochemical parameters showed a consistent trend overall the physiochemical characteristics of lahore city ground water samples were within the permissible limits specified by pak epa and who 3 2 3 2 cations and anions distribution the distribution of various cations and anions in ground water samples collected from different areas of lahore city were shown in table 2 in summer the mean concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k were found at 44 mg l 27 98 mg l 15 33 mg l and 2 90 mg l respectively while in winter the corresponding values were 29 mg l 19 78 mg l 14 64 mg l and 2 76 mg l respectively in comparison with the reported cations level in the groundwater of other cities of pakistan table s4 present mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k were found to be considerably lower than those reported from lahore jalees et al 2021 kasur tariq et al 2008 and gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 while present mean concentration of ca2 and mg2 were found high than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 present mean concentration of na and k were found lower than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while comparison with the reported cations level in the groundwater of other parts of world table s4 present mean concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k were found considerably lower than those reported from india sharma et al 2019 china zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 and ethiopia karuppannan and kawo 2019 while present mean concentration of ca and mg were lower than previous study conduct in india gaikwad et al 2020 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 while the mean concentration of cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 were found 44 mg l 151 mg l 157 mg l and 158 mg l respectively in summer and the corresponding values were 27 mg l 143 mg l 144 mg l and 141 mg l respectively in winter it has been found that all cations and anions values were found within the limit given by who and pak epa in comparison with the reported anions level in the groundwater of other cities of pakistan table s4 present mean concentration of cl so₄2 and hco3 were found considerably lower than those reported level from lahore in winter khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while mean co3 concentration is high from reported from lahore jalees et al 2021 and low from reported study conduct in hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while comparison with the reported anions level in the groundwater of other parts of world table s4 present mean concentration of cl and so₄2 were found to be significantly lower than the reported study conducts in india sharma et al 2019 china gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 while present mean concentration of cl and so₄2 were found to be much higher than those reported values from india gaikwad et al 2020 bangladesh

those reported values from bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 china zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 and ethiopia karuppannan and kawo 2019 while hco3 concentration considerably high than those reported study conduct in india gaikwad et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 seasonal comparison the concentrations of all main cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 in groundwater samples were higher in summer than in winter the greatly increased contributions of cations in summer can be attributed to sewage leaks into groundwater through soil during the monsoon season due to high rainfall and urban run off while soil works as a natural filter to remove pollutants through adsorption continuous and extended wastewater discharge can cause soil saturation which limits soil adsorption and filtering capacity resulting in soil deterioration and poor groundwater quality huq et al 2019 the results of this research were consistent with earlier studies conducted in this region khan et al 2021b bodrud doza et al 2020 the spatial variation of cations and anions is shown in fig 2 in summer high concentrations of ca and mg were found in water samples collected in the densely populated north and northeast part of lahore city during winter however relatively high mg concentrations were observed in the northern and central areas which is oldest part of the city while relatively low and consistent ca concentrations were found in winter groundwater samples conversely much higher na levels in summer were observed in samples taken from the south of the city where most of the excavation and new construction took place however na levels mainly showed higher differences in winter samples collected from central and southern parts of the city elevated k concentrations were found in water samples collected from densely populated areas inner cities in the central and northern parts of the city in summer while in winter the k concentrations were relatively low and consistent in groundwater samples collected from western and northern areas of the city the concentrations of cl and so₄2 were higher in summer while the concentrations of the two anions were higher in winter in the eastern and northern areas of the city during summer higher concentrations of co3 and hco3 were found in groundwater samples taken from the central areas of the city which are very densely populated areas of the city while hco3 concentrations in groundwater samples collected from northern and central regions were higher in winter the co3 concentrations in groundwater samples were relatively low and consistent during winter as shown in fig 2 3 3 3 3 heavy metal concentration in groundwater groundwater is contaminated with heavy metals through various human activities such as chemicals in agricultural and industrial and municipal wastes enters in water bodies without proper treatment these heavy metals are very important for the human body in small amounts but high concentrations cause water pollution and human health risks heavy metal data found in groundwater samples collected from a different area of lahore city is shown in table 2 and spatial variation of these heavy metals of various locations is shown in fig 3 the mean concentration of as was 0 036 mg l in summer and 0 076 mg l in winter which is higher from permissible limit given by who and pak epa almost 100 samples in both seasons have higher as concentration present mean concentration of as in summer and winter was found high than those reported level from kasur ashraf et al 2021 india kumar 2022 bangladesh 41 and china xiao et al 2020 gu et al 2020 as concentration level is high in this region due to dry oxidizing environment

reported study conduct in gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 india sharma et al 2019 and china gu et al 2020 while mean concentration of co was found very low than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and kasur ashraf et al 2021 tariq et al 2008 the high co concentration is due to the burning of fossil fuels the mean concentration of cr was 0 033 mg l and 0 042 mg l in summer and winter respectively 26 samples in summer and 38 samples in winter have higher cr concentration than the permissible limit given by who comparing this study result the mean concentration of cr was found very low than the reported study conducts in lahore jalees et al 2021 kasur ashraf et al 2021 tariq et al 2008 gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 and india shankar 2019 sharma et al 2019 while this study result

corrosive pipeline environments will also add cr to drinking water high concentrations can cause many health problems tumor formation weakness immune system congenital disabilities and respiratory system problems khan et al 2015 cu mean concentrations were 0 025 mg l summer and 0 032 mg l winter falls in permissible range by comparing this mean concentration of cu it was found higher than previous studies result 0 009 mg l 0 004 mg l 0 009 mg l 0 008 mg l and 0 001 mg l reported in lahore khan et al 2021b india kumar 2022 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and china gu et

sharmin et al 2020 and china zhang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 gu et al 2020 while it was found low than those reported study in india kumar 2022 and bangladesh zakir et al 2020 water bearing rocks leaching aquifers and fossil fuel combustion increase the mn concentration murtaza et al 2020 ni means concentration were 0 142 mg l and 0 183 mg l in summer and winter respectively 100 samples in summer and winter have higher ni concentration than the permissible limit given by who 0 02 mg l this study results revealed that ni mean concentration was found mush higher than the reported study conduct in kasur tariq et al 2008 gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 india kumar 2022 shankar 2019 china gu et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 while mean concentration of ni was found lower than those previous study conduct in lahore khan et al 2021b jalees et al 2021 and kasur ashraf et al 2021 ni concentration is high from who s permissible limit due to untreated urban waste tirkey et al 2017 ni is an essential diet element but its high concentration causes congenital disabilities skin hatreds and respirational cancer razzaq et al 2022 pb means concentration were 0 068 mg l and 0 048 mg l in

concentrations of pb have many harmful effects on human health mean concentration of pb in this study was found high than the previous studies conduct in kasur tariq et al 2008 india shankar 2019 sharma et al 2019 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and china gu et al 2020 while it was found low than the reported studies in lahore khan et al 2021b jalees et al 2021 kasur ashraf et al 2021 and nigeria egbueri 2020 comparison with present results are given in table s4 comparing heavy metal concentrations in ground water samples collected from various regions of lahore reveals that as ni and pb along with cd co cr and mn play significant roles in ground water contamination furthermore the significantly higher concentrations of most metals in winter can be attributed to reduced precipitation in cold weather which lowers groundwater levels and enriches contaminants in groundwater whereas excessive summer precipitation particularly from monsoons results in diluted groundwater khan et al 2021b because of this the high levels of potentially toxic metals in the groundwater could harm people s health so the groundwater was not safe to drink murtaza et al 2020 when compared to earlier studies conducted in this region the results of this study show a higher quantity of heavy metals that poisoned the ground water spatial study revealed that the higher concentration of as in the summer water samples collected from central parts of the city while the concentration in the winter groundwater samples were relatively low and stable significantly cd concentration in groundwater samples collected from different parts of the city during summer and winter were relatively low and consistent the higher co concentration in groundwater samples collected from the central part of the city during summer and winter the measured concentration of cr and mn in groundwater samples collected from northern part of lahore have relatively high concentration during the summer while higher concentration of cr and mn in groundwater samples collected from northern and central areas of the city it is an ancient settlement and densely populated area of the city a relatively high concentration of cu ni and pb was found in groundwater samples taken from middle part of the city during summer relatively high and different concentrations of cu ni and pb in groundwater samples during winter observed in northern and central areas of the city it is an ancient settlement and a densely populated area of the city the high levels of these metals mainly indicate the anthropogenic role of these metals in the groundwater of lahore therefore most metals show significant seasonal effects on the chemical composition of lahore groundwater samples collected in summer and winter generally winters are cooler and drier than hot and rainy summers as a result relatively small fluctuations in metal levels are observed in winter compared to summer overall the spatial distribution revealed significant anthropogenic contamination of metals in groundwater in lahore 3 4 3 4 classification of water 3 4 1 3 4 1 piper trilinear diagram piper introduced this to explain the major ions hydro chemical facies which contributed to water quality piper 1944 there are two triangles in the lower part and diamonds in the upper part explaining the relationship between major cations ca2 k mg2 and na and anions cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 the water quality of the study areas using this piper linear diagram has been shown in fig 4 in summer this diagram reveals that 82 of groundwater samples belong to no dominant type while 18 belongs to ca2 type from the cations and anions triangle the diamond part of this diagram shows that 100 sample predominant by mixed type ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 while in winter the cation triangle reveals that 6 of groundwater samples belongs to mg2 type while 47 belongs to ca2 type and 47 belong to no dominant type from the cation triangle from anions triangle 100 ground water samples belongs to bicarbonate type which shows that carbonate s hardness is found in sample as described in previous study saha and paul 2019 the diamond part of this diagram shows that 100 sample predominant by mixed type ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 comparing this result with other studies it was found that piper trilinear diagram gives the same result than those reported in china in which cations triangle shows the no dominance of groundwater while anions triangle showed that most samples were found in zone e suggesting the dominance of hco3 and signifying the weathering of the carbonate dominated lithology diamond was concentrated in zone 1 indicating the dominance of ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 type in the groundwater zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 while other studies reported in india indicated that groundwater samples belong to no dominant type from cations and anions triangles while diamond parts show the mixed ca mg types gaikwad et al 2020 3 4 2 ficklin caboi diagram this diagram explains the different geological aspects of groundwater chemistry by plotting ph against heavy metal loads this diagram was introduced by ficklin and then modified by caboi saleem et al 2019 the plotted data is shown in fig 5 explaining the chemistry of groundwater collected from study areas in summer and winter in summer this study reveals that 98 samples belong to low metal concentration at neutral ph while only 2 samples belong to high metal concentration at neutral ph while in winter 74 samples belong to low metal concentration at neutral ph while only 26 samples belong to high metal concentration at neutral ph it is due to the accumulation of heavy metals in winter season comparing this ficklin caboi result with the other study conduct in dhaka bangladesh revealed that 98 of groundwater samples were classified as near neutral low metal class while the rest 2 are classified as acid low metal class thus it can be inferred that metals present in groundwaters of the dhaka metropolitan city are comparatively low and less mobile in the aqueous phase this study result in summer coincides with this result as this study was conduct in september october summer time in bangladesh sharmin et al 2020 3 5 assessment of drinking water suitability 3 5 1 pollution load index pli the pollution load index was used to explain the metal load in groundwater samples pli value of each sample site is summarized in table s5 and spatial variation is shown in fig 6 along with classification it has been seen that the pli values range from 0 91 to 1 and 0 94 to 1 during summer and winter respectively it seems that 100 groundwater has a medium pollution index indicated by pli calculation the spatial variation of pli shows that groundwater samples collected from northern and western part of the city have relatively lower pli values than the other parts as these groundwater samples have relative low metal concentration in these parts comparing this pli values with other study values reported in kenya revealed the seriously affected groundwater as that groundwater contains high concentration of metals nyambura et al 2020 3 5 2 drinking water quality index dwqi the groundwater valuation for drinking purposes was completed by the arithmetic weighted water quality index method which primes the simple water quality analysis by accumulating different constraints into a single number gaikwad et al 2020 the calculated dwqi values of each study site are summarized in table s6 the calculated dwqi values revealed that all water samples collected in summer have poor quality as their dwqi values exceeded from 100 while in winter 26 water samples are very poor quality while remaining 74 samples belongs to poor quality this study results revealed that all water samples collected from lahore city belong to b and c class which means their water quality is poor for drinking and population controller manners should be amended the spatial distribution of dwqi values in summer and winter are shown in fig 7 along with description it has been seen that the dwqi values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern central and western parts of the city during summer and winter as described earlier these parts are populated old and have old small factories units by comparing dwqi value with other reported study in dhaka bangladesh whose dwqi values ranged from 6 94 to 137 39 among the 47 groundwater samples collected from the dhaka metropolitan city 68 1 of samples recognized as good to excellent water quality i e suitable for drinking purpose without any health hazard while the rest 31 9 samples identified as poor to unsuitable water quality sharmin et al 2020 another study reported in jamalpur bangladesh whose dwqi values ranged from 38 31 to 396 74 among 25 groundwater samples belongs to good quality and safe for drinking zakir et al 2020 another reported study in indonesia revealed that dwqi values of their groundwater samples have exceeded from index values 100 which shows the poor water quality mallongi et al 2022 reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 21 02 to 966 98 out of 51 groundwater samples water quality of 1 and 2 samples was categorized as poor and extremely poor and 48 samples were suitable for drinking purposes rank 1 2 3 the assessment results indicated that the samples suitable for drinking water account for 94 12 of the total samples while the samples unsuitable for drinking account for 5 88 zhang et al 2020 reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 11 62 to 174 32 with an average of 63 24 no samples had an extremely poor quality and only three samples showed poor quality overall only 9 4 of groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking while 54 7 of samples had good quality and even 37 5 of samples were of excellent quality gao et al 2020 another reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 45 6 to 231 with a mean value of 112 out of 50 groundwater samples only 2 water samples have extremely good water quality while 48 belongs to poor quality chen et al 2019 overall it has been seen that most of the country s groundwater belongs to good to poor quality as their groundwater polluted by anthropogenic activities 3 5 3 heavy metal evaluation index hmei hmei was used to find the water quality for the heavy metal contents in water samples this method was used by catherine and described the classification of water quality which has been calculated data using the hmei equation table s6 along their description it has been seen that the hmei values coincide with the calculated values of dwqi in summer hmei values show that ground water samples are lightly polluted while in winter 42 samples are lightly polluted while 48 samples are moderated polluted with heavy metals and strong action should be taken before using this water the spatial distribution of hmei values in summer and winter are shown in fig 8 along with description it has been seen that the hmei values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern central and western parts of the city during summer and winter as described earlier these parts are populated old and have old small factories units by comparing hmei values with other study reported in india whose value ranged from 4 77 to 39 65 with the mean value of 20 89 this study indicated that 60 samples are low polluted while 40 samples are medium polluted kumar 2022 3 5 4 potential ecological risk index peri peri was used to find the risk index for the heavy metal contents in groundwater samples this method was used by pan to describe the risk index which has been shown in table s5 the calculated data using the peri equation has been shown in table s1 along with their description in summer peri values show that 10 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 90 samples have low risk level similarly in winter peri values show that 30 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 70 samples have low risk level the spatial distribution of peri values in summer and winter are shown in fig 9 along with description it has been seen that the peri values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern and central parts of the city during summer and winter comparing this peri values with other study conduct in china revealed that 60 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 40 samples have low risk level lu et al 2014 while another study reported in bangladesh showed that 20 groundwater samples have moderate risk level and 70 samples have low risk level while 10 samples belong to high risk huq et al 2019 3 6 source analysis of heavy metals in water samples 3 6 1 pearson correlation analysis pearson s method was used to explain the inter metal interaction indicating the reasons and paths of heavy metals in water result displayed in table 3 below diagonal data belongs to summer and above diagonal data belongs to winter the pearson s correlations values from 0 9 to 1 are considered strongly related while 0 9 0 4 are considered moderately related and 0 4 0 1 are consider small relation tirkey et al 2017 in summer the ph shows the moderated relation with hardness 0 83 mn 0 64 and pb 0 68 while in winter ph shows strong relation with ca 0 93 and moderated relation with ec 0 84 mg 0 76 na 0 71 and cr 0 42 similarly tds shows the moderated relation with ca 0 66 hco3 0 62 and co 0 65 in summer and pb 0 59 in winter hardness of ground water indicate the strong relation with cl 0 93 and moderated relation with ec 0 89 ca 0 55 mg 0 74 and na 0 88 in summer while it shows moderated relation with ec 0 48 ca 0 78 mg 0 72 na 0 69 cl 0 52 cr 0 56 cu 0 87 and ni 0 56 in winter ecs show a strong relation with so4 2 0 94 and moderated correlation with cd 0 73 co 0 63 and pb 0 76 in summer and strong relation with cl 0 94 and moderated relation with ca 0 83 na 0 44 and co3 0 49 in winter the competitive cations ca and k show the strong relation with co3 0 93 cl 0 98 respectively while moderated relation of ca na cl so4 as and co mg co na hco3 and ca and k ni in summer in winter the competitive cations show the moderated relation of ca na and co mg ni na cr and k cl cd cr and pb in summer the anions cl show a strong correlation with hco3 0 95 while so4 2 and co3 show moderated relation with co3 0 78 and as 0 66 0 41 in winter the anions cl shows a strong correlation with ecs 0 94 while co3 shows moderated relation with ecs 0 48 in summer as co mn ni and pb do not show any relation with others while cu shows strong relation with pb 0 95 and cd and cr shows moderated relation with co 0 45 and mn 0 48 respectively in winter season moderated relation of cd k co co3 and hco3 cr na and k cu co3 mn as ni mg as cr and pb cl hco3 and mn the strong correlation with each other specifies the common dependency and some contributing sources of these parameters in ground water overall this study reveals that most of the parameters show a moderated correlation with each other indicating the mutual source and same origin while some parameters show strong relationship with each other 3 6 2 principal component analysis pca pc analysis was executed affording to the standard procedure defined in the literature gu et al 2020 presented in fig s1 three components were found 45 88 21 871 and 13 546 in summer and 42 88 22 546 and 15 871 in winter respectively in summer pca reveals three important groups of heavy metals studied in ground water samples one group is exceptionally coordinated with co cr and pb which mixed in water by natural and anthropogenic sources mostly pb comes from petrochemical automobile batteries tires and domestic waste in the study areas egbueri 2020 the second group consists of as and ni which contributed to the study area from weathering leaching from domestic effluents sorption and desorption behaviours from these elements ashraf et al 2021 the third group consists of cd cu and mn which contributed to the study area with geogenic activities in winter pca reveals the three groups of heavy metals first group as ni and cr contributed by weathering and leaching of heavy metals from domestic effluents in the second group mn pb and co contributed with natural and anthropogenic sources in third group cd and cu contributed by geogenic activities overall burning fuel paint discharge automobile waste and domestic effluent were released heavy metals into the atmosphere and accumulated in the water proshad et al 2021a 3 6 3 factor analysis fa fa analysis data shown in table s7 in summer four factors with eigen values 1 obtains and they explain the 67 97 of total variance f1 shows the highest loading of as along with significant loading of co and ni supported by their strong cluster on ca f2 shows the highest loading of cd with significant values of ni these metals are mainly contributed by human activities burning fuel paint discharge and domestic effluent saleem et al 2019 f3 and f4 exhibits the highest loading of co cu and co cr respectively the contribution of these metals in ground water is mostly due to the natural and anthropogenic sources saleem et al 2019 in winter three factors with eigen values 1 obtains and they explain the 60 12 of total variance f1 shows the highest loading of cr ni along with significant loading of co cu supported by their strong cluster on ca f2 shows the highest loading of mn with significant values of co f3 exhibits the highest loading of as pb cu with significant loading of co cd due to natural anthropogenic sources and domestic effluents responsible for the contribution of these heavy metals in ground water and these results supported by pca saleem et al 2019 3 6 4 cluster analysis ca cluster analysis with dendrogram by using wards method is shown in fig s2 in summer one cluster was formed between ni as co and pb while other cluster was formed between cd cu and cr and these both clusters associated with mn with a large distance in winter one cluster was formed between cr co cu ni mn while other cluster was formed between as cd and pb and both clusters associated with each other by long distance the fa and ca results for heavy metals in ground water during summer and winter shows some minor differences which is due to the several ecological conditions usual in summer winter as well as calculation methods overall the results of fa are consistent with ca both show a significantly higher anthropogenic contribution of metals and moderated lower diagenetic contributions of metals in the groundwater of lahore city 3 7 health risk assessment 3 7 1 average daily intake adi table 4 shows the adi ingestion dermal values of different age groups this study calculated the long term exposure by multiple exposure routes as 30 years for adults and 6 years for children the calculated mean oral adi values for as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb were 1 34e 03 1 49e 04 1 32e 03 1 30e 03 8 95e 04 5 94e

contact is 2 10e 02 and 2 40e 02 respectively dermal contact with water in the process of bathing washing swimming etc will have an impact on health in general the calculation is based on the average concentration of each metal in the water at each consumption rate in both seasons the mean adi value for these heavy metals via consumption of groundwater varied in order as mn ni pb cr as co cd cu in both adult and children mn was found to be the major contributor to daily intake of heavy metals by residents of the study area via groundwater cdis of all heavy metals were higher for children in comparison to adults which could be attributed to their low body weight as compared to adults by comparing these adi values with other adi values reported in various study showed the same results obtained in this study as their adi values for adult is always less than children s adi values altaf et al 2021 razzaq et al 2022 murtaza et al 2020 tabassum et al 2019 sharmin et al 2020 tirkey et al 2017 gu et al 2020 3 7 2 non carcinogenic health risk the potential non carcinogenic health risks of heavy metal exposure are calculated from the perspective of the hq accordingly in the case of hq 1 people may have an adverse impact on their health proshad et al 2021b the average ingestion hq values for adults of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb were 4 48e 00 2 97e 01 4 42e 01 4 46e 01 2 24e 02 4 24e 00 2 56e 01 and 5 31e 01 respectively similarly the average ingestion hq values for children of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb for children were 1 19e 01 7 88e 07 1 17e 00 1 19e 00 5 93e 02 1 12e 01 6 78e 01 and 1 41e 00 respectively the average hq dermal values for adults of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb in adults are 4 29e 03 2 85e 04 4 23e 04 4 25e 04 2 14e 05 4 06e 03 2 45e 04 and 5 08e 04 respectively similarly the average hq dermal values for children of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb in children are 8 25e 03 5 48e 04 8 13e 04 8 15e 04 4 12e 05 7 81e 03 4 71e 04 and 9 78e 03 respectively on the basis of mean hqs it can be summarized that the contribution of heavy metals to the non carcinogenic health risk for both adults and children was in the sequence of as mn pb cr co cd ni cu from table 4 the hq ingestion values of as and mn exceeding from 1 in adults and hq ingestion values of as co cr mn and pb exceeding from 1 in children the finding of this study is consistent with the study reported by khan in this region whose find that non carcinogenic health risk for adult and children by ingestion route khan et al 2021b while several studies has been reported that hq values for all heavy metal for both adults and children is less than 1 which means that s the concentration of trace metals might pose little health effects to the adult and children via oral ingestion and dermal of groundwater zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 thi calculation is used to detect high risks rather than low risks to protect humans the thi ingestion values in adults range from 8 95e 00 to 1 34e 01 with a mean value of 1 11e 01 similarly the thi ingestion values in children range from 2 37e 01 to 3 55e 01 with a mean value of 2 86e 01 the thi dermal values in adults ranged from 8 57e 03 to 1 28e 02 with an average of 1 04e 02 similarly children s dermal thi values ranged from 1 65e 02 to 2 47e 02 with an average of 1 97e 02 the total value of thiingestion 1 which exhibit the high non carcinogenic effect for the resident of these areas and long usage of this polluted water causes health problems while the total thidermal 1 which exhibits the low carcinogenic effect for the peoples of these areas the finding of this study is consistent with the study reported by khan in this region whose find that thi for adult and children by ingestion route is 1 which indicated the high non carcinogenic health risk khan et al 2021b while other studies reported by bodrud doza sharmin zakir and sharma finds that thi values for all heavy metal for both adults and children is less than 1 which means that s the concentration of heavy metals might pose little health effects to the adult and children via oral ingestion and dermal of groundwater zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 3 7 3 carcinogenic health risk the possibility of developing any cancer in the whole life by the exposure of carcinogenic element heavy metals like as cd cr ni and pb contents in drinking water can create cancer when exposed to human beings out of 8 heavy metals only 5 metals have csf values defined by oehha atsdr 2017 the deliberate ilcr values modelled by these heavy metals by ingestion and dermal contact to the citizens of the study areas are shown in table 5 the ilcr due to as through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 1 25e 03 to 2 83e 03 and 1 20e 06 to 2 71e 06 respectively the ilcr due to cd through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 2 39e 05 to 1 02e 04 and 2 29e 08 to 9 72e 08 respectively the ilcr due to cr through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 4 01e 04 to 1 12e 03 and 3 84e 07 to 1 08e 06 respectively the ilcr due to ni through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 6 92e 03 to 1 18e 02 and 6 62e 06 to 1 13e 05 respectively the ilcr due to pb through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 1 38e 05 to 1 72e 05 and 1 32e 08 to 1 65e 08 respectively overall the ilcr values in an adult due to these 5 heavy metals by ingestion is 1 14e 02 which is higher than the permissible limit given by usepa 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 proshad et al 2021b while ilcr values in an adult due to dermal contact is 1 01e 05 which fall within range set by usepa this result shows that in adults developing cancer risk due to cd cr and pb is negligible in all locations while the cancer risk due to as and ni is high by ingestion this water in these study areas the ilcr due to as through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 3 31e 03 to 7 50e 03 and 2 30e 06 to 5 21e 06 respectively the ilcr due to cd through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 6 33e 05 to 2 69e 04 and 4 40e 08 to 1 87e 07 respectively the ilcr due to cr through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 1 06e 03 to 2 98e 03 and 7 38e 07 to 2 07e 06 respectively the ilcr due to ni through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 1 83e 02 to 3 13e 02 and 1 27e 05 to 2 17e 05 respectively the ilcr due to pb through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 3 65e 05 to 4 57e 05 and 2 53e 08 to 3 17e 08 respectively overall the ilcr values in children due to these 5 heavy metals by ingestion is 3 03e 02 which is higher than the permissible limit given by usepa 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 proshad et al 2021b while ilcr values in children due to dermal contact is 2 11e 05 which fall within range set by usepa these results revealed that cancer risk in children is high for heavy metals as cr and ni while cancer risk for heavy metal cd and pb is negligible for all study sites tcr values in adult and children by ingestion and dermal contact are 1 15e 02 and 3 03e 02 respectively in general the ilcr values inferred those 8 persons in 200 persons developing cancer risk due to heavy metal contamination in drinking water by cumulative ingestion and dermal routes in these areas so peoples of these areas should beware of cancer risk and water should require some treatment before drinking many studies have been completed in different parts of the world whose findings are quite diverse due to different geological conditions and water consumption tabassum et al 2019 proshad et al 2021b shams et al 2022 3 8 monte carlo simulation the monte carlo method was used to simulate the total carcinogenic health risk and comprehensive non carcinogenic risk values for adults and children under drinking water ingestion and dermal contact routes of exposure the simulation results can be used to verify the accuracy of the health risk assessment results the results are shown in fig 11 multiparameter analysis converts uncertainty in the health risk assessment into probability 3 8 1 monte carlo simulation mcs for non cancer risk non carcinogenic risk values for drinking water ingestion and dermal exposure pathways were simulated by using monte carlo methods ramesh et al 2021 histogram shows the non carcinogenic risk thi values at 5 and 95 confidence levels and predicted values after 10 000 random simulations the output fitting results followed the beta and gamma in adults and children respectively according to the simulation in fig 10 the 95th percentile value of thi for adult and children were 4 78e 01 and 2 78e 01 respectively all percentile values were higher than 1 indicating that the health risks caused by the non carcinogenic heavy metals are high eslami et al 2021 3 8 2 monte carlo simulation mcs for carcinogenic risk the probability of carcinogenic risk was estimated by using the monte carlo simulation mcs from the combined pathways of ingestion and dermal contact histogram shows the carcinogenic health risk values at 5 and 95 confidence levels and the predicted values after 10 000 random simulations the output fitting results followed the weibull and gamma in adults and children respectively according to the simulation in fig 11 the 95th percentile value of tcr for adults and children were 5 09e 02 and 2 95e 02 respectively the maximum acceptable carcinogenic risk recommended by the usepa is 1 10 4 and the probability of exceeding 1 10 4 is 100 indicating that carcinogenic heavy metals pose a certain safety risk to human health according to the uncertainty in the selected parameters monte carlo simulation was applied to determine the sensitivity different parameter variables have different sensitivities to carcinogenic risk the sensitivity chart fig 12 revealed that concentration of as ni and pb in groundwater were the most significant metals in developing cancer in adult along with other metals such as cd and cr while concentration of cr and ni in groundwater were the significant metals in developing cancer in children along with other metals such as as cd and pb in children ef was indicated as the most significant factor in cancer risk the more often discrete exposure events occur the higher the possibility that children will be at risk of cancer hence children should reduce their consumption of drinking water that contains harmful metals children absorb more metal than adults due to their body ratio while the contribution of wb sa and other parameters were recorded below 1 indicating a low effect which can be ignored the content of carcinogenic heavy metal elements generates a greater impact on the risk value 4 conclusion groundwater is a major source of drinking water in most parts of pakistan so it s crucial to assess the quality of groundwater the quality of groundwater is determined by analyzing its physiochemical characteristics and heavy metals this study revealed the heavy metals variation in both seasons summer and winter the mean con centration mg l of as 0 036 and 0 051 cd 0 004 and 0 005 co 0 041 and 0 044 cr 0 033 and 0 042 mn 0 414 and 0 494 ni 0 142 and 0 183 and pb 0 068 and 0 048 were found high then permissible range set by who and pak epa while cu 0 025 and 0 032 was inacceptable range in water samples collected from study areas ca and pca are used to identify the source of heavy metals in groundwater according to the dwqi and hmei estimates the majority of the samples were of poor quality and moderately polluted by heavy metals the hq ingestion and hi ingestion 1 indicate both have non carcinogenic health hazards adults and children the ilcr deals with consumption of groundwater by adults 1 13e 02 and children 3 03e 02 which was found to be higher than the usepa set limit 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 which suggested a potential cancer risk hence current study suggests that drinking low quality water over the long term could be harmful to human health in terms of carcinogenic health risks this study found that 8 out of 200 people may acquire cancer during their lifetime owing to long term exposure to arsenic cadmium and nickel contaminated water as a result individuals in the research region should be aware of this risk and take appropriate individual and government steps such as boiling filtration precipitation ion

11634,groundwater pollution is a major environmental concern and may persist under diverse ecological conditions this study describes the seasonal impacts on pollution characteristics coupled with the degree of human health risks in groundwater for this purpose a highly populated city of pakistan lahore was planned and about 50 groundwater samples were collected during the summer and winter seasons in 2021 and 2022 various physiochemical parameters ph ec tds and hardness cations anions and toxic metals as cd co cr mn ni and pb were analyzed to evaluate the seasonal impacts on the groundwater quality besides a monte carlo simulation model and sensitivity analysis were performed to obtain a high level accuracy in cancer risk estimation results revealed that physiochemical parameters cations and anions in most of the samples were within the who limit however the heavy metals concentration was higher in winter than in summer season most metals showed a significant spatial variability were found in older settlements and densely populated areas of the city for both seasons factor analysis fa and cluster analysis ca revealed a significant anthropogenic contribution to ni co cd cu cr and pb contaminations in groundwater drinking water quality indices dwqi and heavy metal pollution indices hmei points in both seasons revealed a poor to moderated pollution pattern pollution load index pli and potential ecological risk index peri indicated the medium pollution with low risks through monte carlo simulation at 95 confidence level revealed that carcinogenic risks associated with as cr cd and ni has exceeded from safer limits consequently winter season was perceived more sensitive owing to the substantial increase of pollutants proclamation in groundwater and posturing a serious threat to humans hence instant remedial actions are suggested to ensure safe drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal toxicity water quality multivariate analysis health risk hazard

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is considered as an outstanding natural resource that plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem in both residential and commercial sectors shah et al 2012 groundwater quality is mainly affected by geochemical cycles and various anthropogenic activities including mining sewage disposal and other agro industrial operations are overwhelmed kadam et al 2021 however seasonal fluctuations wind rain and precipitation are accounted for the significant factor that alter the groundwater quality subba rao et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2016 thus it is essential to evaluate the effect of seasonal fluctuations on the quality of groundwater for its beneficial usage in densely populated and water deficient regions ashraf et al 2021 heavy metals hms are natural components of the earth s crust and a class of inorganic contaminants that have risen to prominence as primary toxicants due to their increased solubility in water heavy metals in groundwater are harmful to human health because of their unique properties such as toxicity biodegradability and biochemistry altaf et al 2021 a few heavy metals disrupt human metabolism by interfering with enzymes and protein components teng et al 2022 these heavy metals persist in the water and are absorbed by the human body through a variety of mechanisms including direct ingestion and dermal contact mouth eyes and nose aslam et al 2022 the health risk evaluation of a specific residential area by consuming polluted water is based on an assumption carcinogenic or non carcinogenic altaf et al 2020 therefore drinking water quality assessment is essential prior to its administration the chemical study of groundwater is critical in hydrological investigations groundwater contamination caused by heavy metals is now a major concern globally especially in pakistan according to previous research as ca mg co ni pb cd cr mn cu cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 are the most prominent compounds observed in pakistani groundwater razzaq et al 2022 hussain et al 2019 murtaza et al 2020 khan et al 2021a heavy metal concentrations in water have been linked to a variety of disorders including abdominal pain heart disease immune system dysfunction high blood pressure liver and kidney damage ur rehman et al 2022 as a result various researchers throughout the world perform studies to determine the risk to human health from drinking contaminated water tripathee et al 2016 jehan et al 2019 2020 nkpaa et al 2018 tabassum et al 2019 in general the uncertainty of the environment and the inability of global leaders to make decisions have resulted in tough situations in developing nations such as pakistan the decline in precipitation rate has an effect on the protection of freshwater resources zhu et al 2019 pak epa pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa 2010 indicates that heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater of punjab s major metropolitan areas are high razzaq et al 2022 in lahore the provincial capital of punjab groundwater recharge has decreased because of high rates of groundwater abstraction water is a good solvent due to its strong hydrogen bonding and polarity which allow it to dissolve a wide variety of bacterial and natural substances consequently natural water is always contaminated by biological and anthropogenic activities above and below the surface batool et al 2019 this study was designed to identify heavy metals in various regions of the city and assess water quality in both seasons using drinking water quality indices dwqi heavy metal evaluation indices hmei potential ecological risk index peri and pollution load index pli these methods were widely used in the previous study and were quite useful in determining groundwater quality indices nkpaa et al 2018 zakir et al 2020 wu et al 2020 varol and davraz 2015 some studies just provide the health risk as a single number ignoring uncertainty the following outcomes were derived from input variables body weight consumption rate etc without knowledge of the correlation and contribution of each assumption consequently this paper uses probabilistic risk assessment which is more refined and precise than the health risk assessment approach employed over the past few decades the monte carlo simulation mcs model investigates the distribution of a variable by simulating random numbers actual conditions and accompanying risk analysis results are shown through site specific data from questionnaires and interviews the purpose of this study was to 1 examine groundwater quality 2 assess the health risk of heavy metals exposure in groundwater through ingestion and dermal adsorption and 3 use monte carlo simulation to determine the probability of non cancer and cancer risks and the main influencing factors this research is important for improving and evaluating water protection policies as well as estimating the prevalence of serious cancer and noncancer related health concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 the geographic location of sampling sites lahore is located between 31 15 31 45 n latitude and 74 01 74 39 e longitude it is bordered to the north by sheikhupura to the east by the wagah border india and to the south by kasur ashraf et al 2021 the ravi river flows on the northern side forming an administrative border between shahdara and lahore lahore is a semitropical lowland with a droughty climate temperature and precipitation rates varied seasonally reducing rainfall in lahore the temperature can reach 40 c in the summer and 5 c in the winter groundwater recharge might reach 40 mm with 75 annual precipitation after monsoon periods khan et al 2021b several studies have demonstrated that different alloy deposits make lahore s aquifers more sloppy unclean and projecting khan et al 2021b despite this the city s water requirements are being met by the river ravi which is currently in a declining condition due to the low rainfall a total of 47 of the city s overall usage was made up of untreated municipal and industrial wastewater akhtar and zhonghua 2013 the water and sanitation authority wasa in lahore has installed over 500 tube wells with depths ranging from 120 to 245 m to supply water and has tested the chemical physical and bacterial qualities of groundwater to ensure access to safe drinking water basharat and rizvi 2013 in recent years the degradation of groundwater class has caused major health problems in surrounding areas private associations or industries or government officials meet domestic and industrial water demand by pumping groundwater khan et al 2021b 2 2 collection of groundwater samples and analysis 50 groundwater samples were collected from various urban areas of lahore during the summer september 2021 and winter december 2021 fig 1 represents the geological location of collecting groundwater all samples were collected from the tube wells established in these regions in acid washed polyethylene bottles to avoid precipitation and metal adsorption in the bottle acidify the sample the samples are transported to the chemical laboratory in a refrigerator processed within one day and stored at 4 c for further examination an atomic adsorption spectrometer is used to protect and evaluate heavy metals according to the procedures outlined in the american public health association apha23rd edition rice 2017 aa240 ph ecs and tds were calculated immediately upon collection the hardness of water was determined using ca and mg which were measured titrimetrically with a na2 edta solution the amount of na and k measured using a flame emission spectrometer jenway singh s spectrophotometric method buurman et al

the metal concentration is determined via a calibration curve 2 3 water quality and pollution indices the contamination level in drinking water due to heavy metals was determined by using pli dwqi hmei and peri the valuation of water quality due to these parameters is classified according to the values given in table s1 2 3 1 pollution load index pli the pollution load index pli was used to assess the heavy metals pollution in groundwater by using equation 1 1 p l i c f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f n 1 n where c f represents the contamination factor of heavy metal the c f is the ratio obtained by dividing the concentration of each metal in the groundwater by the standard value and it can be calculated by using equation 2 2 c f c s where c and s represent the mean heavy metals concentration and standard values of that metal given in table 1 in groundwater respectively 2 3 2 drinking water quality index dwqi dwqi was calculated via sener s method şener et al 2017 which gives the suitability of water sources for drinking purposes 17 parameters are used to find out the dwqi hardness co3 and hco3 were omitted due to the absence of standard values step i relative weight w i was determined by

for single and multi element set by usepa us epa 2011 2 4 4 monte carlo simulation mcs the monte carlo simulation method is a probabilistic simulation method that is widely used in parameter selection for risk uncertainty analysis and risk assessment the procedure uses the definitions of the variables to make assumptions fig 8 out a probabilistic model of the chosen parameters chooses the cells for the prediction and uses the results of several random simulation experiments as a rough solution to the problem to get the value risky mesa frias et al 2013 uncertainty in health risk assessment is mostly caused by exposure characteristics such body weight consumption and skin surface area and the variation in pollutant concentrations between research areas and the model selection these factors influence the calculation of the actual risk value to varying degrees resulting in uncertainties in the health risk assessment chen and liao 2006 oracle s crystal ball 11 1 2 4 software for a monte carlo simulation is used which uses the probability distribution of each parameter to calculate estimate the frequency of non carcinogenic risk assessments for the stability of the test results variable independent runs are performed at 10 000 iterations where each variable randomly chooses values shown in table s3 which based on their distribution function to estimate non cancer risk 2 5 analytical quality assurance crm certified reference material analysis data for various cations and heavy metals is shown in table 1 the concentration values of the certified reference material were used to assess the acceptability of the quality and analytical data crm all analytical data that fell within the crm material s acceptability ranges were deemed valid these metals were quantified in each sample by atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu aa 670 japan under optimum analytical conditions by employing calibration line procedure freshly prepared working standards of the metals by successive dilutions of 1000 mg l stock solution were used for the metal analyses any possible contamination while processing preserving the samples was determined by analyzing the reagent blanks triplicate measurements were made for all the samples and blanks 2 6 statistical analysis spss 2 0 ibm armonk usa was used for statistical data analysis excel 2018 was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation the pearson coefficient method with a significance level of 0 05 was calculated to assess ca among physiochemical and heavy metals pca principal component analysis is used to identify potential sources of heavy metals in water the bs bartlet sphericity and kmo kaiser meyer olkin tests extract essential pcs and assess the data s applicability using pca normalized variables the heavy metals are divided into several sets to understand the distribution of heavy metals by gathering full information about the data set and discovering similarities and differences using origin

measurements were collected for this study this study was approved by the responders as well as the university s health research ethics committee all responders are locals who have lived in the vicinity of the collection site for at least a year the questionnaires were utilized for this study which is detailed in the supplementary data 3 3 result and discussion 3 1 3 1 physiochemical parameters of groundwater groundwater quality was assessed using who who guideline for drinking water quality 2011 and pak epa pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa 2010 standards and statistical data is shown in table 2 in the summer ph values ranged from 6 54 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 29 while in the winter ph values ranged from 6 85 to 8 71 with a mean value of 7 70 the measured ph levels have been found to be within the who and pak epa limits in comparison only 6 of winter samples exceeded the allowed limit indicating the alkaline character of the water the ph values in this study slightly deviate from those in a previous study conducted by khan in the same region khan et al 2021b in which the mean ph values in summer and winter are 7 92 and 8 03 respectively most studies conducted in distinct cultures of this region such as bangladesh huq et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 india gaikwad et al 2020 tirkey et al 2017 china altaf et al 2021 tabassum et al 2019 and indonesia mallongi et al 2022 have the same ph range electrical conductivity ecs values ranged from 1 01 ms cm to 1 91 ms cm with a mean value of 1 40 ms cm in summer while it ranged from 1 14 ms cm to 1 98 ms cm with mean value of 1 60 ms cm in winter which were found within the permissible range the ecs values are relatively low with the previous study conduct in the same area whose mean ecs values are 6 70 and 15 46 in summer and winter respectively khan et al 2021b while ecs values resembles with the other study conduct in bangladesh huq et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 similarly the tds values ranged from 249 mg l to 946 mg l with mean value of 495 mg l in summer while it ranged from 294 mg l to 994 mg l with mean value of 553 mg l in winter which were found within the permissible range showing the suitability of the ground water for drinking with high soluble contents the tds values are little high with the previous study conduct in the same area whose mean tds values are 429 and 489 in summer and winter respectively khan et al 2021b also tds values of this study are very high with other studies conduct in bangladesh huq et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and india gaikwad et al 2020 the hardness of ground water samples ranged from 207 52 mg l to 607 87 mg l in summer with a mean value

results to those of a recent study khan et al 2021b conducted on ground water samples from the city of lahore the physiochemical parameters showed a consistent trend overall the physiochemical characteristics of lahore city ground water samples were within the permissible limits specified by pak epa and who 3 2 3 2 cations and anions distribution the distribution of various cations and anions in ground water samples collected from different areas of lahore city were shown in table 2 in summer the mean concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k were found at 44 mg l 27 98 mg l 15 33 mg l and 2 90 mg l respectively while in winter the corresponding values were 29 mg l 19 78 mg l 14 64 mg l and 2 76 mg l respectively in comparison with the reported cations level in the groundwater of other cities of pakistan table s4 present mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k were found to be considerably lower than those reported from lahore jalees et al 2021 kasur tariq et al 2008 and gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 while present mean concentration of ca2 and mg2 were found high than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 present mean concentration of na and k were found lower than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while comparison with the reported cations level in the groundwater of other parts of world table s4 present mean concentration of ca2 mg2 na and k were found considerably lower than those reported from india sharma et al 2019 china zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 and ethiopia karuppannan and kawo 2019 while present mean concentration of ca and mg were lower than previous study conduct in india gaikwad et al 2020 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 while the mean concentration of cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 were found 44 mg l 151 mg l 157 mg l and 158 mg l respectively in summer and the corresponding values were 27 mg l 143 mg l 144 mg l and 141 mg l respectively in winter it has been found that all cations and anions values were found within the limit given by who and pak epa in comparison with the reported anions level in the groundwater of other cities of pakistan table s4 present mean concentration of cl so₄2 and hco3 were found considerably lower than those reported level from lahore in winter khan et al 2021b and hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while mean co3 concentration is high from reported from lahore jalees et al 2021 and low from reported study conduct in hasilpur nkpaa et al 2018 while comparison with the reported anions level in the groundwater of other parts of world table s4 present mean concentration of cl and so₄2 were found to be significantly lower than the reported study conducts in india sharma et al 2019 china gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 while present mean concentration of cl and so₄2 were found to be much higher than those reported values from india gaikwad et al 2020 bangladesh

those reported values from bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 china zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 chen et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 and ethiopia karuppannan and kawo 2019 while hco3 concentration considerably high than those reported study conduct in india gaikwad et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 seasonal comparison the concentrations of all main cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 in groundwater samples were higher in summer than in winter the greatly increased contributions of cations in summer can be attributed to sewage leaks into groundwater through soil during the monsoon season due to high rainfall and urban run off while soil works as a natural filter to remove pollutants through adsorption continuous and extended wastewater discharge can cause soil saturation which limits soil adsorption and filtering capacity resulting in soil deterioration and poor groundwater quality huq et al 2019 the results of this research were consistent with earlier studies conducted in this region khan et al 2021b bodrud doza et al 2020 the spatial variation of cations and anions is shown in fig 2 in summer high concentrations of ca and mg were found in water samples collected in the densely populated north and northeast part of lahore city during winter however relatively high mg concentrations were observed in the northern and central areas which is oldest part of the city while relatively low and consistent ca concentrations were found in winter groundwater samples conversely much higher na levels in summer were observed in samples taken from the south of the city where most of the excavation and new construction took place however na levels mainly showed higher differences in winter samples collected from central and southern parts of the city elevated k concentrations were found in water samples collected from densely populated areas inner cities in the central and northern parts of the city in summer while in winter the k concentrations were relatively low and consistent in groundwater samples collected from western and northern areas of the city the concentrations of cl and so₄2 were higher in summer while the concentrations of the two anions were higher in winter in the eastern and northern areas of the city during summer higher concentrations of co3 and hco3 were found in groundwater samples taken from the central areas of the city which are very densely populated areas of the city while hco3 concentrations in groundwater samples collected from northern and central regions were higher in winter the co3 concentrations in groundwater samples were relatively low and consistent during winter as shown in fig 2 3 3 3 3 heavy metal concentration in groundwater groundwater is contaminated with heavy metals through various human activities such as chemicals in agricultural and industrial and municipal wastes enters in water bodies without proper treatment these heavy metals are very important for the human body in small amounts but high concentrations cause water pollution and human health risks heavy metal data found in groundwater samples collected from a different area of lahore city is shown in table 2 and spatial variation of these heavy metals of various locations is shown in fig 3 the mean concentration of as was 0 036 mg l in summer and 0 076 mg l in winter which is higher from permissible limit given by who and pak epa almost 100 samples in both seasons have higher as concentration present mean concentration of as in summer and winter was found high than those reported level from kasur ashraf et al 2021 india kumar 2022 bangladesh 41 and china xiao et al 2020 gu et al 2020 as concentration level is high in this region due to dry oxidizing environment

reported study conduct in gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 india sharma et al 2019 and china gu et al 2020 while mean concentration of co was found very low than those reported from lahore khan et al 2021b and kasur ashraf et al 2021 tariq et al 2008 the high co concentration is due to the burning of fossil fuels the mean concentration of cr was 0 033 mg l and 0 042 mg l in summer and winter respectively 26 samples in summer and 38 samples in winter have higher cr concentration than the permissible limit given by who comparing this study result the mean concentration of cr was found very low than the reported study conducts in lahore jalees et al 2021 kasur ashraf et al 2021 tariq et al 2008 gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 and india shankar 2019 sharma et al 2019 while this study result

2020 china gu et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 cr is usually castoff in different industrial activities metal dusting coating leather and cement dyeing tseng et al 2019 in addition fragile and corrosive pipeline environments will also add cr to drinking water high concentrations can cause many health problems tumor formation weakness immune system congenital disabilities and respiratory system problems khan et al 2015 cu mean concentrations were 0 025 mg l summer and 0 032 mg l winter falls in permissible range by comparing this mean concentration of cu it was found higher than previous studies result 0 009 mg l 0 004 mg l 0 009 mg l 0 008 mg l and 0 001 mg l reported in lahore khan et al 2021b india kumar 2022 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and china gu et al 2020 respectively while this study result was found low than previous reported values from lahore khan et al 2021b jalees et al 2021 kasur ashraf et al 2021 india shankar 2019 sharma et al 2019 mn means concentration were 0 414 mg l and 0 494 mg l in summer and winter respectively 6 samples in summer and 22 samples in winter have higher mn concentration than the permissible limit given by who 0 5 mg l comparing the mean concentration of mn it was found to be considerably high value than those reported study in lahore khan et al 2021b kasur ashraf et al 2021 tariq et al 2008 bangladesh sharmin et al 2020 and china zhang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 gu et al 2020 while it was found low than those reported study in india kumar 2022 and bangladesh zakir et al 2020 water bearing rocks leaching aquifers and fossil fuel combustion increase the mn concentration murtaza et al 2020 ni means concentration were 0 142 mg l and 0 183 mg l in summer and winter respectively 100 samples in summer and winter have higher ni concentration than the permissible limit given by who 0 02 mg l this study results revealed that ni mean concentration was found mush higher than the reported study conduct in kasur tariq et al 2008 gujranwala mazhar et al 2019 india kumar 2022 shankar 2019 china gu et al 2020 and nigeria egbueri 2020 while mean concentration of ni was found lower than those previous study conduct in lahore khan et al 2021b jalees et al 2021 and kasur ashraf et al 2021 ni concentration is high from who s permissible limit due to untreated urban waste tirkey et al 2017 ni is an essential diet element but its high concentration causes congenital disabilities skin hatreds and respirational cancer razzaq et al 2022 pb means concentration were 0 068 mg l and 0 048 mg l in summer and winter respectively 100 samples in summer and 82 samples in winter have high pb concentration than the permissible limit given by who 0 01 mg l and pak epa 0 05 mg l for a long time high concentrations of pb have many harmful effects on human health mean concentration of pb in this study was found high than the previous studies conduct in kasur tariq et al 2008 india shankar 2019 sharma et al 2019 bangladesh zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 and china gu et al 2020 while it was found low than the reported studies in lahore khan et al 2021b jalees et al 2021 kasur ashraf et al 2021 and nigeria egbueri 2020 comparison with present results are given in table s4 comparing heavy metal concentrations in ground water samples collected from various regions of lahore reveals that as ni and pb along with cd co cr and mn play significant roles in ground water contamination furthermore the significantly higher concentrations of most metals in winter can be attributed to reduced precipitation in cold weather which lowers groundwater levels and enriches contaminants in groundwater whereas excessive summer precipitation particularly from monsoons results in diluted groundwater khan et al 2021b because of this the high levels of potentially toxic metals in the groundwater could harm people s health so the groundwater was not safe to drink murtaza et al 2020 when compared to earlier studies conducted in this region the results of this study show a higher quantity of heavy metals that poisoned the ground water spatial study revealed that the higher concentration of as in the summer water samples collected from central parts of the city while the concentration in the winter groundwater samples were relatively low and stable significantly cd concentration in groundwater samples collected from different parts of the city during summer and winter were relatively low and consistent the higher co concentration in groundwater samples collected from the central part of the city during summer and winter the measured concentration of cr and mn in groundwater samples collected from northern part of lahore have relatively high concentration during the summer while higher concentration of cr and mn in groundwater samples collected from northern and central areas of the city it is an ancient settlement and densely populated area of the city a relatively high concentration of cu ni and pb was found in groundwater samples taken from middle part of the city during summer relatively high and different concentrations of cu ni and pb in groundwater samples during winter observed in northern and central areas of the city it is an ancient settlement and a densely populated area of the city the high levels of these metals mainly indicate the anthropogenic role of these metals in the groundwater of lahore therefore most metals show significant seasonal effects on the chemical composition of lahore groundwater samples collected in summer and winter generally winters are cooler and drier than hot and rainy summers as a result relatively small fluctuations in metal levels are observed in winter compared to summer overall the spatial distribution revealed significant anthropogenic contamination of metals in groundwater in lahore 3 4 3 4 classification of water 3 4 1 3 4 1 piper trilinear diagram piper introduced this to explain the major ions hydro chemical facies which contributed to water quality piper 1944 there are two triangles in the lower part and diamonds in the upper part explaining the relationship between major cations ca2 k mg2 and na and anions cl so₄2 co3 and hco3 the water quality of the study areas using this piper linear diagram has been shown in fig 4 in summer this diagram reveals that 82 of groundwater samples belong to no dominant type while 18 belongs to ca2 type from the cations and anions triangle the diamond part of this diagram shows that 100 sample predominant by mixed type ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 while in winter the cation triangle reveals that 6 of groundwater samples belongs to mg2 type while 47 belongs to ca2 type and 47 belong to no dominant type from the cation triangle from anions triangle 100 ground water samples belongs to bicarbonate type which shows that carbonate s hardness is found in sample as described in previous study saha and paul 2019 the diamond part of this diagram shows that 100 sample predominant by mixed type ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 comparing this result with other studies it was found that piper trilinear diagram gives the same result than those reported in china in which cations triangle shows the no dominance of groundwater while anions triangle showed that most samples were found in zone e suggesting the dominance of hco3 and signifying the weathering of the carbonate dominated lithology diamond was concentrated in zone 1 indicating the dominance of ca2 mg2 cl and so₄2 type in the groundwater zhang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 while other studies reported in india indicated that groundwater samples belong to no dominant type from cations and anions triangles while diamond parts show the mixed ca mg types gaikwad et al 2020 3 4 2 ficklin caboi diagram this diagram explains the different geological aspects of groundwater chemistry by plotting ph against heavy metal loads this diagram was introduced by ficklin and then modified by caboi saleem et al 2019 the plotted data is shown in fig 5 explaining the chemistry of groundwater collected from study areas in summer and winter in summer this study reveals that 98 samples belong to low metal concentration at neutral ph while only 2 samples belong to high metal concentration at neutral ph while in winter 74 samples belong to low metal concentration at neutral ph while only 26 samples belong to high metal concentration at neutral ph it is due to the accumulation of heavy metals in winter season comparing this ficklin caboi result with the other study conduct in dhaka bangladesh revealed that 98 of groundwater samples were classified as near neutral low metal class while the rest 2 are classified as acid low metal class thus it can be inferred that metals present in groundwaters of the dhaka metropolitan city are comparatively low and less mobile in the aqueous phase this study result in summer coincides with this result as this study was conduct in september october summer time in bangladesh sharmin et al 2020 3 5 assessment of drinking water suitability 3 5 1 pollution load index pli the pollution load index was used to explain the metal load in groundwater samples pli value of each sample site is summarized in table s5 and spatial variation is shown in fig 6 along with classification it has been seen that the pli values range from 0 91 to 1 and 0 94 to 1 during summer and winter respectively it seems that 100 groundwater has a medium pollution index indicated by pli calculation the spatial variation of pli shows that groundwater samples collected from northern and western part of the city have relatively lower pli values than the other parts as these groundwater samples have relative low metal concentration in these parts comparing this pli values with other study values reported in kenya revealed the seriously affected groundwater as that groundwater contains high concentration of metals nyambura et al 2020 3 5 2 drinking water quality index dwqi the groundwater valuation for drinking purposes was completed by the arithmetic weighted water quality index method which primes the simple water quality analysis by accumulating different constraints into a single number gaikwad et al 2020 the calculated dwqi values of each study site are summarized in table s6 the calculated dwqi values revealed that all water samples collected in summer have poor quality as their dwqi values exceeded from 100 while in winter 26 water samples are very poor quality while remaining 74 samples belongs to poor quality this study results revealed that all water samples collected from lahore city belong to b and c class which means their water quality is poor for drinking and population controller manners should be amended the spatial distribution of dwqi values in summer and winter are shown in fig 7 along with description it has been seen that the dwqi values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern central and western parts of the city during summer and winter as described earlier these parts are populated old and have old small factories units by comparing dwqi value with other reported study in dhaka bangladesh whose dwqi values ranged from 6 94 to 137 39 among the 47 groundwater samples collected from the dhaka metropolitan city 68 1 of samples recognized as good to excellent water quality i e suitable for drinking purpose without any health hazard while the rest 31 9 samples identified as poor to unsuitable water quality sharmin et al 2020 another study reported in jamalpur bangladesh whose dwqi values ranged from 38 31 to 396 74 among 25 groundwater samples belongs to good quality and safe for drinking zakir et al 2020 another reported study in indonesia revealed that dwqi values of their groundwater samples have exceeded from index values 100 which shows the poor water quality mallongi et al 2022 reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 21 02 to 966 98 out of 51 groundwater samples water quality of 1 and 2 samples was categorized as poor and extremely poor and 48 samples were suitable for drinking purposes rank 1 2 3 the assessment results indicated that the samples suitable for drinking water account for 94 12 of the total samples while the samples unsuitable for drinking account for 5 88 zhang et al 2020 reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 11 62 to 174 32 with an average of 63 24 no samples had an extremely poor quality and only three samples showed poor quality overall only 9 4 of groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking while 54 7 of samples had good quality and even 37 5 of samples were of excellent quality gao et al 2020 another reported study in china revealed that the calculated dwqi values of groundwater ranged from 45 6 to 231 with a mean value of 112 out of 50 groundwater samples only 2 water samples have extremely good water quality while 48 belongs to poor quality chen et al 2019 overall it has been seen that most of the country s groundwater belongs to good to poor quality as their groundwater polluted by anthropogenic activities 3 5 3 heavy metal evaluation index hmei hmei was used to find the water quality for the heavy metal contents in water samples this method was used by catherine and described the classification of water quality which has been calculated data using the hmei equation table s6 along their description it has been seen that the hmei values coincide with the calculated values of dwqi in summer hmei values show that ground water samples are lightly polluted while in winter 42 samples are lightly polluted while 48 samples are moderated polluted with heavy metals and strong action should be taken before using this water the spatial distribution of hmei values in summer and winter are shown in fig 8 along with description it has been seen that the hmei values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern central and western parts of the city during summer and winter as described earlier these parts are populated old and have old small factories units by comparing hmei values with other study reported in india whose value ranged from 4 77 to 39 65 with the mean value of 20 89 this study indicated that 60 samples are low polluted while 40 samples are medium polluted kumar 2022 3 5 4 potential ecological risk index peri peri was used to find the risk index for the heavy metal contents in groundwater samples this method was used by pan to describe the risk index which has been shown in table s5 the calculated data using the peri equation has been shown in table s1 along with their description in summer peri values show that 10 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 90 samples have low risk level similarly in winter peri values show that 30 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 70 samples have low risk level the spatial distribution of peri values in summer and winter are shown in fig 9 along with description it has been seen that the peri values were high for the groundwater samples collected from northern and central parts of the city during summer and winter comparing this peri values with other study conduct in china revealed that 60 groundwater samples have moderate risk level while 40 samples have low risk level lu et al 2014 while another study reported in bangladesh showed that 20 groundwater samples have moderate risk level and 70 samples have low risk level while 10 samples belong to high risk huq et al 2019 3 6 source analysis of heavy metals in water samples 3 6 1 pearson correlation analysis pearson s method was used to explain the inter metal interaction indicating the reasons and paths of heavy metals in water result displayed in table 3 below diagonal data belongs to summer and above diagonal data belongs to winter the pearson s correlations values from 0 9 to 1 are considered strongly related while 0 9 0 4 are considered moderately related and 0 4 0 1 are consider small relation tirkey et al 2017 in summer the ph shows the moderated relation with hardness 0 83 mn 0 64 and pb 0 68 while in winter ph shows strong relation with ca 0 93 and moderated relation with ec 0 84 mg 0 76 na 0 71 and cr 0 42 similarly tds shows the moderated relation with ca 0 66 hco3 0 62 and co 0 65 in summer and pb 0 59 in winter hardness of ground water indicate the strong relation with cl 0 93 and moderated relation with ec 0 89 ca 0 55 mg 0 74 and na 0 88 in summer while it shows moderated relation with ec 0 48 ca 0 78 mg 0 72 na 0 69 cl 0 52 cr 0 56 cu 0 87 and ni 0 56 in winter ecs show a strong relation with so4 2 0 94 and moderated correlation with cd 0 73 co 0 63 and pb 0 76 in summer and strong relation with cl 0 94 and moderated relation with ca 0 83 na 0 44 and co3 0 49 in winter the competitive cations ca and k show the strong relation with co3 0 93 cl 0 98 respectively while moderated relation of ca na cl so4 as and co mg co na hco3 and ca and k ni in summer in winter the competitive cations show the moderated relation of ca na and co mg ni na cr and k cl cd cr and pb in summer the anions cl show a strong correlation with hco3 0 95 while so4 2 and co3 show moderated relation with co3 0 78 and as 0 66 0 41 in winter the anions cl shows a strong correlation with ecs 0 94 while co3 shows moderated relation with ecs 0 48 in summer as co mn ni and pb do not show any relation with others while cu shows strong relation with pb 0 95 and cd and cr shows moderated relation with co 0 45 and mn 0 48 respectively in winter season moderated relation of cd k co co3 and hco3 cr na and k cu co3 mn as ni mg as cr and pb cl hco3 and mn the strong correlation with each other specifies the common dependency and some contributing sources of these parameters in ground water overall this study reveals that most of the parameters show a moderated correlation with each other indicating the mutual source and same origin while some parameters show strong relationship with each other 3 6 2 principal component analysis pca pc analysis was executed affording to the standard procedure defined in the literature gu et al 2020 presented in fig s1 three components were found 45 88 21 871 and 13 546 in summer and 42 88 22 546 and 15 871 in winter respectively in summer pca reveals three important groups of heavy metals studied in ground water samples one group is exceptionally coordinated with co cr and pb which mixed in water by natural and anthropogenic sources mostly pb comes from petrochemical automobile batteries tires and domestic waste in the study areas egbueri 2020 the second group consists of as and ni which contributed to the study area from weathering leaching from domestic effluents sorption and desorption behaviours from these elements ashraf et al 2021 the third group consists of cd cu and mn which contributed to the study area with geogenic activities in winter pca reveals the three groups of heavy metals first group as ni and cr contributed by weathering and leaching of heavy metals from domestic effluents in the second group mn pb and co contributed with natural and anthropogenic sources in third group cd and cu contributed by geogenic activities overall burning fuel paint discharge automobile waste and domestic effluent were released heavy metals into the atmosphere and accumulated in the water proshad et al 2021a 3 6 3 factor analysis fa fa analysis data shown in table s7 in summer four factors with eigen values 1 obtains and they explain the 67 97 of total variance f1 shows the highest loading of as along with significant loading of co and ni supported by their strong cluster on ca f2 shows the highest loading of cd with significant values of ni these metals are mainly contributed by human activities burning fuel paint discharge and domestic effluent saleem et al 2019 f3 and f4 exhibits the highest loading of co cu and co cr respectively the contribution of these metals in ground water is mostly due to the natural and anthropogenic sources saleem et al 2019 in winter three factors with eigen values 1 obtains and they explain the 60 12 of total variance f1 shows the highest loading of cr ni along with significant loading of co cu supported by their strong cluster on ca f2 shows the highest loading of mn with significant values of co f3 exhibits the highest loading of as pb cu with significant loading of co cd due to natural anthropogenic sources and domestic effluents responsible for the contribution of these heavy metals in ground water and these results supported by pca saleem et al 2019 3 6 4 cluster analysis ca cluster analysis with dendrogram by using wards method is shown in fig s2 in summer one cluster was formed between ni as co and pb while other cluster was formed between cd cu and cr and these both clusters associated with mn with a large distance in winter one cluster was formed between cr co cu ni mn while other cluster was formed between as cd and pb and both clusters associated with each other by long distance the fa and ca results for heavy metals in ground water during summer and winter shows some minor differences which is due to the several ecological conditions usual in summer winter as well as calculation methods overall the results of fa are consistent with ca both show a significantly higher anthropogenic contribution of metals and moderated lower diagenetic contributions of metals in the groundwater of lahore city 3 7 health risk assessment 3 7 1 average daily intake adi table 4 shows the adi ingestion dermal values of different age groups this study calculated the long term exposure by multiple exposure routes as 30 years for adults and 6 years for children the calculated mean oral adi values for as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb were 1 34e 03 1 49e 04 1 32e 03 1 30e 03 8 95e 04 5 94e

daily exposure the maximum adi value for all heavy metals is 6 84e 00 for adults and 2 61e 01 for children it has been found that the adi value of children s oral contact with drinking water is higher than that of adults another important way of contact with water is dermal contact the calculated mean dermal adi values for as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb were 1 29e 06 1 42e 07 1 27e 06 1 25e 06 8 57e 07 5 68e 05 4 90e 06 and 1 78e 06 for an adult and 2 47e 06 2 74e 07 2 44e 06 2 42e 06 1 65e 06 1 09e 04 9 42e 06 and 3 42e 06 for the child respectively the adi for adults and children due to dermal contact is 2 10e 02 and 2 40e 02 respectively dermal contact with water in the process of bathing washing swimming etc will have an impact on health in general the calculation is based on the average concentration of each metal in the water at each consumption rate in both seasons the mean adi value for these heavy metals via consumption of groundwater varied in order as mn ni pb cr as co cd cu in both adult and children mn was found to be the major contributor to daily intake of heavy metals by residents of the study area via groundwater cdis of all heavy metals were higher for children in comparison to adults which could be attributed to their low body weight as compared to adults by comparing these adi values with other adi values reported in various study showed the same results obtained in this study as their adi values for adult is always less than children s adi values altaf et al 2021 razzaq et al 2022 murtaza et al 2020 tabassum et al 2019 sharmin et al 2020 tirkey et al 2017 gu et al 2020 3 7 2 non carcinogenic health risk the potential non carcinogenic health risks of heavy metal exposure are calculated from the perspective of the hq accordingly in the case of hq 1 people may have an adverse impact on their health proshad et al 2021b the average ingestion hq values for adults of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb were 4 48e 00 2 97e 01 4 42e 01 4 46e 01 2 24e 02 4 24e 00 2 56e 01 and 5 31e 01 respectively similarly the average ingestion hq values for children of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb for children were 1 19e 01 7 88e 07 1 17e 00 1 19e 00 5 93e 02 1 12e 01 6 78e 01 and 1 41e 00 respectively the average hq dermal values for adults of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb in adults are 4 29e 03 2 85e 04 4 23e 04 4 25e 04 2 14e 05 4 06e 03 2 45e 04 and 5 08e 04 respectively similarly the average hq dermal values for children of as cd co cr cu mn ni and pb in children are 8 25e 03 5 48e 04 8 13e 04 8 15e 04 4 12e 05 7 81e 03 4 71e 04 and 9 78e 03 respectively on the basis of mean hqs it can be summarized that the contribution of heavy metals to the non carcinogenic health risk for both adults and children was in the sequence of as mn pb cr co cd ni cu from table 4 the hq ingestion values of as and mn exceeding from 1 in adults and hq ingestion values of as co cr mn and pb exceeding from 1 in children the finding of this study is consistent with the study reported by khan in this region whose find that non carcinogenic health risk for adult and children by ingestion route khan et al 2021b while several studies has been reported that hq values for all heavy metal for both adults and children is less than 1 which means that s the concentration of trace metals might pose little health effects to the adult and children via oral ingestion and dermal of groundwater zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 thi calculation is used to detect high risks rather than low risks to protect humans the thi ingestion values in adults range from 8 95e 00 to 1 34e 01 with a mean value of 1 11e 01 similarly the thi ingestion values in children range from 2 37e 01 to 3 55e 01 with a mean value of 2 86e 01 the thi dermal values in adults ranged from 8 57e 03 to 1 28e 02 with an average of 1 04e 02 similarly children s dermal thi values ranged from 1 65e 02 to 2 47e 02 with an average of 1 97e 02 the total value of thiingestion 1 which exhibit the high non carcinogenic effect for the resident of these areas and long usage of this polluted water causes health problems while the total thidermal 1 which exhibits the low carcinogenic effect for the peoples of these areas the finding of this study is consistent with the study reported by khan in this region whose find that thi for adult and children by ingestion route is 1 which indicated the high non carcinogenic health risk khan et al 2021b while other studies reported by bodrud doza sharmin zakir and sharma finds that thi values for all heavy metal for both adults and children is less than 1 which means that s the concentration of heavy metals might pose little health effects to the adult and children via oral ingestion and dermal of groundwater zakir et al 2020 sharmin et al 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 3 7 3 carcinogenic health risk the possibility of developing any cancer in the whole life by the exposure of carcinogenic element heavy metals like as cd cr ni and pb contents in drinking water can create cancer when exposed to human beings out of 8 heavy metals only 5 metals have csf values defined by oehha atsdr 2017 the deliberate ilcr values modelled by these heavy metals by ingestion and dermal contact to the citizens of the study areas are shown in table 5 the ilcr due to as through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 1 25e 03 to 2 83e 03 and 1 20e 06 to 2 71e 06 respectively the ilcr due to cd through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 2 39e 05 to 1 02e 04 and 2 29e 08 to 9 72e 08 respectively the ilcr due to cr through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 4 01e 04 to 1 12e 03 and 3 84e 07 to 1 08e 06 respectively the ilcr due to ni through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 6 92e 03 to 1 18e 02 and 6 62e 06 to 1 13e 05 respectively the ilcr due to pb through ingestion and dermal in the adult ranges from 1 38e 05 to 1 72e 05 and 1 32e 08 to 1 65e 08 respectively overall the ilcr values in an adult due to these 5 heavy metals by ingestion is 1 14e 02 which is higher than the permissible limit given by usepa 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 proshad et al 2021b while ilcr values in an adult due to dermal contact is 1 01e 05 which fall within range set by usepa this result shows that in adults developing cancer risk due to cd cr and pb is negligible in all locations while the cancer risk due to as and ni is high by ingestion this water in these study areas the ilcr due to as through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 3 31e 03 to 7 50e 03 and 2 30e 06 to 5 21e 06 respectively the ilcr due to cd through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 6 33e 05 to 2 69e 04 and 4 40e 08 to 1 87e 07 respectively the ilcr due to cr through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 1 06e 03 to 2 98e 03 and 7 38e 07 to 2 07e 06 respectively the ilcr due to ni through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 1 83e 02 to 3 13e 02 and 1 27e 05 to 2 17e 05 respectively the ilcr due to pb through ingestion and dermal in children ranges from 3 65e 05 to 4 57e 05 and 2 53e 08 to 3 17e 08 respectively overall the ilcr values in children due to these 5 heavy metals by ingestion is 3 03e 02 which is higher than the permissible limit given by usepa 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 proshad et al 2021b while ilcr values in children due to dermal contact is 2 11e 05 which fall within range set by usepa these results revealed that cancer risk in children is high for heavy metals as cr and ni while cancer risk for heavy metal cd and pb is negligible for all study sites tcr values in adult and children by ingestion and dermal contact are 1 15e 02 and 3 03e 02 respectively in general the ilcr values inferred those 8 persons in 200 persons developing cancer risk due to heavy metal contamination in drinking water by cumulative ingestion and dermal routes in these areas so peoples of these areas should beware of cancer risk and water should require some treatment before drinking many studies have been completed in different parts of the world whose findings are quite diverse due to different geological conditions and water consumption tabassum et al 2019 proshad et al 2021b shams et al 2022 3 8 monte carlo simulation the monte carlo method was used to simulate the total carcinogenic health risk and comprehensive non carcinogenic risk values for adults and children under drinking water ingestion and dermal contact routes of exposure the simulation results can be used to verify the accuracy of the health risk assessment results the results are shown in fig 11 multiparameter analysis converts uncertainty in the health risk assessment into probability 3 8 1 monte carlo simulation mcs for non cancer risk non carcinogenic risk values for drinking water ingestion and dermal exposure pathways were simulated by using monte carlo methods ramesh et al 2021 histogram shows the non carcinogenic risk thi values at 5 and 95 confidence levels and predicted values after 10 000 random simulations the output fitting results followed the beta and gamma in adults and children respectively according to the simulation in fig 10 the 95th percentile value of thi for adult and children were 4 78e 01 and 2 78e 01 respectively all percentile values were higher than 1 indicating that the health risks caused by the non carcinogenic heavy metals are high eslami et al 2021 3 8 2 monte carlo simulation mcs for carcinogenic risk the probability of carcinogenic risk was estimated by using the monte carlo simulation mcs from the combined pathways of ingestion and dermal contact histogram shows the carcinogenic health risk values at 5 and 95 confidence levels and the predicted values after 10 000 random simulations the output fitting results followed the weibull and gamma in adults and children respectively according to the simulation in fig 11 the 95th percentile value of tcr for adults and children were 5 09e 02 and 2 95e 02 respectively the maximum acceptable carcinogenic risk recommended by the usepa is 1 10 4 and the probability of exceeding 1 10 4 is 100 indicating that carcinogenic heavy metals pose a certain safety risk to human health according to the uncertainty in the selected parameters monte carlo simulation was applied to determine the sensitivity different parameter variables have different sensitivities to carcinogenic risk the sensitivity chart fig 12 revealed that concentration of as ni and pb in groundwater were the most significant metals in developing cancer in adult along with other metals such as cd and cr while concentration of cr and ni in groundwater were the significant metals in developing cancer in children along with other metals such as as cd and pb in children ef was indicated as the most significant factor in cancer risk the more often discrete exposure events occur the higher the possibility that children will be at risk of cancer hence children should reduce their consumption of drinking water that contains harmful metals children absorb more metal than adults due to their body ratio while the contribution of wb sa and other parameters were recorded below 1 indicating a low effect which can be ignored the content of carcinogenic heavy metal elements generates a greater impact on the risk value 4 conclusion groundwater is a major source of drinking water in most parts of pakistan so it s crucial to assess the quality of groundwater the quality of groundwater is determined by analyzing its physiochemical characteristics and heavy metals this study revealed the heavy metals variation in both seasons summer and winter the mean con centration mg l of as 0 036 and 0 051 cd 0 004 and 0 005 co 0 041 and 0 044 cr 0 033 and 0 042 mn 0 414 and 0 494 ni 0 142 and 0 183 and pb 0 068 and 0 048 were found high then permissible range set by who and pak epa while cu 0 025 and 0 032 was inacceptable range in water samples collected from study areas ca and pca are used to identify the source of heavy metals in groundwater according to the dwqi and hmei estimates the majority of the samples were of poor quality and moderately polluted by heavy metals the hq ingestion and hi ingestion 1 indicate both have non carcinogenic health hazards adults and children the ilcr deals with consumption of groundwater by adults 1 13e 02 and children 3 03e 02 which was found to be higher than the usepa set limit 1 0e 06 1 0e 04 which suggested a potential cancer risk hence current study suggests that drinking low quality water over the long term could be harmful to human health in terms of carcinogenic health risks this study found that 8 out of 200 people may acquire cancer during their lifetime owing to long term exposure to arsenic cadmium and nickel contaminated water as a result individuals in the research region should be aware of this risk and take appropriate individual and government steps such as boiling filtration precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis and electrodialysis to improve the quality of drinking water and groundwater credit author statement changlin jia investigation methodology formal analysis writing original
