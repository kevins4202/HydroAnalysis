12485,there is an extensive body of knowledge pertaining to the treatment of winery wastewater and other acidic effluents in biosand reactors this manuscript compares the performance of biosand reactors containing raw sand and fractionated sand fractionation of sand particles 0 425 mm removed increased the hydraulic conductivity of the sand matrix 9 fold when compared to raw sand from 0 285 mm s 1 to 2 50 mm s 1 and 0 129 mm s 1 to 1 11 mm mm s 1 before and after start up respectively similar results for both sands were obtained in terms of organic removal performance 94 and 95 respectively and neutralization of acidic ph 4 9 winery wastewater results indicate that one 5 6 m3 biosand reactor module containing 2 9 m3 of fractionated sand can theoretically treat 8102 l d 1 which is the approximate volume generated from wineries crushing 329 to 547 t of grapes per annum this is notably higher than the design flow rate of 1000 l d 1 in used in a pilot system containing raw sand furthermore a zero waste biosand reactor model is presented for treatment of winery wastewater the strategy includes reuse of treated effluent for irrigation anaerobic digestion of primary

generate solid wastes by products and winery wastewater ww many solid waste streams including lees and marc are valorised on site or in dedicated biorefineries 5 but due to its nature ww has little beneficial use winery wastewater fluctuates in physiochemical quality with the highest organic and volumetric loads occurring during the crush harvest period 6 8 after primary settling and ph adjustment beneficial irrigation is often used as a means of ww disposal particularly in water stressed countries 9 depending on cellar activities and practices the ww can contain high concentrations of organic molecules and inorganics for example high sodium na loads can emanate from the ubiquitous use of the relatively inexpensive and effective cleaning product sodium carbonate na2co3 6 polyphenolics in ww can be phytotoxic and highly saline ww may cause some soils to become sodic 6 10 12 irrigation with untreated ww can therefore pose a threat to the receiving environment it is therefore prudent to remediate ww before discharge on land or to aquatic environments there are several ww treatment options available which vary in cost complexity and efficiency the challenge for designers of ww treatment systems is the seasonal variability in the quality and quantity of ww 13 15 depending on the local legislation the amount of ww generated and the location of the cellar different levels of remediation may be required while complex treatment systems may be effective they are generally not applicable for smaller wineries due to cost and staff constraints 16 constructed treatment wetlands have been extensively used as passive ww treatment systems but typically have large spatial footprints and the ww may be phytotoxic to the plants 17 biosand reactors bsrs alternatively known as biological sand filters or unplanted constructed treatment wetlands are cost effective require minimal maintenance and provide an environment for biodegradation of the organic fraction of ww and neutralization of acidic ww after start up the hydraulic conductivity hc of the bsrs decreases due to the formation of functional biomass this is inversely correlated with organic loading and therefore reversible so that the systems do not require backwashing after the crush season even after long term operation 18 21 when operated in vertical mode bsrs have smaller spatial footprints and higher specific organic removal rates orr than other passive treatment systems and can be retrofitted to existing treatment systems 21 one of the challenges that has previously been associated with pilot bsrs is the large up to 95 reduction in the hc of the sand due to build up of biomass during ww treatment 21 the biomass is a necessary functional component of bsrs and is most abundant during periods of high organic loading during this time it retards the flow of ww causing a transient reduction in the hydraulic capacity of bsrs 18 21 22 the size of sand particles is a critical factor governing the hc of soil and sand environments with liquid flow rates increasing as particles increase in size 22 23 it was therefore hypothesized that i the hydraulic performance of bsrs during the crush period could be improved by fractionating the sand and using only the larger sand particles in the systems and ii the smaller sand particles could be used for another purpose for example smaller sand particles are more desirable in self compacting concrete scc mixes 24 the proposed dual usage of the sand feeds into the principles of a circular economy in passive treatment systems there is theoretically a balance between hydraulic retention time hrt and remediation efficiency 25 26 and functional microbial communities are influenced by the character of sand particles in bsrs 27 it was therefore recognized that the fractionation strategy could have a negative impact on bsr performance column replicates containing raw or fractionated sand particles 0 425 mm were therefore used to compare i the hc before and after build up of biomass consequent to feeding with ww ii organic removal rates and iii ww neutralization rates this study is the final in a series of studies pertaining to remediation of ww in bsrs the manuscript therefore contains a section exploring the holistic use of bsrs and proposed ancillary methods for treating ww and ww sludge in the context of resource utilization and reuse for a bio circular economy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operation the experimental set up consisted of six identical clear 2000 mm tall polyvinyl chloride pvc columns with internal diameters of 105 mm fig 1a each column contained approximately 20 kg of sand to a height of 1450 mm table 1 the columns were operated in triplicate with one set containing raw unfractionated sand and the second containing sand with all particles 0 425 mm removed fractionated sand fig 2 the raw sand has an effective size uniformity coefficient and fineness modulus of d10 0 36 2 3 and 1 67 respectively and d10 0 36 2 0 and 2 78 respectively for the fractionated sand to prevent sand washout and to ensure permanent saturation but unimpeded flow when required during operation a complex sealing system consisting of gaskets mesh screens spigots backing rings and ball valves were installed at the bottom outlet of each column to increase the column lengths for sand hc measurements spigots and backing rings were also installed at the top of the columns fig 1b c for the hc tests the outlet piping was removed from the columns so that the flow was only restricted by the 50 mm ball valves to increase the hydraulic head temporary 2000 mm column lengths were joined to the top of the columns above the mesh and a stopwatch was used to measure the time it took for the water level to drop each 200 mm with the final measurement being taken at a hydraulic head of 1520 mm hc measurements for each column were conducted in triplicate for the performance evaluation experiments each column was fed with ww the hydraulic loading rate hlr was calculated in terms of the volume of sand within the column as previously described 18 table 1 the columns were fed via ivac volumetric pumps model 597 at a rate of 2 4 l day 1 with operational parameters as shown in table 1 all the pumps were fed from the same holding vessel to ensure influent consistency approximately 3 kg of sand was extracted from an operational bsr system containing functional biomass 21 distilled water was added to the extracted sand and sonicated after the initial hc test the columns were allowed to drain for 48 h then inoculated with 1 l of the supernatant fluid from the sonicated sand to the top of each column which were then allowed to acclimate for 14 days after inoculation starting at days 0 21 42 63 84 105 and 126 the columns were fed with different batches of ww at 100 ml h 1 for the allotted volume sampled and outlet was closed till the next dosing table 2 during the start up period days 0 to 83 the ww was diluted with filtered water and the columns were fed with ww in increasing concentrations to allow the functional microbial communities to gradually acclimate to the ww this incremental priming has been shown to increase system performance in bsrs 28 the systems were considered operational from day 84 table 2 range hrt hydraulic

no 1 09001 0500 total alkalinity was measured using the merck titrimetric method with titration pipette mquant catalogue number 1 111109 0001 according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 3 characterisation of sand the particle size distribution was performed using the sans 3001 method ag1 pr5 ag21 by cetlab south africa fractionated samples of sand analysed by automated scanning electron microscopy using a fei qemscan quantitive evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy instrument thermo fisher scientific waltham usa and idiscover software the roundness and aspect ratios of the different mineral fractions determined using the idiscover software were used to compare the shapes and sizes of particles with different mineral composition as previously described 23 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance the saturated hc is the intrinsic value which describes the rate at which fluid moves though a saturated porous media and is affected by the porosity of the medium particle packing particle size 23 and uniformity of the particles 22 in this study indices obtained via qemscan were used to compare the morphologies of the raw and fractionated sand 23 30 for the raw sand the quartz and calcite contributions were 81 3 wt wt and 17 6 wt wt while for the fractionated sand they were 74 0 wt wt and 9 6 wt wt respectively computer generated images of the morphology and mineralogy of the raw and fractionated sand obtained using via qemscan are shown in fig 3 additional information of the character of the raw sand can be found in literature 22 23 it was previously established that the hc of the sand with the smaller fractions 0 6 mm removed exhibited a significantly higher p 0 05 hc 2 75 0 02 mm s 1 than the raw sand 0 41 0 10 mm s 1 but the relative losses in hc due to the formation of functional biomass were not determined 19 22 in this study the hc results before and after biomass formation were very similar to those obtained in an earlier experiment conducted using columns containing a batch of sand from the same quarry site fed with synthetic ww for 14 weeks 22 the initial comparative hc values of the raw sand batches were 0 28 0 05 mm s 1 this study and 0 284 mm s 1 22 with respective reductions in hc due to the growth of functional biomass of 52 3 6 and 52 for the fractionated sand the initial hc of 2 50 0 20 mm s 1 reduced by 55 4 2 after feeding with ww for 19 weeks but the hc average 1 15 0 081 mm s 1 was still 4 fold higher than the initial hc of the raw sand fig 4 the hc results were applied to a pilot bsr system with a novel design 21 shown in fig 5 in the system pre settled ww is applied to the surface of the bsr modules and flows passively through the system as indicated in the diagram the adjustable outlets allow the hlr to be manipulated by changing the hydraulic head to the maximum rate dictated by the hc it was found that the range of possible flow rates was considerably greater when using fractionated sand in comparison to raw sand in the bsr modules fig 6 when the pilot system was operated with raw sand and a hydraulic head of 0 8 m the maximum achievable flow rate during the crush season was 250 l d 1 per module 21 by applying the hc results obtained in the column experiments containing fractionated sand it was calculated that this rate could theoretically be increased to 114 681 l d 1 before and 5455 l d 1 after biomass accumulation during the crush season this would reduce the hrt for the reactor module to 17 8 h during the crush season fig 6 in reality the maximum operational flow with a hydraulic head of 0 8 m would be limited to 8102 l d 1 which equates to a hlr of 3212 l m 3of sand d 1 in order to provide sufficient hrt 12h for bioremediation of the ww in other words when calculating the ww volume generated tonne of grapes crushed previously formulated 31 one bsr module containing fractionated sand would be required for wineries that crush 547 t or 329 t of grapes respectively producing 50 or 80 of their ww during the crush season in comparison a single bsr module would be capable of treating the ww from wineries crushing approximately three times as many grapes when applying the ww generation volume of 3 05 m3 ww tonne of grapes crushed formulated by another group of researchers 32 3 2 remediation performance of biosand filters with fractionated and raw sand 3 2 1 organic removal rates due to the organic nature of ww the organic fraction was measured using cod as a proxy 6 it has been conclusively established that bsrs containing raw sand are capable of significantly reducing the cod of ww including the concentrations of polyphenolics 18 21 33 34 a pilot system containing raw sand was able to treat ww at higher organic loading rates 279 g cod m 3 of sand day 1 with a smaller spatial footprint than reported for other passive systems constructed treatment wetlands 21 in this study the use of fractionated sand had a positive influence not only on hydraulic performance but on cod removal efficiency fig 7a the cod removal efficiencies in the columns containing raw and fractionated sand ranged from 71 to 94 and 74 to 95 respectively for the final sampling instance with the most concentrated ww the organic removal efficiency in the columns containing fractionated sand was 95 1 with influent and effluent concentrations of 4681 mg l 1 and 222 mg l 1 43 respectively this was comparable with the 94 1 organic removal efficiency and effluent concentration of 298 mg l 1 61 obtained with the raw sand fig 7a the trend continued with the removal of total polyphenolics with the fractionated sand columns having slightly higher removal efficiencies 87 to 94 than the raw sand columns 87 to 93 with influent values ranging from 10 4 to 55 3 mg gae l 1 fig 7b 3 2 2 neutralization of acidic winery wastewater winery wastewater is typically acidic which may have a negative impact on the receiving environment it has been established that bsrs are capable of neutralizing acidic ww and increasing the sodium adsorption ratio sar 18 the main ph adjustment mechanism in bsrs is via abiotic dissolution of calcite 19 23 but biotic mechanisms are also involved 19 it is possible that some calcite solubilises and then re precipitates when the ww flows through bsrs and becomes less acidic however qemscan results have shown that no other ca based minerals such as anhydrite or gypsum are formed 19 23 the longevity of bsr systems in terms of calcite dissolution capacity is beyond the projected life of the systems with a lifespan of 37 years being calculated using data from column and in situ experiments for systems containing approximately 10 calcite furthermore it has been shown that loss of calcite particles does not have a deleterious effect p 0 05 on the hc 23 in this study the ph in the final effluent from the columns containing both raw and fractionated sand was slightly alkaline with no significant p 0 5 differences between effluent values in the final sampling instance the ph of the acidic ww increased from 4 86 to 8 13 0 17 and 8 10 0 14 after treatment in the columns containing raw and fractionated sand respectively fig 7c there were temporal changes over the sampling period for both total alkalinity and ec of the effluent ww fig 7d e both of these parameters increased when the columns were fed with more concentrated ww with lower ph values supporting previous results that showed that calcite dissolution increases with decreases in acidity 19 23 overall the result showed that fractionation of sand did not have a negative impact on the ww ph neutralization mechanisms 3 2 3 comparison of hydraulic and organic loading of biosand reactors with other passive treatment systems treating winery wastewater the theoretical organic loading rates olr and hlrs loading rates measured in the pilot bsr system containing raw sand were notably higher than in other passive systems treating ww translating into a comparatively lower spatial footprint 21 based on the results obtained from this study when using fractionated sand and applying a hydraulic head of 0 8 m fig 5 the theoretical olrs and hlrs after biomass accumulation during the crush season were typically an order of magnitude higher than in other systems including the pilot bsr system containing raw sand table 3 3 3 sustainable and circular economy approach for valorisation of winery wastewater towards zero waste for wineries circular economy principles have been envisaged evaluated and or applied in the wine industry for a range of products services and solid wastes by products these include wine packaging 43 multiple external and internal stakeholder engagements and activities 44 biorefineries for the extraction of tartrates antioxidants and other value added products from grape pomace and lees 7 8 and the use of solids wastes for animal feed and composting passive systems such as constructed treatment wetlands and bsrs are sustainable options for remediation of ww 17 18 20 21 45 building on the results obtained from previous studies a circular economy and zero waste model for ww remediation and valorisation based on the use of bsrs is proposed fig 8 the intention is to promote the design and implementation of integrated sustainable systems for reuse and recycling of ww and primary winery wastewater sludge pwws in order to contribute to minimizing waste formation and maximizing resource recovery in wineries 46 in comparison to other passive treatment systems bsrs containing fractionated sand particles 0 425 mm are envisaged to have even smaller spatial footprints and higher olrs than previous systems containing raw sand section 3 2 2 19 as alluded to in section 3 1 it is feasible that these new bsr systems can be implemented at wineries crushing around 547 t of grapes and generating 1507 m3 of ww or less per annum taking into account 50 peak flows during the crush period this amount of ww can theoretically be treated using just one 5 6 m3 bsr module containing 2 9 m3 of sand the ww treatment capacity can be increased by adding additional modules where practically possible table 4 alternatively the size of the modules may be increased while sand containing larger particles is more desirable for use in bsrs the cost of fractionating the sand can be offset by using the finer sand fractions for example scc in the building industry 24 remediation of ww using bsrs renders it suitable for irrigation purposes reducing water consumption which is important in water stressed wine producing areas such as south africa australia and california usa 47 48 before ww is remediated in bsrs the solids are removed using primary settling in a survey conducted in south africa 25 of wineries indicated that they use commercial companies to remove pwss and dump it in landfills this is an economic and environmental burden on the industry and is more likely to take place in medium and larger wineries than smaller wineries in addition medium large wineries tend to dispose of pwws more frequently than smaller wineries 49 50 in another study it was found that the na in ww does not partition into the pwws and that it is amendable to anaerobic digestion ad generating up to 206 2 7 ml ch4 gvsadded 5 these results suggest that it may be feasible for biogas generated from co digestion of pwws and other available organic substrates to be used as part of a renewable energy mix in wineries 5 51 in addition it was shown that the digestate from ad of pwws has potential as an organic agricultural fertilizer as it contains micronutrients and high concentrations of n 21 5 to 27 7 g kg dry weight and c 229 to 277 g kg dry weight 5 in summary based on the results of this research and previous findings the a zero waste model is proposed which consists of the following objectives i to fractionate sand and use the fraction with larger particles 0 425 mm in bsrs and the smaller fraction in high performance concrete i e scc ii to remediate ww in bsrs and use the treated effluent for irrigation iii to digest pwws and use the biogas for energy and the digestate as an agricultural fertilizer fig 8 data for different size categories of wineries generating different volumes of ww are provided in table 4 the volume and character of ww is incumbent on cellar practices and differs from winery to winery 6 32 52 in most cases the highest volume of ww up to 80 is usually generated during the standard three month crush period but this figure can vary quite widely for example some wineries do not crush while other do not bottle on site and a number of wineries have bottling facilities which will result in greatly different flow rates with the latter generating considerable quantities outside the crush season 17 53 54 table 4 provides data that can assist practitioners to capacitate integrated bsr systems for different sized wineries based on the amount of grapes crushed per annum and maximum peak flows 50 80 during crush period the amount of methane generated can be estimated using the volume of total sludge ts 2261 mg ts l 1 of wastewater 49 in press converting the ts to volatile solids vs ts vs ratio of 0 675 and vf to methane 191 5 mlch4 gvs 1 5 in addition the average calorific value of 6 kwh m3 and a conversion efficiency of 35 was used to calculate the electricity generation 56 for example a winery crushing 1000 t of grapes would require 3 bsr modules with fractionated sand if 80 of the ww is produced in the crush the sludge would potentially yield 1266 kwh of electricity from the methane 4 conclusion to conclude a circular economy approach for the treatment and valorisation of waste gives a purpose and a value to waste the bsr system containing raw sand has a proven track record in terms of treatment of ww previously a drawback was associated with reduction in hc due to the accumulation of functional biomass during the crush season that reduced the bsr treatment capacity to below the design limit this study showed that the hc and flow rate can be increase 9 fold by using fractionated sand with the smaller particles removed with the experimental test setup bsr columns containing fractionated sand also showed excellent organic removal efficiencies and increased the ph of acidic ww with a zero waste model it is suggested that the larger fraction of sand 0 425 mm is used in bsrs and the smaller fraction in high performance concretes the solid fraction of ww can be anaerobically digested producing biogas which may be used for energy and digestate used as an agricultural fertilizer the quality of the remediated ww is acceptable for irrigation purposes funding this work was

mm s 1 but the relative losses in hc due to the formation of functional biomass were not determined 19 22 in this study the hc results before and after biomass formation were very similar to those obtained in an earlier experiment conducted using columns containing a batch of sand from the same quarry site fed with synthetic ww for 14 weeks 22 the initial comparative hc values of the raw sand batches were 0 28 0 05 mm s 1 this study and 0 284 mm s 1 22 with respective reductions in hc due to the growth of functional biomass of 52 3 6 and 52 for the fractionated sand the initial hc of 2 50 0 20 mm s 1 reduced by 55 4 2 after feeding with ww for 19 weeks but the hc average 1 15 0 081 mm s 1 was still 4 fold higher than the initial hc of the raw sand fig 4 the hc results were applied to a pilot bsr system with a novel design 21 shown in fig 5 in the system pre settled ww is applied to the surface of the bsr modules and flows passively through the system as indicated in the diagram the adjustable outlets allow the hlr to be manipulated by changing the hydraulic head to the maximum rate dictated by the hc it was found that the range of possible flow rates was considerably greater when using fractionated sand in comparison to raw sand in the bsr modules fig 6 when the pilot system was operated with raw sand and a hydraulic head of 0 8 m the maximum achievable flow rate during the crush season was 250 l d 1 per module 21 by applying the hc results obtained in the column experiments containing fractionated sand it was calculated that this rate could theoretically be increased to 114 681 l d 1 before and 5455 l d 1 after biomass accumulation during the crush season this would reduce the hrt for the reactor module to 17 8 h during the crush season fig 6 in reality the maximum operational flow with a hydraulic head of 0 8 m would be limited to 8102 l d 1 which equates to a hlr of 3212 l m 3of sand d 1 in order to provide sufficient hrt 12h for bioremediation of the ww in other words when calculating the ww volume generated tonne of grapes crushed previously formulated 31 one bsr module containing fractionated sand would be required for wineries that crush 547 t or 329 t of grapes respectively producing 50 or 80 of their ww during the crush season in comparison a single bsr module would be capable of treating the ww from wineries crushing approximately three times as many grapes when applying the ww generation volume of 3 05 m3 ww tonne of grapes crushed formulated by another group of researchers 32 3 2 remediation performance of biosand filters with fractionated and raw sand 3 2 1 organic removal rates due to the organic nature of ww the organic fraction was measured using cod as a proxy 6 it has been conclusively established that bsrs containing raw sand are capable of significantly reducing the cod of ww including the concentrations of polyphenolics 18 21 33 34 a pilot system containing raw sand was able to treat ww at higher organic loading rates 279 g cod m 3 of sand day 1 with a smaller spatial footprint than reported for other passive systems constructed treatment wetlands 21 in this study the use of fractionated sand had a positive influence not only on hydraulic performance but on cod removal efficiency fig 7a the cod removal efficiencies in the columns containing raw and fractionated sand ranged from 71 to 94 and 74 to 95 respectively for the final sampling instance with the most concentrated ww the organic removal efficiency in the columns containing fractionated sand was 95 1 with influent and effluent concentrations of 4681 mg l 1 and 222 mg l 1 43 respectively this was comparable with the 94 1 organic removal efficiency and effluent concentration of 298 mg l 1 61 obtained with the raw sand fig 7a the trend continued with the removal of total polyphenolics with the fractionated sand columns having slightly higher removal efficiencies 87 to 94 than the raw sand columns 87 to 93 with influent values ranging from 10 4 to 55 3 mg gae l 1 fig 7b 3 2 2 neutralization of acidic winery wastewater winery wastewater is typically acidic which may have a negative impact on the receiving environment it has been established that bsrs are capable of neutralizing acidic ww and increasing the sodium adsorption ratio sar 18 the main ph adjustment mechanism in bsrs is via abiotic dissolution of calcite 19 23 but biotic mechanisms are also involved 19 it is possible that some calcite solubilises and then re precipitates when the ww flows through bsrs and becomes less acidic however qemscan results have shown that no other ca based minerals such as anhydrite or gypsum are formed 19 23 the longevity of bsr systems in terms of calcite dissolution capacity is beyond the projected life of the systems with a lifespan of 37 years being calculated using data from column and in situ experiments for systems containing approximately 10 calcite furthermore it has been shown that loss of calcite particles does not have a deleterious effect p 0 05 on the hc 23 in this study the ph in the final effluent from the columns containing both raw and fractionated sand was slightly alkaline with no significant p 0 5 differences between effluent values in the final sampling instance the ph of the acidic ww increased from 4 86 to 8 13 0 17 and 8 10 0 14 after treatment in the columns containing raw and fractionated sand respectively fig 7c there were temporal changes over the sampling period for both total alkalinity and ec of the effluent ww fig 7d e both of these parameters increased when the columns were fed with more concentrated ww with lower ph values supporting previous results that showed that calcite dissolution increases with decreases in acidity 19 23 overall the result showed that fractionation of sand did not have a negative impact on the ww ph neutralization mechanisms 3 2 3 comparison of hydraulic and organic loading of biosand reactors with other passive treatment systems treating winery wastewater the theoretical organic loading rates olr and hlrs loading rates measured in the pilot bsr system containing raw sand were notably higher than in other passive systems treating ww translating into a comparatively lower spatial footprint 21 based on the results obtained from this study when using fractionated sand and applying a hydraulic head of 0 8 m fig 5 the theoretical olrs and hlrs after biomass accumulation during the crush season were typically an order of magnitude higher than in other systems including the pilot bsr system containing raw sand table 3 3 3 sustainable and circular economy approach for valorisation of winery wastewater towards zero waste for wineries circular economy principles have been envisaged evaluated and or applied in the wine industry for a range of products services and solid wastes by products these include wine packaging 43 multiple external and internal stakeholder engagements and activities 44 biorefineries for the extraction of tartrates antioxidants and other value added products from grape pomace and lees 7 8 and the use of solids wastes for animal feed and composting passive systems such as constructed treatment wetlands and bsrs are sustainable options for remediation of ww 17 18 20 21 45 building on the results obtained from previous studies a circular economy and zero waste model for ww remediation and valorisation based on the use of bsrs is proposed fig 8 the intention is to promote the design and implementation of integrated sustainable systems for reuse and recycling of ww and primary winery wastewater sludge pwws in order to contribute to minimizing waste formation and maximizing resource recovery in wineries 46 in comparison to other passive treatment systems bsrs containing fractionated sand particles 0 425 mm are envisaged to have even smaller spatial footprints and higher olrs than previous systems containing raw sand section 3 2 2 19 as alluded to in section 3 1 it is feasible that these new bsr systems can be implemented at wineries crushing around 547 t of grapes and generating 1507 m3 of ww or less per annum taking into account 50 peak flows during the crush period this amount of ww can theoretically be treated using just one 5 6 m3 bsr module containing 2 9 m3 of sand the ww treatment capacity can be increased by adding additional modules where practically possible table 4 alternatively the size of the modules may be increased while sand containing larger particles is more desirable for use in bsrs the cost of fractionating the sand can be offset by using the finer sand fractions for example scc in the building industry 24 remediation of ww using bsrs renders it suitable for irrigation purposes reducing water consumption which is important in water stressed wine producing areas such as south africa australia and california usa 47 48 before ww is remediated in bsrs the solids are removed using primary settling in a survey conducted in south africa 25 of wineries indicated that they use commercial companies to remove pwss and dump it in landfills this is an economic and environmental burden on the industry and is more likely to take place in medium and larger wineries than smaller wineries in addition medium large wineries tend to dispose of pwws more frequently than smaller wineries 49 50 in another study it was found that the na in ww does not partition into the pwws and that it is amendable to anaerobic digestion ad generating up to 206 2 7 ml ch4 gvsadded 5 these results suggest that it may be feasible for biogas generated from co digestion of pwws and other available organic substrates to be used as part of a renewable energy mix in wineries 5 51 in addition it was shown that the digestate from ad of pwws has potential as an organic agricultural fertilizer as it contains micronutrients and high concentrations of n 21 5 to 27 7 g kg dry weight and c 229 to 277 g kg dry weight 5 in summary based on the results of this research and previous findings the a zero waste model is proposed which consists of the following objectives i to fractionate sand and use the fraction with larger particles 0 425 mm in bsrs and the smaller fraction in high performance concrete i e scc ii to remediate ww in bsrs and use the treated effluent for irrigation iii to digest pwws and use the biogas for energy and the digestate as an agricultural fertilizer fig 8 data for different size categories of wineries generating different volumes of ww are provided in table 4 the volume and character of ww is incumbent on cellar practices and differs from winery to winery 6 32 52 in most cases the highest volume of ww up to 80 is usually generated during the standard three month crush period but this figure can vary quite widely for example some wineries do not crush while other do not bottle on site and a number of wineries have bottling facilities which will result in greatly different flow rates with the latter generating considerable quantities outside the crush season 17 53 54 table 4 provides data that can assist practitioners to capacitate integrated bsr systems for different sized wineries based on the amount of grapes crushed per annum and maximum peak flows 50 80 during crush period the amount of methane generated can be estimated using the volume of total sludge ts 2261 mg ts l 1 of wastewater 49 in press converting the ts to volatile solids vs ts vs ratio of 0 675 and vf to methane 191 5 mlch4 gvs 1 5 in addition the average calorific value of 6 kwh m3 and a conversion efficiency of 35 was used to calculate the electricity generation 56 for example a winery crushing 1000 t of grapes would require 3 bsr modules with fractionated sand if 80 of the ww is produced in the crush the sludge would potentially yield 1266 kwh of electricity from the methane 4 conclusion to conclude a circular economy approach for the treatment and valorisation of waste gives a purpose and a value to waste the bsr system containing raw sand has a proven track record in terms of treatment of ww previously a drawback was associated with reduction in hc due to the accumulation of functional biomass during the crush season that reduced the bsr treatment capacity to below the design limit this study showed that the hc and flow rate can be increase 9 fold by using fractionated sand with the smaller particles removed with the experimental test setup bsr columns containing fractionated sand also showed excellent organic removal efficiencies and increased the ph of acidic ww with a zero waste model it is suggested that the larger fraction of sand 0 425 mm is used in bsrs and the smaller fraction in high performance concretes the solid fraction of ww can be anaerobically digested producing biogas which may be used for energy and digestate used as an agricultural fertilizer the quality of the remediated ww is acceptable for irrigation purposes funding this work was

12486,a2bo4 type perovskite with ruddlesden popper structure performed favorable catalytic activity in the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants than abo3 but the higher forming temperature limits its further application in this work a series of a site sr doped la2coo4 Î´ perovskites were prepared and used for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc the introduction of sr lowered the formation temperature of the perovskite and improved the catalytic capability the lasrcoo4 perovskite with 50 sr doping possessed the best tc degradation efficiency complete degradation in 14 min besides to overcome the mass transfer limitation caused by catalyst powder agglomeration and the difficulty of recovery perovskite powder catalysts were embedded in polyacrylonitrile pan ultrafiltration membrane by phase conversion method the resulting pan lsc catalytic separation membranes achieved efficient degradation of tc due to the partial increase in the concentration of contaminants inside the membrane pores the membrane embedded with 5 wt lasrcoo4 perovskite degraded 94 tc in 3 min which improved over 24 compared to the perovskite powder the catalytic degradation mechanism of tc and the toxicity of the intermediates were then analyzed the effectiveness of catalytic membranes in practical applications was also evaluated overall pan lsc membranes provide the potential for rapid purification of organic wastewater keywords a2bo4 type perovskite catalytic membrane peroxymonosulfate tetracycline hydrochloride data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is an inevitable problem for the development of human society with the frequent usage of drugs and the development of aquaculture antibiotics represented by tetracycline hydrochloride tc are gradually accumulating in surface water basins which not only causes water pollution issues but also has the pitfall of leading to the evolution of drug resistant strains posing a major threat to aquatic organisms and human health 1 3 according to the antibiotic pollution map of the chinese academy of sciences 6100 tons of tc are released into the soil and groundwater environment each year 4 traditional methods such as biodegradation and physical adsorption are difficult to completely remove tc owing to its poor biodegradability 5 8 thus an increasing number of researches aim to find green effective and cost efficient technologies to achieve rapid tc degradation in water bodies 9 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have emerged as a potential technology for the degradation of difficult pollutants in wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency 10 sr aops generate sulfate radicals so4 through the breakage of peroxy bonds o o in peroxymonosulfates pms and the so4 with strong oxidizing ability can achieve the oxidation or partial mineralization of pollutants 11 pms can be generated by heat ultrasound ultraviolet light electro chemical methods transition metal and carbon based catalysts and integrated processes between them 12 in particular the use of catalysts for pms activation has the advantage of high activation efficiency and low cost and energy input since homogeneous catalysis causes secondary pollution to water bodies and the recovery of catalyst is difficult to achieve 13 a variety of heterogeneous catalysts transition metal oxides nitrides sulfides carbon based materials etc have been used to activate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants 14 16 in recent years abo3 type perovskites have gradually gained increasing attention in order to further pursue higher catalytic activity 17 typical abo3 type perovskite oxides generally include rare earth or alkaline earth metal cations at the a site transition metal cations at the b site and o anions perovskite oxide catalysts offer various benefits such as good structural stability and electron transfer capability 18 in comparison with abo3 type perovskite ruddlesden popper type perovskite with layered structure possesses better surface exchange and volume diffusion coefficients of oxygen and thus exhibits higher stability and redox ability 19 this structure consists of n layers of abo3 perovskite plates stacked along the c axis with rock salt layers ao and the general formula of perovskite can be expressed as a2bo4 when n is 1 20 a2bo4 type perovskite has a good thermal stability and a high ionic conductivity a few studies have applied a2bo4 type perovskite for the activation of pms and demonstrated that la2cuo4 Î´ la2coo4 Î´ and lasrco0 8fe0 2o4 Î´ catalysts have superior catalytic ability than abo3 type perovskite 21 23 noteworthy the great design flexibility of perovskite oxide permits the adjustment of catalyst lattice structure together with the oxidation state of transition metal elements by simple doping strategy 24 recent studies have concluded that doping at the a site of perovskite is an effective method to improve catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalysis 25 cheng et al introduced sr into the a site of lafeo3 perovskite and found that the doped perovskite enhanced the degradation rate of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by 5 7 times 12 gao et al similarly demonstrated that sr doping at the a site increased the surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite and substantially enhanced the activation efficiency of pms 26 however the modification of a site doping on the catalytic activity of a2bo4 type perovskite remains to be further investigated besides the synthesis of co based a2bo4 perovskite with the high catalytic activity is often accompanied by high pressure or temperature above 1000 c which limits further applications the application of perovskite catalysts in sr aops still faces some significant challenges the leaching of toxic metal ions and the difficulty of recovering the powder catalyst are inevitable problems for the long term operation of perovskite catalysts 27 besides natural organic matter nom in the wastewater may potentially cover the active site of the catalyst and negatively affect the degradation 28 to address these issues loading heterogeneous catalysts into membrane substrates with selective separation capabilities is a promising concept 29 31 under external pressure the effluent flows through the catalytic membrane and large molecule pollutants are blocked by size sieving while small molecule organic pollutants enter the membrane pores and combine with the uniformly dispersed catalysts thus achieving the simultaneous separation degradation process 32 33 this continuous operation not only contributes to the rapid removal of degradation products from the catalyst surface and improves the degradation efficiency but also helps to reduce the leaching of metal ions from the catalyst 34 in addition the tortuous path of the membrane pores leads to an increased partial concentration of contaminants which strengthens the mass transfer and therefore contributes to the degradation efficiency of the catalyst 35 nevertheless the activity of catalytic membranes remains to be further improved despite some studies have attempted to combine perovskite catalysts with membranes herein a site sr doped la2coo4 Î´ perovskite catalysts were synthesized by a typical sol gel method at a lower calcination temperature and the effect of sr introduction on the catalytic activity was investigated then the lscx perovskite crystals were embedded in pan membranes by phase transformation method the obtained pan lsc catalytic separation membranes exhibited good permeation performance and excellent tc degradation under various operating conditions in addition the anti pollution properties of the membranes were tested in the presence of nom and the catalytic membranes exhibited efficient synergy of separation degradation performance accordingly the catalytic membrane displayed favorable resistance to the interference of inorganic anions and exhibited efficient catalytic performance in different water matrices subsequently the stability of the catalytic membranes the reaction mechanism and the toxicity of the intermediates were analyzed finally by comparison with other catalytic membranes the pan lsc membrane exhibited desirable separation and degradation performance 2 experimental section 2 1 materials peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 2 6h2o lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate la no3 3 6h2o sodium

tianjin guangfu chemical reagent co ltd china n methyl pyrrolidone nmp pan powder mw 150 000 g mol 1 and humic acid ha were obtained from tianjin kermel chemical reagent co ltd china all chemicals were used directly with no further purification 2 2 synthesis of perovskite catalysts the sr dropped la2coo4 Î´ perovskites were prepared by citrate sol gel method according to the method of huan et al 36 as shown in fig s1 the appropriately weighed la no3 3 6h2o co no3 2 6h2o sr no3 2 and citric acid were mixed in the appropriate molar ratio and dissolved in deionized water wherein the mole ratio of metal cations to citric acid was 1 1 25 the solution was then stirred in the water bath at 80 c for several hours until most of the water was evaporated to form a gel the resulting gel was dried at 120 c for 3 h to remove water and then got pink fluffy precursors the precursor was then ground to powder and calcined at 180 c for 2 h to decompose the citric acid the temperature was then increased to 850 c at a rate of 5 c min and maintained for 6 h the resulting powder catalysts were labeled as lscx according to the molar ratio of sr at the a site in the perovskite for example when sr occupied 50 of the a site in the perovskite the obtained lasrcoo4 was named as lsc50 in addition lacoo3 lco and la0 5sr0 5coo3 lsco were prepared using the same process with the calcination temperature reduced to 550 c and the calcination time reduced to 4 h 2 3 fabrication of pan lsc catalytic membrane the pan lsc catalytic membrane was prepared by the phase transition method 37 first several amounts of lsc perovskite catalyst were added to 8 8 g nmp solution and kept under ultrasonication for 30 min to make the catalyst uniformly dispersed then 1 2 g of pan powder was added into the solution and stirred in the water bath at 70 c for 8 h the obtained homogeneous casting solution was placed in a vacuum atmosphere at 60 c for 12 h to eliminate bubbles afterward the casting solution is slowly poured onto a neat glass plate and scraped with a 200 Î¼m casting knife then the glass plates were immersed in a water bath and kept for 36 h to complete the phase transformation process the prepared pan lsc catalytic membranes were labeled as pan lsc y membranes where y is 1 2 3 4 5 6 as the lsc50 catalyst content of 1 to 6 wt respectively 2 4 characterization the crystalline

hydrophilicity of pan lsc x membranes were characterized via water contact angle observed and calculated at 25 c by the contact angle measuring instrument powereach china the concentration of

in the membrane and the leaching of metal ions from different catalysts and membranes were examined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher icap pro usa 2 5 degradation performance of perovskite catalyst the degradation performance of perovskite catalysts was evaluated by the rate of contaminant removal by activated pms in a typical procedure 10 mg of perovskite powder was added to 200 ml of 15 ppm tc aqueous solution with constant stirring at 25 c in the water bath after 10 min the catalyst has reached adsorption desorption equilibrium then 0 5 mmol of pms was added to the solution a few solutions were periodically extracted and filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m pvdf membrane the uv vis spectroscope was applied to detect the tc content at 357 nm in this test the degradation rate of tc could be approximated by first order reaction therefore the reaction rate can be analyzed by kinetic equations eq 1 1 ln c c 0 kt where c mg l 1 is the tc concentration at instant t while c 0 mg l 1 refers to the concentration of initial tc k min 1 means the kinetic rate constant and t min represents the reaction time 2 6 assessment of the separation and degradation capacity of membranes the separation and degradation performance of the membranes was evaluated using a cross flow device with an effective filtration area of 7 cm2 before use the membranes were pressurized to 0 15 mpa for 0 5 h after which the pressure was lowered to 0 1 mpa and the pure water flux was calculated using eq 2 2 j v a p t where j l m 2 h 1 refers to the pure water flux v l means the permeate water volume a cm2 represents the effective filtration area p bar is the operating pressure and t h is the filtration time the porosity of the membrane was calculated using eq 3 3 Îµ m w m d Ï w ad 100 where m w and m d g represent the wet and dry membranes masses respectively Ï w g cm 3 refers to the pure water density a cm2 represents the membrane area and d cm means the thickness of membrane the ha rejection rate reflects the separation performance of the membrane for macromolecular contaminants and can be obtained by eq 4 4 r c 0 c c 0 100 where r is the rejection rate of ha c 0 and c mg l 1 represent the ha concentration in the initial solution and the solution after membrane filtration respectively the concentration of ha was detected by the uv vis spectroscope at 254 nm the flux recovery rate frr is used to assess the anti fouling performance of the membrane firstly the membrane was pre pressurized with deionized water at 0 15 mpa for 0 5 h and subsequently reduced to 0 1 mpa to measure and record the initial pure water flux j 0 of the membrane subsequently the deionized water was substituted with the contaminant solution and the flux of the contaminated membrane was calculated for 0 5 h then the membrane was washed with a pms solution at a concentration of 1 0 mm for 15 min and the permeate flux of the cleaned membrane was measured and recorded j 1 the above operation was repeated 3 times to obtain the frr by eq 5 5 frr j 1 j 0 100 the influence of various reaction conditions onto the catalytic degradation performance of the membranes was analyzed by comparative tests typically 500 ml of 15 ppm tc solution was used as the target contaminant after the cycle started pms were added to the solution pms was activated by contacting with the catalyst at the membrane surface and within the pores of the membrane and the final degraded solution was run off through the membrane at regular intervals the tc concentration in the degraded solution was detected with the uv vis spectroscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of perovskite catalyst particles the xrd of the prepared perovskite particles are shown in fig s2 it was observed that no a2bo4 type perovskite was formed by calcining the precursors at 850 c without adding sr at all if sr doping x 40 or x 80 the calcination products showed a mixture of abo3 perovskite and a2bo4 perovskite when the feeding molar ratios of la and sr were close to each other 40 x 60 the calcined oxide exhibited pure a2bo4 phase besides the characteristic diffraction peak gradually shifted to a higher angle with the addition of sr indicating the success of incorporating sr into the perovskite lattice 12 although the cation size of la3 1 32 Ã¥ was smaller than that of sr2 1 44 Ã¥ the introduction of low valent sr2 introduces more surface anionic defects such as oxygen vacancies to maintain the electrical neutrality of the material which may lead to greater lattice shrinking 25 among them the lsc50 perovskite possessed clearer and sharper characteristic peaks so it was further evaluated as shown in fig 1 a lsc50 exhibited an irregular bulk structure with particle size distribution ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers the catalyst surface was smooth and agglomeration was evident as indicated in fig 1 b c d e f the four elements la sr co and o were uniformly distributed and the atomic ratios of la sr co and o were 13 18 11 12 11 77 and 63 93 respectively which were approximately similar to the molar ratios of the feeds from fig 1 g h it was observed that the tem image of lsc50 possesses the same morphology as the sem image and the lattice stripe spacing of lsc50 catalyst is 0 274 nm which corresponds to 110 crystal planes according to pdf 97 009 9897 38 the xps spectra for lsc50 catalyst are shown in fig 2 the signals of la sr co and o were investigated co is generally considered to be the key element of pms activation fig 2 b illustrated the sr 3d spectrum of lsc50 catalyst the fitted peaks located at 132 1 133 7 and 135 4 ev were attributed to sr2 in perovskite surface oxide and carbonate respectively 39 as indicated in fig 2 c the co 2p spectrum of co showed two main peaks at about 780 5 and 795 9 ev which could be attributed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively 22 the fitted peaks at 781 9 and 797 1 ev were co ii while the fitted peaks at 790 3 and 795 4 ev were co iii in fig 2 d three valent o elements were present in the o 1 s spectrum which were lattice oxygen ol surface oxygen oa and oxygen in water molecules oh the fitted peaks localized at 528 9 531 3 and 533 0 ev correspond to the ol oa and oh respectively 40 moreover the xps spectra of various perovskites were compared as exhibited in fig s3 a the peaks of a2bo4 perovskite were shifted slightly to the positive binding energy region in comparison with abo3 perovskite suggesting that a2bo4 perovskite possessed a lower surface co oxidation state compared to abo3 among them lsc50 exhibited the lowest co oxidation state 21 22 as shown in fig s3 b the ratio of co2 co3 in lsc50 was 0 44 higher than that of 0 35 for lco it is worth observing that the oa ol ratio could to evaluate the relative content of oxygen vacancies in perovskite oxides 41 as indicated in fig s3 c d e f g the oa ol ratio of lsc50 was 5 53 higher than the other perovskite particles indicating that more oxygen vacancies were generated in lsc50 structure epr analysis also indicated that the oxygen vacancy content of the lsc50 was higher than that of the abo3 type lsco perovskite fig s4 3 2 degradation performance of powder perovskite catalyst in fig 3 a the tc degradation ability of different perovskite particles was investigated the catalysts were considered to reach tc adsorption resolution equilibrium after 10 min by feeding 0 05 g l 1 of perovskite particles into 15 ppm tc solution the high forming temperature of the perovskite catalysts resulted in a low specific surface area fig s5 so that all the prepared catalyst particles could adsorb only about 5 tc by adding 0 5 mmol pms the tc was gradually degraded for the abo3 perovskite the a site sr substitution slightly enhanced the degradation efficiency of the catalysts since the co based perovskite possessed high catalytic activity the enhancement effect brought by sr doping was not significant in contrast for a2bo4 perovskite the effect brought by sr doping was more obvious among them lsc50 had the best catalytic ability and could completely degrade tc within 12 min which may be attributed to the highest number of oxygen vacancies in lsc50 meanwhile the catalytic ability of a2bo4 type perovskites was better than abo3 perovskites according to the kinetic analysis as indicated in fig 3 b the degradation of tc followed the pseudo first order kinetic equation k value of lsc50 was calculated to be 0 4176 min 1 which was 2 2 times that of lco and 2 1 times that of lsco in conclusion lsc50 was selected for the preparation of pan lsc y catalytic separation membranes 3 3 structure and permeability of catalytic membrane the cross section and surface morphology of pan and pan lsc y catalytic membranes are indicated in fig 4 all membranes exhibited typical asymmetric structures consisting of a dense skin layer and porous support layer with a finger like structure suggesting strong invasion of the pan nmp phase by non solvents during membrane formation process fig 4 a exhibits that with the addition of lsc50 a greater number of micropores appeared in the membrane sublayer and in fig 4 b it appears that the epidermal layer of the catalytic membrane was less thick than the initial pan membrane these structural changes are due to the addition of lsc50 particles which increased the viscosity of the casting solution thereby impeding the fluidity of the polymer chains prolonging the phase transition process and thus increasing the porosity as shown in table s1 the average pore size in pan membranes was 17 97 nm the average pore size of the membranes increased and then decreased with the addition of lsc50 and the pan lsc 4 membrane had the highest pore size 27 53 nm as a result the water permeability of the catalytic membrane was significantly increased the resistance to mass transfer was greatly reduced 37 42 however when 6 wt of lsc50 was introduced into the membrane as exhibited in fig 4 c obvious wrinkles were detected on the membrane surface indicating that the viscosity of the casting solution was extremely high this might lead to decreased porosity and increased densification of the membrane which negatively affected the permeability performance of the membrane 43 besides as indicated in fig 4 d the eds mapping showed that the lsc50 was embedded uniformly in the surface and pores of the membrane table s2 lists the elemental composition of pan lsc 5 catalytic membranes which shows that lsc is successfully incorporated into pan membranes to evaluate the membrane permeation performance the pure water flux of the membrane was tested as depicted in fig 5 a with the addition of lsc the pure water flux of the membrane showed a tendency to increase and then decrease reaching a peak value of 1086 1 l m 2 h 1 at a concentration of 5 wt lsc50 a similar trend was also observed for porosity these results are consistent with speculation in previous sem analysis results the hydrophilicity of the membrane was characterized by measuring the water contact angle from fig 5 b it can be observed that as the mass of lsc50 particles embedded in the membrane matrix increases the water contact angle of the membrane decreases this indicates that the introduction of hydrophilic lsc50 catalyst particles improves the hydrophilicity of pan membranes the ability of membranes to reject large molecular contaminants was further investigated using ha as a contaminant in fig 5 b it can be found that all membranes possess good ha retention which provides a prerequisite for effective synergism between the separation and degradation performance of catalytic membranes 3 4 degradation performance of catalytic membranes by coupling the aops with membrane separation the resulting pan lsc catalytic membranes exhibited excellent tc degradation performance the degradation performance of the catalytic membranes was assessed by the tc removal efficiency and the results are presented in fig 6 a the original pan membrane was able to remove about 29 7 of tc in 30 min without the addition of pms because of the porous structure of the polymer membrane that allows the membrane to partially adsorb the tc after the addition of pms the removal of tc by the pan membrane was increased to 67 2 in 30 min this improvement in catalytic performance was primarily due to a significant increase in the local pms and contaminant concentration within the confines of the membrane pore channel which allowed rapid generation of ros in the membrane structure 35 37 44 apparently the degradation efficiency of tc by catalytic membranes increased continuously with the increase of lsc50 content it is noteworthy that pan lsc 5 membranes can remove 90 of tc within 3 min and reach a removal rate above 99 within 27 min reflecting excellent degradation rate the filtrate after 30 min of degradation reaction was tested and both uv and liquid chromatography results showed that the tc was removed fig s6 interestingly when the lsc50 content in the catalytic membrane exceeded 2 wt the short time degradation rate of the catalytic membrane was higher than that of the lsc50 catalyst particles this is due to the uniform distribution of the lsc50 catalyst in the pan lsc membrane which provides better dispersion compared to the lsc50 powder moreover the membrane pores served to enhance the mass transfer and mitigate the limitation caused by the low specific surface area of lsc50 besides there was no significant increase in the degradation rate of pan lsc 6 membrane compared to pan lsc 5 membrane thus considering the results of the previous pure water flux test the pan lsc 5 membrane was selected for the subsequent study 3 5 effect of operating conditions the effect of different parameters on the degradability of the pan lsc 5 membrane was investigated the degradation performance of catalytic membranes was tested at 25 35 and 45 c and the results are presented in fig 6 b a number of studies suggested that the higher temperature accelerated the breaking of the o o bond in pms and accelerated the generation of ros 45 nevertheless there was only a 1 9 increase in tc removal with a 20 c increase in temperature on the basis of the arrhenius equation lnk ea rt lna we suggest that pan lsc catalytic membranes can significantly reduce the activation energy of the reaction ea for pms activation which not only facilitates the removal of organic pollutants but also reduces the energy consumption during the reaction the ph of the solution has a significant effect on the degradation performance of the catalytic membrane as it affects the generation of free radicals the test results at varied ph are shown in fig 6 c within 30 min the vast majority of tc was degraded at ph values of 5 7 and 9 this is because pms has a pka2 of 9 4 the major form of pms present when the ph of the solution is 5 9 is hso5 which favors the further production of the highly reactive so4 and 1o2 46 on the other hand while the ph was 3 and 11 the removal rate of tc decreased to 75 2 and 85 7 respectively this is because at when the ph is 3 the formation of cooh an important intermediate leading to so4 production is suppressed 47 in addition excess h reacts with so4 and oh resulting in the depletion of ros furthermore at a ph above 9 the major form of pms is converted to so5 2 which is less active than so4 45 at ph above 10 so4 reacts with oh and generates oh which has a weaker oxidation capacity compared to so4 48 this means that the catalytic membrane can rapidly degrade tc in neutral conditions as well as in weakly acidic and weakly alkaline conditions meanwhile since pms is an acidic oxide the solution ph decreases and remains to about 5 6 after the addition of pms and thus the initial ph of the solution was not adjusted for the subsequent experiments under the above operating conditions the impact of pms content on the catalytic degradation effect of the membrane was investigated as shown in fig 6 d the tc removal rate of the catalytic membrane decreased when the pms was 0 25 mmol and due to the low content of ros when the adsorption of tc by the membrane reached equilibrium part of the undegraded tc would enter the filtrate resulting in a temporary increase of tc content within 5 10 min 32 in addition the improvement brought by high pms content was not obvious when the pms content was higher than 0 5 mmol therefore 0 5 mmol was considered the most appropriate pms concentration one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the local pms concentration is excessively high due to the increased mass transfer effect of membrane pores which triggers ros self quenching 49 moreover the effect of tc concentration on the membrane degradation performance was evaluated as depicted in fig 6 e the removal rate decreased with increasing tc concentration when the concentration of tc was 15 ppm and 20 ppm respectively 99 6 and 97 0 of the pollutants were degraded of note the pan lsc 5 membrane was able to remove 99 7 of the contaminants in 3 min when the tc concentration was 10 ppm this indicates that the catalytic membrane has an excellent degradation efficiency for tc fig 6 f represents the relationship between the operating pressure and degradation performance the pure water flux and residence time t of the catalytic membrane at different operating pressures are shown in table 1 t d f as the pressure increased the degradation rate of tc by the membrane gradually decreased which was caused by both the higher accumulation rate of the pollutants and the shorter residence time of the pollutants in the membrane at a pressure of 0 1 mpa only about 60 of the tc was removed in the first three minutes while the tc removal rate reached 97 in three minutes when the pressure was reduced to 0 02 mpa in addition to contributing to lower operating costs the lower operating pressure had exhibited a positive effect on tc degradation besides to further evaluate the rate of tc mineralization by the catalytic membrane the toc of the treated solution was investigated at different processes as shown in fig s7 approximately 62 1 of the tc was mineralized into co2 and h2o after 3 consecutive operating processes in summary the pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane had an excellent degradation effect on tc and could be adapted to a variety of operating environments 3 6 influence of environmental factors on catalytic membrane performance the presence of various inorganic anions and nom may affect the activation process of pms by inhibiting electron transfer progress therefore it is necessary to evaluate these influencing factors as presented in fig 7 a the introduction of anions inhibited the degradation of tc to varying degrees which possibly attributed to the anions reacting with ros or occupying the active site of the reaction 50 in particular h2po4 displayed the most pronounced inhibition reducing the degradation rate of tc to 91 3 while cl hco3 and no3 showed a slight inhibitory effect on tc degradation this suggests that pan lsc catalytic membranes can maintain favorable tc degradation efficiency in coexistence with inorganic anions to further verify the ability of the membrane to purify complex wastewater different concentrations of ha and 15 ppm of tc were complexed and treated as target pollutants in principle ha as a naturally occurring organic macromolecular compound can effectively limit the generation of ros due to the sieving effect of the membrane ha cannot pass through the membrane and is rejected to the outside of the membrane while tc penetrates the membrane and can be degraded in the channel assisted reaction sites as illustrated in fig 7 b the membrane can degrade 98 9 of tc in 30 min even when the ha content is 200 ppm which demonstrates the efficient synergy between membrane separation and degradation accordingly to evaluate the potential of catalytic membranes in practical applications tc degradation tests were performed using different water matrices as depicted in fig 7 c the catalytic membrane could realize high tc degradation in both tap water and river water and the degradation rate slightly reduced in conclusion the pan lsc 5 catalytic membranes exhibited considerable adaptability to different effluents 3 7 stability recyclability and anti fouling properties of catalytic membranes well stability and repeatability are the guarantees that the catalytic membrane can be applied to practical operation fig 8 a shows the repeatability test of the pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane after 5 cycles the membrane can still achieve a tc removal rate of 98 7 in 30 min demonstrating high stability on the other hand the catalytic efficiency of the membrane decreased possibly due to the increased oxidation state of the transition metal ions in the lsc50 particles or due to the depletion of reactive oxygen species which affected the continuation of the non radical pathway 22 the leaching of cobalt ions has been an important factor limiting the development of cobalt based catalysts the tortuous channels of the catalytic membrane greatly enhance the mass transfer efficiency of the oxidation reaction and the contaminants are rapidly degraded within a short residence time the shortened residence time ensures the stability of the lsc50 catalysts to a certain extent 37 table 2 shows the metal ion leaching from the catalytic membrane in 1 3 and 5 cycles the cobalt ion leaching from the catalytic membranes is significantly lower than the chinese wastewater discharge standard gb 25467 2010 1 mg l reflecting an excellent environmental friendliness in addition the leaching of strontium ions was slightly higher than that of lanthanum and cobalt which may indicate the poor stability of the strontium element present in the surface oxides of the catalysts in order to evaluate the membrane antifouling performance a simulated wastewater containing 15 mg l 1 tc and 100 mg l 1 ha as target pollutants was used to compare the recovery of membrane flux from the original pan membrane and the catalytic membrane after cleaning with pms as depicted in fig 8 b the solution flux of pan and catalytic membranes decreased significantly after the addition of pollutants compared to pure water indicating that the deposition of pollutants resulted in severe membrane fouling based on the catalytic degradation characteristics of the catalytic membrane the accumulated contaminants on the membrane surface and in the pore could be effectively removed by catalytic oxidation after three consecutive contamination cleaning cycle operations the flux recovery rate of pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane was 71 3 which is significantly higher than 28 5 of the original pan membrane proving that the catalytic membrane has good long term anti fouling performance 3 8 analysis of the degradation mechanism of catalytic membrane generally in the aops pms is activated to ros with strong oxidizing power and achieves further degradation of organic pollutants as typical ros hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate so4 are radicals while singlet oxygen 1o2 is non radical in order to determine the types of ros in the present experiments quenching experiments are performed tba meoh and ffa were selected to quench oh so4 and 1o2 respectively 51 52 as depicted in fig 9 a the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 tba exhibited only a weak inhibitory effect on the degradation of tc in contrast the removal rate of tc was reduced to 47 5 in 30 min following the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 meoh both tba and meoh were reported to be effective at quenching oh but the reactivity of meoh containing Î± hydrogen toward so4 is much greater than the tba without Î± hydrogen 53 therefore the correlation results indicated that so4 dominated in the free radical pathway for the non free pathway the removal of tc was reduced to 33 4 in the presence of 0 01 mol l 1 of ffa which had a stronger inhibitory effect than 0 2 mol l 1 of meoh these results suggested that apart from free radicals a large amount of 1o2 was generated during the reaction and this non free radical pathway played a critical role in the tc degradation process this is similar to the conclusion reached in the study of li et al concerning the degradation of phenol by rp type perovskite 22 to develop further evidence for the presence of free radical and non free radical pathways in the tc degradation process epr analysis with dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents revealed the generation of oh so4 and 1o2 as in fig 9 b the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were observed at both the 15th min and 30th min of the reaction indicating the formation of so4 and oh however the lower peak values of the obtained characteristic epr signal peaks may indicate that the system contains a less amount of so4 and oh species moreover the typical three line epr spectrum of apparent temp 1o2 is shown in fig 9 c confirming the generation of 1o2 according to previous considerations the lsc50 perovskite activation of pms for tc degradation is a coexistence of free radical pathways and non radical pathways in order to investigate the active sites as well as the valence changes of the metal elements during the reaction the xps spectra of lsc50 particles before and after the reaction were evaluated as fig 10 a in the co 2p xps spectrum the co2 co3 ratio decreased from 0 44 to 0 25 illustrating the presence of an active redox cycle for the o 1 s spectrum as shown in fig 10 b the ratio of surface oxygen to lattice oxygen oa ol decreased from 5 53 to 4 29 reflecting the involvement of oxygen vacancies as active sites in the reaction process the surface hydroxyl oh increased from 23 8 to 29 5 which is probably due to the adsorption of intermediates in the reaction 54 additionally fig 10 c presents the sr 3d xps spectrum in which the ratio of srco3 to sr in the perovskite structure varies only slightly from 1 0 to 1 1 while the sr in the surface oxide shows a significant decrease this may be caused by the possibility that the sr in the surface oxide sr o is unstable and therefore leaches into solution during the reaction consistent with previous speculations based on the above analysis a possible reaction mechanism for the activation of pms by the catalytic membrane was postulated first through eq 6 accompanied by the redox reaction of co3 co2 the pms coupled with the lattice oxygen oo x in the lsc to produce oxygen vacancies vo and part of 1o2 the co3 co2 redox is more active than the co4 co3 redox the co element valence in the rp perovskite is closer to 3 and consequently more susceptible to 1o2 generation than the abo3 perovskite 55 according to eq 7 pms radical so5 which has a low redox potential is also generated during the redox of co3 co2 and the undesirable redox ability of so5 contributed negligibly to the degradation of tc 56 the consumption of lattice oxygen during the reaction invariably resulted in the forming of oxygen vacancies as intermediates which together with the oxygen vacancies intrinsic to the perovskite structure promoted the formation of free radicals so4 and oh via eq 8 and eq 9 furthermore these processes are accompanied by co2 co3 redox reactions thus enabling the redox cycling of co ions meanwhile the processes are also accompanied by the regeneration of lattice oxygen which could continuously promote the coupling of pms with lattice oxygen through eq 6 since the lattice oxygen in rp perovskite is unstable notably the rp perovskite structure has a unique highly reactive interstitial oxygen oi hence pms can directly generate 1o2 by coupling with the interstitial oxygen via eq 10 this possibility is more helpful for the non radical pathway because it does not lead to the generation of so4 and oh by generating oxygen vacancies through eq 8 and eq 9 besides due to the high activity of the interstitial oxygen the mobility of the oxygen in the perovskite was significantly enhanced which rapidly replenished the interstitial oxygen consumed by the reaction and made the process of eq 10 sustainable 22 in summary the free radicals so4 and oh as well as the non free radical 1o2 interact synergistically through eq 11 which led to the deep degradation of tc and eventual mineralization into co2 and h2o 6 co 3 hso 5 o o x co 2 hso 4 o 1 2 v o 7 co 3 hso 5 h o o x co 2 so 5 h 2 o v o 8 co 2 hso 5 v o co 3 so 4 h o o x 9 co 2 hso 5 h 2 o v o co 3 so 4 2 2 h oh o o x 10 co 3 hso 5 o i co 2 hso 4 o 1 2 11 o 1 2 so 4 oh tc intermediates so 4 2 h 2 o co 2 as illustrated in fig s8 the degradation intermediates of tc were analyzed by hplc ms and the possible degradation routes of pan lsc membranes to tc were speculated the possible degradation paths were analyzed as shown in fig 11 under the attack of ros tc was oxidized to 2 possible intermediates p2 m z 430 and p3 m z 498 after demethylation ring opening decarbonylation and dehydroxylation reactions therefore two possible pathways for tc degradation are postulated in the first pathway p2 was further oxidized to form p4 m z 301 on this basis p4 removed the alkyl and amino groups from the side chain to form p6 m z 245 and p7 m z 226 and further degraded to lower molecular organic compounds including p9 m z 149 p10 m z 158 and p11 m z 177 in the second pathway p3 opened the ring to form p5 m z 337 then p5 removed the side chains to give p8 m z 295 and p8 was further oxidized to p12 m z 133 eventually p9 p10 p11 and p12 were completely mineralized to co2 and h2o in order to investigate the environmental and biological effects of tc degradation process the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t with quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction was used to predict the developmental toxicity mutagenicity daphnia lc50 and oral rat ld50 of tc and its intermediates fig 12 a depicts the developmental toxicity of the intermediates which were lower than tc except for p7 and p8 fig 12 b demonstrates the mutagenicity of the intermediates tc was positive and the mutagenicity of the intermediates tended to decrease as the reaction progressed and more than half of the intermediates were negative as shown in fig 12 c d the biotoxicity of the intermediates was significantly reduced after the catalytic membrane treatment the toxicity of daphnia lc50 was attenuated from highly toxic to low toxic or even harmless while the toxicity of oral rat ld50 was gradually reduced from toxic to harmful in summary the toxicity of degradation products was less than that of tc besides compared with the separation and degradation capabilities of various catalytic membranes summarized in table s3 pan lsc membranes exhibit desirable performance 4 conclusion in this paper a2bo4 type perovskite lscx with sr doping at the a site was synthesized by simple sol gel method compared with abo3 perovskite the k constant of tc degradation by lsc50 was improved by 2 times demonstrating excellent catalytic activity then the lsc50 catalyst was embedded into the pan membrane matrix by the phase conversion method to form pan lsc catalytic separation membrane by confining contaminants and ros within the membrane pores to enhance mass transfer rapid regeneration of organic wastewater was achieved the pan lsc 5 membrane was able to degrade 94 of tc within 3 min and was adaptable to a variety of operating conditions with 24 improvement over perovskite powder radical quenching experiments and epr analysis indicated that so4 and 1o2 played a dominant role in the catalytic oxidation meanwhile these ros effectively degrade the contaminants attached to the membrane surface which imparts self cleaning properties to the membrane in addition the pan lsc membrane exhibited good cycling stability and lower ion leaching the biological toxicity of the tc wastewater treated by the membrane was significantly reduced reflecting a broad application prospect credit authorship contribution statement jingchao yu

12486,a2bo4 type perovskite with ruddlesden popper structure performed favorable catalytic activity in the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants than abo3 but the higher forming temperature limits its further application in this work a series of a site sr doped la2coo4 Î´ perovskites were prepared and used for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tc the introduction of sr lowered the formation temperature of the perovskite and improved the catalytic capability the lasrcoo4 perovskite with 50 sr doping possessed the best tc degradation efficiency complete degradation in 14 min besides to overcome the mass transfer limitation caused by catalyst powder agglomeration and the difficulty of recovery perovskite powder catalysts were embedded in polyacrylonitrile pan ultrafiltration membrane by phase conversion method the resulting pan lsc catalytic separation membranes achieved efficient degradation of tc due to the partial increase in the concentration of contaminants inside the membrane pores the membrane embedded with 5 wt lasrcoo4 perovskite degraded 94 tc in 3 min which improved over 24 compared to the perovskite powder the catalytic degradation mechanism of tc and the toxicity of the intermediates were then analyzed the effectiveness of catalytic membranes in practical applications was also evaluated overall pan lsc membranes provide the potential for rapid purification of organic wastewater keywords a2bo4 type perovskite catalytic membrane peroxymonosulfate tetracycline hydrochloride data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is an inevitable problem for the development of human society with the frequent usage of drugs and the development of aquaculture antibiotics represented by tetracycline hydrochloride tc are gradually accumulating in surface water basins which not only causes water pollution issues but also has the pitfall of leading to the evolution of drug resistant strains posing a major threat to aquatic organisms and human health 1 3 according to the antibiotic pollution map of the chinese academy of sciences 6100 tons of tc are released into the soil and groundwater environment each year 4 traditional methods such as biodegradation and physical adsorption are difficult to completely remove tc owing to its poor biodegradability 5 8 thus an increasing number of researches aim to find green effective and cost efficient technologies to achieve rapid tc degradation in water bodies 9 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have emerged as a potential technology for the degradation of difficult pollutants in wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency 10 sr aops generate sulfate radicals so4 through the breakage of peroxy bonds o o in peroxymonosulfates pms and the so4 with strong oxidizing ability can achieve the oxidation or partial mineralization of pollutants 11 pms can be generated by heat ultrasound ultraviolet light electro chemical methods transition metal and carbon based catalysts and integrated processes between them 12 in particular the use of catalysts for pms activation has the advantage of high activation efficiency and low cost and energy input since homogeneous catalysis causes secondary pollution to water bodies and the recovery of catalyst is difficult to achieve 13 a variety of heterogeneous catalysts transition metal oxides nitrides sulfides carbon based materials etc have been used to activate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants 14 16 in recent years abo3 type perovskites have gradually gained increasing attention in order to further pursue higher catalytic activity 17 typical abo3 type perovskite oxides generally include rare earth or alkaline earth metal cations at the a site transition metal cations at the b site and o anions perovskite oxide catalysts offer various benefits such as good structural stability and electron transfer capability 18 in comparison with abo3 type perovskite ruddlesden popper type perovskite with layered structure possesses better surface exchange and volume diffusion coefficients of oxygen and thus exhibits higher stability and redox ability 19 this structure consists of n layers of abo3 perovskite plates stacked along the c axis with rock salt layers ao and the general formula of perovskite can be expressed as a2bo4 when n is 1 20 a2bo4 type perovskite has a good thermal stability and a high ionic conductivity a few studies have applied a2bo4 type perovskite for the activation of pms and demonstrated that la2cuo4 Î´ la2coo4 Î´ and lasrco0 8fe0 2o4 Î´ catalysts have superior catalytic ability than abo3 type perovskite 21 23 noteworthy the great design flexibility of perovskite oxide permits the adjustment of catalyst lattice structure together with the oxidation state of transition metal elements by simple doping strategy 24 recent studies have concluded that doping at the a site of perovskite is an effective method to improve catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalysis 25 cheng et al introduced sr into the a site of lafeo3 perovskite and found that the doped perovskite enhanced the degradation rate of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by 5 7 times 12 gao et al similarly demonstrated that sr doping at the a site increased the surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite and substantially enhanced the activation efficiency of pms 26 however the modification of a site doping on the catalytic activity of a2bo4 type perovskite remains to be further investigated besides the synthesis of co based a2bo4 perovskite with the high catalytic activity is often accompanied by high pressure or temperature above 1000 c which limits further applications the application of perovskite catalysts in sr aops still faces some significant challenges the leaching of toxic metal ions and the difficulty of recovering the powder catalyst are inevitable problems for the long term operation of perovskite catalysts 27 besides natural organic matter nom in the wastewater may potentially cover the active site of the catalyst and negatively affect the degradation 28 to address these issues loading heterogeneous catalysts into membrane substrates with selective separation capabilities is a promising concept 29 31 under external pressure the effluent flows through the catalytic membrane and large molecule pollutants are blocked by size sieving while small molecule organic pollutants enter the membrane pores and combine with the uniformly dispersed catalysts thus achieving the simultaneous separation degradation process 32 33 this continuous operation not only contributes to the rapid removal of degradation products from the catalyst surface and improves the degradation efficiency but also helps to reduce the leaching of metal ions from the catalyst 34 in addition the tortuous path of the membrane pores leads to an increased partial concentration of contaminants which strengthens the mass transfer and therefore contributes to the degradation efficiency of the catalyst 35 nevertheless the activity of catalytic membranes remains to be further improved despite some studies have attempted to combine perovskite catalysts with membranes herein a site sr doped la2coo4 Î´ perovskite catalysts were synthesized by a typical sol gel method at a lower calcination temperature and the effect of sr introduction on the catalytic activity was investigated then the lscx perovskite crystals were embedded in pan membranes by phase transformation method the obtained pan lsc catalytic separation membranes exhibited good permeation performance and excellent tc degradation under various operating conditions in addition the anti pollution properties of the membranes were tested in the presence of nom and the catalytic membranes exhibited efficient synergy of separation degradation performance accordingly the catalytic membrane displayed favorable resistance to the interference of inorganic anions and exhibited efficient catalytic performance in different water matrices subsequently the stability of the catalytic membranes the reaction mechanism and the toxicity of the intermediates were analyzed finally by comparison with other catalytic membranes the pan lsc membrane exhibited desirable separation and degradation performance 2 experimental section 2 1 materials peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 2 6h2o lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate la no3 3 6h2o sodium

were used directly with no further purification 2 2 synthesis of perovskite catalysts the sr dropped la2coo4 Î´ perovskites were prepared by citrate sol gel method according to the method of huan et al 36 as shown in fig s1 the appropriately weighed la no3 3 6h2o co no3 2 6h2o sr no3 2 and citric acid were mixed in the appropriate molar ratio and dissolved in deionized water wherein the mole ratio of metal cations to citric acid was 1 1 25 the solution was then stirred in the water bath at 80 c for several hours until most of the water was evaporated to form a gel the resulting gel was dried at 120 c for 3 h to remove water and then got pink fluffy precursors the precursor was then ground to powder and calcined at 180 c for 2 h to decompose the citric acid the temperature was then increased to 850 c at a rate of 5 c min and maintained for 6 h the resulting powder catalysts were labeled as lscx according to the molar ratio of sr at the a site in the perovskite for example when sr occupied 50 of the a site in the perovskite the obtained lasrcoo4 was named as lsc50 in addition lacoo3 lco and la0 5sr0 5coo3 lsco were prepared using the same process with the calcination temperature reduced to 550 c and the calcination time reduced to 4 h 2 3 fabrication of pan lsc catalytic membrane the pan lsc catalytic membrane was prepared by the phase transition method 37 first several amounts of lsc perovskite catalyst were added to 8 8 g nmp solution and kept under ultrasonication for 30 min to make the catalyst uniformly dispersed then 1 2 g of pan powder was added into the solution and stirred in the water bath at 70 c for 8 h the obtained homogeneous casting solution was placed in a vacuum atmosphere at 60 c for 12 h to eliminate bubbles afterward the casting solution is slowly poured onto a neat glass plate and scraped with a 200 Î¼m casting knife then the glass plates were immersed in a water bath and kept for 36 h to complete the phase transformation

degradation performance of perovskite catalyst the degradation performance of perovskite catalysts was evaluated by the rate of contaminant removal by activated pms in a typical procedure 10 mg of perovskite powder was added to 200 ml of 15 ppm tc aqueous solution with constant stirring at 25 c in the water bath after 10 min the catalyst has reached adsorption desorption equilibrium then 0 5 mmol of pms was added to the solution a few solutions were periodically extracted and filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m pvdf membrane the uv vis spectroscope was applied to detect the tc content at 357 nm in this test the degradation rate of tc could be approximated by first order reaction therefore the reaction rate can be analyzed by kinetic equations eq 1 1 ln c c 0 kt where c mg l 1 is the tc concentration at instant t while c 0 mg l 1 refers to the concentration of initial tc k min 1 means the kinetic rate constant and t min represents the reaction time 2 6 assessment of the separation and degradation capacity of membranes the separation and degradation performance of the membranes was evaluated using a cross flow device with an effective filtration area of 7 cm2 before use the membranes were pressurized to 0 15 mpa for 0 5 h after which the pressure was lowered to 0 1 mpa and the pure water flux was calculated using eq 2 2 j v a p t where j l m 2 h 1 refers to the pure water flux v l means the permeate water volume a cm2 represents the effective filtration area p bar is the operating pressure and t h is the filtration time the porosity of the membrane was calculated using eq 3 3 Îµ m w m d Ï w ad 100 where m w and m d g represent the wet and dry membranes masses respectively Ï w g cm 3 refers to the pure water density a cm2 represents the membrane area and d cm means the thickness of membrane the ha rejection rate reflects the separation performance of the membrane for macromolecular contaminants and can be obtained by eq 4 4 r c 0 c c 0 100 where r is the rejection rate of ha c 0 and c mg l 1 represent the ha concentration in the initial solution and the solution after membrane filtration respectively the concentration of ha was detected by the uv vis spectroscope at 254 nm the flux recovery rate frr is used to assess the anti fouling performance of the membrane firstly the membrane was pre pressurized with deionized water at 0 15 mpa for 0 5 h and subsequently reduced to 0 1 mpa to measure and record the initial pure water flux j 0 of the membrane subsequently the deionized water was substituted with the contaminant solution and the flux of the contaminated membrane was calculated for 0 5 h then the membrane was washed with a pms solution at a concentration of 1 0 mm for 15 min and the permeate flux of the cleaned membrane was measured and recorded j 1 the above operation was repeated 3 times to obtain the frr by eq 5 5 frr j 1 j 0 100 the influence of various reaction conditions onto the catalytic degradation performance of the membranes was analyzed by comparative tests typically 500 ml of 15 ppm tc solution was used as the target contaminant after the cycle started pms were added to the solution pms was activated by contacting with the catalyst at the membrane surface and within the pores of the membrane and the final degraded solution was run off through the membrane at regular intervals the tc concentration in the degraded solution was detected with the uv vis spectroscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of perovskite catalyst particles the xrd of the prepared perovskite particles are shown in fig s2 it was observed that no a2bo4 type perovskite was formed by calcining the precursors at 850 c without adding sr at all if sr doping x 40 or x 80 the calcination products showed a mixture of abo3 perovskite and a2bo4 perovskite when the feeding molar ratios of la and sr were close to each other 40 x 60 the calcined oxide exhibited pure a2bo4 phase besides the characteristic diffraction peak gradually shifted to a higher angle with the addition of sr indicating the success of incorporating sr into the perovskite lattice 12 although the cation size of la3 1 32 Ã¥ was smaller than that of sr2 1 44 Ã¥ the introduction of low valent sr2 introduces more surface anionic defects such as oxygen vacancies to maintain the electrical neutrality of the material which may lead to greater lattice shrinking 25 among them the lsc50 perovskite possessed clearer and sharper characteristic peaks so it was further evaluated as shown in fig 1 a lsc50 exhibited an irregular bulk structure with particle size distribution ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers the catalyst surface was smooth and agglomeration was evident as indicated in fig 1 b c d e f the four elements la sr co and o were uniformly distributed and the atomic ratios of la sr co and o were 13 18 11 12 11 77 and 63 93 respectively which were approximately similar to the molar ratios of the feeds from fig 1 g h it was observed that the tem image of lsc50 possesses the same morphology as the sem image and the lattice stripe spacing of lsc50 catalyst is 0 274 nm which corresponds to 110 crystal planes according to pdf 97 009 9897 38 the xps spectra for lsc50 catalyst are shown in fig 2 the signals of la sr co and o were investigated co is generally considered to be the key element of pms activation fig 2 b illustrated the sr 3d spectrum of lsc50 catalyst the fitted peaks located at 132 1 133 7 and 135 4 ev were attributed to sr2 in perovskite surface oxide and carbonate respectively 39 as indicated in fig 2 c the co 2p spectrum of co showed two main peaks at about 780 5 and 795 9 ev which could be attributed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively 22 the fitted peaks at 781 9 and 797 1 ev were co ii while the fitted peaks at 790 3 and 795 4 ev were co iii in fig 2 d three valent o elements were present in the o 1 s spectrum which were lattice oxygen ol surface oxygen oa and oxygen in water molecules oh the fitted peaks localized at 528 9 531 3 and 533 0 ev correspond to the ol oa and oh respectively 40 moreover the xps spectra of various perovskites were compared as exhibited in fig s3 a the peaks of a2bo4 perovskite were shifted slightly to the positive binding energy region in comparison with abo3 perovskite suggesting that a2bo4 perovskite possessed a lower surface co oxidation state compared to abo3 among them lsc50 exhibited the lowest co oxidation state 21 22 as shown in fig s3 b the ratio of co2 co3 in lsc50 was 0 44 higher than that of 0 35 for lco it is worth observing that the oa ol ratio could to evaluate the relative content of oxygen vacancies in perovskite oxides 41 as indicated in fig s3 c d e f g the oa ol ratio of lsc50 was 5 53 higher than the other perovskite particles indicating that more oxygen vacancies were generated in lsc50 structure epr analysis also indicated that the oxygen vacancy content of the lsc50 was higher than that of the abo3 type lsco perovskite fig s4 3 2 degradation performance of powder perovskite catalyst in fig 3 a the tc degradation ability of different perovskite particles was investigated the catalysts were considered to reach tc adsorption resolution equilibrium after 10 min by feeding 0 05 g l 1 of perovskite particles into 15 ppm tc solution the high forming temperature of the perovskite catalysts resulted in a low specific surface area fig s5 so that all the prepared catalyst particles could adsorb only about 5 tc by adding 0 5 mmol pms the tc was gradually degraded for the abo3 perovskite the a site sr substitution slightly enhanced the degradation efficiency of the catalysts since the co based perovskite possessed high catalytic activity the enhancement effect brought by sr doping was not significant in contrast for a2bo4 perovskite the effect brought by sr doping was more obvious among them lsc50 had the best catalytic ability and could completely degrade tc within 12 min which may be attributed to the highest number of oxygen vacancies in lsc50 meanwhile the catalytic ability of a2bo4 type perovskites was better than abo3 perovskites according to the kinetic analysis as indicated in fig 3 b the degradation of tc followed the pseudo first order kinetic equation k value of lsc50 was calculated to be 0 4176 min 1 which was 2 2 times that of lco and 2 1 times that of lsco in conclusion lsc50 was selected for the preparation of pan lsc y catalytic separation membranes 3 3 structure and permeability of catalytic membrane the cross section and surface morphology of pan and pan lsc y catalytic membranes are indicated in fig 4 all membranes exhibited typical asymmetric structures consisting of a dense skin layer and porous support layer with a finger like structure suggesting strong invasion of the pan nmp phase by non solvents during membrane formation process fig 4 a exhibits that with the addition of lsc50 a greater number of micropores appeared in the membrane sublayer and in fig 4 b it appears that the epidermal layer of the catalytic membrane was less thick than the initial pan membrane these structural changes are due to the addition of lsc50 particles which increased the viscosity of the casting solution thereby impeding the fluidity of the polymer chains prolonging the phase transition process and thus increasing the porosity as shown in table s1 the average pore size in pan membranes was 17 97 nm the average pore size of the membranes increased and then decreased with the addition of lsc50 and the pan lsc 4 membrane had the highest pore size 27 53 nm as a result the water permeability of the catalytic membrane was significantly increased the resistance to mass transfer was greatly reduced 37 42 however when 6 wt of lsc50 was introduced into the membrane as exhibited in fig 4 c obvious wrinkles were detected on the membrane surface indicating that the viscosity of the casting solution was extremely high this might lead to decreased porosity and increased densification of the membrane which negatively affected the permeability performance of the membrane 43 besides as indicated in fig 4 d the eds mapping showed that the lsc50 was embedded uniformly in the surface and pores of the membrane table s2 lists the elemental composition of pan lsc 5 catalytic membranes which shows that lsc is successfully incorporated into pan membranes to evaluate the membrane permeation performance the pure water flux of the membrane was tested as depicted in fig 5 a with the addition of lsc the pure water flux of the membrane showed a tendency to increase and then decrease reaching a peak value of 1086 1 l m 2 h 1 at a concentration of 5 wt lsc50 a similar trend was also observed for porosity these results are consistent with speculation in previous sem analysis results the hydrophilicity of the membrane was characterized by measuring the water contact angle from fig 5 b it can be observed that as the mass of lsc50 particles embedded in the membrane matrix increases the water contact angle of the membrane decreases this indicates that the introduction of hydrophilic lsc50 catalyst particles improves the hydrophilicity of pan membranes the ability of membranes to reject large molecular contaminants was further investigated using ha as a contaminant in fig 5 b it can be found that all membranes possess good ha retention which provides a prerequisite for effective synergism between the separation and degradation performance of catalytic membranes 3 4 degradation performance of catalytic membranes by coupling the aops with membrane separation the resulting pan lsc catalytic membranes exhibited excellent tc degradation performance the degradation performance of the catalytic membranes was assessed by the tc removal efficiency and the results are presented in fig 6 a the original pan membrane was able to remove about 29 7 of tc in 30 min without the addition of pms because of the porous structure of the polymer membrane that allows the membrane to partially adsorb the tc after the addition of pms the removal of tc by the pan membrane was increased to 67 2 in 30 min this improvement in catalytic performance was primarily due to a significant increase in the local pms and contaminant concentration within the confines of the membrane pore channel which allowed rapid generation of ros in the membrane structure 35 37 44 apparently the degradation efficiency of tc by catalytic membranes increased continuously with the increase of lsc50 content it is noteworthy that pan lsc 5 membranes can remove 90 of tc within 3 min and reach a removal rate above 99 within 27 min reflecting excellent degradation rate the filtrate after 30 min of degradation reaction was tested and both uv and liquid chromatography results showed that the tc was removed fig s6 interestingly when the lsc50 content in the catalytic membrane exceeded 2 wt the short time degradation rate of the catalytic membrane was higher than that of the lsc50 catalyst particles this is due to the uniform distribution of the lsc50 catalyst in the pan lsc membrane which provides better dispersion compared to the lsc50 powder moreover the membrane pores served to enhance the mass transfer and mitigate the limitation caused by the low specific surface area of lsc50 besides there was no significant increase in the degradation rate of pan lsc 6 membrane compared to pan lsc 5 membrane thus considering the results of the previous pure water flux test the pan lsc 5 membrane was selected for the subsequent study 3 5 effect of operating conditions the effect of different parameters on the degradability of the pan lsc 5 membrane was investigated the degradation performance of catalytic membranes was tested at 25 35 and 45 c and the results are presented in fig 6 b a number of studies suggested that the higher temperature accelerated the breaking of the o o bond in pms and accelerated the generation of ros 45 nevertheless there was only a 1 9 increase in tc removal with a 20 c increase in temperature on the basis of the arrhenius equation lnk ea rt lna we suggest that pan lsc catalytic membranes can significantly reduce the activation energy of the reaction ea for pms activation which not only facilitates the removal of organic pollutants but also reduces the energy consumption during the reaction the ph of the solution has a significant effect on the degradation performance of the catalytic membrane as it affects the generation of free radicals the test results at varied ph are shown in fig 6 c within 30 min the vast majority of tc was degraded at ph values of 5 7 and 9 this is because pms has a pka2 of 9 4 the major form of pms present when the ph of the solution is 5 9 is hso5 which favors the further production of the highly reactive so4 and 1o2 46 on the other hand while the ph was 3 and 11 the removal rate of tc decreased to 75 2 and 85 7 respectively this is because at when the ph is 3 the formation of cooh an important intermediate leading to so4 production is suppressed 47 in addition excess h reacts with so4 and oh resulting in the depletion of ros furthermore at a ph above 9 the major form of pms is converted to so5 2 which is less active than so4 45 at ph above 10 so4 reacts with oh and generates oh which has a weaker oxidation capacity compared to so4 48 this means that the catalytic membrane can rapidly degrade tc in neutral conditions as well as in weakly acidic and weakly alkaline conditions meanwhile since pms is an acidic oxide the solution ph decreases and remains to about 5 6 after the addition of pms and thus the initial ph of the solution was not adjusted for the subsequent experiments under the above operating conditions the impact of pms content on the catalytic degradation effect of the membrane was investigated as shown in fig 6 d the tc removal rate of the catalytic membrane decreased when the pms was 0 25 mmol and due to the low content of ros when the adsorption of tc by the membrane reached equilibrium part of the undegraded tc would enter the filtrate resulting in a temporary increase of tc content within 5 10 min 32 in addition the improvement brought by high pms content was not obvious when the pms content was higher than 0 5 mmol therefore 0 5 mmol was considered the most appropriate pms concentration one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the local pms concentration is excessively high due to the increased mass transfer effect of membrane pores which triggers ros self quenching 49 moreover the effect of tc concentration on the membrane degradation performance was evaluated as depicted in fig 6 e the removal rate decreased with increasing tc concentration when the concentration of tc was 15 ppm and 20 ppm respectively 99 6 and 97 0 of the pollutants were degraded of note the pan lsc 5 membrane was able to remove 99 7 of the contaminants in 3 min when the tc concentration was 10 ppm this indicates that the catalytic membrane has an excellent degradation efficiency for tc fig 6 f represents the relationship between the operating pressure and degradation performance the pure water flux and residence time t of the catalytic membrane at different operating pressures are shown in table 1 t d f as the pressure increased the degradation rate of tc by the membrane gradually decreased which was caused by both the higher accumulation rate of the pollutants and the shorter residence time of the pollutants in the membrane at a pressure of 0 1 mpa only about 60 of the tc was removed in the first three minutes while the tc removal rate reached 97 in three minutes when the pressure was reduced to 0 02 mpa in addition to contributing to lower operating costs the lower operating pressure had exhibited a positive effect on tc degradation besides to further evaluate the rate of tc mineralization by the catalytic membrane the toc of the treated solution was investigated at different processes as shown in fig s7 approximately 62 1 of the tc was mineralized into co2 and h2o after 3 consecutive operating processes in summary the pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane had an excellent degradation effect on tc and could be adapted to a variety of operating environments 3 6 influence of environmental factors on catalytic membrane performance the presence of various inorganic anions and nom may affect the activation process of pms by inhibiting electron transfer progress therefore it is necessary to evaluate these influencing factors as presented in fig 7 a the introduction of anions inhibited the degradation of tc to varying degrees which possibly attributed to the anions reacting with ros or occupying the active site of the reaction 50 in particular h2po4 displayed the most pronounced inhibition reducing the degradation rate of tc to 91 3 while cl hco3 and no3 showed a slight inhibitory effect on tc degradation this suggests that pan lsc catalytic membranes can maintain favorable tc degradation efficiency in coexistence with inorganic anions to further verify the ability of the membrane to purify complex wastewater different concentrations of ha and 15 ppm of tc were complexed and treated as target pollutants in principle ha as a naturally occurring organic macromolecular compound can effectively limit the generation of ros due to the sieving effect of the membrane ha cannot pass through the membrane and is rejected to the outside of the membrane while tc penetrates the membrane and can be degraded in the channel assisted reaction sites as illustrated in fig 7 b the membrane can degrade 98 9 of tc in 30 min even when the ha content is 200 ppm which demonstrates the efficient synergy between membrane separation and degradation accordingly to evaluate the potential of catalytic membranes in practical applications tc degradation tests were performed using different water matrices as depicted in fig 7 c the catalytic membrane could realize high tc degradation in both tap water and river water and the degradation rate slightly reduced in conclusion the pan lsc 5 catalytic membranes exhibited considerable adaptability to different effluents 3 7 stability recyclability and anti fouling properties of catalytic membranes well stability and repeatability are the guarantees that the catalytic membrane can be applied to practical operation fig 8 a shows the repeatability test of the pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane after 5 cycles the membrane can still achieve a tc removal rate of 98 7 in 30 min demonstrating high stability on the other hand the catalytic efficiency of the membrane decreased possibly due to the increased oxidation state of the transition metal ions in the lsc50 particles or due to the depletion of reactive oxygen species which affected the continuation of the non radical pathway 22 the leaching of cobalt ions has been an important factor limiting the development of cobalt based catalysts the tortuous channels of the catalytic membrane greatly enhance the mass transfer efficiency of the oxidation reaction and the contaminants are rapidly degraded within a short residence time the shortened residence time ensures the stability of the lsc50 catalysts to a certain extent 37 table 2 shows the metal ion leaching from the catalytic membrane in 1 3 and 5 cycles the cobalt ion leaching from the catalytic membranes is significantly lower than the chinese wastewater discharge standard gb 25467 2010 1 mg l reflecting an excellent environmental friendliness in addition the leaching of strontium ions was slightly higher than that of lanthanum and cobalt which may indicate the poor stability of the strontium element present in the surface oxides of the catalysts in order to evaluate the membrane antifouling performance a simulated wastewater containing 15 mg l 1 tc and 100 mg l 1 ha as target pollutants was used to compare the recovery of membrane flux from the original pan membrane and the catalytic membrane after cleaning with pms as depicted in fig 8 b the solution flux of pan and catalytic membranes decreased significantly after the addition of pollutants compared to pure water indicating that the deposition of pollutants resulted in severe membrane fouling based on the catalytic degradation characteristics of the catalytic membrane the accumulated contaminants on the membrane surface and in the pore could be effectively removed by catalytic oxidation after three consecutive contamination cleaning cycle operations the flux recovery rate of pan lsc 5 catalytic membrane was 71 3 which is significantly higher than 28 5 of the original pan membrane proving that the catalytic membrane has good long term anti fouling performance 3 8 analysis of the degradation mechanism of catalytic membrane generally in the aops pms is activated to ros with strong oxidizing power and achieves further degradation of organic pollutants as typical ros hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate so4 are radicals while singlet oxygen 1o2 is non radical in order to determine the types of ros in the present experiments quenching experiments are performed tba meoh and ffa were selected to quench oh so4 and 1o2 respectively 51 52 as depicted in fig 9 a the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 tba exhibited only a weak inhibitory effect on the degradation of tc in contrast the removal rate of tc was reduced to 47 5 in 30 min following the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 meoh both tba and meoh were reported to be effective at quenching oh but the reactivity of meoh containing Î± hydrogen toward so4 is much greater than the tba without Î± hydrogen 53 therefore the correlation results indicated that so4 dominated in the free radical pathway for the non free pathway the removal of tc was reduced to 33 4 in the presence of 0 01 mol l 1 of ffa which had a stronger inhibitory effect than 0 2 mol l 1 of meoh these results suggested that apart from free radicals a large amount of 1o2 was generated during the reaction and this non free radical pathway played a critical role in the tc degradation process this is similar to the conclusion reached in the study of li et al concerning the degradation of phenol by rp type perovskite 22 to develop further evidence for the presence of free radical and non free radical pathways in the tc degradation process epr analysis with dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents revealed the generation of oh so4 and 1o2 as in fig 9 b the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were observed at both the 15th min and 30th min of the reaction indicating the formation of so4 and oh however the lower peak values of the obtained characteristic epr signal peaks may indicate that the system contains a less amount of so4 and oh species moreover the typical three line epr spectrum of apparent temp 1o2 is shown in fig 9 c confirming the generation of 1o2 according to previous considerations the lsc50 perovskite activation of pms for tc degradation is a coexistence of free radical pathways and non radical pathways in order to investigate the active sites as well as the valence changes of the metal elements during the reaction the xps spectra of lsc50 particles before and after the reaction were evaluated as fig 10 a in the co 2p xps spectrum the co2 co3 ratio decreased from 0 44 to 0 25 illustrating the presence of an active redox cycle for the o 1 s spectrum as shown in fig 10 b the ratio of surface oxygen to lattice oxygen oa ol decreased from 5 53 to 4 29 reflecting the involvement of oxygen vacancies as active sites in the reaction process the surface hydroxyl oh increased from 23 8 to 29 5 which is probably due to the adsorption of intermediates in the reaction 54 additionally fig 10 c presents the sr 3d xps spectrum in which the ratio of srco3 to sr in the perovskite structure varies only slightly from 1 0 to 1 1 while the sr in the surface oxide shows a significant decrease this may be caused by the possibility that the sr in the surface oxide sr o is unstable and therefore leaches into solution during the reaction consistent with previous speculations based on the above analysis a possible reaction mechanism for the activation of pms by the catalytic membrane was postulated first through eq 6 accompanied by the redox reaction of co3 co2 the pms coupled with the lattice oxygen oo x in the lsc to produce oxygen vacancies vo and part of 1o2 the co3 co2 redox is more active than the co4 co3 redox the co element valence in the rp perovskite is closer to 3 and consequently more susceptible to 1o2 generation than the abo3 perovskite 55 according to eq 7 pms radical so5 which has a low redox potential is also generated during the redox of co3 co2 and the undesirable redox ability of so5 contributed negligibly to the degradation of tc 56 the consumption of lattice oxygen during the reaction invariably resulted in the forming of oxygen vacancies as intermediates which together with the oxygen vacancies intrinsic to the perovskite structure promoted the formation of free radicals so4 and oh via eq 8 and eq 9 furthermore these processes are accompanied by co2 co3 redox reactions thus enabling the redox cycling of co ions meanwhile the processes are also accompanied by the regeneration of lattice oxygen which could continuously promote the coupling of pms with lattice oxygen through eq 6 since the lattice oxygen in rp perovskite is unstable notably the rp perovskite structure has a unique highly reactive interstitial oxygen oi hence pms can directly generate 1o2 by coupling with the interstitial oxygen via eq 10 this possibility is more helpful for the non radical pathway because it does not lead to the generation of so4 and oh by generating oxygen vacancies through eq 8 and eq 9 besides due to the high activity of the interstitial oxygen the mobility of the oxygen in the perovskite was significantly enhanced which rapidly replenished the interstitial oxygen consumed by the reaction and made the process of eq 10 sustainable 22 in summary the free radicals so4 and oh as well as the non free radical 1o2 interact synergistically through eq 11 which led to the deep degradation of tc and eventual mineralization into co2 and h2o 6 co 3 hso 5 o o x co 2 hso 4 o 1 2 v o 7 co 3 hso 5 h o o x co 2 so 5 h 2 o v o 8 co 2 hso 5 v o co 3 so 4 h o o x 9 co 2 hso 5 h 2 o v o co 3 so 4 2 2 h oh o o x 10 co 3 hso 5 o i co 2 hso 4 o 1 2 11 o 1 2 so 4 oh tc intermediates so 4 2 h 2 o co 2 as illustrated in fig s8 the degradation intermediates of tc were analyzed by hplc ms and the possible degradation routes of pan lsc membranes to tc were speculated the possible degradation paths were analyzed as shown in fig 11 under the attack of ros tc was oxidized to 2 possible intermediates p2 m z 430 and p3 m z 498 after demethylation ring opening decarbonylation and dehydroxylation reactions therefore two possible pathways for tc degradation are postulated in the first pathway p2 was further oxidized to form p4 m z 301 on this basis p4 removed the alkyl and amino groups from the side chain to form p6 m z 245 and p7 m z 226 and further degraded to lower molecular organic compounds including p9 m z 149 p10 m z 158 and p11 m z 177 in the second pathway p3 opened the ring to form p5 m z 337 then p5 removed the side chains to give p8 m z 295 and p8 was further oxidized to p12 m z 133 eventually p9 p10 p11 and p12 were completely mineralized to co2 and h2o in order to investigate the environmental and biological effects of tc degradation process the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t with quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction was used to predict the developmental toxicity mutagenicity daphnia lc50 and oral rat ld50 of tc and its intermediates fig 12 a depicts the developmental toxicity of the intermediates which were lower than tc except for p7 and p8 fig 12 b demonstrates the mutagenicity of the intermediates tc was positive and the mutagenicity of the intermediates tended to decrease as the reaction progressed and more than half of the intermediates were negative as shown in fig 12 c d the biotoxicity of the intermediates was significantly reduced after the catalytic membrane treatment the toxicity of daphnia lc50 was attenuated from highly toxic to low toxic or even harmless while the toxicity of oral rat ld50 was gradually reduced from toxic to harmful in summary the toxicity of degradation products was less than that of tc besides compared with the separation and degradation capabilities of various catalytic membranes summarized in table s3 pan lsc membranes exhibit desirable performance 4 conclusion in this paper a2bo4 type perovskite lscx with sr doping at the a site was synthesized by simple sol gel method compared with abo3 perovskite the k constant of tc degradation by lsc50 was improved by 2 times demonstrating excellent catalytic activity then the lsc50 catalyst was embedded into the pan membrane matrix by the phase conversion method to form pan lsc catalytic separation membrane by confining contaminants and ros within the membrane pores to enhance mass transfer rapid regeneration of organic wastewater was achieved the pan lsc 5 membrane was able to degrade 94 of tc within 3 min and was adaptable to a variety of operating conditions with 24 improvement over perovskite powder radical quenching experiments and epr analysis indicated that so4 and 1o2 played a dominant role in the catalytic oxidation meanwhile these ros effectively degrade the contaminants attached to the membrane surface which imparts self cleaning properties to the membrane in addition the pan lsc membrane exhibited good cycling stability and lower ion leaching the biological toxicity of the tc wastewater treated by the membrane was significantly reduced reflecting a broad application prospect credit authorship contribution statement jingchao yu

12487,this work introduces a continuous flow process for the implementation of magnetic nanoadsorbents in drinking water treatment practices based on their complete recovery using a rotary separation setup with an arrangement including the use of permanent magnets magnetostatic analysis and computational fluid dynamics were combined to simulate the generated magnetic field of a halbach array of magnets fixed in a pmma disk and the flow behavior of a sn based magnetic nanocomposite dispersion under the influence of the alternating field the rotating speed and direction the flowrate of the dispersion and the immersion level into the dispersion tank were proven to be the critical parameters to maximize capture and separation of the nanocomposite from the flowing water to validate the efficiency of the designed setup the corresponding magnetic separator was built and adapted as a unit in a sequence with a stirring tank which brings cr vi polluted water in contact with the nanocomposite the experimental operation involved the use of a tin oxyhydroxide abhurite a phase known for its high uptake efficiency on cr vi loaded with 20 wt fe3o4 nanoparticles which act as the magnetic carrier for the post treatment recovery the developed pilot unit achieved a complete water purification for cr vi concentrations up to 100 Î¼g l even for low contact times such as 15 min whereas the in line magnetic separator offered a total 100 capture of the nanocomposite providing solid free and purified water keywords magnetic separation drinking water recovery nanoparticles hexavalent chromium purification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the expansion of the infiltration of nanotechnology in everyday activities the use of engineered nanoparticles is becoming very frequent in a wide range of applications beyond high technology ones electronics sensors information storage 1 particularly nanoparticles are increasingly used in clothing and cosmetic industries endowing novel properties to such products nanoparticles are also capable to strengthen the mechanical properties and resulting performance of constructing materials while their applications in the fields of biomedicine and environmental remediation is also becoming more widespread 2 3 in the latter case nanoparticles have limited operational lifetime and they are considered as consumables thus implying to the demand to minimize consequences of their post use release to the human body or to the environment 4 7 for instance the successful implementation of nanoparticles as effective adsorbents in water treatment technologies raises the issue of their complete recovery in the end considering the potential toxicity of the loaded pollutants and the relative high quantities of the collected solid 8 11 such need becomes more intense when drinking water is the subject of purification and nanoparticles should be approached as a byproduct after fulfilling their role in the process 12 13 therefore combining the restriction to succeed in reaching very low pollutant concentrations below the regulation limit the requirement to maximize capture capacity with minimum quantity of used nanoparticles and the demand to ensure the absence of nanoparticles in water or any waste stream the design of nanoparticle assisted drinking water treatment processes and the adoption of proper facilities are rather challenging fields of research 14 15 the main advantages of using nanoparticles for water purification are the increase of specific surface area due to their small dimensions and the possibility to accelerate treatment time by modifying the typical column bed configuration with a direct dispersion of nanoparticles in a tank unfortunately the nanoscale size of the nanoparticles may turn into a severe drawback since their separation at the end of the process requires the use of a nanofiltration a step which is able to dominate the total operation cost 16 to overcome this obstacle magnetic nanoparticles are suggested as a direct adsorbent or active phase carrier offering the potential for easy scalable and tunable separation when an external magnetic field is applied to the flow 17 18 magnetophoresis can be applied in a variety of geometries and magnetic field sources 19 in continuous flow water treatment facilities the magnetic field is commonly applied by placing permanent magnets electromagnets or even superconducting devices at the sides of the flowing steam 20 22 attachment of electromagnetic or superconducting coils manage to reach magnetic fields of very high intensity and fast control of the desired conditions being able to handle high flowrates of the nanoparticle dispersion 23 24 on the other hand the demand for electrical power or cryogenic installations respectively which increases significantly when scale up is attempted limits the practical interest for such solutions in water treatment employing permanent magnets especially those made of neodymium iron boron nd2fe14b is a much easier and cost saving option offering many different possibilities of arrangement and thereby separation efficiency 25 26 simple magnetic separators have been reported as a way to integrate magnetic adsorbents in water or wastewater treatment 27 for instance the uptake of cr vi by graphene fe3o4 polypyrrole nanocomposites was combined with their separation by a batch setup 28 other reports describe the application of magnetic nanoparticles for the removal of arsenic and cr vi from water adopted to continuous flow apparatus based on high gradient magnetic field columns and packed beds 29 32 there the dispersion of the nanoparticles after treatment process is directed through a vertical path into the generated magnetic field in another approach permanent magnets are commonly placed in sequence arranged in a way to force water pass through alternating magnetized and non magnetized regions forming a field gradient region 33 in the same scheme linear magnetic separators have been tested for the recovery of magnetic nanoparticles or nanocomposites when placed in the outflow of water treatment units 34 36 the field gradient was further increased by modifying the shape of the magnets the polarity direction the symmetry or by simply placing metallic wires to perturb the uniformity of the field another approach enabling to save time and space is the operation of sink float separators in which magnetically triggered flocculation is combined with the solid separation utilizing the levitation force of the magnetic fluid 37 38 but arrangements of static magnets must be accompanied with high flow lengths and narrow cross sections since the effective range of permanent magnets is small this turns to be a perplexing issue for the design of high capacity units requiring the operation of parallel flowing lines to handle the flow load dynamic motion of the arrangement of magnets or the flowing dispersion may elevate the separation efficiency and boost the recovery of weak magnetic phases the simulation and pilot testing of a rotary magnetic drum and a centrifugal separator was illustrated for the capture of magnetic particles in mineral separation processes 39 40 the magnetic force strength the relative rotation rate and the magnetic field gradient were found to positively affect the separation efficiency whereas feed flowrate was inversely proportional to the recovery yield additionally applications in water treatment suggest that the contact time of nanomaterial with polluted water the kinetic and removal capacity of the nanoadsorbent and the volume of the reactor are critical design parameters to construct and operate a magnetic separator 30 this study investigates a sophisticated magnetic separation setup for the recovery of used magnetic nanoparticles from water remediation processes based on the construction of a halbach array of magnets arranged in a rotating disk resembling the operation of rotary vacuum drum filters commonly used in industrial liquid solid separations such system appears advantageous for the reduction of the separator size with simultaneous improvement in recovery efficiency and volume capacity computational fluid dynamics cfd indicated the optimum construction and operation parameters with respect to the magnets arrangement and the various flow conditions flowrate concentration particle free path rotating speed simulation results were validated in a laboratory scale water treatment unit designed to purify water polluted by hexavalent chromium using fe3o4 nanoparticles as direct adsorbents or magnetic carriers for sn based phases 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup replicating the geometry of a rotary vacuum drum the main component of the magnetic separator setup was a rotating disk made of pmma which hosted rectangular ndfeb permanent magnets positioned in a halbach array configuration fig 1 the diameter of the disk was 100 mm with a width of 45 mm eight rectangular n42 type block magnets with dimensions 40 10 10 mm were placed into the disk with a radial symmetrical distribution very close to the edge to maximize the magnetic field gradient each magnet was positioned with 90 degrees rotation of the magnetization axis in comparison to the previous one in the sequence the disk was fixed in the center of a tank with dimensions 145 45 85 mm in which the flowing nanoparticle dispersion was introduced from a valve placed at the side at a height of 70 mm from the bottom the total volume of dispersion into the tank was controlled by the height of the outflowing valve which was adjusted at different positions on the top of the profile of the disk a conveyor belt was attached to drive collected nanoparticles away from the magnetic field and assist the recovery of the magnetic nanomaterial by water washing images of the laboratory setup are available in the supporting information the design parameters of the experiment were the rotating speed of the disk and the direction of rotation the flowrate and the concentration of the dispersion and the volume of the dispersion into the tank as defined by its operating level 2 2 computational fluid analysis in order to estimate and visualize the ferrofluid velocity and the motion of the magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid we employed a coupled magnetorheological model within the framework of comsol multiphysics 41 the distribution of magnetic field and its gradient were derived from the magnetostatic module while the spatiotemporal velocity distribution of the ferrofluid was obtained from the incompressible navier stokes equations the latter also depends on the rotation of the disk and so a rotating mesh was constructed the geometric model of magnetic separator rotor and fluid domain for computational fluid dynamics cfd and magnetostatic analysis was generated using the finite elements method provided by comsol multiphysics v 3 5a this simulation was developed in a manner that the dimensions and boundary conditions from the experimental setup are comparable fig 2 displays the 3d finite volume mesh of the present physical domain the mesh was composed of tetrahedral element type with ten nodes in subdomain and triangular element size with six nodes in boundaries the mesh consists of 748 053 tetrahedral elements with 155 438 nodes the tracking trajectories of nanoparticles were found by importing the forces experienced to the nanoparticles in the model the relevant equations those are the magnetic force magnetophoretic due to the presence of inhomogeneous non uniform external magnetic field and the viscous drag force that is resembling the friction that opposes the motion of magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid for nano sized particles gravitational force is insignificant as compared to the other two even though the gravitational force is playing a crucial role in dictating the transport behavior of larger sized magnetic particles often causing rapid sedimentation of particles when size is sufficiently large subjected to magnetophoresis it is usually insignificant as compared to the magnetophoretic and viscous drag forces if the nano sized mnp is employed 42 for the finite volume approach the integral form of the governing equations of mass transfer and species transport processes were applied to the control volume of the cells which make up the discretizational computational model of a continuous physical domain of the specific physical system under investigation in this study a multi phase model accounting for both the aqueous medium and the solid particles discrete phase model was used to study a multi species circular magnetic separator rotor with the temporal conservation laws of continuity momentum and energy 43 the governing partial differential equations for mass momentum magnetic field and energy equation are solved for the unsteady incompressible flow magnetic nanoparticles introduced into the separator system experience drag and magnetic forces in proportion to particle size very small particles such as those in the nanoscale also exhibit random brownian motion which can significantly affect nanoparticle behavior for small spherical particles in a fluid possessing a small reynolds number re 1 the drag force f d can be described using stokes drag which is defined as 44 1 f d 6 ÏÎ¼ r p v f where v f is the flow velocity r p is the radius of magnetic nanoparticle and Î¼ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the nanoparticles were assumed to be spherical with a radius of r p 20 nm furlani et al 45 determined analytically the magnetic force applied on a single spherical magnetic nanoparticle they used an effective dipole moment approach in which the particle is replaced by an equivalent point dipole located at its center the force depends on the magnetic field at the location of the

loaded with tin based oxyhydroxide were prepared and used as model systems to simulate the performance of the designed separator and experimentally validate the successful water purification and particle recovery in the suggested scheme beyond their magnetic response recent studies demonstrated that fe3o4 nanoparticles are able to contribute in the capture of aqueous cr vi forms even at low concentrations especially when high fe2 fe3 ratio is achieved by choosing suitable synthetic routes 35 46 on the other hand sn ii oxyhydroxides can be tailored to deliver the highest cr vi reduction potential following their ability to donate two electrons before reaching the maximum oxidation state for sn iv 47 therefore single fe3o4 nanoparticles were expected to show a lower uptake capacity combined with easier magnetic separation when the nanoparticles were used as a carrier in the nanocomposite magnetic separation would become more challenging due to the lower magnetic response but a much higher cr vi uptake response would be maintained considering their beneficial contribution to the purification process a similar approach was previously reported to develop fe3o4 feooh nanocomposites for simultaneous uptake of as v and sb v forms through an intermediate reduction step 36 magnetite nanoparticles with diameters around 40 nm were synthesized using the oxidative precipitation of concentrated feso4 solution by nano3 under the conditions of high temperature alkaline medium and the presence of ethanol 48 in brief 70 ml of a 0 28 m feso4 solution were rapidly mixed with another solution prepared by the addition of 40 ml absolute ethanol 1 84 g naoh and 1 70 g nano3 in 50 ml of degassed distilled water after that the viscous intermediate product green rust was transferred in a water bath regulated to 90 c and allowed to age for 12 h the black product was washed several times with distilled water and finally stored as dispersion a part of the fe3o4 nanoparticles was used as the first component to prepare tin based nanocomposite the tin oxyhydroxide was produced by the chemical precipitation of dissolved sncl2 solution 0 1 m at ph 2 initiated by the addition of 10 wt naoh solution 49 after carrying out the appropriate washing and centrifugation cycles concentrated sludge of the product identified as abhurite snâo oh âclâ was blended with corresponding sludge derived from the fe3o4 nanoparticle dispersion at a ratio of around 20 wt in fe3o4 it should be noted that wet blending is the only way to overcome redox interactions between the participating phases that would cause the significant loss of both cr vi uptake efficiency and magnetization values due to the oxidation of fe3o4 such issues have been already reported for tin oxyhydroxide decorated biochar composites 50 2 4 chromium uptake preliminary batch adsorption tests were performed in natural like water spiked with cr vi and adjusted to ph 7 to obtain adsorption isotherms for each sample a quantity of 5 100 mg of dried nanomaterial was dispersed in 200 ml of cr vi solution with concentration 100 1000 Î¼g l into 300 ml conical flasks the flasks were shaken for 24 h at 20 c using an orbital shaker then the solid was filtered and the cr vi residual concentration was determined using the diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method kinetic data for the uptake effect were separately collected by taking samples from a dispersion of 60 mg l of nanomaterial in a 500 Î¼g l of cr vi solution for time intervals up to 10 h the efficiency of the nanomaterials in a continuous flow process was evaluated by operating a 2 l contact reactor with mechanical stirring to mix nanoparticle dispersions with the polluted water test water with initial cr vi concentration 50 500 Î¼g l ph 7 was pumped in the reactor with a flowrate 30 140 ml min while the concentrated dispersion of nanoparticles was added in drops to stabilize a concentration of 80 or 160 mg l in the reactor such conditions defined a residence time of 15 60 min the outflowing dispersion was transferred to the rotary magnetic separator to recover nanomaterial and receive the treated water for cr vi determination the magnetic separation yield was evaluated after the determination of iron in the collected water from the outflow of the magnetic separator in the steady state 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic field distribution the magnetic field intensity generated by the halbach array configuration with eight ndfeb magnets was first estimated focusing on its distribution in the water flow region fig 3 the flux density was maximized in regions close to the magnet positions where values above 300 mt are observed near the disk water interface and values above 100 mt are preserved within a distance of 10 mm in the space between two magnets the flux density values weaken quickly after few mm from the disk surface however during rotation such arrangement is responsible for the continuous alternation of the field intensity at any flow position between the maximum and minimum values providing an extra gradient which further assists capture and separation of nanoparticles from water particularly the magnetic field gradient follows a similar distribution with its maximum reaching 100 t m close to the sides of the magnets the alternating field gradient in the region close to the disk surface provides a significant advantage in the capture of particles sized in the nanoscale when compared to previously reported stationary magnetophoresis setups such systems were adequate for the improvement of the mixing efficiency in order to establish homogeneity in nanoparticle dispersions control of transport behavior washing and sorting processes usually in biological samples 42 51 55 placing permanent magnets next to the flow path or in batch vessels requires an additional arrangement to achieve high separation yields for instance to improve magnetic gradient steel wool was used to narrow flowing channels through a superconducting magnetic separator to capture phosphate ferric flocs or remove microalgae from fishpond water 23 56 57 wires and rod micro matrices with different geometries were also proposed to ensure high capacity high gradient magnetic separation 56 58 59 elsewhere a three dimensional multi wire model was developed for separation of magnetic catalyst particles from the wax stream in fischer tropsch synthesis 60 similarly a ferromagnetic membrane separating unit made of laser perforated thick ferromagnetic foil was successfully tested to capture hydroxyapatite microparticles 1 Î¼m carried by magnetic nanoparticles from a water suspension 61 downstream options are also available to recover protein loaded magnetic nanoparticles but their performance is still under development whereas continuous flow is still out of discussion 62 the limitations of similar approaches to handle intentional release and re collecting of magnetic nanoparticles in water treatment facilities or other environmental engineering applications were summarized in 63 suggesting the important role of colloidal stability and the need to study magnetophoresis in the frame of theoretical analysis and dimensionless number calculations 3 2 fluid dynamics the magnetic field generated by the eight magnet rotating disk was added as an input to simulate the flow conditions of the aqueous magnetic nanoparticle dispersion inflowing to the separator tank the simulation was based on the magnetisation of nanocomposites at a ratio equal to 20 wt in fe3o4 fig 4 summarizes the flow velocity map of water into the separator under representative conditions of operation in addition the mean trajectories of nanoparticle movement under the effect of the magnetic field is also provided with a red continuous line this analysis is very similar to that performed to predict the particle trajectories in a mixing chamber with fluorescent particles in a ferrofluid stream by changing the number and the positions of 4 magnets 64 it has been reported that rotation of the magnetic arrangement caused a significant enhancement of mixing rate in our work higher rotation speeds are generally related to longer trajectories paths before nanoparticles reach the surface of the disk and be separated from the dispersion the case of clockwise rotation with 200 rpm fig 4a suggests a much faster capture of most nanoparticles upon entering the flowing path in the separator on the other hand the separation time when increasing rotation speed to 300 rpm fig 4b is almost doubled working with a counter clockwise rotation shows important advantages since rotation of the disk in the opposite direction to the water flow allows separation at an earlier stage fig 4c while at the same time the captured solid is transferred directly out of the tank having minimum contact with the incoming water moreover it is clear in fig 4 that the rotation of the disk generates an inhomogeneous distribution of fluid velocity with points of high and low velocity breadth near the magnets due to the spatiotemporal alternation of the location of those points the rotation increases the probability for a particle to pass from a point of relatively low fluid velocity and eventually to be captured by the magnet by running similar simulations for several conditions the mean free path of magnetic nanoparticles as a function of the rotation speed was calculated fig 5 counter clockwise rotation appears to be the optimum choice with the residence time of nanoparticles in the flow being minimized for a wide range of disk velocities between 100 and 400 rpm on the contrary clockwise rotation provides fast separation only for 200 rpm and then the mean free path rapidly increases small or zero rotation speeds of the disk appears to be another condition associated with slower separation rates rotation speed has been found to be a dominant parameter to define separation yield in a high capacity wet belt magnetic separator used to purify non metallic ores 65 increasing the rotation speed was responsible for weakening of the magnetic force and the loss of magnetic material to the non magnetic product the validity of multiphysics models to simulate the field gradient and predict experimental separation yield is supported by combined theoretical and experimental studies for the optimization of aerodynamic drum or wet rotating magnetic separating devices 66 67 3 3 long term field disorder the operation of the magnetic separator for extended period would result in the collection of significant magnetic solid at the sides of the disk forming a thick film of nanoparticles around the positions of the magnets the magnetization of each nanoparticle itself gives rise to a self demagnetization field also called demagnetizing field that opposes magnetic field h and its amplitude increases with the amount of the deposited magnetic material this internal field is also taken into account in the estimation of the induced magnetic flux density b thus the amplitude of magnetic flux density would experience a significant drop in the flowing path fig 6 with proportional consequences in the separation rate and total yield fig 4d illustrates the importance of studying this scenario since the interference induced by particle accumulation is responsible for the increase of nanoparticle free path to long distances even worse the complete separation of nanoparticles becomes doubtful as more material is captured and remains in the rotating disk in the long term it is calculated that separation efficiency may drop to around 30 for this reason the use of a conveyor belt adopted on the disk to rapidly take out captured nanoparticles from the system was recommended for the experimental setup 3 4 water level effect in the designed rotary magnetic separator the length of the flowing path of the dispersion under the effect of the magnetic field is defined by the operation level of water in the tank in practice water level can be tuned by moving the position of the outflow hole at different heights to understand the significance of this design parameter in the efficiency of the magnetic separator simulations of the mean free path of nanoparticles when the water level was adjusted to 3 cm were carried out results showing the average trajectories of nanoparticles are presented in fig 7 at lower flowrates 60 ml min a mean free path of 3 6 cm was calculated before capture and separation is observed while upon doubling the flowrate the mean path increases to 4 3 cm the distance before capture approaches 8 6 cm when a flowrate of 600 ml min is applied 3 5 amount of magnets another variation of the system which involves the replacement of the eight magnet halbach arrangement by a four magnet array was simulated the main alternation lies on the higher distances between magnets which extends the path with very low magnetic flux density fig 8 therefore the frequency of field alternation between maximum and minimum values decreases to the half for the same rotating speed the mean free path before separation when a four magnet separator is applied is shown in fig 8 in comparison to the efficiency of the eight magnet arrangement the four magnet system was found to be less efficient presenting a constant mean path increase of around 30 at any operating flowrate for flowrates below 150 ml min the separation is relatively fast taking place at early stages of the flow path however above 150 ml min the flowing distance before capture presents a sharp increase reaching levels in which complete separation is not expected to occur the important role of dense cylindrical arrangements of rotating permanent magnets was mathematically predicted and then observed toward coagulation of magnetic and non magnetic minerals 68 generated alternating magnetic field induces dynamic rotation and repulsion forces which assists the capture of magnetic diamagnetic and conductive particles from a slurry 3 6 pilot unit operation the optimization through computational fluid dynamics is a common design procedure to predict the performance the optimum geometry and operating parameters without the need to construct and test all mentioned cases which would entail a cost increase to validate the efficiency of the designed magnetic separator as a component of a continuous flow sequence with a water purification reactor utilizing abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles or reference fe3o4 nanoparticles the possibility to achieve high cr vi uptake accompanied by 100 nanocomposite recovery was studied for various experimental conditions the used nanoadsorbents were previously characterized to verify their composition and efficiency toward cr vi uptake capacity and capture rate details can be found in the supporting information file xrd measurements fig s1 confirmed the prevalent presence of tin chloro oxyhydroxide snâo oh âclâ in the nanocomposite with structure identical to the abhurite mineral whereas peaks corresponding to the inverse spinel structure of fe3o4 were also identified in both samples uptake efficiency in the low residual concentration range 800 Î¼g l was studied through batch adsorption experiments to obtain the isotherms fig s2 by fitting collected data with a freundlich type curve it was found that the capacity of the nanocomposite for cr vi when residual concentration of 25 Î¼g l was achieved was around 7 mg g a lower corresponding capacity for the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles was determined 2 3 mg g the kinetic study of the nanomaterials indicated that 50 of the process was completed within the first 15 min whereas 80 of the equilibrium capture was reached after 50 min of contact the used nanoadsorbents were previously characterized to verify their composition and efficiency toward cr vi uptake capacity and capture rate details can be found in the supporting information file xrd measurements fig s1 confirmed the prevalent presence of tin chloro oxyhydroxide snâo oh âclâ in the nanocomposite with structure

nanomaterials indicated that 50 of the process was completed within the first 15 min whereas 80 of the equilibrium capture was reached after 50 min of contact although typical cr vi polluted groundwaters are rarely met with concentrations above 100 Î¼g l in this series of experiments concentrations up to 500 Î¼g l were tested in the feed of the contact reactor in parallel various flowrates and consequently residence times were applied to understand the effect of the process rate in the total efficiency more specifically to achieve residence times of the contact reactor in the range 15 60 min the water flowrate in the magnetic separator was adjusted to the range 140 30 ml min respectively under such flow conditions the magnetic separation yield in the eight magnet rotary separator was maintained at the maximum level and zero iron concentrations were measured in the outflow such facile recovery of nanomaterial should be attributed to an occurring cooperative magnetophoresis and the corresponding induced convection which is expected for the specific field gradient and particle concentration 21 therefore the evaluation experiments focused on determining the removal efficiency of cr vi for varying residence times and initial cr vi concentrations fig 9 summarizes the results of experiment series for the different runs of the contact reactor and magnetic separator sequence using abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles providing the mapping of residual cr vi concentration values determined under various experimental parameters for a dose of 80 mg l the complete purification of water residual cr vi close to 0 is observed independently of the residence time in the reactor when initial cr vi was at maximum 100 Î¼g l which is a reasonable and typical case of realistic operation condition for drinking water treatment then at more polluted water sources a residence time of at least 45 min is required to distribute water in compliance to the upcoming regulation for cr vi the specific dose of the nanocomposite was able to sufficiently treat water with initial concentration up to 300 Î¼g l when flowrate was decreased to correspond to a 60 min residence time for higher initial cr vi concentrations or lower residence times cr vi uptake is still high but only partial with the residual concentration lying above 100 Î¼g l addition of the double nanocomposite dose 160 mg l expands the threshold for safe drinking water supply to a cr vi concentration of around 250 Î¼g l independently of the residence time or up to 450 Î¼g l for the highest flowrate significantly lower efficiency for cr vi uptake was defined in the corresponding runs with pure fe3o4 nanoparticles fig s4 indicating that residual cr vi complies with drinking water regulation only when a higher dose is provided in polluted water with initial cr vi concentrations below 100 Î¼g l however for this sample the recovery of the solid in the separator was almost instant due to the 5 fold higher magnetic response of fe3o4 nanoparticles therefore the evaluation experiments focused on determining the removal efficiency of cr vi for varying residence times and initial cr vi concentrations fig 9 summarizes the results of experiment series for the different runs of the contact reactor and magnetic separator sequence using abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles providing the mapping of residual cr vi concentration values determined under various experimental parameters for a dose of 80 mg l the complete purification of water residual cr vi close to 0 is observed

times cr vi uptake is still high but only partial with the residual concentration lying above 100 Î¼g l addition of the double nanocomposite dose 160 mg l expands the threshold for safe drinking water supply to a cr vi concentration of around 250 Î¼g l independently of the residence time or up to 450 Î¼g l for the lowest flowrate significantly lower efficiency for cr vi uptake was defined in the corresponding runs with pure fe3o4 nanoparticles fig s4 indicating that residual cr vi complies with drinking water regulation only when a higher dose is provided in polluted water with initial cr vi concentrations below 100 Î¼g l however for this sample the recovery of the solid in the separator was almost instant due to the 5 fold higher magnetic response of fe3o4 nanoparticles considering that for the studied flowrate range no release of the nanoadsorbent or leached metals were identified in the water outflowing from the magnetic separator unit the designed system is capable of operating with acceptable performance under realistic conditions of a water treatment particularly the suggested sequence of a stirring tank reactor realizing the contact between the magnetic nanocomposite and the polluted water and a rotary magnetic separator which contributes to the complete recovery of the cr loaded solid can be easily and proportionally scaled up to large dimensions to become part of real water treatment facilities in addition the established high uptake capacity of the tested nanocomposite in combination with the low capital operational and energy cost of the system ensures the competitiveness of such technology and a significant chance to become an option for communities with extended cr vi pollution regarding the stability of the recovered nanoadsorbents being loaded with captured chromium it has been demonstrated in previous studies that the presence of the fe3o4 and the abhurite phases promotes reduction of highly mobile cr vi species into almost insoluble cr iii hydroxides 69 this favors the occurrence of different forms of cr iii precipitation and complexation with the crystal structure of the solid side capture of cr vi by fe3o4 is accompanied by the surface oxidation of iron oxide to the Î³ fe2o3 and the complexation of cr iii in the defined crystal structure 70 such mechanism indicates a non reversible capture of cr iii considering also the very low tendency of this oxidation state to dissolve in an aqueous environment uptake of cr vi by sn ii oxyhydroxides was also correlated with the formation of surface complexes rather than the deposition of cr oh 3 here the outer surface layer of the oxyhydroxide is oxidized into a sno2 and the reduced cr iii species are attached to the tin phase through various complexation geometries 71 accordingly the fe3o4 nanoparticles and the corresponding sn ii nanocomposite tested in our study are finally loaded with cr iii on their surface forming a very stable solid byproduct interestingly the only way to release cr from the sn ii oxyhydroxide back to the aqueous phase is by applying extremely acidic conditions concentrated hcl and heat as recently suggested in an attempt to reconstruct and recycle similar adsorbents 72 finally the magnetically captured sludge of the nanoadsorbents which is strongly held on the rotating cylinder was moved out of the range of the magnetic field by a conveyor belt so as to avoid the gradual drop of the magnetic field range from the formation of a thick sludge film on the sides of the magnets the carried sludge was easily removed from the surface of the belt by the flow of a water stream and the dispersion of the cr vi loaded nanoadsorbent was collected in another tank 4 conclusions a laboratory pilot unit which combines the purification of water polluted with hexavalent chromium by an abhurite fe3o4 nanocomposite with the sequential complete recovery of the solid was developed by means of fluid dynamics predictions and via the monitoring of its experimental operation the success of its application was promoted by the high capacity of the tin oxyhydroxide to capture cr vi species rapidly through a reduction mechanism and the attached magnetically responsive fe3o4 nanoparticles which participate as carriers for the post treatment separation of the solid under the effect of magnetic field in this case a rotary magnetic separator replicating the corresponding operation of an industrial vacuum drum filter was designed to comply with the uninterrupted continuous flow mode and maximize the recovery efficient the separator consists of a halbach array of magnets fixed in a polymer disk immersed into the dispersion of the nanocomposite which outflows from the purification reactor optimized conditions of its operation such as rotating speed and direction flowrate and immersion height enabled the rapid capture and separation of the magnetic nanocomposite whereas the continuous removal of collected solid from the disk tread allows seamless operation without the need of cleaning the low cost of the applied nanocomposite and the opportunity for direct scale up of its implementation setup provides a very promising solution toward filtration free removal of pollutants using adsorbents the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 xrd diagram of the 20 fe3o4 abhurite nanocomposite and

12487,this work introduces a continuous flow process for the implementation of magnetic nanoadsorbents in drinking water treatment practices based on their complete recovery using a rotary separation setup with an arrangement including the use of permanent magnets magnetostatic analysis and computational fluid dynamics were combined to simulate the generated magnetic field of a halbach array of magnets fixed in a pmma disk and the flow behavior of a sn based magnetic nanocomposite dispersion under the influence of the alternating field the rotating speed and direction the flowrate of the dispersion and the immersion level into the dispersion tank were proven to be the critical parameters to maximize capture and separation of the nanocomposite from the flowing water to validate the efficiency of the designed setup the corresponding magnetic separator was built and adapted as a unit in a sequence with a stirring tank which brings cr vi polluted water in contact with the nanocomposite the experimental operation involved the use of a tin oxyhydroxide abhurite a phase known for its high uptake efficiency on cr vi loaded with 20 wt fe3o4 nanoparticles which act as the magnetic carrier for the post treatment recovery the developed pilot unit achieved a complete water purification for cr vi concentrations up to 100 Î¼g l even for low contact times such as 15 min whereas the in line magnetic separator offered a total 100 capture of the nanocomposite providing solid free and purified water keywords magnetic separation drinking water recovery nanoparticles hexavalent chromium purification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the expansion of the infiltration of nanotechnology in everyday activities the use of engineered nanoparticles is becoming very frequent in a wide range of applications beyond high technology ones electronics sensors information storage 1 particularly nanoparticles are increasingly used in clothing and cosmetic industries endowing novel properties to such products nanoparticles are also capable to strengthen the mechanical properties and resulting performance of constructing materials while their applications in the fields of biomedicine and environmental remediation is also becoming more widespread 2 3 in the latter case nanoparticles have limited operational lifetime and they are considered as consumables thus implying to the demand to minimize consequences of their post use release to the human body or to the environment 4 7 for instance the successful implementation of nanoparticles as effective adsorbents in water treatment technologies raises the issue of their complete recovery in the end considering the potential toxicity of the loaded pollutants and the relative high quantities of the collected solid 8 11 such need becomes more intense when drinking water is the subject of purification and nanoparticles should be approached as a byproduct after fulfilling their role in the process 12 13 therefore combining the restriction to succeed in reaching very low pollutant concentrations below the regulation limit the requirement to maximize capture capacity with minimum quantity of used nanoparticles and the demand to ensure the absence of nanoparticles in water or any waste stream the design of nanoparticle assisted drinking water treatment processes and the adoption of proper facilities are rather challenging fields of research 14 15 the main advantages of using nanoparticles for water purification are the increase of specific surface area due to their small dimensions and the possibility to accelerate treatment time by modifying the typical column bed configuration with a direct dispersion of nanoparticles in a tank unfortunately the nanoscale size of the nanoparticles may turn into a severe drawback since their separation at the end of the process requires the use of a nanofiltration a step which is able to dominate the total operation cost 16 to overcome this obstacle magnetic nanoparticles are suggested as a direct adsorbent or active phase carrier offering the potential for easy scalable and tunable separation when an external magnetic field is applied to the flow 17 18 magnetophoresis can be applied in a variety of geometries and magnetic field sources 19 in continuous flow water treatment facilities the magnetic field is commonly applied by placing permanent magnets electromagnets or even superconducting devices at the sides of the flowing steam 20 22 attachment of electromagnetic or superconducting coils manage to reach magnetic fields of very high intensity and fast control of the desired conditions being able to handle high flowrates of the nanoparticle dispersion 23 24 on the other hand the demand for electrical power or cryogenic installations respectively which increases significantly when scale up is attempted limits the practical interest for such solutions in water treatment employing permanent magnets especially those made of neodymium iron boron nd2fe14b is a much easier and cost saving option offering many different possibilities of arrangement and thereby separation efficiency 25 26 simple magnetic separators have been reported as a way to integrate magnetic adsorbents in water or wastewater treatment 27 for instance the uptake of cr vi by graphene fe3o4 polypyrrole nanocomposites was combined with their separation by a batch setup 28 other reports describe the application of magnetic nanoparticles for the removal of arsenic and cr vi from water adopted to continuous flow apparatus based on high gradient magnetic field columns and packed beds 29 32 there the dispersion of the nanoparticles after treatment process is directed through a vertical path into the generated magnetic field in another approach permanent magnets are commonly placed in sequence arranged in a way to force water pass through alternating magnetized and non magnetized regions forming a field gradient region 33 in the same scheme linear magnetic separators have been tested for the recovery of magnetic nanoparticles or nanocomposites when placed in the outflow of water treatment units 34 36 the field gradient was further increased by modifying the shape of the magnets the polarity direction the symmetry or by simply placing metallic wires to perturb the uniformity of the field another approach enabling to save time and space is the operation of sink float separators in which magnetically triggered flocculation is combined with the solid separation utilizing the levitation force of the magnetic fluid 37 38 but arrangements of static magnets must be accompanied with high flow lengths and narrow cross sections since the effective range of permanent magnets is small this turns to be a perplexing issue for the design of high capacity units requiring the operation of parallel flowing lines to handle the flow load dynamic motion of the arrangement of magnets or the flowing dispersion may elevate the separation efficiency and boost the recovery of weak magnetic phases the simulation and pilot testing of a rotary magnetic drum and a centrifugal separator was illustrated for the capture of magnetic particles in mineral separation processes 39 40 the magnetic force strength the relative rotation rate and the magnetic field gradient were found to positively affect the separation efficiency whereas feed flowrate was inversely proportional to the recovery yield additionally applications in water treatment suggest that the contact time of nanomaterial with polluted water the kinetic and removal capacity of the nanoadsorbent and the volume of the reactor are critical design parameters to construct and operate a magnetic separator 30 this study investigates a sophisticated magnetic separation setup for the recovery of used magnetic nanoparticles from water remediation processes based on the construction of a halbach array of magnets arranged in a rotating disk resembling the operation of rotary vacuum drum filters commonly used in industrial liquid solid separations such system appears advantageous for the reduction of the separator size with simultaneous improvement in recovery efficiency and volume capacity computational fluid dynamics cfd indicated the optimum construction and operation parameters with respect to the magnets arrangement and the various flow conditions flowrate concentration particle free path rotating speed simulation results were validated in a laboratory scale water treatment unit designed to purify water polluted by hexavalent chromium using fe3o4 nanoparticles as direct adsorbents or magnetic carriers for sn based phases 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup replicating the geometry of a rotary vacuum drum the main component of the magnetic separator setup was a rotating disk made of pmma which hosted rectangular ndfeb permanent magnets positioned in a halbach array configuration fig 1 the diameter of the disk was 100 mm with a width of 45 mm eight rectangular n42 type block magnets with dimensions 40 10 10 mm were placed into the disk with a radial symmetrical distribution very close to the edge to maximize the magnetic field gradient each magnet was positioned with 90 degrees rotation of the magnetization axis in comparison to the previous one in the sequence the disk was fixed in the center of a tank with dimensions 145 45 85 mm in which the flowing nanoparticle dispersion was introduced from a valve placed at the side at a height of 70 mm from the bottom the total volume of dispersion into the tank was controlled by the height of the outflowing valve which was adjusted at different positions on the top of the profile of the disk a conveyor belt was attached to drive collected nanoparticles away from the magnetic field and assist the recovery of the magnetic nanomaterial by water washing images of the laboratory setup are available in the supporting information the design parameters of the experiment were the rotating speed of the disk and the direction of rotation the flowrate and the concentration of the dispersion and the volume of the dispersion into the tank as defined by its operating level 2 2 computational fluid analysis in order to estimate and visualize the ferrofluid velocity and the motion of the magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid we employed a coupled magnetorheological model within the framework of comsol multiphysics 41 the distribution of magnetic field and its gradient were derived from the magnetostatic module while the spatiotemporal velocity distribution of the ferrofluid was obtained from the incompressible navier stokes equations the latter also depends on the rotation of the disk and so a rotating mesh was constructed the geometric model of magnetic separator rotor and fluid domain for computational fluid dynamics cfd and magnetostatic analysis was generated using the finite elements method provided by comsol multiphysics v 3 5a this simulation was developed in a manner that the dimensions and boundary conditions from the experimental setup are comparable fig 2 displays the 3d finite volume mesh of the present physical domain the mesh was composed of tetrahedral element type with ten nodes in subdomain and triangular element size with six nodes in boundaries the mesh consists of 748 053 tetrahedral elements with 155 438 nodes the tracking trajectories of nanoparticles were found by importing the forces experienced to the nanoparticles in the model the relevant equations those are the magnetic force magnetophoretic due to the presence of inhomogeneous non uniform external magnetic field and the viscous drag force that is resembling the friction that opposes the motion of magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid for nano sized particles gravitational force is insignificant as compared to the other two even though the gravitational force is playing a crucial role in dictating the transport behavior of larger sized magnetic particles often causing rapid sedimentation of particles when size is sufficiently large subjected to magnetophoresis it is usually insignificant as compared to the magnetophoretic and viscous drag forces if the nano sized mnp is employed 42 for the finite volume approach the integral form of the governing equations of mass transfer and species transport processes were applied to the control volume of the cells which make up the discretizational computational model of a continuous physical domain of the specific physical system under investigation in this study a multi phase model accounting for both the aqueous medium and the solid particles discrete phase model was used to study a multi species circular magnetic separator rotor with the temporal conservation laws of continuity momentum and energy 43 the governing partial differential equations for mass momentum magnetic field and energy equation are solved for the unsteady incompressible flow magnetic nanoparticles introduced into the separator system experience drag and magnetic forces in proportion to particle size very small particles such as those in the nanoscale also exhibit random brownian motion which can significantly affect nanoparticle behavior for small spherical particles in a fluid possessing a small reynolds number re 1 the drag force f d can be described using stokes drag which is defined as 44 1 f d 6 ÏÎ¼ r p v f where v f is the flow velocity r p is the radius of magnetic nanoparticle and Î¼ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the nanoparticles were assumed to be spherical with a radius of r p 20 nm furlani et al 45 determined analytically the magnetic force applied on a single spherical magnetic nanoparticle they used an effective dipole moment approach in which the particle is replaced by an equivalent point dipole located at its center the force depends on the magnetic field at the location of the

loaded with tin based oxyhydroxide were prepared and used as model systems to simulate the performance of the designed separator and experimentally validate the successful water purification and particle recovery in the suggested scheme beyond their magnetic response recent studies demonstrated that fe3o4 nanoparticles are able to contribute in the capture of aqueous cr vi forms even at low concentrations especially when high fe2 fe3 ratio is achieved by choosing suitable synthetic routes 35 46 on the other hand sn ii oxyhydroxides can be tailored to deliver the highest cr vi reduction potential following their ability to donate two electrons before reaching the maximum oxidation state for sn iv 47 therefore single fe3o4 nanoparticles were expected to show a lower uptake capacity combined with easier magnetic separation when the nanoparticles were used as a carrier in the nanocomposite magnetic separation would become more challenging due to the lower magnetic response but a much higher cr vi uptake response would be maintained considering their beneficial contribution to the purification process a similar approach was previously reported to develop fe3o4 feooh nanocomposites for simultaneous uptake of as v and sb v forms through an intermediate reduction step 36 magnetite nanoparticles with diameters around 40 nm were synthesized using the oxidative precipitation of concentrated feso4 solution by nano3 under the conditions of high temperature alkaline medium and the presence of ethanol 48 in brief 70 ml of a 0 28 m feso4 solution were rapidly mixed with another solution prepared by the addition of 40 ml absolute ethanol 1 84 g naoh and 1 70 g nano3 in 50 ml of degassed distilled water after that the viscous intermediate product green rust was transferred in a water bath regulated to 90 c and allowed to age for 12 h the black product was washed several times with distilled water and finally stored as dispersion a part of the fe3o4 nanoparticles was used as the first component to prepare tin based nanocomposite the tin oxyhydroxide was produced by the chemical precipitation of dissolved sncl2 solution 0 1 m at ph 2 initiated by the addition of 10 wt naoh solution 49 after carrying out the appropriate washing and centrifugation cycles concentrated sludge of the product identified as abhurite snâo oh âclâ was blended with corresponding sludge derived from the fe3o4 nanoparticle dispersion at a ratio of around 20 wt in fe3o4 it should be noted that wet blending is the only way to overcome redox interactions between the participating phases that would cause the significant loss of both cr vi uptake efficiency and magnetization values due to the oxidation of fe3o4 such issues have been already reported for tin oxyhydroxide decorated biochar composites 50 2 4 chromium uptake preliminary batch adsorption tests were performed in natural like water spiked with cr vi and adjusted to ph 7 to obtain adsorption isotherms for each sample a quantity of 5 100 mg of dried nanomaterial was dispersed in 200 ml of cr vi solution with concentration 100 1000 Î¼g l into 300 ml conical flasks the flasks were shaken for 24 h at 20 c using an orbital shaker then the solid was filtered and the cr vi residual concentration was determined using the diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method kinetic data for the uptake effect were separately collected by taking samples from a dispersion of 60 mg l of nanomaterial in a 500 Î¼g l of cr vi solution for time intervals up to 10 h the efficiency of the nanomaterials in a continuous flow process was evaluated by operating a 2 l contact reactor with mechanical stirring to mix nanoparticle dispersions with the polluted water test water with initial cr vi concentration 50 500 Î¼g l ph 7 was pumped in the reactor with a flowrate 30 140 ml min while the concentrated dispersion of nanoparticles was added in drops to stabilize a concentration of 80 or 160 mg l in the reactor such conditions defined a residence time of 15 60 min the outflowing dispersion was transferred to the rotary magnetic separator to recover nanomaterial and receive the treated water for cr vi determination the magnetic separation yield was evaluated after the determination of iron in the collected water from the outflow of the magnetic separator in the steady state 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic field distribution the magnetic field intensity generated by the halbach array configuration with eight ndfeb magnets was first estimated focusing on its distribution in the water flow region fig 3 the flux density was maximized in regions close to the magnet positions where values above 300 mt are observed near the disk water interface and values above 100 mt are preserved within a distance of 10 mm in the space between two magnets the flux density values weaken quickly after few mm from the disk surface however during rotation such arrangement is responsible for the continuous alternation of the field intensity at any flow position between the maximum and minimum values providing an extra gradient which further assists capture and separation of nanoparticles from water particularly the magnetic field gradient follows a similar distribution with its maximum reaching 100 t m close to the sides of the magnets the alternating field gradient in the region close to the disk surface provides a significant advantage in the capture of particles sized in the nanoscale when compared to previously reported stationary magnetophoresis setups such systems were adequate for the improvement of the mixing efficiency in order to establish homogeneity in nanoparticle dispersions control of transport behavior washing and sorting processes usually in biological samples 42 51 55 placing permanent magnets next to the flow path or in batch vessels requires an additional arrangement to achieve high separation yields for instance to improve magnetic gradient steel wool was used to narrow flowing channels through a superconducting magnetic separator to capture phosphate ferric flocs or remove microalgae from fishpond water 23 56 57 wires and rod micro matrices with different geometries were also proposed to ensure high capacity high gradient magnetic separation 56 58 59 elsewhere a three dimensional multi wire model was developed for separation of magnetic catalyst particles from the wax stream in fischer tropsch synthesis 60 similarly a ferromagnetic membrane separating unit made of laser perforated thick ferromagnetic foil was successfully tested to capture hydroxyapatite microparticles 1 Î¼m carried by magnetic nanoparticles from a water suspension 61 downstream options are also available to recover protein loaded magnetic nanoparticles but their performance is still under development whereas continuous flow is still out of discussion 62 the limitations of similar approaches to handle intentional release and re collecting of magnetic nanoparticles in water treatment facilities or other environmental engineering applications were summarized in 63 suggesting the important role of colloidal stability and the need to study magnetophoresis in the frame of theoretical analysis and dimensionless number calculations 3 2 fluid dynamics the magnetic field generated by the eight magnet rotating disk was added as an input to simulate the flow conditions of the aqueous magnetic nanoparticle dispersion inflowing to the separator tank the simulation was based on the magnetisation of nanocomposites at a ratio equal to 20 wt in fe3o4 fig 4 summarizes the flow velocity map of water into the separator under representative conditions of operation in addition the mean trajectories of nanoparticle movement under the effect of the magnetic field is also provided with a red continuous line this analysis is very similar to that performed to predict the particle trajectories in a mixing chamber with fluorescent particles in a ferrofluid stream by changing the number and the positions of 4 magnets 64 it has been reported that rotation of the magnetic arrangement caused a significant enhancement of mixing rate in our work higher rotation speeds are generally related to longer trajectories paths before nanoparticles reach the surface of the disk and be separated from the dispersion the case of clockwise rotation with 200 rpm fig 4a suggests a much faster capture of most nanoparticles upon entering the flowing path in the separator on the other hand the separation time when increasing rotation speed to 300 rpm fig 4b is almost doubled working with a counter clockwise rotation shows important advantages since rotation of the disk in the opposite direction to the water flow allows separation at an earlier stage fig 4c while at the same time the captured solid is transferred directly out of the tank having minimum contact with the incoming water moreover it is clear in fig 4 that the rotation of the disk generates an inhomogeneous distribution of fluid velocity with points of high and low velocity breadth near the magnets due to the spatiotemporal alternation of the location of those points the rotation increases the probability for a particle to pass from a point of relatively low fluid velocity and eventually to be captured by the magnet by running similar simulations for several conditions the mean free path of magnetic nanoparticles as a function of the rotation speed was calculated fig 5 counter clockwise rotation appears to be the optimum choice with the residence time of nanoparticles in the flow being minimized for a wide range of disk velocities between 100 and 400 rpm on the contrary clockwise rotation provides fast separation only for 200 rpm and then the mean free path rapidly increases small or zero rotation speeds of the disk appears to be another condition associated with slower separation rates rotation speed has been found to be a dominant parameter to define separation yield in a high capacity wet belt magnetic separator used to purify non metallic ores 65 increasing the rotation speed was responsible for weakening of the magnetic force and the loss of magnetic material to the non magnetic product the validity of multiphysics models to simulate the field gradient and predict experimental separation yield is supported by combined theoretical and experimental studies for the optimization of aerodynamic drum or wet rotating magnetic separating devices 66 67 3 3 long term field disorder the operation of the magnetic separator for extended period would result in the collection of significant magnetic solid at the sides of the disk forming a thick film of nanoparticles around the positions of the magnets the magnetization of each nanoparticle itself gives rise to a self demagnetization field also called demagnetizing field that opposes magnetic field h and its amplitude increases with the amount of the deposited magnetic material this internal field is also taken into account in the estimation of the induced magnetic flux density b thus the amplitude of magnetic flux density would experience a significant drop in the flowing path fig 6 with proportional consequences in the separation rate and total yield fig 4d illustrates the importance of studying this scenario since the interference induced by particle accumulation is responsible for the increase of nanoparticle free path to long distances even worse the complete separation of nanoparticles becomes doubtful as more material is captured and remains in the rotating disk in the long term it is calculated that separation efficiency may drop to around 30 for this reason the use of a conveyor belt adopted on the disk to rapidly take out captured nanoparticles from the system was recommended for the experimental setup 3 4 water level effect in the designed rotary magnetic separator the length of the flowing path of the dispersion under the effect of the magnetic field is defined by the operation level of water in the tank in practice water level can be tuned by moving the position of the outflow hole at different heights to understand the significance of this design parameter in the efficiency of the magnetic separator simulations of the mean free path of nanoparticles when the water level was adjusted to 3 cm were carried out results showing the average trajectories of nanoparticles are presented in fig 7 at lower flowrates 60 ml min a mean free path of 3 6 cm was calculated before capture and separation is observed while upon doubling the flowrate the mean path increases to 4 3 cm the distance before capture approaches 8 6 cm when a flowrate of 600 ml min is applied 3 5 amount of magnets another variation of the system which involves the replacement of the eight magnet halbach arrangement by a four magnet array was simulated the main alternation lies on the higher distances between magnets which extends the path with very low magnetic flux density fig 8 therefore the frequency of field alternation between maximum and minimum values decreases to the half for the same rotating speed the mean free path before separation when a four magnet separator is applied is shown in fig 8 in comparison to the efficiency of the eight magnet arrangement the four magnet system was found to be less efficient presenting a constant mean path increase of around 30 at any operating flowrate for flowrates below 150 ml min the separation is relatively fast taking place at early stages of the flow path however above 150 ml min the flowing distance before capture presents a sharp increase reaching levels in which complete separation is not expected to occur the important role of dense cylindrical arrangements of rotating permanent magnets was mathematically predicted and then observed toward coagulation of magnetic and non magnetic minerals 68 generated alternating magnetic field induces dynamic rotation and repulsion forces which assists the capture of magnetic diamagnetic and conductive particles from a slurry 3 6 pilot unit operation the optimization through computational fluid dynamics is a common design procedure to predict the performance the optimum geometry and operating parameters without the need to construct and test all mentioned cases which would entail a cost increase to validate the efficiency of the designed magnetic separator as a component of a continuous flow sequence with a water purification reactor utilizing abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles or reference fe3o4 nanoparticles the possibility to achieve high cr vi uptake accompanied by 100 nanocomposite recovery was studied for various experimental conditions the used nanoadsorbents were previously characterized to verify their composition and efficiency toward cr vi uptake capacity and capture rate details can be found in the supporting information file xrd measurements fig s1 confirmed the prevalent presence of tin chloro oxyhydroxide snâo oh âclâ in the nanocomposite with structure identical to the abhurite mineral whereas peaks corresponding to the inverse spinel structure of fe3o4 were also identified in both samples uptake efficiency in the low residual concentration range 800 Î¼g l was studied through batch adsorption experiments to obtain the isotherms fig s2 by fitting collected data with a freundlich type curve it was found that the capacity of the nanocomposite for cr vi when residual concentration of 25 Î¼g l was achieved was around 7 mg g a lower corresponding capacity for the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles was determined 2 3 mg g the kinetic study of the nanomaterials indicated that 50 of the process was completed within the first 15 min whereas 80 of the equilibrium capture was reached after 50 min of contact the used nanoadsorbents were previously characterized to verify their composition and efficiency toward cr vi uptake capacity and capture rate details can be found in the supporting information file xrd measurements fig s1 confirmed the prevalent presence of tin chloro oxyhydroxide snâo oh âclâ in the nanocomposite with structure

cr vi when residual concentration of 25 Î¼g l was achieved was around 7 mg g a lower corresponding capacity for the pure fe3o4 nanoparticles was determined 2 3 mg g the kinetic study of the nanomaterials indicated that 50 of the process was completed within the first 15 min whereas 80 of the equilibrium capture was reached after 50 min of contact although typical cr vi polluted groundwaters are rarely met with concentrations above 100 Î¼g l in this series of experiments concentrations up to 500 Î¼g l were tested in the feed of the contact reactor in parallel various flowrates and consequently residence times were applied to understand the effect of the process rate in the total efficiency more specifically to achieve residence times of the contact reactor in the range 15 60 min the water flowrate in the magnetic separator was adjusted to the range 140 30 ml min respectively under such flow conditions the magnetic separation yield in the eight magnet rotary separator was maintained at the maximum level and zero iron concentrations were measured in the outflow such facile recovery of nanomaterial should be attributed to an occurring cooperative magnetophoresis and the corresponding induced convection which is expected for the specific field gradient and particle concentration 21 therefore the evaluation experiments focused on determining the removal efficiency of cr vi for varying residence times and initial cr vi concentrations fig 9 summarizes the results of experiment series for the different runs of the contact reactor and magnetic separator sequence using abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles providing the mapping of residual cr vi concentration values determined under various experimental parameters for a dose of 80 mg l the complete purification of water residual cr vi close to 0 is observed independently of the residence time in the reactor when initial cr vi was at maximum 100 Î¼g l which is a reasonable and typical case of realistic operation condition for drinking water treatment then at more polluted water sources a residence time of at least 45 min is required to distribute water in compliance to the upcoming regulation for cr vi the specific dose of the nanocomposite was able to sufficiently treat water with initial concentration up to 300 Î¼g l when flowrate was decreased to correspond to a 60 min residence time for higher initial cr vi concentrations or lower residence times cr vi uptake is still high but only partial with the residual concentration lying above 100 Î¼g l addition of the double nanocomposite dose 160 mg l expands the threshold for safe drinking water supply to a cr vi concentration of around 250 Î¼g l independently of the residence time or up to 450 Î¼g l for the highest flowrate significantly lower efficiency for cr vi uptake was defined in the corresponding runs with pure fe3o4 nanoparticles fig s4 indicating that residual cr vi complies with drinking water regulation only when a higher dose is provided in polluted water with initial cr vi concentrations below 100 Î¼g l however for this sample the recovery of the solid in the separator was almost instant due to the 5 fold higher magnetic response of fe3o4 nanoparticles therefore the evaluation experiments focused on determining the removal efficiency of cr vi for varying residence times and initial cr vi concentrations fig 9 summarizes the results of experiment series for the different runs of the contact reactor and magnetic separator sequence using abhurite loaded fe3o4 nanoparticles providing the mapping of residual cr vi concentration values determined under various experimental parameters for a dose of 80 mg l the complete purification of water residual cr vi close to 0 is observed independently of the residence time in the reactor when initial cr vi was at maximum 100 Î¼g l which is a reasonable and typical case of realistic operation condition for drinking water treatment then

times cr vi uptake is still high but only partial with the residual concentration lying above 100 Î¼g l addition of the double nanocomposite dose 160 mg l expands the threshold for safe drinking water supply to a cr vi concentration of around 250 Î¼g l independently of the residence time or up to 450 Î¼g l for the lowest flowrate significantly lower efficiency for cr vi uptake was defined in the corresponding runs with pure fe3o4 nanoparticles fig s4 indicating that residual cr vi complies with drinking water regulation only when a higher dose is provided in polluted water with initial cr vi concentrations below 100 Î¼g l however for this sample the recovery of the solid in the separator was almost instant due to the 5 fold higher magnetic response of fe3o4 nanoparticles considering that for the studied flowrate range no release of the nanoadsorbent or leached metals were identified in the water outflowing from the magnetic separator unit the designed system is capable of operating with acceptable performance under realistic conditions of a water treatment particularly the suggested sequence of a stirring tank reactor realizing the contact between the magnetic nanocomposite and the polluted water and a rotary magnetic separator which contributes to the complete recovery of the cr loaded solid can be easily and proportionally scaled up to large dimensions to become part of real water treatment facilities in addition the established high uptake capacity of the tested nanocomposite in combination with the low capital operational and energy cost of the system ensures the competitiveness of such technology and a significant chance to become an option for communities with extended cr vi pollution regarding the stability of the recovered nanoadsorbents being loaded with captured chromium it has been demonstrated in previous studies that the presence of the fe3o4 and the abhurite phases promotes reduction of highly mobile cr vi species into almost insoluble cr iii hydroxides 69 this favors the occurrence of different forms of cr iii precipitation and complexation with the crystal structure of the solid side capture of cr vi by fe3o4 is accompanied by the surface oxidation of iron oxide to the Î³ fe2o3 and the complexation of cr iii in the defined crystal structure 70 such mechanism indicates a non reversible capture of cr iii considering also the very low tendency of this oxidation state to dissolve in an aqueous environment uptake of cr vi by sn ii oxyhydroxides was also correlated with the formation of surface complexes rather than the deposition of cr oh 3 here the outer surface layer of the oxyhydroxide is oxidized into a sno2 and the reduced cr iii species are attached to the tin phase through various complexation geometries 71 accordingly the fe3o4 nanoparticles and the corresponding sn ii nanocomposite tested in our study are finally loaded with cr iii on their surface forming a very stable solid byproduct interestingly the only way to release cr from the sn ii oxyhydroxide back to the aqueous phase is by applying extremely acidic conditions concentrated hcl and heat as recently suggested in an attempt to reconstruct and recycle similar adsorbents 72 finally the magnetically captured sludge of the nanoadsorbents which is strongly held on the rotating cylinder was moved out of the range of the magnetic field by a conveyor belt so as to avoid the gradual drop of the magnetic field range from the formation of a thick sludge film on the sides of the magnets the carried sludge was easily removed from the surface of the belt by the flow of a water stream and the dispersion of the cr vi loaded nanoadsorbent was collected in another tank 4 conclusions a laboratory pilot unit which combines the purification of water polluted with hexavalent chromium by an abhurite fe3o4 nanocomposite with the sequential complete recovery of the solid was developed by means of fluid dynamics predictions and via the monitoring of its experimental operation the success of its application was promoted by the high capacity of the tin oxyhydroxide to capture cr vi species rapidly through a reduction mechanism and the attached magnetically responsive fe3o4 nanoparticles which participate as carriers for the post treatment separation of the solid under the effect of magnetic field in this case a rotary magnetic separator replicating the corresponding operation of an industrial vacuum drum filter was designed to comply with the uninterrupted continuous flow mode and maximize the recovery efficient the separator consists of a halbach array of magnets fixed in a polymer disk immersed into the dispersion of the nanocomposite which outflows from the purification reactor optimized conditions of its operation such as rotating speed and direction flowrate and immersion height enabled the rapid capture and separation of the magnetic nanocomposite whereas the continuous removal of collected solid from the disk tread allows seamless operation without the need of cleaning the low cost of the applied nanocomposite and the opportunity for direct scale up of its implementation setup provides a very promising solution toward filtration free removal of pollutants using adsorbents the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 xrd diagram of the 20 fe3o4 abhurite nanocomposite and

12488,industrial wastewater frequently contains suspended solid ss particles which may be extremely harmful to human health and the environment the bed filtration method offers clear benefits for treating wastewater contaminated with ss particles an important technical indicator of the method is the bed pressure drop but modeling of its development during bed filtration has been poorly studied in this study the ergun equation is selected as the basis of the pressure drop model and its parameters are optimized to evaluate the model s accuracy at various flow rates and total bed depths filtration experiments were carried out the findings demonstrate that the model has a high prediction accuracy with prediction errors for the bed pressure drop in the deep stage being less than 5 by the end of the deep stage the accumulated masses of ss particles in the 5 cm layer below the bed surface in 15 cm and 25 cm depth beds accounted for about 85 1 and 80 4 and were responsible for 51 and 36 of the pressure drop respectively and after the deep stage less ss particles being retained as filter cake will benefit long term operation the optimization model provided in this study and the discovery of the pressure drop distribution within the bed can provide a theoretical basis for the design or improvement of the bed filtration process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords industrial wastewater ss particles bed filtration pressure drop model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the accelerated growth of industry the generation of wastewater has expanded significantly and the hydrosphere has been seriously and widely polluted endangering human health and safety 1 suspended solid ss particles are one of the main forms of pollutants in industrial wastewater characterized by difficult sedimentation and degradation they are not only pollutants themselves but also provide carriers for other contaminants such as heavy metal ions and pathogenic microorganisms 2 the removal of ss particles is thus a crucial component of industrial wastewater treatment 3 the choice of treatment method is strongly influenced by the working conditions of the wastewater high fluctuation concentration high toxicity or residual pressure and heat will cause rapid inactivation of microbial community the products of chemical transformation process are prone to secondary pollution therefore the disadvantages of most biological 4 and chemical 5 treatment methods are significant the principle of industrial wastewater treatment by physical methods is the separation of ss particles from the wastewater common separation technologies include mechanical screening hydro cyclone separation 6 membrane separation 7 bed filtration and others bed filtration and its packaged technology 8 10 are widely used in industry because they provide both the required separation accuracy and efficiency and have a long operation cycle 11 compared to the other technologies the easy backwash regeneration of bed filtration is another significant benefit typically pressure drop is taken directly as a key operational indicator for regeneration the gradual accumulation of ss particles in the bed is the primary factor contributing to the rising of pressure drop the pressure drop reaching a certain threshold also indicates that the concentration of ss particles is too high and the filtration performance will decline the existing research on bed pressure drop focuses on the exploration of pressure drop variations and the establishment of filtration models bed filtration models include the capillary model 12 constricted tube model 13 and spherical model 14 based on the calculation of the real flow within the bed and porous medium model 15 that facilitate the calculation of the apparent flow field as well as unit bed element ube model 16 that provide a non homogenization approach in contrast researchers preferred the apparent flow based calculation due to its simpler acquisition of parameters darcy s law 17 18 which proposed a description of the bed permeability coefficient described a linear relationship between permeability velocity and hydraulic gradient based on a homogeneous porous medium model the permeability coefficient was calculated using the bed void fraction parameter in the well known semi empirical kozeny carman equation 19 21 more specifically the permeability coefficient and particle sizes were linked by the fair hatch equation 22 23 and advanced equations based on them for theorisation such as the brinkman kozeny equation 24 darcy s law based equations worked well for handling linear issues at low reynolds numbers but they were insufficient to cope with the parameters that varied and tended to be unevenly distributed during the bed filtration process as well as with non linear conditions 25 the forchheimer empirical equation 26 28 responded by adding a non linear term and reflected the effects of the viscosity and inertia in the flow field the ergun equation 29 30 is a typical forchheimer type equation with stable empirical coefficients and it s very good capabilities for predicting porous medium pressure drops have been demonstrated 31 33 some researchers also modified selected particle parameters for example andrei et al 34 defined the equivalent diameter of particles which was mainly influenced by the sphericity of particles yang et al 35 modified the equivalent diameter by the cylinder specific surface area parameter to use it in a fibrous bed model in the studies most of the bed pressure drop was calculated statically and the changes in the pressure drop during the filtration process were not explained in detail in few studies the changes in the pressure drop caused by the accumulation of ss particles were discussed and clear methods or models for predicting those changes were not formulated an efficient model for pressure drop prediction during the bed filtration process will provide important guidance for the technical optimization and implementation of the process based on the general form of ergun equation an optimization method is proposed in this paper for transforming the static parameters into dynamic parameters and the advantages of spherical model and ube model are combined to build a model for predicting the dynamic changes in the bed pressure drop the general correction method of the ergun equation is adopted to improve the accuracy of pressure drop predictions bed filtration experiments were performed at different flow rates and bed depths to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the optimized prediction model and the trend towards non homogenization within the bed was discussed 2 mathematical model and experiment 2 1 mathematical model 1 model foundations a filtration bed is usually formed by random packing of granular media which can then be regarded as an evenly distributed porous medium in the initial state when ss particles accumulate in the bed during the filtration process the bed porosity distribution tends to become uneven along the main direction of the flow on the other hand the porosity distribution differences perpendicular to the main flow direction usually caused by the boundary effects are small and are ignored in the optimized model therefore the bed depth was divided into several layers using the ube theory 16 as shown in fig 1 to simplify the calculations the porosity and amount of accumulated ss particles in multiple adjacent ubes were considered to be the same the changes on the surface ube affected by the accumulation of ss particles were considered to be representative of the change within the total bed depth affected by the accumulation of ss particles the bed filtration process was divided into the deep stage including the initial stage the middle stage and the late stage and the surface stage of forming the filter cake the corresponding surface ube changes are shown in fig 1 2 model equations as the only real time monitoring parameter that can guide the operation the bed pressure drop during the filtration process is an important indicator of the bed filtration process operational status 9 previous studies 31 32 36 have shown that the accuracy of the ergun equation 29 30 for the pressure drop calculations of randomly packed particle beds is satisfactory the formula is as follows 1 Î´p z 150 1 Îµ 2 Îµ 3 Î¼ d 2 u 1 75 1 Îµ Îµ 3 Ï d u 2 where z is the bed depth Îµ and d are the bed porosity and the medium particle diameter respectively and Î¼ and u are the fluid viscosity and the apparent velocity respectively the numerical coefficients 150 and 1 75 correspond to the viscous resistance coefficient and the inertial resistance coefficient respectively which were determined using a regular spherical particle bed in the case of different shape parameters of bed medium particles including but not limited to particle sphericity specific surface area surface roughness and others these two coefficients need to be experimentally calibrated i e a resistance coefficient correction method should be adopted 31 32 therefore when the ergun equation is applied to an irregular granular bed especially when parameters such as particle diameter and porosity vary with the process it must take the general form with the resistance coefficients a and b to be determined and where the parameters should be expressed as dynamically 2 Î´ p c z a Î¼ 1 Îµ c t 2 Îµ c t 3 d c t 2 u f b Ï l 1 Îµ c t Îµ c t 3 d c t u f 2 where subscript t indicates that these parameters will change with time as the bed filtration process continues and subscripts c and f refer to the bed particles and apparent fluid respectively after the resistance coefficients a and b are determined the general ergun equation has the diameter of the medium particles as the only independent variable parameter after the apparent velocity is given the diameter of the medium particles changes with the accumulation of ss particles in the bed which is related to the relationship between the bed pressure drop and the mass of ss particles accumulated in the bed at the end of the deep stage of the bed filtration process a large amount of ss particles will accumulate within the top layer bed units and the degree of void filling will be high the viscosity and inertia coefficients will change and a surface filter cake will form reducing the accuracy of the general ergun equation thus at this stage the pressure drop has to be considered differently the pressure drop comprises two parts the drop within the bed Î´p c and within the surface filter cake Î´p s 37 3 Î´ p Î´ p c Î´ p s ss particles formed surface filter cakes at relatively constant apparent velocities and varying differential pressures resulting in uneven porosities and varying thicknesses of filter cakes 38 39 making it difficult to apply calculation models that require coefficient determinations such as darcy s law or the ergun equation 40 a parametric representation of the actual accumulation of ss particles in the filter cake within the flow field is necessary which is related to the convection and diffusion intensity of the particle population 41 the peclet number pe is a dimensionless number commonly used in the studies of transport phenomena whose physical meaning is the ratio of the convection rate to the diffusion rate 42 4 pe 3 u f Ï Î¼ d 2 k 0 t in the above formula d is the median diameter of ss particle count

the bed m 0 is the ss particle mass at the end of the deep filtration stage and Ï s is the ss particle density the pressure drop of a fluid through a particulate deposit layer was studied earlier by davies et al 44 and based on their main conclusion thomas et al 45 further extended the expression for the pressure drop of a filter cake by 6 Î´ p s 64 Î± s 1 5 1 56 Î± s 3 Î¼ z f c u f d s 2 c u

of ss particles in the fluid and the subscripts i o and t refer to the bed inlet bed outlet and time respectively 2 2 parameter optimization eq 2 adopts the determined viscosity and inertia coefficients and pure water at 20 c and atmospheric pressure is selected as the fluid the parameters that reflect the dynamic changes in the filtration process include the porosity Îµ c t and the medium particle diameter d c t both of which are related to the in situ packing of ss particles from the above considering the combination of several adjacent ubes and the influence of the shape of

to calculate d c t with non negligible seepage through the layer considered the seepage channels are too small to allow for the transport of ss particles 47 to simplify the seepage calculation the percolation theory 48 was used to optimize the equivalent state of the cumulative layer and Î± u was assumed to be equal to 0 6884 at the same time the application range of the model was extended to the bed filtration of wastewater containing deformable ss particles the dynamic change diagram of the bed medium particles is shown in fig 2 which shows the equivalent spheres of the medium particles as a function of the mass m s the bed porosity Îµ c t has the relationship of 1 Îµ c t 1 Îµ c 0 d c t 3 d c 0 3 with the particle diameter d c t thus it can be expressed by the following equation 12

particles which was one specification of quartz sand ss particles were simulated using fly ash passed through a mesh 3000 sieve the parameters of the materials used are listed in table 1 where a larger number of experimental groups were conducted using quartz sand of 1 0 2 0 mm multiple parameter measurements were made and the model equation was calculated by substituting the mean value pressure gauges were set in the filter and at the bed outlet to obtain the pressure values at different depths of the bed in real time and flowmeters were deployed in the pipeline to monitor the flow the control variables in the experiment were total bed filling depth and flow rate the ss content in the inlet and outlet water and the value of each pressure indication were monitored regularly the measured data were then processed to obtain the changes in filtration efficiency and bed pressure drop with time and with the accumulated mass of filtered ss particles 2 experimental program the selection of the depths of the bed medium was based on the theoretical analysis and observations of preliminary experiments which showed that the content of ss particles within a certain depth from the top surface of the bed was the largest after the filter cake formation on the surface of the bed medium particle samples were acquired in an experiment with quartz sand from the surface of the bed depth 0 cm depth of 10 cm and depth of 20 cm at the end of the deep stage of the filtration process sample images from a scanning electron microscope sem are shown in fig 4 based on the above discussion a 5 cm total depth was selected for the first bed filtration experiment and additional total depths of 15 cm and 25 cm were used following lessons from the initial trial in the subsequent experiments for the different bed depths the flow rates were controlled in the range of 4 16 l min and the corresponding bed apparent velocities were 3 14 m h the simulated wastewater was prepared using fly ash see table 1 in which the target mass concentration of ss particles was 500 mg l the simulated wastewater and outlet water from the multiple experiments were interrogated by the gravimetric method and substituted into the mathematical model the sampling interval was 5 min during the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of viscosity and inertial resistance coefficients the viscosity and inertia resistance coefficients a and b in eq 2 were determined from the bed pressure drop measurements four flow values in the range of 4 16 l min were selected to axially flow through the beds of the depth of 5 cm the changes in the pressure drop with flow rate are shown in fig 5 the measured data were fit with a quadratic function and the viscosity and inertia resistance coefficients a and b were obtained by dividing the linear and quadratic term coefficients by Î¼ 1 Îµ c t 2 Îµ c t 3 d c t 2 and Ï l 1 Îµ c t Îµ c t 3 d c t in eq 2 respectively the resistance coefficients of the medium bed were determined as a 173 and b 1 66 for the 1 0 2 0 mm quartz sand 3 2 bed filtration performance and pressure drops under different flow rates after the correction of the bed resistance coefficients and the optimization of the dynamic parameters the filtration experiments for the 5 cm deep bed at 8 12 and 16 l min flow rates were carried out the change in filtration efficiency with time and the accumulated ss particle mass are in fig 6 a and b respectively the initial efficiency was slightly higher when the flow rate was small a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the large fluid traction provided by the high flow rate reduces the chance of ss particles accumulating on the bed particles at the initial filtration moment 49 and the efficiencies improved faster when the flow rate was high in fig 6 b the change in filtration efficiency with the accumulated ss particle mass under the three flow rates tended to be consistent it is thus demonstrated that the changes in filtration efficiency are highly correlated with the mass of ss particles accumulated in the bed under different flow rates at the same depth bed and the flow rate is the factor that determines the accumulation rate of ss particle mass the pressure drops in the bed were recorded at the same time as the filtration efficiencies the measured pressure drops with time and accumulated ss particle mass are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively additionally in fig 6 d the measured pressure drops were compared to the model predictions which included both the optimized model and the original model of the ergun equation the rising trend of bed pressure drop accelerated suddenly till the surface filtration stage commenced it was driven up by the surface filter cake which corresponded to the reduction in flow flux and the increase in resistance of the cake 50 the pressure drop model predictions of the accumulated ss particle mass all had a transition point at 5381 g m2 for beds of 5 cm depth which was defined as the boundary between the deep and surface stages on the other hand the experimental data indicated different transition points for each of the three flow rates the differences between them and the model values were larger for larger flow rates which are approximately700 g m2 1000 g m2 and 1200 g m2 respectively for 8 12 and 16 l min thus the model errors of the transition points values were close to 20 at the maximum flow rate a plausible explanation for the errors can be that multiple ss particles formed bridges across the gap between bed particles bridging phenomenon 51 52 which limited the migration and reduced the flux of ss particles in the cross section of the bed for the comparison of model and experimental values of pressure drop the deep stage pressure drop errors were within 5 analyzing these errors from the model perspective the main reason was that changes in the values of a and b in the late deep stage were no longer negligible another important factor was that the calculated bed was a collection of multiple ubes and neglecting the small differences between ubes would cause a loss of accuracy too for industrial applications the level of error of the optimized model is acceptable and also of importance to advise bed filtration cycle in contrast the errors of the original model surpassed 20 in the late deep stage 3 3 filtration performance and pressure drops at different bed depths additional bed filtration experiments were carried out for the total bed depths of 5 15 and 25 cm at a flow rate of 12 l min the filtration efficiency changed with time and accumulated ss particle mass as shown in fig 7 a and b the initial filtration efficiencies increased with the increase in total bed depth essentially because the deeper the bed the longer the transmission time for the ss particles contacting the bed particles 53 the changes in filtration efficiency with accumulated ss particle mass showed a similar trend but the ss particle mass corresponding to the pressure drop at the same moment in different beds grew with the increasing bed depth which was caused by the increasing transmission time of ss particles resulting in their more accumulation in the bed this suggests that the model case may be correct in that the transition point between the two filtration stages at a given flow rate is not related to the bed depth the variations in the pressure drop with time and accumulated ss particle mass are shown in fig 7 c and d the initial pressure drops were approximately proportional to the bed depth and the trends of pressure drop with time were consistent the experimental curves of pressure drop with accumulated ss particle mass had their transition points that were less than 18 earlier than the corresponding model predictions which was similar to the situation discussed in section 3 2 the deeper the bed the larger the accumulated ss particle mass corresponding to the transition point under the adopted flow rate of 12 l min the theoretical transition points of the beds with depths of 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm were 5381 g m2 6177 g m2 and 6479 g m2 respectively i e the differences between two consecutive values were 769 g m2 and 302 g m2 the differences calculated according to the transition points of the curves fitted to the experimental data were about 750 g m2 and 290 g m2 i e the errors were less than 3 0 and 5 0 respectively it implies that the model s prediction errors for transition points are systematic in theory the downstream bed filters the effluent of the upstream bed without affecting the mass accumulation in the upstream bed 54 in other words this part of the difference corresponds to the mass distribution of ss particles in the bed taking the bed of the depth of 25 cm at the end of the deep filtration stage as an example the relative masses of accumulated ss particles in 0 5 cm 5 15 cm and 15 25 cm depth layer were about 80 4 14 1 and 5 5 respectively and the mass percentage in the 0 5 cm and 5 15 cm depth layers of the 15 cm depth bed were 85 1 and 14 9 this results from the superficial layer at small depths filtering the maximum concentration of simulated wastewater first resulting in the fastest accumulation of mass 55 56 and the fastest reduction in porosity 57 58 3 4 pressure drops over different bed depths as described in section 3 3 the distribution of accumulated ss particles at different depths of the bed differed resulting in differences in pressure drop distributions several cases located at different depths of the same bed were investigated and are shown in fig 8 the pressures at different depths of the 25 cm depth bed at a flow rate of 12 l min during the filtrations process were monitored and the pressure drops between the monitored points were calculated the pressure drops over bed depths 0 5 cm i 5 15 cm ii and 15 25 cm iii are shown in fig 8 c and d and compared with the corresponding model predictions in case i the actual pressure drops were consistent with the model values of the 5 cm depth bed in cases ii and iii the pressure drops increased with a slowly diminishing growth rate before stabilization the pressure drop model values in cases ii and iii were calculated based on the ube division and the errors between the model and mean of experimental values were found to be less than 1 the same analysis was carried out for the 15 cm depth bed shown in fig 8 a and b which exhibited similar results at the end of the deep filtration stage of the 15 and 25 cm depth beds the pressure drop within the top 5 cm bed layer accounted for about 52 and 36 of the total values respectively both the experiment and the model pointed out that after the filtration began the bed top layer was carrying the fastest rate of increase in pressure drop relative to the other depths and the largest pressure drop gradually shifted to that layer this corresponded to the unevenness in distribution and trend of ss particles within the bed 55 56 3 5 performance of the model in long term operation the above experiments proved that the pressure drop model has good accuracy in the deep stage of bed filtration but the duration failed to meet the demand of long term operation so the experimental duration was extended and the filtration performance and pressure drop were monitored for a 25 cm depth bed at a flow rate of 12 l min and the monitored data are shown in fig 9 the trends of filtration efficiency and pressure drop in the early and mid term were consistent with the previous experiments but the efficiency decreased rapidly in the late term while the pressure drop increased at a slower rate which was related to the decrease in the accumulation rate of ss particles in the evolution of the pressure drop with the accumulated ss particle mass pressure drop model values maintained high fit with the experimental data which was also in line with the variation over a short period of time after the surface stage started but then there were one or more significant decreases in pressure drop and maintained a large fluctuation this may be derived from partial collapse of the filter cake 59 60 where the bridge formed between the bed particles was disrupted when the pressure drop rose 61 and the filter cake formed above it thus lost its support and increased flux 62 the ss particles provided less pressure drop within the bed than the filter cake which resulted in a lower overall rate of pressure drop rise applying the model to the bed without ube division the point a corresponding to the highest ss particle mass and pressure drop within the bed is obtained and its connection with the point b at the beginning of the surface stage can be considered as the trend line of pressure drop without filter cake 0 g m2 and the isomass reference lines of filter cake mass can be obtained combined with the location of the data area when it reached the predicted maximum pressure drop it can be seen that the mass of the retained filter cake is about 2000 3500 g m2 and the less the retained mass the later the pressure drop reaching maximum it states that the reduction of filter cake formation is beneficial for long term operation 4 conclusions in this study based on the optimization of the parameters of the ergun equation the pressure drop prediction model for the bed filtration process was established and bed filtration experiments were carried out to verify the accuracy of the optimized model and the pressure drop distribution of the bed filtration process was investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the pressure drop prediction model based on the ergun equation with parameters optimized mainly for the bed particles diameter has prediction errors of less than 5 for the deep filtration 2 the deep filtration of different depth beds completed at similar times but corresponded to different ss particle masses between which the differences represented its distribution within the bed and mainly concentrated in the surface layer 3 the distribution of pressure drop over different layer in the same bed was associated with that of ss particles and the pressure drop over the surface layer rising fastest and maintaining highest 4 the variation of pressure drop after deep filtration stage can be explained with the optimized model combined with filter cake formation and collapse the less the filter cake formed the longer the filtration time although the model cannot yet explain unexpected mechanisms such as particle bridging and avoid the errors they bring its prediction accuracy meets the needs of practical applications and can provide good theoretical guidance for the design and evaluation of bed filtration and its

12488,industrial wastewater frequently contains suspended solid ss particles which may be extremely harmful to human health and the environment the bed filtration method offers clear benefits for treating wastewater contaminated with ss particles an important technical indicator of the method is the bed pressure drop but modeling of its development during bed filtration has been poorly studied in this study the ergun equation is selected as the basis of the pressure drop model and its parameters are optimized to evaluate the model s accuracy at various flow rates and total bed depths filtration experiments were carried out the findings demonstrate that the model has a high prediction accuracy with prediction errors for the bed pressure drop in the deep stage being less than 5 by the end of the deep stage the accumulated masses of ss particles in the 5 cm layer below the bed surface in 15 cm and 25 cm depth beds accounted for about 85 1 and 80 4 and were responsible for 51 and 36 of the pressure drop respectively and after the deep stage less ss particles being retained as filter cake will benefit long term operation the optimization model provided in this study and the discovery of the pressure drop distribution within the bed can provide a theoretical basis for the design or improvement of the bed filtration process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

industry the generation of wastewater has expanded significantly and the hydrosphere has been seriously and widely polluted endangering human health and safety 1 suspended solid ss particles are one of the main forms of pollutants in industrial wastewater characterized by difficult sedimentation and degradation they are not only pollutants themselves but also provide carriers for other contaminants such as heavy metal ions and pathogenic microorganisms 2 the removal of ss particles is thus a crucial component of industrial wastewater treatment 3 the choice of treatment method is

percolation theory 48 was used to optimize the equivalent state of the cumulative layer and Î± u was assumed to be equal to 0 6884 at the same time the application range of the model was extended to the bed filtration of wastewater containing deformable ss particles the dynamic change diagram of the bed medium particles is shown in fig 2 which shows the equivalent spheres of the medium particles as a function of the mass m s the bed porosity Îµ c t has the relationship of 1 Îµ c t 1 Îµ c 0 d c t 3 d c 0 3 with the particle diameter d c t thus it can be expressed by the following equation 12

particles which was one specification of quartz sand ss particles were simulated using fly ash passed through a mesh 3000 sieve the parameters of the materials used are listed in table 1 where a larger number of experimental groups were conducted using quartz sand of 1 0 2 0 mm multiple parameter measurements were made and the model equation was calculated by substituting the mean value pressure gauges were set in the filter and at the bed outlet to obtain the pressure values at different depths of the bed in real time and flowmeters were deployed in the pipeline to monitor the flow the control variables in the experiment were total bed filling depth and flow rate the ss content in the inlet and outlet water and the value of each pressure indication were monitored regularly the measured data were then processed to obtain the changes in filtration efficiency and bed pressure drop with time and with the accumulated mass of filtered ss particles 2 experimental program the selection of the depths of the bed medium was based on the theoretical analysis and observations of preliminary experiments which showed that the content of ss particles within a certain depth from the top surface of the bed was the largest after the filter cake formation on the surface of the bed medium particle samples were acquired in an experiment with quartz sand from the surface of the bed depth 0 cm depth of 10 cm and depth of 20 cm at the end of the deep stage of the filtration process sample images from a scanning electron microscope sem are shown in fig 4 based on the above discussion a 5 cm total depth was selected for the first bed filtration experiment and additional total depths of 15 cm and 25 cm were used following lessons from the initial trial in the subsequent experiments for the different bed depths the flow rates were controlled in the range of 4 16 l min and the corresponding bed apparent velocities were 3 14 m h the simulated wastewater was prepared using fly ash see table 1 in which the target mass concentration of ss particles was 500 mg l the simulated wastewater and outlet water from the multiple experiments were interrogated by the gravimetric method and substituted into the mathematical model the sampling interval was 5 min during the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of viscosity and inertial resistance coefficients the viscosity and inertia resistance coefficients a and b in eq 2 were determined from the bed pressure drop measurements four flow values in the range of 4 16 l min were selected to axially flow through the beds of the depth of 5 cm the changes in the pressure drop with flow rate are shown in fig 5 the measured data were fit with a quadratic function and the viscosity and inertia resistance coefficients a and b were obtained by dividing the linear and quadratic term coefficients by Î¼ 1 Îµ c t 2 Îµ c t 3 d c t 2 and Ï l 1 Îµ c t Îµ c t 3 d c t in eq 2 respectively the resistance coefficients of the medium bed were determined as a 173 and b 1 66 for the 1 0 2 0 mm quartz sand 3 2 bed filtration performance and pressure drops under different flow rates after the correction of the bed resistance coefficients and the optimization of the dynamic parameters the filtration experiments for the 5 cm deep bed at 8 12 and 16 l min flow rates were carried out the change in filtration efficiency with time and the accumulated ss particle mass are in fig 6 a and b respectively the initial efficiency was slightly higher when the flow rate was small a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the large fluid traction provided by the high flow rate reduces the chance of ss particles accumulating on the bed particles at the initial filtration moment 49 and the efficiencies improved faster when the flow rate was high in fig 6 b the change in filtration efficiency with the accumulated ss particle mass under the three flow rates tended to be consistent it is thus demonstrated that the changes in filtration efficiency are highly correlated with the mass of ss particles accumulated in the bed under different flow rates at the same depth bed and the flow rate is the factor that determines the accumulation rate of ss particle mass the pressure drops in the bed were recorded at the same time as the filtration efficiencies the measured pressure drops with time and accumulated ss particle mass are shown in fig 6 c and d respectively additionally in fig 6 d the measured pressure drops were compared to the model predictions which included both the optimized model and the original model of the ergun equation the rising trend of bed pressure drop accelerated suddenly till the surface filtration stage commenced it was driven up by the surface filter cake which corresponded to the reduction in flow flux and the increase in resistance of the cake 50 the pressure drop model predictions of the accumulated ss particle mass all had a transition point at 5381 g m2 for beds of 5 cm depth which was defined as the boundary between the deep and surface stages on the other hand the experimental data indicated different transition points for each of the three flow rates the differences between them and the model values were larger for larger flow rates which are approximately700 g m2 1000 g m2 and 1200 g m2 respectively for 8 12 and 16 l min thus the model errors of the transition points values were close to 20 at the maximum flow rate a plausible explanation for the errors can be that multiple ss particles formed bridges across the gap between bed particles bridging phenomenon 51 52 which limited the migration and reduced the flux of ss particles in the cross section of the bed for the comparison of model and experimental values of pressure drop the deep stage pressure drop errors were within 5 analyzing these errors from the model perspective the main reason was that changes in the values of a and b in the late deep stage were no longer negligible another important factor was that the calculated bed was a collection of multiple ubes and neglecting the small differences between ubes would cause a loss of accuracy too for industrial applications the level of error of the optimized model is acceptable and also of importance to advise bed filtration cycle in contrast the errors of the original model surpassed 20 in the late deep stage 3 3 filtration performance and pressure drops at different bed depths additional bed filtration experiments were carried out for the total bed depths of 5 15 and 25 cm at a flow rate of 12 l min the filtration efficiency changed with time and accumulated ss particle mass as shown in fig 7 a and b the initial filtration efficiencies increased with the increase in total bed depth essentially because the deeper the bed the longer the transmission time for the ss particles contacting the bed particles 53 the changes in filtration efficiency with accumulated ss particle mass showed a similar trend but the ss particle mass corresponding to the pressure drop at the same moment in different beds grew with the increasing bed depth which was caused by the increasing transmission time of ss particles resulting in their more accumulation in the bed this suggests that the model case may be correct in that the transition point between the two filtration stages at a given flow rate is not related to the bed depth the variations in the pressure drop with time and accumulated ss particle mass are shown in fig 7 c and d the initial pressure drops were approximately proportional to the bed depth and the trends of pressure drop with time were consistent the experimental curves of pressure drop with accumulated ss particle mass had their transition points that were less than 18 earlier than the corresponding model predictions which was similar to the situation discussed in section 3 2 the deeper the bed the larger the accumulated ss particle mass corresponding to the transition point under the adopted flow rate of 12 l min the theoretical transition points of the beds with depths of 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm were 5381 g m2 6177 g m2 and 6479 g m2 respectively i e the differences between two consecutive values were 769 g m2 and 302 g m2 the differences calculated according to the transition points of the curves fitted to the experimental data were about 750 g m2 and 290 g m2 i e the errors were less than 3 0 and 5 0 respectively it implies that the model s prediction errors for transition points are systematic in theory the downstream bed filters the effluent of the upstream bed without affecting the mass accumulation in the upstream bed 54 in other words this part of the difference corresponds to the mass distribution of ss particles in the bed taking the bed of the depth of 25 cm at the end of the deep filtration stage as an example the relative masses of accumulated ss particles in 0 5 cm 5 15 cm and 15 25 cm depth layer were about 80 4 14 1 and 5 5 respectively and the mass percentage in the 0 5 cm and 5 15 cm depth layers of the 15 cm depth bed were 85 1 and 14 9 this results from the superficial layer at small depths filtering the maximum concentration of simulated wastewater first resulting in the fastest accumulation of mass 55 56 and the fastest reduction in porosity 57 58 3 4 pressure drops over different bed depths as described in section 3 3 the distribution of accumulated ss particles at different depths of the bed differed resulting in differences in pressure drop distributions several cases located at different depths of the same bed were investigated and are shown in fig 8 the pressures at different depths of the 25 cm depth bed at a flow rate of 12 l min during the filtrations process were monitored and the pressure drops between the monitored points were calculated the pressure drops over bed depths 0 5 cm i 5 15 cm ii and 15 25 cm iii are shown in fig 8 c and d and compared with the corresponding model predictions in case i the actual pressure drops were consistent with the model values of the 5 cm depth bed in cases ii and iii the pressure drops increased with a slowly diminishing growth rate before stabilization the pressure drop model values in cases ii and iii were calculated based on the ube division and the errors between the model and mean of experimental values were found to be less than 1 the same analysis was carried out for the 15 cm depth bed shown in fig 8 a and b which exhibited similar results at the end of the deep filtration stage of the 15 and 25 cm depth beds the pressure drop within the top 5 cm bed layer accounted for about 52 and 36 of the total values respectively both the experiment and the model pointed out that after the filtration began the bed top layer was carrying the fastest rate of increase in pressure drop relative to the other depths and the largest pressure drop gradually shifted to that layer this corresponded to the unevenness in distribution and trend of ss particles within the bed 55 56 3 5 performance of the model in long term operation the above experiments proved that the pressure drop model has good accuracy in the deep stage of bed filtration but the duration failed to meet the demand of long term operation so the experimental duration was extended and the filtration performance and pressure drop were monitored for a 25 cm depth bed at a flow rate of 12 l min and the monitored data are shown in fig 9 the trends of filtration efficiency and pressure drop in the early and mid term were consistent with the previous experiments but the efficiency decreased rapidly in the late term while the pressure drop increased at a slower rate which was related to the decrease in the accumulation rate of ss particles in the evolution of the pressure drop with the accumulated ss particle mass pressure drop model values maintained high fit with the experimental data which was also in line with the variation over a short period of time after the surface stage started but then there were one or more significant decreases in pressure drop and maintained a large fluctuation this may be derived from partial collapse of the filter cake 59 60 where the bridge formed between the bed particles was disrupted when the pressure drop rose 61 and the filter cake formed above it thus lost its support and increased flux 62 the ss particles provided less pressure drop within the bed than the filter cake which resulted in a lower overall rate of pressure drop rise applying the model to the bed without ube division the point a corresponding to the highest ss particle mass and pressure drop within the bed is obtained and its connection with the point b at the beginning of the surface stage can be considered as the trend line of pressure drop without filter cake 0 g m2 and the isomass reference lines of filter cake mass can be obtained combined with the location of the data area when it reached the predicted maximum pressure drop it can be seen that the mass of the retained filter cake is about 2000 3500 g m2 and the less the retained mass the later the pressure drop reaching maximum it states that the reduction of filter cake formation is beneficial for long term operation 4 conclusions in this study based on the optimization of the parameters of the ergun equation the pressure drop prediction model for the bed filtration process was established and bed filtration experiments were carried out to verify the accuracy of the optimized model and the pressure drop distribution of the bed filtration process was investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the pressure drop prediction model based on the ergun equation with parameters optimized mainly for the bed particles diameter has prediction errors of less than 5 for the deep filtration 2 the deep filtration of different depth beds completed at similar times but corresponded to different ss particle masses between which the differences represented its distribution within the bed and mainly concentrated in the surface layer 3 the distribution of pressure drop over different layer in the same bed was associated with that of ss particles and the pressure drop over the surface layer rising fastest and maintaining highest 4 the variation of pressure drop after deep filtration stage can be explained with the optimized model combined with filter cake formation and collapse the less the filter cake formed the longer the filtration time although the model cannot yet explain unexpected mechanisms such as particle bridging and avoid the errors they bring its prediction accuracy meets the needs of practical applications and can provide good theoretical guidance for the design and evaluation of bed filtration and its

12489,representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs compounds such as phenanthrene phe derived from multiple anthropogenic activities are contributing to a growing number of concerns about its threats to the global water environment and human health microbial degradation is considered to be an increasingly promising approach for phe removal while effective phe biodegraders from in situ environments are yet to be identified and their underlying degradation mechanisms still remain to be understood herein a klebsiella sp strain ds 1 was isolated from petrochemical wastewater using phe as the sole carbon source the degradation efficiency of phe was up to 88 4 at 30 c and ph 7 within a maximum of 9 days ds 1 grew actively in wide ranges of environmental factors such as ph values 5 9 temperature 20 c 37 c and initial concentrations of phe 20 200 mg l with the maintenance of phe degradability genome analysis revealed 14 genes that were involved in phe biodegradation by ds 1 detection of metabolic intermediates revealed that strain ds 1 degraded phe via the phthalic acid pathway these findings have expanded the knowledge of klebsiella sp as an active phe degrader in wastewater and indicate its potential in the bioremediation of phe contaminated aquatic environments keywords phenanthrene genomic analyses biodegradation phthalic acid pathway klebsiella sp data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since 1970s polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contamination has aroused global concern due to its environmental ubiquitousness as well as health hazards 1 phenanthrene phe is an angular ring pah and has been included as one of the priority pah pollutants by many countries such as china the us and the eu as it has become one of the most abundant pahs in the aquatic environment 2 phe contamination mainly originates from the refinery incomplete combustion and spill of fossil fuel resulting in its continuous release into atmospheric environment and subsequent transfer to soil and water through atmospheric deposition runoff and waste discharges 3 reports from asian and african rivers revealed a wide distribution of phe with the concentration ranging from 0 053 to 3 153 Î¼g l in surface water and 63 98 to 382 16 Î¼g kg in sediments 4 5 in addition unexpectedly high levels of phe ranging from 14 6 to 1460 Î¼g l have been documented in the marine environment causing serious toxic effects on the growth and reproduction of fish 6 7 phe can be accumulated in crops such as wheat soybean and maize leaves and finally exposed to mammals through food chain transfer 8 additionally occupational human exposure to phe through inhalation intestinal absorption and dermal contact can lead to adverse effects such as skin irritation headaches and reduced immunity 9 in addition phe contains specific electronic structures such as k region and bay region and they have been associated with carcinogenic potencies due to their conversion to diol epoxides which not only irreversibly bound to proteins and dna cause mutations but also disrupted normal cellular processes 10 literatures have been reported the possible relationship between phe exposure and higher cancer risks such as lung and breast cancer 11 12 for phe removal from contaminated sites bioremediation is considered to be a cost effective and environmentally friendly strategy 13 14 aerobic bacteria occupy the highest percentage of candidates for phe degradation such as streptomyces sp 15 kocuria rosea sp 16 pseudomonas sp 17 19 and sphingomonas sp 20 these bacteria utilize the phthalic acid and salicylic acid pathways for the degradation of phe initially both pathways yield the same degradation products which are further processed by dioxygenase through an oxidation reaction resulting in the production of cis 3 4 dihydrodihydroxyphenanthrene this compound is subsequently converted into 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid the two pathways differ in their conversion of cis 3 4 dihydrodihydroxyphenanthrene to 2 hydroxymucofuranoic acid semialdehyde and protocatechuic acid respectively which are then incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle 21 until now extensive research has been conducted to uncover the genetic mechanisms involved in phe biodegradation leading to the identification of multiple phe metabolic genes such as nah pah dox phn phd nid etc 22 24 however it is still needed to identify more indigenous microorganisms that are responsible for efficient phe degradation and their degradation mechanisms should be further explained in this work a phe degrading strain named ds 1 belonging to klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the petrochemical wastewater this is the first report to claim a wastewater derived klebsiella pneumoniae sp that degraded phe furthermore optimal conditions of phe degradation by ds 1 as well as the corresponding genetic and metabolic mechanisms were subsequentially investigated the results of this study may expand our knowledge of in situ phe degraders and provide alternatives for effective biological treatment of phe contaminated wastewater 2

wastewater with phe as the sole carbon source ds 1 cells were rod shaped with lengths of approximately 0 8 1 2 Î¼m fig 1a ds 1 was a gram negative bacterium without flagella and spores fig 1b and the colonies grown on the agar plate was ivory neat edge and opaque spheroid fig 1c a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree based on 16s rdna sequences was constructed and ds 1 exhibited the maximum sequence identity 99 with the klebsiella pneumoniae strain dsm30104 fig 2 according to the previous studies phe degraders such as sphingomona mycobacterium janibacter anophelis and shinella sp were successfully isolated from soil 33 sediment 34 and wastewater 35 although known for causing development of lung and liver abscess 36 klebsiella pneumonia have been considered as a promising member for recalcitrant organic compounds including pahs for example klebsiella pneumonia isolated from soil have been reported to have the ability for degradation of pyrene and benzo a pyrene 37 another klebsiella pneumonia strain isolated from textile waste was capable of degrading reactive dyes resulting in the decolorization of the textile effluent 38 moreover klebsiella pneumoniae played significant roles in biodegradation of fluoroquinolones 39 zearalenone 40 and tylenol 41 to our best knowledge this study provides the first evidence that wastewater derived klebsiella pneumoniae participated in efficient degradation of phe 3 2 bacterial growth and phe degradation by the ds 1 strain the time dependent strain growth and residual content of phe in strain ds 1 were observed in fig 3 it was shaken at 150 rpm and 30 c with an initial concentration of 100 mg l over a period of 10 days the ds 1 strain was able to degrade approximately 80 mg l of phe the degradation rate gradually increased from 0 days to 2 days with the adaptation of the ds 1 because the strain was in the growth adaptation stage during this period the colour of the liquid culture gradually changed from clear to yellow the highest degradation rate was detected during the period from day 3 to day 5 which agreed with the ongoing logarithmic growth of ds 1 the degradation subsequently slowed down from day 5 until the end of the experiment fig 3 microbial degradation of pahs including phe has been extensively studied with previous reports showing the results for instance klebsiella sp pd3 strain isolated from soil degraded 78 2 of phe over 12 days 42 while streptomyces sp achieved an 80 degradation efficiency within 15 days 43 even anaerobic microorganisms can contribute to the degradation of phe with sulfate reducing bacteria degrading 60 7 of phe in 21 days 44 however the degradation efficiency of strain ds 1 was 80 over a period of 10 days it exhibited even greater efficiency and rate in degradation suggesting its potential for biodegradation in various applications 3 3 effect of environmental factors on the degradation capability of phe to investigate the impact of the ds 1 strain on the degradation of phe under varying environmental conditions a series of degradation tests were conducted the tests were performed at different ph ranging from 5 to 9 temperatures ranging from 20 c to 37 c and initial concentrations of phe ranging from 20 to 200 mg l the biodegradation of phe was influenced by temperature which impacted both the growth of the strain and the activity of enzymes involved in its metabolism according to fig 4a 30 c was the best temperature for phe degradation by ds 1 with a degradation efficiency of 80 4 this was consistent with the previous studies on pyrene biodegradation by klebsiella pneumoniae pl1 37 for cultures at 20 c residual amounts of phe were the most culturing the degradation efficiency was 21 9 as lower temperature inhibited activities of the phe degrading enzymes such as dioxygenase and dehydrogenase these enzymes have optimum activity at mesophilic temperatures 20 40 c and it decreases with very high or low temperatures 45 in this study the highest degradation efficiency of phe was observed at 30 c in the range of 20 37 c fig 4b exhibited the variation of phe degradation by ds 1 with different ph from 5 to 9 at ph 7 strain ds 1 had the best degradation efficiency at ph 6 8 and 9 it degraded phe comparably with minimal difference which proved its adaptive capacity to neutral and slightly alkaline conditions fig 4c showed the influence of the initial concentration shift on the degradation ability strain ds 1 was added to the msm with an initial concentration of 20 mg l and 2 3 mg l phe remained after 9 days with the highest degradation efficiency of 88 4 at an initial concentration of 200 mg l the degradation efficiency was 25 8 this finding might be attributed to the strong toxic action of excessive concentrations of phe on strain ds 1 in summary temperature ph and phe concentration are the key factors affecting the efficiency of ds 1 in the degradation of phe and the optimal growth conditions for ds 1 are 30 c and ph 7 previous study indicated that the maximum degradation efficiency of pseudomonas sp stutzeri bacillus pumilus or bacillus simplex for phe were below 80 after 15 days at 30 c and ph 7 under optimal conditions 46 strain ds 1 exhibited greater efficiency in degradation compared to them the optimum growth conditions for diaphorobacter sp msn 0 and ym 6 were the same as for strain ds 1 at 30 c and ph 7 34 47 however the degradation efficiency of strain msn 0 was approximately 50 at ph 9 and that of strain ym 6 was 13 2 at ph 6 the degradation efficiency of strain ds 1 exceeded 60 at both ph 6 and 9 this indicates that strain ds 1 is more adaptable to the environment in addition to temperature ph and initial concentration additional carbon sources may affect the degradation of phe some studies suggested that supplementing additional carbon sources such as glucose and fructose could promote bacterial growth and enhance the degradation efficiency of phe 48 however the study on ym 6 showed that salicylic acid and 2 hydroxynaphthalene inhibited the biodegradation of phe 34 further experiments are needed to explore the effects of additional carbon sources which will contribute to the success of strain ds 1 in the remediation of phe contaminated sites 3 4 genomic analysis the whole genome of strain ds 1 is composed of one chromosome and four plasmids the ring mounted chromosome comprises 5 276 398 bp with a gc content of 57 53 and a coding rate of 86 46 fig 5 table 1 shows the chromosome and plasmid data of the strain a total of 4910 protein coding sequences and 9 5s rrna 9 16s rrna 8 23s rrna 86 trna genes and 124 ncrna were predicted plasmid 1 contains 205 146 bases with 45 21 gc content and 82 46 coding

contains 85 539 bases with 52 31 gc content and 81 35 coding ratio with 105 predicted protein coding sequences plasmid 4 presents a shorter sequence than the others and predicts three coding sequences the total 4603 genes were annotated in the ds 1 strain in accordance with the clusters of orthologous genes cog functional classification table 2 a total of 45 6 functional genes was detected ds 1 strains are involved in a large number of biological processes and exhibit strong metabolic and coding activities 3 5 determination of intermediates and the phe degrading pathway putative intermediates in the degradation of ds 1 were detected by triple quadrupole lc ms as shown in table 3 we detected 1 hydroxy 2 naphthaldehyde 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid phthalic acid protocatechuic acid and 2 carboxybenzaldehyde these metabolites appeared in the phthalic acid pathway in the degradation which again confirmed the involvement of pathway in the degradation of phe by klebsiella pneumoniae strain alignment of predicted genes against the kegg gene database was completed using the blast algorithm the genomic information of strain ds 1 was annotated for 1985 metabolic pathways and potential genes were identified on the chromosome encoding the phe degradation of dioxygenases and dehydrogenases table 4 these genes demonstrated that the degradation pathway was the protocatechuic acid pathway rather than the salicylic acid pathway based on the intermediate metabolites detected and the identification of all potential degradation genes the pathway of phe degradation by klebsiella pneumoniae was inferred fig 6 the extrapolation of the phthalic acid pathway was performed in a previous study the initial oxidation step is their conversion to the intermediate product the intermediate product was sequentially converted to 3 4 hydroxyphenanthrene 1 hydroxy 2 naphthalenecarboxaldehyde and 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid by the action of related enzymes the detection of degradation intermediates and annotation of degradation genes demonstrated that it carries out the degradation of phe by the protocatechuic acid pathway 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid was converted to 2 carboxybenzaldehyde by the action of 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid dioxygenase and 4 2 carboxyphenyl 2 oxobut 3 enoic acid aldolase phthalic acid was catalysed by 2 formylbenzoic acid dehydrogenase after a series of reactions phthalic acid was converted to protocatechuic acid which was then converted to 3 carboxy cis muconic acidy by the action of protocatechuic acid 3 4 dioxygenase enzymes encoded by pcag and pach and proceeded to pathway of degrading benzoic acid cleavage of benzoate occurred after conversion to catechol and subsequently completion of the conversion in the tca cycle aerobic bacteria are the main degraders of phe in natural environment and the majority of degraders are through phthalic acid metabolic pathway for instance pseudomonas sp lphe 2 which was isolated from aerobic sludge in a coking plant exhibited similar metabolic intermediates and degradation genes as observed in the degradation of phe through this pathway 49 similarly strain msn 0 also degraded phe via the phthalic acid pathway although the enzymes involved in the reaction were different 47 the degradation genes involved in the reaction of strain msn 0 was identified as acidovorax sp na3 and alcaligenes faecalis 50 they accomplish the degradation of functional genes such as phnc phnd etc but these genes were not found in the strain ds 1 this indicates that different degradation strains may produce the same degradation intermediates with the action of enzymes encoded by different genes while intermediates such as phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid were detected the degradation genes responsible for their generation were not identified further research is necessary to investigate and elucidate the genes involved in the degradation of phe 4 conclusion the phe degrading ds 1 strain enriched from wastewater was identified as klebsiella pneumonia by 16s rdna sequencing and the ds 1 strain also proliferated and exhibited phe degradation under different conditions such as ph values temperatures and initial concentrations of phe five intermediates were identified during the degradation including phthalic acid protocatechuic acid catechol 1 hydroxy 2 naphthaldehyde and 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid based on the annotated degradation genes in the genome it appeared that the strain ds 1 degraded phe through the phthalic acid pathway however further studies are needed to explore the enzymes involved and intermediate products for a more accurate understanding of the pathway the strain ds 1 is considered as a potential candidate for promoting phe degradation in water treatment processes in the future the application of ds 1 in the bioremediation of pahs contaminated water environments can be further developed declaration of competing interest

12489,representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs compounds such as phenanthrene phe derived from multiple anthropogenic activities are contributing to a growing number of concerns about its threats to the global water environment and human health microbial degradation is considered to be an increasingly promising approach for phe removal while effective phe biodegraders from in situ environments are yet to be identified and their underlying degradation mechanisms still remain to be understood herein a klebsiella sp strain ds 1 was isolated from petrochemical wastewater using phe as the sole carbon source the degradation efficiency of phe was up to 88 4 at 30 c and ph 7 within a maximum of 9 days ds 1 grew actively in wide ranges of environmental factors such as ph values 5 9 temperature 20 c 37 c and initial concentrations of phe 20 200 mg l with the maintenance of phe degradability genome analysis revealed 14 genes that were involved in phe biodegradation by ds 1 detection of metabolic intermediates revealed that strain ds 1 degraded phe via the phthalic acid pathway these findings have expanded the knowledge of klebsiella sp as an active phe degrader in wastewater and indicate its potential in the bioremediation of phe contaminated aquatic environments keywords phenanthrene genomic analyses biodegradation phthalic acid pathway klebsiella sp data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since 1970s polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contamination has aroused global concern due to its environmental ubiquitousness as well as health hazards 1 phenanthrene phe is an angular ring pah and has been included as one of the priority pah pollutants by many countries such as china the us and the eu as it has become one of the most abundant pahs in the aquatic environment 2 phe contamination mainly originates from the refinery incomplete combustion and spill of fossil fuel resulting in its continuous release into atmospheric environment and subsequent transfer to soil and water through atmospheric deposition runoff and waste discharges 3 reports from asian and african rivers revealed a wide distribution of phe with the concentration ranging from 0 053 to 3 153 Î¼g l in surface water and 63 98 to 382 16 Î¼g kg in sediments 4 5 in addition unexpectedly high levels of phe ranging from 14 6 to 1460 Î¼g l have been documented in the marine environment causing serious toxic effects on the growth and reproduction of fish 6 7 phe can be accumulated in crops such as wheat soybean and maize leaves and finally exposed to mammals through food chain transfer 8 additionally occupational human exposure to phe through inhalation intestinal absorption and dermal contact can lead to adverse effects such as skin irritation headaches and reduced immunity 9 in addition phe contains specific electronic structures such as k region and bay region and they have been associated with carcinogenic potencies due to their conversion to diol epoxides which not only irreversibly bound to proteins and dna cause mutations but also disrupted normal cellular processes 10 literatures have been reported the possible relationship between phe exposure and higher cancer risks such as lung and breast cancer 11 12 for phe removal from contaminated sites bioremediation is considered to be a cost effective and environmentally friendly strategy 13 14 aerobic bacteria occupy the highest percentage of candidates for phe degradation such as streptomyces sp 15 kocuria rosea sp 16 pseudomonas sp 17 19 and sphingomonas sp 20 these bacteria utilize the phthalic acid and salicylic acid pathways for the degradation of phe initially both pathways yield the same degradation products which are further processed by dioxygenase through an oxidation reaction resulting in the production of cis 3 4 dihydrodihydroxyphenanthrene this compound is subsequently converted into 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid the two pathways differ in their conversion of cis 3 4 dihydrodihydroxyphenanthrene to 2 hydroxymucofuranoic acid semialdehyde and protocatechuic acid respectively which are then incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle 21 until now extensive research has been conducted to uncover the genetic mechanisms involved in phe biodegradation leading to the identification of multiple phe metabolic genes such as nah pah dox phn phd nid etc 22 24 however it is still needed to identify more indigenous microorganisms that are responsible for efficient phe degradation and their degradation mechanisms should be further explained in this work a phe degrading strain named ds 1 belonging to klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the petrochemical wastewater this is the first report to claim a wastewater derived klebsiella pneumoniae sp that degraded phe furthermore optimal conditions of phe degradation by ds 1 as well as the corresponding genetic and metabolic mechanisms were subsequentially investigated the results of this study may expand our knowledge of in situ phe degraders and provide alternatives for effective biological treatment of phe contaminated wastewater 2

four enrichments the diluted cultures were spread on msm plates for screening and isolation of bacterium a single colony was isolated and streaked on an msm plate containing phe 25 after multiple

wastewater with phe as the sole carbon source ds 1 cells were rod shaped with lengths of approximately 0 8 1 2 Î¼m fig 1a ds 1 was a gram negative bacterium without flagella and spores fig 1b and the colonies grown on the agar plate was ivory neat edge and opaque spheroid fig 1c a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree based on 16s rdna sequences was constructed and ds 1 exhibited the maximum sequence identity 99 with the klebsiella pneumoniae strain dsm30104 fig 2 according to the previous studies phe degraders such as sphingomona mycobacterium janibacter anophelis and shinella sp were successfully isolated from soil 33 sediment 34 and wastewater 35 although known for causing development of lung and liver abscess 36 klebsiella pneumonia have been considered as a promising member for recalcitrant organic compounds including pahs for example klebsiella pneumonia isolated from soil have been reported to have the ability for degradation of pyrene and benzo a pyrene 37 another klebsiella pneumonia strain isolated from textile waste was capable of degrading reactive dyes resulting in the decolorization of the textile effluent 38 moreover klebsiella pneumoniae played significant roles in biodegradation of fluoroquinolones 39 zearalenone 40 and tylenol 41 to our best knowledge this study provides the first evidence that wastewater derived klebsiella pneumoniae participated in efficient degradation of phe 3 2 bacterial growth and phe degradation by the ds 1 strain the time dependent strain growth and residual content of phe in strain ds 1 were observed in fig 3 it was shaken at 150 rpm and 30 c with an initial concentration of 100 mg l over a period of 10 days the ds 1 strain was able to degrade approximately 80 mg l of phe the degradation rate gradually increased from 0 days to 2 days with the adaptation of the ds 1 because the strain was in the growth adaptation stage during this period the colour of the liquid culture gradually changed from clear to yellow the highest degradation rate was detected during the period from day 3 to day 5 which agreed with the ongoing logarithmic growth of ds 1 the degradation subsequently slowed down from day 5 until the end of the experiment fig 3 microbial degradation of pahs including phe has been extensively studied with previous reports showing the results for instance klebsiella sp pd3 strain isolated from soil degraded 78 2 of phe over 12 days 42 while streptomyces sp achieved an 80 degradation efficiency within 15 days 43 even anaerobic microorganisms can contribute to the degradation of phe with sulfate reducing bacteria degrading 60 7 of phe in 21 days 44 however the degradation efficiency of strain ds 1 was 80 over a period of 10 days it exhibited even greater efficiency and rate in degradation suggesting its potential for biodegradation in various applications 3 3 effect of environmental factors on the degradation capability of phe to investigate the impact of the ds 1 strain on the degradation of phe under varying environmental conditions a series of degradation tests were conducted the tests were performed at different ph ranging from 5 to 9 temperatures ranging from 20 c to 37 c and initial concentrations of phe ranging from 20 to 200 mg l the biodegradation of phe was influenced by temperature which impacted both the growth of the strain and the activity of enzymes involved in its metabolism according to fig 4a 30 c was the best temperature for phe degradation by ds 1 with a degradation efficiency of 80 4 this was consistent with the previous studies on pyrene biodegradation by klebsiella pneumoniae pl1 37 for cultures at 20 c residual amounts of phe were the most culturing the degradation efficiency was 21 9 as lower temperature inhibited activities of the phe degrading enzymes such as dioxygenase and dehydrogenase these enzymes have optimum activity at mesophilic temperatures 20 40 c and it decreases with very high or low temperatures 45 in this study the highest degradation efficiency of phe was observed at 30 c in the range of 20 37 c fig 4b exhibited the variation of phe degradation by ds 1 with different ph from 5 to 9 at ph 7 strain ds 1 had the best degradation efficiency at ph 6 8 and 9 it degraded phe comparably with minimal difference which proved its adaptive capacity to neutral and slightly alkaline conditions fig 4c showed the influence of the initial concentration shift on the degradation ability strain ds 1 was added to the msm with an initial concentration of 20 mg l and 2 3 mg l phe remained after 9 days with the highest degradation efficiency of 88 4 at an initial concentration of 200 mg l the degradation efficiency was 25 8 this finding might be attributed to the strong toxic action of excessive concentrations of phe on strain ds 1 in summary temperature ph and phe concentration are the key factors affecting the efficiency of ds 1 in the degradation of phe and the optimal growth conditions for ds 1 are 30 c and ph 7 previous study indicated that the maximum degradation efficiency of pseudomonas sp stutzeri bacillus pumilus or bacillus simplex for phe were below 80 after 15 days at 30 c and ph 7 under optimal conditions 46 strain ds 1 exhibited greater efficiency in degradation compared to them the optimum growth conditions for diaphorobacter sp msn 0 and ym 6 were the same as for strain ds 1 at 30 c and ph 7 34 47 however the degradation efficiency of strain msn 0 was approximately 50 at ph 9 and that of strain ym 6 was 13 2 at ph 6 the degradation efficiency of strain ds 1 exceeded 60 at both ph 6 and 9 this indicates that strain ds 1 is more adaptable to the environment in addition to temperature ph and initial concentration additional carbon sources may affect the degradation of phe some studies suggested that supplementing additional carbon sources such as glucose and fructose could promote bacterial growth and enhance the degradation efficiency of phe 48 however the study on ym 6 showed that salicylic acid and 2 hydroxynaphthalene inhibited the biodegradation of phe 34 further experiments are needed to explore the effects of additional carbon sources which will contribute to the success of strain ds 1 in the remediation of phe contaminated sites 3 4 genomic analysis the whole genome of strain ds 1 is composed of one chromosome and four plasmids the ring mounted chromosome comprises 5 276 398 bp with a gc content of 57 53 and a coding rate of 86 46 fig 5 table 1 shows the chromosome and plasmid data of the

contains 85 539 bases with 52 31 gc content and 81 35 coding ratio with 105 predicted protein coding sequences plasmid 4 presents a shorter sequence than the others and predicts three coding sequences
