14975,microfiltration mf membranes with a mean pore size same as or smaller than 0 45 µm have been typically used to separate pathogenic protozoa in water since materials larger than 0 45 µm are considered particulates however 0 45 µm is too small to separate protozoa which are 4 6 µm cryptosporidium oocyst or 8 15 µm giardia cyst in size in this study we optimized the mean pore size of mf membranes to maximize the producibility and guarantee a high removal rate simultaneously and proposed the membrane filtration using an mf membrane with an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to dissolved organic matter dom which is called near dom mf ndom mf according to the mf test using polystyrene surrogate beads with diameters of 3 and 8 µm an mf membrane with a 0 8 µm mean pore size was the best in that it showed 52 to 146 higher water fluxes than a 0 45 µm mf membrane while maintaining the removal rate at 3 4 log it was also the case for a low temperature mf test revealing the ndom mf is highly effective regardless of temperature changes lastly we tried to find the possibility of combining the ndom mf with disinfection by an ultraviolet light emitting diode uvc led to further guarantee the high quality of treated water while providing high process efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords giardia cyst cryptosporidium oocyst microfiltration uv disinfection water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water treatment technologies have come a long way by driving technological innovation in various aspects encompassing developing high performance membranes lee et al 2022 2021a lim et al 2021 advanced biological wastewater treatment anburajan et al 2021 corpuz et al 2021 decentralized wastewater treatment hube and wu 2021 lee et al 2021b udomkittayachai et al 2021 efficient desalination processes chong and krantz 2018 krantz and chong 2021 disinfection rouge et al 2022 yoon et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes kim et al 2021 son et al 2021 vigneshwaran et al 2021 adsorption based water treatment karthikeyan et al 2021 njaramba et al 2022 and electrochemical water treatment ahn et al 2021 over the decades thanks to the remarkable advances in water treatment technologies clean water supply has significantly improved in quantity and quality however drinking water supply and water safety are still being menaced by severe droughts and floods caused by unprecedented climate change for example variable rainfall patterns arising from climate change can exacerbate the water security associated with a resilient water supply which is evidenced by the case where cryptosporidium was more likely to be found with heavy rainfall nijhawan and howard 2021 as such climate change is threatening drinking water hygiene such that more than 2 billion people worldwide still suffer from various waterborne diseases pichel et al 2019 tao and xin 2014 among pathogens causing waterborne diseases giardia and cryptosporidium are considered the most prevalent pathogens silva and sabogal paz 2021 their cysts giardia and oocysts cryptosporidium are known to be infective and if infected they can cause abdominal pain diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients baldursson and karanis 2011 certad et al 2017 efstratiou et al 2017 guzman herrador et al 2015 hemphill et al 2019 moreira and bondelind 2017 njaramba et al 2022 savioli et al 2006 accordingly it is necessary to thoroughly remove or inactivate the cysts oocysts to guarantee drinking water hygiene for that reason 99 2 log and 99 9 3 log removal or inactivation are recommended for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively as minimum criteria for water treatment in accordance with the enforcement decree of the water supply and waterworks installation act in korea unfortunately however it is very hard to control the cysts oocysts using chlorine which is one of the most widely used disinfectants he et al 2022 due to their resistance to chlorine disinfection nasser 2016 sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2022 specifically the cysts oocysts require thousands giardia to hundreds of thousands cryptosporidium times higher ct values chlorine concentration multiplied by time for chlorine inactivation as compared to e coli hoff and rubin 1987 joret et al 1989 korich 1993 considering that too much chlorine consumption to inactivate the cysts oocysts can result in a large increase in the economic burden and the risk factors related to taste and odor problems and disinfectant by products dbps cai et al 2019 tsitsifli and kanakoudis 2018 chlorine inactivation is inappropriate as a control strategy of the cysts oocysts as an alternative to chlorine disinfection membrane separation processes can be considered a desirable option to remove the cysts oocysts in that they basically correspond to particulates which can be physically separated based on size exclusion among several membrane separation processes ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have been widely used to remove cysts oocysts from an aqueous solution since they have small pores 0 01 0 5 μm enough to remove protozoan cysts 4 15 μm omarova et al 2018 when it comes to cyst and oocyst removal using uf it was more effective in removing the cysts oocysts than conventional sand filtration and flocculation sedimentation lyu et al 2022 meanwhile when mf is used to control the cysts oocysts mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm have been utilized to make sure cyst and oocyst removal because particulates are defined as matters larger than 0 45 μm while dissolved organic matters doms are considered smaller than 0 45 μm xu and guo 2018 however one needs to note that uf or mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm are too dense to efficiently separate the cysts oocysts with high productivity upon consideration that giardia cysts 8 μm 12 μm and cryptosporidium oocysts 4 5 μm 5 μm are much larger than 0 45 μm betancourt and rose 2004 to maximize the membrane separation efficiency for the removal of the cysts oocysts it can be considered to use mf membranes with a larger mean pore size than 0 45 μm in a way that does not compromise the removal rate of the cysts oocysts with this in mind we tried to find an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to doms referred to as the near dom ndom hereafter to enhance the water flux while maintaining the removal rate of the cysts oocysts to optimize the mean pore size of mf membranes based on the water flux and removal rate we carried out mf filtration tests using five kinds of mf membranes with different mean pore sizes and two kinds of polystyrene ps latex beads as surrogates as for the removal rate of surrogate particles it was hard to accurately measure the removal rate because the used feed solutions were so dilute that a turbidimeter could not detect higher removal rates than 99 99 2 depending on the particle size to overcome the technological hurdle the removal rates were evaluated by estimating the number of particles in the feed and permeate solutions based on the particle size distribution analysis and the visual observation performed by manually counting the number of particles using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem respectively moreover to further guarantee the quality and safety of the treated water we indirectly tested the feasibility of a serial system consisting of mf and disinfection processes by estimating the removal inactivation efficiency obtainable when a feed solution goes through mf and disinfection processes sequentially given that ultraviolet uv disinfection is not only very effective in inactivating giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts but also does not entail dbps as well as taste and odor problems unlike chlorine disinfection hull et al 2019 kooshan et al 2022 shah et al 2021 we had come up with the idea of adding a uv disinfection process behind an mf process for uv disinfection we applied a uvc light emitting diode led reactor since it can be used to effectively inactivate protozoans bacteria and viruses without concerns about mercury leakage unlike a conventional mercury uv lamp beck et al 2017 kooshan et al 2022 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 lastly it is also expected that uvc led can contribute to more stable disinfection that is less affected by temperature changes than chlorine disinfection susceptible to temperature changes green et al 2018 monteiro et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for mf tests unless specified otherwise all the materials used in this study were purchased from merck and sigma aldrich and used without additional purification five types of mixed cellulose ester mce mf membranes advantec japan with different mean pore sizes were used in order to determine an optimum mean pore size suitable to maximize the water flux and guarantee comparable removal efficiencies their nominal mean pore sizes provided by the manufacturer were 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm fig s1 the commercial mf membranes with the nominal mean pore sizes of 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm were marked as 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm membranes respectively meanwhile ps latex beads of 3 and 8 μm in diameter were used as the surrogate particles of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively given that cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts fall in the range of 4 6 µm and 8 15 µm respectively betancourt and rose 2004 chalmers 2012 kwarciak kozlowska and wlodarczyk 2020 muhammad et al 2008 the volume and concentration of the stock solutions supplied by the manufacturer were 5 ml and 10 wt respectively the stock solutions were diluted at certain concentrations with di water and the diluted feed solutions containing 3 and 8 µm beads were marked as 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively 2 2 characterization of materials used for mf tests ps beads were characterized by a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer partica mini la 350 horiba ltd to identify the volume percentage depending on the size of particles in one type of ps stock solution the volume percentage for each particle size was used to estimate the number of particles for each size which was utilized to assume the removal rate of each surrogate particle the wavelength of the light source was 650 nm and 1 6 was used as the refractive index of ps at room temperature as reported previously jones et al 2013 mcgrory et al 2020 the surfaces and cross sections of mf membranes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem gemini 500 carl zeiss oberkochen germany after being sputter coated with platinum in the center for university wide research facilities curf at jeonbuk national university meanwhile to help understand the trend in the water flux and removal rate the mean pore sizes of five types of membranes were measured based on the wet up dry up method using a capillary flow porometer cfp cfp 34rtf8a x 6 l4 porous materials inc usa specifically polymeric membranes typically consist of three kinds of pores through pore blind pore and closed pore fig 1 lopez marquez et al 2022 tomin and kmetty 2022 a blind pore features that only one side is open while another side is blocked a closed pore is blocked in all directions in contrast a through pore opens on both sides accordingly only a through pore can play a role as the effective pathway to allow water permeation among three types of pores therefore it is necessary to determine the mean pore size of through pores to accurately interpret the water flux behavior of polymeric membranes given this fact a cfp is suitable equipment to measure the mean pore size of through pores since a cfp provides a mean pore size calculated by measuring the flow rate of the air traversing through a membrane specimen as a function of transmembrane pressure tmp lee et al 2013 another point worthy of note is that a cfp measures the narrowest bottleneck among various through pores varying with the longitudinal direction this feature of a cfp is useful when the size gap between the pores observable on the surface and the bottleneck pores measured by a cfp is significant because it helps determine the effective mean pore size when it comes to the pore size measurement procedure using a cfp it begins with filling the membrane pore channels with a 1 1 2 3 3 3 hexafluoropropene galwick pmi usa solution with low surface tension 16 dyn cm 1 subsequently the tmp was increased until the applied gas broke through the wetting liquid the point where the gas first pushes forward the wetting liquid is called the bubble point which is considered the largest pore size among the bottleneck pores described in fig 1 b since the bubble point was recorded a cfp measures the small pores than the pore observed at the bubble point while flowing air through wet and dry membranes sequentially the narrowest diameter of a through pore can be assessed by the following relationship won et al 2012 1 d 4 γ cos θ p where d is the narrowest diameter of a through pore µm γ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid n m 1 and θ is the contact angle between the liquid and the inner pore and p is the critical pressure at which the gas breaks through the wetting liquid psi li et al 2006 yu et al 2010 lastly we measured the viscosities of the mixture consisting of ps beads and methylene blue mb methylene blue to investigate the influence of doms on the rheological behavior of the mixture 3 and 8 µm bead solutions were prepared at the same concentrations 10 and 60 ppm for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively as each solution used for mf tests as for the mixture 10 ppm mb solutions were prepared ahead of time afterward 3 and 8 µm bead stock solutions were added to the mb solutions until the bead concentrations reached 10 and 60 ppm for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively the four types of solutions were subjected to sonication and subsequently vortex to prepare homogeneous suspensions then the viscosities of the four suspensions were evaluated with a dv2t viscometer ametek brookfield usa at a shear rate of 1 67 s 1 at 22 c 2 3 mf test at room temperature typical particle separation processes via uf and mf are carried out at concentrations of tens of ppm jang et al 2015 jung et al 2015 also the particle concentration is adjusted depending on the particle size jang et al 2015 because the actual numbers of particles are so far apart from each other if the particle solutions are prepared at the same concentration despite the different sizes with these in mind we prepared 1 l of 3 µm ps bead solution at 10 ppm by adding 100 μl of 10 wt stock solution to 1 l of deionized di water as for an 8 μm bead sample 500 ml of 8 µm ps bead solution was prepared at 60 ppm by adding 300 μl of 10 wt stock solution to 500 ml of di water the as prepared feed solutions were sonicated for 15 min with a bath sonicator sk7200bt youngjin corporation china before every mf test and stirred at 300 rpm throughout an mf test the water flux j l m 2 h 1 lmh and particle removal rate were evaluated with a laboratory scale crossflow mf system fig 2 a comprising a gear pump emg 4000 scist korea pressure gage pulse damper square membrane module and 2 l feed tank working volume 1 l as described in the previous literature kim et al 2022 the operating pressure crossflow rate and effective membrane area were 1 bar 1 3 1 5 l min 1 and 4 cm2 respectively meanwhile a crossflow rate of about 1 4 l min 1 was consistently applied to all the filtration tests without further adjustment because there were no statistically significant differences in the water permeance and removal rate depending on the crossflow rate fig s2 no significant influence of crossflow rate on the membrane performance could be attributed to the fact that the back transport of particles from the membrane surface is negligible since the number of particles in a water treatment process is quite small for reference our membrane module had a channel width of 20 mm a length of 20 mm and a depth of 1 5 mm accordingly the crossflow rate of 1 3 1 5 l min 1 was translated into a crossflow velocity of 72 2 83 3 cm s 1 which falls between the widely used crossflow velocities 10 400 cm s 1 for microfiltration choi et al 2015 ho and sung 2009 laorko et al 2011 zhao et al 2002 prior to collecting a permeate solution a membrane was compacted for 30 min by circulating the feed solution at the given pressure and crossflow rate singh and purkait 2019 after the 30 min compaction 30 and 100 ml of permeate solutions were collected to measure the water flux of the 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively some of the permeate solutions were used to examine their turbidities with a turbidimeter orion aq4500 thermo scientific usa the turbidities of the initial feed solutions were 9 74 0 06 and 5 34 0 10 ntu for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions with concentrations of 10 and 60 ppm respectively however the turbidity was not detected n d in all the permeate solutions for that reason it was too hard to directly confirm the particle removal rate based on the permeate solution s turbidity instead we tried to assume the removal rate by dividing the number of particles in a permeate solution by the number of particles in a feed solution to utilize the newly designed method we needed to estimate the number of particles in the feed and permeate solutions with high accuracy as for counting the number of particles in a permeate solution first after the dead end filtration of a permeate solution using a 0 1 μm mce filter with a 47 mm diameter fig 2 b the number of particles in a permeate solution was extrapolated by taking the fesem images of the particles deposited on the filter surface and manually counting the number of particles deposited on the filter surface since it was impossible to go over the entire area of the filter s surface containing the permeate solution s particles we tried to compensate for the limitation by getting as many sem images as possible and thereby infer a more accurate removal rate in detail three specimens were taken from one filter containing the permeate solution s particles at three arbitrary locations after that we obtained 49 sem images on average at 600 magnification from one filter note that 600 magnification was chosen to manually count 3 and 8 μm beads in that the magnification is appropriate to find the presence of the two kinds of beads simultaneously while allowing us to cover a larger area within the observable range in our experience 49 sem images are translated into around 1 20 10 2 cm2 which corresponds to about 0 1 of the effective filter area 12 56 cm2 used for the dead end filtration in this way a particle counting method was repeated five and three times for 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively which was equally applied to five types of membranes as a result 1201 and 759 sem images were acquired for 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively they were used to infer the number of particles in a permeate solution and the resulting removal rate the number of particles in a permeate solution was calculated based on the following relationship 2 n p n p a e a s n s where np is the estimated total number of particles in a permeate solution np is the counted number of particles observed using the sem images of the filter specimens ae is the effective area cm2 of the filter used for the dead end filtration of a permeate solution as is the area cm2 of an sem image and ns is the total number of the sem images obtained from one filter the estimation of the number of particles in the as prepared feed solution started from the point of investigating the particle size distribution of the feed solutions to calculate the number of particles based on the density size and volume fractions varying depending on the size the first eye catching point was that the commercial bead solutions had a wider particle size distribution than expected as shown in fig 3 this result implies that one does not have to calculate the number of particles based only on the mean particle size and density recklessly but should try to individually estimate the number of particles by reflecting the volume percentages varying in particle size given this point we tried to calculate the number of individual particles with different sizes upon consideration of the intrinsic density 1 05 g cm 3 the measured particle size and the measured volume percentage of each size of the particle the number of particles in a feed solution can be estimated by the following relationship 3 n f lower limit upper limit m p φ ip 418 9 r ip 3 ρ where nf is the estimated number of particles with different sizes in a feed solution mp is the mass g of total particles in a feed solution φi p is the measured volume fraction of individual particles in a feed solution ri p is the measured radius of individual particles in a feed solution and ρ is the density of ps lastly the particle removal rate r was evaluated using the np and nf based on the following relationship 4 r 1 n p n f 100 2 4 ndom mf test with a 0 8 µm membrane under the conditions including real world factors such as low temperature 10 c and doms to test the feasibility of an ndom mf process under various temperature conditions we assessed the water flux and removal rate of the mf membrane selected as an optimal candidate at a low temperature all the experimental conditions were the same as those used in the mf test a room temperature except for temperature and membrane type the temperature and type of membrane were 6 10 c and a 0 8 µm membrane respectively to estimate the removal rate a permeate solution was collected for a certain period of time and filtered again via dead end filtration using a 0 1 μm filter after depositing the particles in a permeate solution on a 0 1 μm filter the filter containing the filtered particles was thoroughly dried and used to get the sem images to carry out a particle counting method 335 sem images were obtained and used for a particle counting method the number of spotted particles was used to estimate the removal rate lastly a 10 ppm dye mb solution was used to prepare the mixture consisting of mb and ps beads and determine how doms influence the performance of microfiltration of 3 and 8 µm bead solutions the microfiltration test to clarify the influence of doms was performed under the same experimental condition as described above apart from the type of the feed solution and membrane i e only 0 8 µm membrane was used the removal rate was calculated by the analysis through the particle counting method using 270 sem images 2 5 experimental apparatus for uvc led applications the output power of uvc leds seoul optodevice co korea fig 4 was 156 mw the uvc led in a housing diameter of 9 mm was much smaller than a commercial 4 w uvc low pressure mercury lamp philips co usa which was 136 mm in length and 16 mm in diameter rectangular leds of 0 73 mm 0 78 mm were placed at the center of the housing to provide an effective irradiation angle of 120 either a mercury lamp or a set of two uvc leds was placed at the top of a cylindrical tube which is 10 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height this collimated column guided a parallel uv irradiation to the sample placed under the column the emission spectrum of the uvc led and uv lamp was measured using a spectrapro 500 acton research co usa the uv light intensity was measured using a uvx radiometer uvp co usa equipped with a uvc uva detector cho et al 2006 2 6 culture and analysis of microorganisms for uvc led applications b subtilis e coli and ms2 bacteriophage were supplied by the american type culture collection atcc usa suspensions of b subtilis spores atcc 6633 were cultured and analyzed as reported previously nakayama et al 1996 except for a couple of minor changes such as utilizing a 1 10 diluted nutrient agar and taking a longer incubation period of 5 to 7 days cho et al 2003 in detail we aseptically rehydrated a freeze dried pellet of b subtilis with a nutrient broth difco co usa and incubated it at 37 c for 18 h after repeating centrifugations at 3 500 g for 10 min and resuspending in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 150 mm at ph 7 2 two times the bacterial cells were inoculated into sterile petri dishes containing 1 10 diluted nutrient agar 0 8 g l 1 difco nutrient broth and 15 g l 1 agar difco co usa and incubated at 37 c for 5 to 7 days to induce sporulation after incubation we rinsed the agar containing b subtilis spores using pbs and harvested the spores into 50 ml conical tubes then to rinse the harvested spores the spores were subjected to centrifugation at 3 500 g for 10 min and resuspension with pbs repeatedly three times after the rinsing procedure the recovery of spores reached over 99 the recovered spores were used to prepare a stock solution and the stock solution was used after the heating process at 80 c for 20 min to guarantee the inactivation of any remaining vegetative cells ahead of each experiment the procedures to prepare and enumerate e coli atcc 8739 were based on kleyn and bicknell kleyn and bicknell 2004 a lyophilized pellet of e coli was aseptically rehydrated in 50 ml of tryptic soy broth difco co usa and cultured at 37 c for 18 h then we harvested bacterial cells from the broth by repeating centrifugation at 1 000 g for 10 min and resuspension in 50 ml of pbs the stock suspension of e coli was prepared by resuspending the final pellets into a 50 ml conical tube containing 40 ml pbs the number of viable b subtilis spores and e coli cells was estimated by a spread plate method based on the standard method standard method 1992 a nutrient agar containing 8 g l 1 of nutrient broth and 15 g l 1 of agar was spread with 0 1 ml of sample after incubation at 37 c for 24 h the number of colonies was counted lastly the soft agar overlay method using a mutant strain of e coli c3000 as a host debartolomeis and cabelli 1991 was employed to prepare and quantify ms2 bacteriophages atcc 15 597 e coli c3000 was cultured in media consisting of 0 8 w v nutrient broth and 0 5 nacl the media for the plaque assays was composed of 1 3 tryptone 1 0 glucose 0 8 nacl 1 0 cacl2 2h2o and 1 0 mgso4 also 1 5 and 0 7 agar were included in the media of the bottom and top agars used for the plaque assays respectively after inoculating phage into the e coli and incubating it overnight at 37 c the ms2 bacteriophages were collected by suspending the overlay soft agar in 10 ml pbs and obtaining supernatant after centrifugation for 15 min at 3 000 g to prepare a stock solution for ms2 bacteriophage viability assay triplicate the sample was diluted up to 100 times and grown on an e coli host lawn i e in a double agar layer and the plaque forming unit pfu was enumerated after overnight incubation at 37 c 2 7 disinfection using uvc leds all the experimental solutions were prepared using milli q water millipore co usa and analytical or reagent grade chemicals all the glassware was used after being thoroughly cleaned with milli q water and autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min experiments were performed in triplicate and all the assay results were within a 90 confidence interval disinfection experiments in the liquid phase were performed using surrogates such as b subtilis spores e coli and ms2 phage following the procedure by usepa usepa 2006 the above three kinds of microorganisms were selected as surrogates for giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts for the following reasons first e coli and ms2 phage have often been used as surrogates in uv disinfection because they are much less sensitive to uv disinfection than giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts linden et al 2002 sigmon et al 2015 usepa 2003 accordingly if a certain uv disinfection condition successfully inactivated e coli and ms2 phage it indicates that the disinfection condition should be effective in inactivating giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts which are more susceptible to uv disinfection it is also the case for b subtilis spores which is more tolerant to uv disinfection than giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts hijnen et al 2006 apart from tolerance to uv b subtilis spores have also been used as a surrogate of the aerobic spore for cryptosporidium oocysts jung et al 2008 muhammad et al 2008 based on the above rationales the above three microorganisms were used as conservative surrogates to address the high dose challenge imposed by giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts 2 8 statistical analysis the student s t test using prism 6 version 6 04 graphpad was carried out to determine the statistically significant differences in the viscosities of a 3 μm or 8 μm bead solution and the mixture consisting of 3 μm or 8 μm bead solution and 10 ppm mb solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the removal rate of five commercial mf membranes tables 1 and 2 show the number of individual particles changing with the particles sizes and volume fractions for 3 and 8 μm bead samples respectively these trends support that commercial ps bead solutions have a very large particle size distribution as shown in fig 3 in particular a 3 μm bead sample was confirmed to have a considerably prominent standard deviation 1 38 μm given its mean particle size 2 48 μm which is evident from the comparison with an 8 μm bead sample with a mean particle size of 8 36 μm and standard deviation of 1 96 μm as a result the particles smaller than 30 i e 0 766 μm of the mean particle size accounted for almost half i e 47 1 of the total number of particles in a 3 μm bead sample even though their volume fraction was only about 5 6 of the total volume of the particles accordingly it is desirable not to involve the number of particles ranging from 0 445 to 0 766 μm in the denominator used to calculate the removal rate for the purpose of preventing the removal rate from being overestimated due to the number of particles away from the mean particle size this condition associated with the particle size taken into consideration for calculating the removal rate was applied to all types of membranes for a fair comparison on the other hand as shown in table 2 the minimum particle size of an 8 μm bead sample was 3 905 μm which is easily discernible at the given magnification e g 600 by means of fesem in other words all sizes of the particles involved in an 8 μm bead solution should be detected by the suggested particle counting method with no problem more importantly the number of 3 905 μm beads which were the smallest particles in an 8 μm bead solution corresponded only to 1 35 of the number of total beads in a stock solution this is an important point because the fact reveals an 8 μm bead solution is much freer from the overestimation issue caused by too small particles thus all the particles in an 8 μm bead solution were included in counting the number of particles regardless of particle size as shown in table 3 the mf test and analysis in accordance with the suggested particle counting method represented that all types of mf membranes achieved more than 3 and 4 log reductions of 3 and 8 µm beads respectively fig 5 a and b this excellent selectivity was also revealed in the contrast between the appearances of the particles deposited on the membrane surface after mf tests fig 5 c and d and the particles in a permeate solution fig 5 e and f as for the removal rate for 8 µm beads it was not difficult to predict all the mf membranes would successfully separate ps beads because even the smallest particles 3 905 µm in an 8 µm bead solution were larger than the measured mean pore size 2 03 µm of a 5 µm mf membrane unlike 8 µm beads it was intriguing that 3 µm beads also did not cause statistically significant differences in the removal rate fig 5 a this unexpected result is attributable to the bubble point and the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes when it comes to the bubble point s influence on the removal rate obtained using 3 μm beads as shown in fig 6 a the bubble points of all the membranes were larger than the smallest bead size 0 877 μm among the particle sizes taken into consideration when calculating the removal rate indeed even a 0 45 μm membrane also showed a larger bubble point 0 92 μm than 0 877 μm this fact signifies that all the membranes were likely to allow particle passage due to their bubble points larger than some of the particles in a 3 μm bead solution also given that smaller particles typically take up a higher proportion in the number the small particles passage is considered significant in a 0 45 μm membrane on the other hand the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes is also considered to contribute to making the removal rates similar to one another in the mf test using 3 μm beads in detail the removal rates of 3 and 5 μm membranes were expected to be low because their nominal mean pore sizes were known to be similar to or larger than 3 μm beads however both membranes revealed much smaller mean pore sizes in the pore size distribution analysis using a cfp 1 74 and 2 0 for 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively fig 6 b more importantly even the bubble points of the two membranes were smaller than or similar to 3 μm 2 6 and 3 0 for 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively fig 6 a which means that most of the pores of the two membranes were smaller than 3 μm beads as such 3 and 5 μm membranes were thought to have no statistically significant difference in the removal rate due to the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes overall all the membranes tested in this study showed potential for removing particles similar to giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts in size regardless of the pore size 3 2 correlation between the water flux and pore size of five commercial mf membranes fig 7 presents the permeate water flux of five commercial mf membranes obtained from the mf test using pure water 3 and 8 μm bead solutions as expected the permeate water flux obtained from the mf test using pure water was the highest regardless of the types of membranes because the mf using pure water is free from membrane fouling caused by particle deposition as for the comparison between the water flux obtained from the mf test using 3 and 8 μm bead solutions the mf test using an 8 μm bead solution exhibited higher water fluxes than a 3 μm bead solution on the whole this phenomenon arises from the number and size of 8 μm beads to be specific based on the number of particles in each feed solution used in the mf test an 8 μm bead solution was assumed to have 1 069 108 beads table 3 which is around 38 times fewer than the number of 3 μm beads excluding the particles smaller than 0 877 μm accordingly an 8 μm bead solution was even more favorable for antifouling filtration thanks to the fewer particles than a 3 μm bead solution leading to higher water fluxes regardless of types of membranes meanwhile large particles are also more beneficial than smaller particles from the perspective of membrane fouling control on the condition that most of the particles are larger than the pore size of the membrane trzaskus et al 2016 in this regard it also makes sense that an 8 μm bead solution caused less fouling and thereby induced higher water flux as compared to a 3 μm bead solution even more intriguingly than comparing the water fluxes based on the type of feed solutions we spotted a very distinctive trend in the water flux as a function of the nominal mean pore size in general the water flux positively correlates with the pore size based on hagen poiseuille s law as follows hosseini et al 2018 5 j ε d 2 32 μ l δ p where ε is the overall porosity d is the pore diameter μ is the liquid viscosity l is the membrane thickness and p is the tmp according to hagen poiseuille s law since the water flux is proportional to the square of the pore diameter the water flux of five commercial mf membranes was supposed to increase more sharply as the pore size increased however the increasing rate of the water flux dropped beyond 1 μm mean pore size and this phenomenon consistently appeared regardless of the type of feed solutions as a result the water flux increased by only 5 30 in the range of nominal mean pore size from 1 to 5 μm in stark contrast to the water flux enhancement 1 7 2 6 times observed in the nominal mean pore size range from 0 45 to 1 μm fig 7 to clarify the root cause of the unexpected water flux behavior we thoroughly examined the pore size distribution of five commercial mf membranes using a cfp according to the pore size distribution data fig 8 all the membranes were found to possess a remarkably narrow pore size distribution overall more importantly the trend of mean pore size was very similar to that of water flux regardless of the type of feed solutions fig 6 b which was also the case for the bubble point fig 6 a this result suggests that the membrane pore size dictated the water flux in this study which makes sense considering that there were no significant differences e g thickness and overall porosity see more details in table s1 in the membrane characteristics associated with the intrinsic water permeability except for the pore size hydrophilicity was excluded from consideration because five commercial mf membranes consisted of the same material i e mce in the first place finally and most importantly we spotted a noticeable discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes in detail the mean pore sizes of 3 and 5 μm membranes were measured at 1 74 0 08 and 2 0 0 2 μm respectively fig 6 b these measured mean pore sizes corresponded to 58 and 40 of the nominal mean pore sizes of 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively demonstrating a great deal of difference between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes from the particle size distribution analysis to verify why the water flux behaved very differently from the nominal mean pore size beyond 1 μm we could draw a conclusion that it boils down to the apparent discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes 3 3 ndom mf test with a 0 8 µm membrane under the conditions including real world factors such as low temperature 10 c and doms if the ndom mf is feasible at low temperatures we could successfully utilize the hybrid system consisting of the ndom mf and uvc led processes in real water treatment now that a uvc led process s disinfection ability is known to be relatively independent of temperature changes green et al 2018 as an effort to test the feasibility of the ndom mf under variable temperature conditions we carried out the mf test with a 0 8 μm membrane at a low temperature ranging from 6 to 10 c considering that the control of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts becomes more difficult at a low temperature for the mf test at low temperature a 0 8 μm membrane was chosen as an optimum candidate in that it solely met the requirements in terms of the water flux particle removal and rationale for the absolute retention as follows as for the water flux and particle removal a 0 8 μm membrane showed a comparable removal rate to a 0 45 μm membrane while it had a 1 5 2 5 times higher water flux than a 0 45 μm membrane finally and most importantly only a 0 8 μm membrane was highly likely to give promise of the absolute retention of the particles larger than 3 μm which covers the size range of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts only a 0 8 μm membrane s mean pore size 1 28 μm was about 3 times smaller than 4 μm namely the smallest size among cryptosporidium oocysts fig 6 b fitting the absolute retention s criterion namely that the particle size should be 2 to 3 times of the pore size at least lee and liu 1994 with these in mind a 0 8 μm membrane was selected as the best candidate to guarantee absolute retention as shown in fig 9 a the permeate water fluxes were consistently evaluated lower at a low temperature than at room temperature regardless of the type of feed solutions this phenomenon can be understood in relation to the water s viscosity varying with temperature abdullah et al 2020 apmann et al 2021 in other words the water s viscosity was presumed to increase due to the temperature drop which was accompanied by the increase in the filtration resistance ending up with a significant flux decline fig 9 a although the water flux was reduced with the temperature decrease the water flux of a 0 8 μm membrane was found to still possess similar to or 1 6 2 times higher than that of a 0 45 μm membrane at room temperature accordingly it is not too much to say that a 0 8 μm membrane has the potential for low temperature mf only if it also keeps a comparable removal rate even at a low temperature in this regard it is worth noting that the particle removal rate of a 0 8 μm membrane was kept at a similar level regardless of the temperature change when comparing the mf test using the same kind of feed solution fig 9 b overall the ndom mf using a 0 8 μm membrane is expected to be workable even in variable temperature conditions while achieving high water flux and comparable removal rate of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts independent of temperature changes lastly in reality giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts are likely to be found along with doms in water accordingly we also need to cope with the situation where we have to handle the mixture consisting of protozoa and doms given that we conducted the filtration test using a 0 8 μm membrane and the mixture consisting of the two types of polystyrene beads and 10 ppm mb which is one of the dissolved organic matters to test the feasibility of the ndom mf under the condition including another real world factor according to the filtration of the mixture the permeate flux was slightly reduced by 10 to 20 as mb was added to the mixture fig 9 c this phenomenon is thought to arise from the increased viscosities of mixtures fig 9 d by the interaction between mb and polystyrene beads resulting in higher filtration resistance however the mb addition did not cause significant differences in the removal rate fig 9 e which was understandable upon consideration of the too small molecular size of mb 1 42 0 62 0 16 nm3 ma et al 2012 to influence the behavior of beads 3 and 8 μm from these results we could conclude that the ndom mf using a 0 8 μm membrane is feasible to remove protozoa regardless of the existence of doms 3 4 water disinfection using uvc leds according to the ndom mf using 3 and 8 μm bead solutions it already achieved a 3 4 log reduction thus if uvc led came behind the ndom mf process and used the permeate solution released from the ndom mf process uvc led would have only a slim chance of detecting the inactivation of protozoa by uvc led due to very scarce cysts oocysts for that reason it was almost impossible to experimentally test the feasibility of a serial hybrid system consisting of the ndom mf and uvc led processes to overcome the practical limitation imposed by the high dose challenge of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts in a serial hybrid system we tried to independently conduct a comparison study between the disinfection of surrogate microorganisms by uvc led and germicidal uv lamp also we tried to indirectly weigh up the possibility of using a serial hybrid system to further improve the quality of treated water fig 10 shows the kinetics of e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage inactivation in the aqueous phase by uvc led and mercury uv lamp these experiments were performed at three different light intensities for each light source i e by adjusting the distance between the light source and the sample these data were plotted versus it the product of the light intensity i in mw cm 2 and exposure time t in s and the following pseudo first order kinetics usepa 2006 was used to analyze the data as follows 6 l o g n n 0 k i t where n is the concentration of viable microorganisms at time t cfu ml 1 or pfu ml 1 n 0 is the initial concentration of viable microorganisms cfu ml 1 or pfu ml 1 and k is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj 1 the linear portion of the data i e all the data points for e coli and ms2 phage and data points after it 10 mj cm 2 for b subtilis spores followed the above kinetics with relatively high correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 several features in fig 10 are noteworthy first all three indicator microorganisms were rapidly inactivated using the uvc led for example when 0 14 mw cm 2 of light intensity was applied which corresponds to two led lamps positioned 2 cm from the sample in a reactor 2 log 99 inactivation was achieved by 0 48 2 86 and 4 29 min exposure for e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage respectively second the inactivation kinetics obtained with uvc led was nearly identical to those obtained with mercury uv lamp this phenomenon was expected in the first place since the spectrum of the light emitted by uvc led was very similar to that by mercury uv lamp as shown in fig 11 therefore one could save time and effort to develop independent kinetics using uvc leds by referring to the information regarding inactivation kinetics of various microorganisms by low pressure mercury uv lamps usepa 2006 in particular the it values set forth by the regulations which had been determined using mercury uv lamps were consistent with the it values obtained herein with uvc led for example it values required to achieve 2 log inactivation of e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage by uvc led were 4 24 and 36 mj cm 2 respectively which were within the ranges reported in the literature i e 3 0 to 6 2 23 to 50 and 30 to 60 mj cm 2 for e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage respectively determined by mercury uv lamps as such uvc leds were verified to be as effective as a germicidal uv lamp from the perspective of disinfection capability while it does not cause the weaknesses stemming from a conventional mercury uv lamp and chlorine notably since uvc led effectively inactivated the above three types of microorganisms more tolerant to uv than protozoa it is also expected to successfully inactivate giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts as well then if we provide uvc led to further treat the permeate obtained from ndom mf it is technically possible to achieve a 6 7 log reduction i e 3 4 log reduction by ndom mf and another 3 log reduction by uvc led 3 5 implication of a serial hybrid system consisting of ndom mf and uvc led disinfection the results of this study suggest that uvc led is a promising alternative to conventional mercury vapor fluorescent uv lamps as well as other led devices such as uva led while providing the same disinfection rate in the liquid phase the uvc led provides several advantages over conventional mercury uv lamps the uvc led is much more energy efficient as it emits nearly monochromatic light at a germicidal wavelength with minimal energy loss as heat combined with the fact that the lifetime is nearly permanent the uvc led has great potential to be useful as a disinfection device in remote environments such as developing countries where energy supply and continuous maintenance are often challenging since the uvc led is very small and requires direct current that can be easily supplied by batteries or solar cells without additional circuits it might be useful as a portable device lastly considering the design flexibility due to its small size and the fact that it does not employ mercury vapor which may pose a threat its environmentally friendly applications in small or narrow spaces could also be very promising all things considered uvc leds could provide various kinds of strengths if we combine a range of merits of uvc led with ndom mf we could expect the synergistic effect of coupling the ndom mf with uvc led to guarantee the high quality of treated water with high process efficiency 4 conclusion in this study we proposed membrane filtration using an mf membrane with an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to dissolved organic matters doms which is called near dom mf ndom mf to efficiently remove giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts a 0 8 µm membrane was chosen as an optimum candidate for efficient ndom mf and used for the performance comparison with a 0 45 µm mf membrane which is a conventional membrane widely used to remove giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts according to the mf test using polystyrene surrogate beads with diameters of 3 and 8 µm the ndom mf using a 0 8 µm membrane showed 52 to 146 higher water fluxes than a 0 45 µm mf membrane while maintaining the removal rate at 3 4 log which was also the case for a low temperature mf test to further guarantee the high quality of treated water with high process efficiency ndom mf can be coupled with uvc led thanks to various kinds of strengths stemming from uvc led such as the disinfection efficiency as high as a conventional mercury

14975,microfiltration mf membranes with a mean pore size same as or smaller than 0 45 µm have been typically used to separate pathogenic protozoa in water since materials larger than 0 45 µm are considered particulates however 0 45 µm is too small to separate protozoa which are 4 6 µm cryptosporidium oocyst or 8 15 µm giardia cyst in size in this study we optimized the mean pore size of mf membranes to maximize the producibility and guarantee a high removal rate simultaneously and proposed the membrane filtration using an mf membrane with an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to dissolved organic matter dom which is called near dom mf ndom mf according to the mf test using polystyrene surrogate beads with diameters of 3 and 8 µm an mf membrane with a 0 8 µm mean pore size was the best in that it showed 52 to 146 higher water fluxes than a 0 45 µm mf membrane while maintaining the removal rate at 3 4 log it was also the case for a low temperature mf test revealing the ndom mf is highly effective regardless of temperature changes lastly we tried to find the possibility of combining the ndom mf with disinfection by an ultraviolet light emitting diode uvc led to further guarantee the high quality of treated water while providing high process efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords giardia cyst cryptosporidium oocyst microfiltration uv disinfection water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water treatment technologies have come a long way by driving technological innovation in various aspects encompassing developing high performance membranes lee et al 2022 2021a lim et al 2021 advanced biological wastewater treatment anburajan et al 2021 corpuz et al 2021 decentralized wastewater treatment hube and wu 2021 lee et al 2021b udomkittayachai et al 2021 efficient desalination processes chong and krantz 2018 krantz and chong 2021 disinfection rouge et al 2022 yoon et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes kim et al 2021 son et al 2021 vigneshwaran et al 2021 adsorption based water treatment karthikeyan et al 2021 njaramba et al 2022 and electrochemical water treatment ahn et al 2021 over the decades thanks to the remarkable advances in water treatment technologies clean water supply has significantly improved in quantity and quality however drinking water supply and water safety are still being menaced by severe droughts and floods caused by unprecedented climate change for example variable rainfall patterns arising from climate change can exacerbate the water security associated with a resilient water supply which is evidenced by the case where cryptosporidium was more likely to be found with heavy rainfall nijhawan and howard 2021 as such climate change is threatening drinking water hygiene such that more than 2 billion people worldwide still suffer from various waterborne diseases pichel et al 2019 tao and xin 2014 among pathogens causing waterborne diseases giardia and cryptosporidium are considered the most prevalent pathogens silva and sabogal paz 2021 their cysts giardia and oocysts cryptosporidium are known to be infective and if infected they can cause abdominal pain diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients baldursson and karanis 2011 certad et al 2017 efstratiou et al 2017 guzman herrador et al 2015 hemphill et al 2019 moreira and bondelind 2017 njaramba et al 2022 savioli et al 2006 accordingly it is necessary to thoroughly remove or inactivate the cysts oocysts to guarantee drinking water hygiene for that reason 99 2 log and 99 9 3 log removal or inactivation are recommended for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively as minimum criteria for water treatment in accordance with the enforcement decree of the water supply and waterworks installation act in korea unfortunately however it is very hard to control the cysts oocysts using chlorine which is one of the most widely used disinfectants he et al 2022 due to their resistance to chlorine disinfection nasser 2016 sammarro silva and sabogal paz 2022 specifically the cysts oocysts require thousands giardia to hundreds of thousands cryptosporidium times higher ct values chlorine concentration multiplied by time for chlorine inactivation as compared to e coli hoff and rubin 1987 joret et al 1989 korich 1993 considering that too much chlorine consumption to inactivate the cysts oocysts can result in a large increase in the economic burden and the risk factors related to taste and odor problems and disinfectant by products dbps cai et al 2019 tsitsifli and kanakoudis 2018 chlorine inactivation is inappropriate as a control strategy of the cysts oocysts as an alternative to chlorine disinfection membrane separation processes can be considered a desirable option to remove the cysts oocysts in that they basically correspond to particulates which can be physically separated based on size exclusion among several membrane separation processes ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have been widely used to remove cysts oocysts from an aqueous solution since they have small pores 0 01 0 5 μm enough to remove protozoan cysts 4 15 μm omarova et al 2018 when it comes to cyst and oocyst removal using uf it was more effective in removing the cysts oocysts than conventional sand filtration and flocculation sedimentation lyu et al 2022 meanwhile when mf is used to control the cysts oocysts mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm have been utilized to make sure cyst and oocyst removal because particulates are defined as matters larger than 0 45 μm while dissolved organic matters doms are considered smaller than 0 45 μm xu and guo 2018 however one needs to note that uf or mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm are too dense to efficiently separate the cysts oocysts with high productivity upon consideration that giardia cysts 8 μm 12 μm and cryptosporidium oocysts 4 5 μm 5 μm are much larger than 0 45 μm betancourt and rose 2004 to maximize the membrane separation efficiency for the removal of the cysts oocysts it can be considered to use mf membranes with a larger mean pore size than 0 45 μm in a way that does not compromise the removal rate of the cysts oocysts with this in mind we tried to find an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to doms referred to as the near dom ndom hereafter to enhance the water flux while maintaining the removal rate of the cysts oocysts to optimize the mean pore size of mf membranes based on the water flux and removal rate we carried out mf filtration tests using five kinds of mf membranes with different mean pore sizes and two kinds of polystyrene ps latex beads as surrogates as for the removal rate of surrogate particles it was hard to accurately measure the removal rate because the used feed solutions were so dilute that a turbidimeter could not detect higher removal rates than 99 99 2 depending on the particle size to overcome the technological hurdle the removal rates were evaluated by estimating the number of particles in the feed and permeate solutions based on the particle size distribution analysis and the visual observation performed by manually counting the number of particles using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem respectively moreover to further guarantee the quality and safety of the treated water we indirectly tested the feasibility of a serial system consisting of mf and disinfection processes by estimating the removal inactivation efficiency obtainable when a feed solution goes through mf and disinfection processes sequentially given that ultraviolet uv disinfection is not only very effective in inactivating giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts but also does not entail dbps as well as taste and odor problems unlike chlorine disinfection hull et al 2019 kooshan et al 2022 shah et al 2021 we had come up with the idea of adding a uv disinfection process behind an mf process for uv disinfection we applied a uvc light emitting diode led reactor since it can be used to effectively inactivate protozoans bacteria and viruses without concerns about mercury leakage unlike a conventional mercury uv lamp beck et al 2017 kooshan et al 2022 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 lastly it is also expected that uvc led can contribute to more stable disinfection that is less affected by temperature changes than chlorine disinfection susceptible to temperature changes green et al 2018 monteiro et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for mf tests unless specified otherwise all the materials used in this study were purchased from merck and sigma aldrich and used without additional purification five types of mixed cellulose ester mce mf membranes advantec japan with different mean pore sizes were used in order to determine an optimum mean pore size suitable to maximize the water flux and guarantee comparable removal efficiencies their nominal mean pore sizes provided by the manufacturer were 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm fig s1 the commercial mf membranes with the nominal mean pore sizes of 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm were marked as 0 45 0 8 1 3 and 5 µm membranes respectively meanwhile ps latex beads of 3 and 8 μm in diameter were used as the surrogate particles of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively given that cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts fall in the range of 4 6 µm and 8 15 µm respectively betancourt and rose 2004 chalmers 2012 kwarciak kozlowska and wlodarczyk 2020 muhammad et al 2008 the volume and concentration of the stock solutions supplied by the manufacturer were 5 ml and 10 wt respectively the stock solutions were diluted at certain concentrations with di water and the diluted feed solutions containing 3 and 8 µm beads were marked as 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively 2 2 characterization of materials used for mf tests ps beads were characterized by a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer partica mini la 350 horiba ltd to identify the volume percentage depending on the size of particles in one type of ps stock solution the volume percentage for each particle size was used to estimate the number of particles for each size which was utilized to assume the removal rate of each surrogate particle the wavelength of the light source was 650 nm and 1 6 was used as the refractive index of ps at room temperature as reported previously jones et al 2013 mcgrory et al 2020 the surfaces and cross sections of mf membranes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem gemini 500 carl zeiss oberkochen germany after being sputter coated with platinum in the center for university wide research facilities curf at jeonbuk national university meanwhile to help understand the trend in the water flux and removal rate the mean pore sizes of five types of membranes were measured based on the wet up dry up method using a capillary flow porometer cfp cfp 34rtf8a x 6 l4 porous materials inc usa specifically polymeric membranes typically consist of three kinds of pores through pore blind pore and closed pore fig 1 lopez marquez et al 2022 tomin and kmetty 2022 a blind pore features that only one side is open while another side is blocked a closed pore is blocked in all directions in contrast a through pore opens on both sides accordingly only a through pore can play a role as the effective pathway to allow water permeation among three types of pores therefore it is necessary to determine the mean pore size of through pores to accurately interpret the water flux behavior of polymeric membranes given this fact a cfp is suitable equipment to measure the mean pore size of through pores since a cfp provides a mean pore size calculated by measuring the flow rate of the air traversing through a membrane specimen as a function of transmembrane pressure tmp lee et al 2013 another point worthy of note is that a cfp measures the narrowest bottleneck among various through pores varying with the longitudinal direction this feature of a cfp is useful when the size gap between the pores observable on the surface and the bottleneck pores measured by a cfp is significant because it helps determine the effective mean pore size when it comes to the pore size measurement procedure using a cfp it begins with filling the membrane pore channels with a 1 1 2 3 3 3 hexafluoropropene galwick pmi usa solution with low surface tension 16 dyn cm 1 subsequently the tmp was increased until the applied gas broke through the wetting liquid the point where the gas first pushes forward the wetting liquid is called the bubble point which is considered the largest pore size among the bottleneck pores described in fig 1 b since the bubble point was recorded a cfp measures the small pores than the pore observed at the bubble point while flowing air through wet and dry membranes sequentially the narrowest diameter of a through pore can be assessed by the following relationship won et al 2012 1 d 4 γ cos θ p where d is the narrowest diameter of a through pore µm γ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid n m 1 and θ is the contact angle between the liquid and the inner pore and p is the critical pressure at which the gas breaks through the wetting liquid psi li et al 2006 yu et al 2010 lastly we measured the viscosities of the mixture consisting of ps beads and methylene blue mb methylene blue to investigate the influence of doms on the rheological behavior of the mixture 3 and 8 µm bead solutions were prepared at the same concentrations 10 and 60 ppm for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively as each solution used for mf tests as for the mixture 10 ppm mb solutions were prepared ahead of time afterward 3 and 8 µm bead stock solutions were added to the mb solutions until the bead concentrations reached 10 and 60 ppm for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions respectively the four types of solutions were subjected to sonication and subsequently vortex to prepare homogeneous suspensions then the viscosities of the four suspensions were evaluated with a dv2t viscometer ametek brookfield usa at a shear rate of 1 67 s 1 at 22 c 2 3 mf test at room temperature typical particle separation processes via uf and mf are carried out at concentrations of tens of ppm jang et al 2015 jung et al 2015 also the particle concentration is adjusted depending on the particle size jang et al 2015 because the actual numbers of particles are so far apart from each other if the particle solutions are prepared at the same concentration despite the different sizes with these in mind we prepared 1 l of 3 µm ps bead solution at 10 ppm by adding 100 μl of 10 wt stock solution to 1 l of deionized di water as for an 8 μm bead sample 500 ml of 8 µm ps bead solution was prepared at 60 ppm by adding 300 μl of 10 wt stock solution to 500 ml of di water the as prepared feed solutions were sonicated for 15 min with a bath sonicator sk7200bt youngjin corporation china before every mf test and stirred at 300 rpm throughout an mf test the water flux j l m 2 h 1 lmh and particle removal rate were evaluated with a laboratory scale crossflow mf system fig 2 a comprising a gear pump emg 4000 scist korea pressure gage pulse damper square membrane module and 2 l feed tank working volume 1 l as described in the previous literature kim et al 2022 the operating pressure crossflow rate and effective membrane area were 1 bar 1 3 1 5 l min 1 and 4 cm2 respectively meanwhile a crossflow rate of about 1 4 l min 1 was consistently applied to all the filtration tests without further adjustment because there were no statistically significant differences in the water permeance and removal rate depending on the crossflow rate fig s2 no significant influence of crossflow rate on the membrane performance could be attributed to the fact that the back transport of particles from the membrane surface is negligible since the number of particles in a water treatment process is quite small for reference our membrane module had a channel width of 20 mm a length of 20 mm and a depth of 1 5 mm accordingly the crossflow rate of 1 3 1 5 l min 1 was translated into a crossflow velocity of 72 2 83 3 cm s 1 which falls between the widely used crossflow velocities 10 400 cm s 1 for microfiltration choi et al 2015 ho and sung 2009 laorko et al 2011 zhao et al 2002 prior to collecting a permeate solution a membrane was compacted for 30 min by circulating the feed solution at the given pressure and crossflow rate singh and purkait 2019 after the 30 min compaction 30 and 100 ml of permeate solutions were collected to measure the water flux of the 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively some of the permeate solutions were used to examine their turbidities with a turbidimeter orion aq4500 thermo scientific usa the turbidities of the initial feed solutions were 9 74 0 06 and 5 34 0 10 ntu for 3 and 8 µm bead solutions with concentrations of 10 and 60 ppm respectively however the turbidity was not detected n d in all the permeate solutions for that reason it was too hard to directly confirm the particle removal rate based on the permeate solution s turbidity instead we tried to assume the removal rate by dividing the number of particles in a permeate solution by the number of particles in a feed solution to utilize the newly designed method we needed to estimate the number of particles in the feed and permeate solutions with high accuracy as for counting the number of particles in a permeate solution first after the dead end filtration of a permeate solution using a 0 1 μm mce filter with a 47 mm diameter fig 2 b the number of particles in a permeate solution was extrapolated by taking the fesem images of the particles deposited on the filter surface and manually counting the number of particles deposited on the filter surface since it was impossible to go over the entire area of the filter s surface containing the permeate solution s particles we tried to compensate for the limitation by getting as many sem images as possible and thereby infer a more accurate removal rate in detail three specimens were taken from one filter containing the permeate solution s particles at three arbitrary locations after that we obtained 49 sem images on average at 600 magnification from one filter note that 600 magnification was chosen to manually count 3 and 8 μm beads in that the magnification is appropriate to find the presence of the two kinds of beads simultaneously while allowing us to cover a larger area within the observable range in our experience 49 sem images are translated into around 1 20 10 2 cm2 which corresponds to about 0 1 of the effective filter area 12 56 cm2 used for the dead end filtration in this way a particle counting method was repeated five and three times for 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively which was equally applied to five types of membranes as a result 1201 and 759 sem images were acquired for 3 and 8 µm bead samples respectively they were used to infer the number of particles in a permeate solution and the resulting removal rate the number of particles in a permeate solution was calculated based on the following relationship 2 n p n p a e a s n s where np is the estimated total number of particles in a permeate solution np is the counted number of particles observed using the sem images of the filter specimens ae is the effective area cm2 of the filter used for the dead end filtration of a permeate solution as is the area cm2 of an sem image and ns is the total number of the sem images obtained from one filter the estimation of the number of particles in the as prepared feed solution started from the point of investigating the particle size distribution of the feed solutions to calculate the number of particles based on the density size and volume fractions varying depending on the size the first eye catching point was that the commercial bead solutions had a wider particle size distribution than expected as shown in fig 3 this result implies that one does not have to calculate the number of particles based only on the mean particle size and density recklessly but should try to individually estimate the number of particles by reflecting the volume percentages varying in particle size given this point we tried to calculate the number of individual particles with different sizes upon consideration of the intrinsic density 1 05 g cm 3 the measured particle size and the measured volume percentage of each size of the particle the number of particles in a feed solution can be estimated by the following relationship 3 n f lower limit upper limit m p φ ip 418 9 r ip 3 ρ where nf is the estimated number of particles with different sizes in a feed solution mp is the mass g of total particles in a feed solution φi p is the measured volume fraction of individual particles in a feed solution ri p is the measured radius of individual particles in a feed solution and ρ is the density of ps lastly the particle removal rate r was evaluated using the np and nf based on the following relationship 4 r 1 n p n f 100 2 4 ndom mf test with a 0 8 µm membrane under the conditions including real world factors such as low temperature 10 c and doms to test the feasibility of an ndom mf process under various temperature conditions we assessed the water flux and removal rate of the mf membrane selected as an optimal candidate at a low temperature all the experimental conditions were the same as those used in the mf test a room temperature except for temperature and membrane type the temperature and type of membrane were 6 10 c and a 0 8 µm membrane respectively to estimate the removal rate a permeate solution was collected for a certain period of time and filtered again via dead end filtration using a 0 1 μm filter after depositing the particles in a permeate solution on a 0 1 μm filter the filter containing the filtered particles was thoroughly dried and used to get the sem images to carry out a particle counting method 335 sem images were obtained and used for a particle counting method the number of spotted particles was used to estimate the removal rate lastly a 10 ppm dye mb solution was used to prepare the mixture consisting of mb and ps beads and determine how doms influence the performance of microfiltration of 3 and 8 µm bead solutions the microfiltration test to clarify the influence of doms was performed under the same experimental condition as described above apart from the type of the feed solution and membrane i e only 0 8 µm membrane was used the removal rate was calculated by the analysis through the particle counting method using 270 sem images 2 5 experimental apparatus for uvc led applications the output power of uvc leds seoul optodevice co korea fig 4 was 156 mw the uvc led in a housing diameter of 9 mm was much smaller than a commercial 4 w uvc low pressure mercury lamp philips co usa which was 136 mm in length and 16 mm in diameter rectangular leds of 0 73 mm 0 78 mm were placed at the center of the housing to provide an effective irradiation angle of 120 either a mercury lamp or a set of two uvc leds was placed at the top of a cylindrical tube which is 10 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height this collimated column guided a parallel uv irradiation to the sample placed under the column the emission spectrum of the uvc led and uv lamp was measured using a spectrapro 500 acton research co usa the uv light intensity was measured using a uvx radiometer uvp co usa equipped with a uvc uva detector cho et al 2006 2 6 culture and analysis of microorganisms for uvc led applications b subtilis e coli and ms2 bacteriophage were supplied by the american type culture collection atcc usa suspensions of b subtilis spores atcc 6633 were cultured and analyzed as reported previously nakayama et al 1996 except for a couple of minor changes such as utilizing a 1 10 diluted nutrient agar and taking a longer incubation period of 5 to 7 days cho et al 2003 in detail we aseptically rehydrated a freeze dried pellet of b subtilis with a nutrient broth difco co usa and incubated it at 37 c for 18 h after repeating centrifugations at 3 500 g for 10 min and resuspending in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 150 mm at ph 7 2 two times the bacterial cells were inoculated into sterile petri dishes containing 1 10 diluted nutrient agar 0 8 g l 1 difco nutrient broth and 15 g l 1 agar difco co usa and incubated at 37 c for 5 to 7 days to induce sporulation after incubation we rinsed the agar containing b subtilis spores using pbs and harvested the spores into 50 ml conical tubes then to rinse the harvested spores the spores were subjected to centrifugation at 3 500 g for 10 min and resuspension with pbs repeatedly three times after the rinsing procedure the recovery of spores reached over 99 the recovered spores were used to prepare a stock solution and the stock solution was used after the heating process at 80 c for 20 min to guarantee the inactivation of any remaining vegetative cells ahead of each experiment the procedures to prepare and enumerate e coli atcc 8739 were based on kleyn and bicknell kleyn and bicknell 2004 a lyophilized pellet of e coli was aseptically rehydrated in 50 ml of tryptic soy broth difco co usa and cultured at 37 c for 18 h then we harvested bacterial cells from the broth by repeating centrifugation at 1 000 g for 10 min and resuspension in 50 ml of pbs the stock suspension of e coli was prepared by resuspending the final pellets into a 50 ml conical tube containing 40 ml pbs the number of viable b subtilis spores and e coli cells was estimated by a spread plate method based on the standard method standard method 1992 a nutrient agar containing 8 g l 1 of nutrient broth and 15 g l 1 of agar was spread with 0 1 ml of sample after incubation at 37 c for 24 h the number of colonies was counted lastly the soft agar overlay method using a mutant strain of e coli c3000 as a host debartolomeis and cabelli 1991 was employed to prepare and quantify ms2 bacteriophages atcc 15 597 e coli c3000 was cultured in media consisting of 0 8 w v nutrient broth and 0 5 nacl the media for the plaque assays was composed of 1 3 tryptone 1 0 glucose 0 8 nacl 1 0 cacl2 2h2o and 1 0 mgso4 also 1 5 and 0 7 agar were included in the media of the bottom and top agars used for the plaque assays respectively after inoculating phage into the e coli and incubating it overnight at 37 c the ms2 bacteriophages were collected by suspending the overlay soft agar in 10 ml pbs and obtaining supernatant after centrifugation for 15 min at 3 000 g to prepare a stock solution for ms2 bacteriophage viability assay triplicate the sample was diluted up to 100 times and grown on an e coli host lawn i e in a double agar layer and the plaque forming unit pfu was enumerated after overnight incubation at 37 c 2 7 disinfection using uvc leds all the experimental solutions were prepared using milli q water millipore co usa and analytical or reagent grade chemicals all the glassware was used after being thoroughly cleaned with milli q water and autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min experiments were performed in triplicate and all the assay results were within a 90 confidence interval disinfection experiments in the liquid phase were performed using surrogates such as b subtilis spores e coli and ms2 phage following the procedure by usepa usepa 2006 the above three kinds of microorganisms were selected as surrogates for giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts for the following reasons first e coli and ms2 phage have often been used as surrogates in uv disinfection because they are much less sensitive to uv disinfection than giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts linden et al 2002 sigmon et al 2015 usepa 2003 accordingly if a certain uv disinfection condition successfully inactivated e coli and ms2 phage it indicates that the disinfection condition should be effective in inactivating giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts which are more susceptible to uv disinfection it is also the case for b subtilis spores which is more tolerant to uv disinfection than giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts hijnen et al 2006 apart from tolerance to uv b subtilis spores have also been used as a surrogate of the aerobic spore for cryptosporidium oocysts jung et al 2008 muhammad et al 2008 based on the above rationales the above three microorganisms were used as conservative surrogates to address the high dose challenge imposed by giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts 2 8 statistical analysis the student s t test using prism 6 version 6 04 graphpad was carried out to determine the statistically significant differences in the viscosities of a 3 μm or 8 μm bead solution and the mixture consisting of 3 μm or 8 μm bead solution and 10 ppm mb solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the removal rate of five commercial mf membranes tables 1 and 2 show the number of individual particles changing with the particles sizes and volume fractions for 3 and 8 μm bead samples respectively these trends support that commercial ps bead solutions have a very large particle size distribution as shown in fig 3 in particular a 3 μm bead sample was confirmed to have a considerably prominent standard deviation 1 38 μm given its mean particle size 2 48 μm which is evident from the comparison with an 8 μm bead sample with a mean particle size of 8 36 μm and standard deviation of 1 96 μm as a result the particles smaller than 30 i e 0 766 μm of the mean particle size accounted for almost half i e 47 1 of the total number of particles in a 3 μm bead sample even though their volume fraction was only about 5 6 of the total volume of the particles accordingly it is desirable not to involve the number of particles ranging from 0 445 to 0 766 μm in the denominator used to calculate the removal rate for the purpose of preventing the removal rate from being overestimated due to the number of particles away from the mean particle size this condition associated with the particle size taken into consideration for calculating the removal rate was applied to all types of membranes for a fair comparison on the other hand as shown in table 2 the minimum particle size of an 8 μm bead sample was 3 905 μm which is easily discernible at the given magnification e g 600 by means of fesem in other words all sizes of the particles involved in an 8 μm bead solution should be detected by the suggested particle counting method with no problem more importantly the number of 3 905 μm beads which were the smallest particles in an 8 μm bead solution corresponded only to 1 35 of the number of total beads in a stock solution this is an important point because the fact reveals an 8 μm bead solution is much freer from the overestimation issue caused by too small particles thus all the particles in an 8 μm bead solution were included in counting the number of particles regardless of particle size as shown in table 3 the mf test and analysis in accordance with the suggested particle counting method represented that all types of mf membranes achieved more than 3 and 4 log reductions of 3 and 8 µm beads respectively fig 5 a and b this excellent selectivity was also revealed in the contrast between the appearances of the particles deposited on the membrane surface after mf tests fig 5 c and d and the particles in a permeate solution fig 5 e and f as for the removal rate for 8 µm beads it was not difficult to predict all the mf membranes would successfully separate ps beads because even the smallest particles 3 905 µm in an 8 µm bead solution were larger than the measured mean pore size 2 03 µm of a 5 µm mf membrane unlike 8 µm beads it was intriguing that 3 µm beads also did not cause statistically significant differences in the removal rate fig 5 a this unexpected result is attributable to the bubble point and the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes when it comes to the bubble point s influence on the removal rate obtained using 3 μm beads as shown in fig 6 a the bubble points of all the membranes were larger than the smallest bead size 0 877 μm among the particle sizes taken into consideration when calculating the removal rate indeed even a 0 45 μm membrane also showed a larger bubble point 0 92 μm than 0 877 μm this fact signifies that all the membranes were likely to allow particle passage due to their bubble points larger than some of the particles in a 3 μm bead solution also given that smaller particles typically take up a higher proportion in the number the small particles passage is considered significant in a 0 45 μm membrane on the other hand the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes is also considered to contribute to making the removal rates similar to one another in the mf test using 3 μm beads in detail the removal rates of 3 and 5 μm membranes were expected to be low because their nominal mean pore sizes were known to be similar to or larger than 3 μm beads however both membranes revealed much smaller mean pore sizes in the pore size distribution analysis using a cfp 1 74 and 2 0 for 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively fig 6 b more importantly even the bubble points of the two membranes were smaller than or similar to 3 μm 2 6 and 3 0 for 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively fig 6 a which means that most of the pores of the two membranes were smaller than 3 μm beads as such 3 and 5 μm membranes were thought to have no statistically significant difference in the removal rate due to the discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes overall all the membranes tested in this study showed potential for removing particles similar to giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts in size regardless of the pore size 3 2 correlation between the water flux and pore size of five commercial mf membranes fig 7 presents the permeate water flux of five commercial mf membranes obtained from the mf test using pure water 3 and 8 μm bead solutions as expected the permeate water flux obtained from the mf test using pure water was the highest regardless of the types of membranes because the mf using pure water is free from membrane fouling caused by particle deposition as for the comparison between the water flux obtained from the mf test using 3 and 8 μm bead solutions the mf test using an 8 μm bead solution exhibited higher water fluxes than a 3 μm bead solution on the whole this phenomenon arises from the number and size of 8 μm beads to be specific based on the number of particles in each feed solution used in the mf test an 8 μm bead solution was assumed to have 1 069 108 beads table 3 which is around 38 times fewer than the number of 3 μm beads excluding the particles smaller than 0 877 μm accordingly an 8 μm bead solution was even more favorable for antifouling filtration thanks to the fewer particles than a 3 μm bead solution leading to higher water fluxes regardless of types of membranes meanwhile large particles are also more beneficial than smaller particles from the perspective of membrane fouling control on the condition that most of the particles are larger than the pore size of the membrane trzaskus et al 2016 in this regard it also makes sense that an 8 μm bead solution caused less fouling and thereby induced higher water flux as compared to a 3 μm bead solution even more intriguingly than comparing the water fluxes based on the type of feed solutions we spotted a very distinctive trend in the water flux as a function of the nominal mean pore size in general the water flux positively correlates with the pore size based on hagen poiseuille s law as follows hosseini et al 2018 5 j ε d 2 32 μ l δ p where ε is the overall porosity d is the pore diameter μ is the liquid viscosity l is the membrane thickness and p is the tmp according to hagen poiseuille s law since the water flux is proportional to the square of the pore diameter the water flux of five commercial mf membranes was supposed to increase more sharply as the pore size increased however the increasing rate of the water flux dropped beyond 1 μm mean pore size and this phenomenon consistently appeared regardless of the type of feed solutions as a result the water flux increased by only 5 30 in the range of nominal mean pore size from 1 to 5 μm in stark contrast to the water flux enhancement 1 7 2 6 times observed in the nominal mean pore size range from 0 45 to 1 μm fig 7 to clarify the root cause of the unexpected water flux behavior we thoroughly examined the pore size distribution of five commercial mf membranes using a cfp according to the pore size distribution data fig 8 all the membranes were found to possess a remarkably narrow pore size distribution overall more importantly the trend of mean pore size was very similar to that of water flux regardless of the type of feed solutions fig 6 b which was also the case for the bubble point fig 6 a this result suggests that the membrane pore size dictated the water flux in this study which makes sense considering that there were no significant differences e g thickness and overall porosity see more details in table s1 in the membrane characteristics associated with the intrinsic water permeability except for the pore size hydrophilicity was excluded from consideration because five commercial mf membranes consisted of the same material i e mce in the first place finally and most importantly we spotted a noticeable discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes in detail the mean pore sizes of 3 and 5 μm membranes were measured at 1 74 0 08 and 2 0 0 2 μm respectively fig 6 b these measured mean pore sizes corresponded to 58 and 40 of the nominal mean pore sizes of 3 and 5 μm membranes respectively demonstrating a great deal of difference between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes from the particle size distribution analysis to verify why the water flux behaved very differently from the nominal mean pore size beyond 1 μm we could draw a conclusion that it boils down to the apparent discrepancy between the nominal and measured mean pore sizes 3 3 ndom mf test with a 0 8 µm membrane under the conditions including real world factors such as low temperature 10 c and doms if the ndom mf is feasible at low temperatures we could successfully utilize the hybrid system consisting of the ndom mf and uvc led processes in real water treatment now that a uvc led process s disinfection ability is known to be relatively independent of temperature changes green et al 2018 as an effort to test the feasibility of the ndom mf under variable temperature conditions we carried out the mf test with a 0 8 μm membrane at a low temperature ranging from 6 to 10 c considering that the control of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts becomes more difficult at a low temperature for the mf test at low temperature a 0 8 μm membrane was chosen as an optimum candidate in that it solely met the requirements in terms of the water flux particle removal and rationale for the absolute retention as follows as for the water flux and particle removal a 0 8 μm membrane showed a comparable removal rate to a 0 45 μm membrane while it had a 1 5 2 5 times higher water flux than a 0 45 μm membrane finally and most importantly only a 0 8 μm membrane was highly likely to give promise of the absolute retention of the particles larger than 3 μm which covers the size range of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts only a 0 8 μm membrane s mean pore size 1 28 μm was about 3 times smaller than 4 μm namely the smallest size among cryptosporidium oocysts fig 6 b fitting the absolute retention s criterion namely that the particle size should be 2 to 3 times of the pore size at least lee and liu 1994 with these in mind a 0 8 μm membrane was selected as the best candidate to guarantee absolute retention as shown in fig 9 a the permeate water fluxes were consistently evaluated lower at a low temperature than at room temperature regardless of the type of feed solutions this phenomenon can be understood in relation to the water s viscosity varying with temperature abdullah et al 2020 apmann et al 2021 in other words the water s viscosity was presumed to increase due to the temperature drop which was accompanied by the increase in the filtration resistance ending up with a significant flux decline fig 9 a although the water flux was reduced with the temperature decrease the water flux of a 0 8 μm membrane was found to still possess similar to or 1 6 2 times higher than that of a 0 45 μm membrane at room temperature accordingly it is not too much to say that a 0 8 μm membrane has the potential for low temperature mf only if it also keeps a comparable removal rate even at a low temperature in this regard it is worth noting that the particle removal rate of a 0 8 μm membrane was kept at a similar level regardless of the temperature change when comparing the mf test using the same kind of feed solution fig 9 b overall the ndom mf using a 0 8 μm membrane is expected to be workable even in variable temperature conditions while achieving high water flux and comparable removal rate of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts independent of temperature changes lastly in reality giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts are likely to be found along with doms in water accordingly we also need to cope with the situation where we have to handle the mixture consisting of protozoa and doms given that we conducted the filtration test using a 0 8 μm membrane and the mixture consisting of the two types of polystyrene beads and 10 ppm mb which is one of the dissolved organic matters to test the feasibility of the ndom mf under the condition including another real world factor according to the filtration of the mixture the permeate flux was slightly reduced by 10 to 20 as mb was added to the mixture fig 9 c this phenomenon is thought to arise from the increased viscosities of mixtures fig 9 d by the interaction between mb and polystyrene beads resulting in higher filtration resistance however the mb addition did not cause significant differences in the removal rate fig 9 e which was understandable upon consideration of the too small molecular size of mb 1 42 0 62 0 16 nm3 ma et al 2012 to influence the behavior of beads 3 and 8 μm from these results we could conclude that the ndom mf using a 0 8 μm membrane is feasible to remove protozoa regardless of the existence of doms 3 4 water disinfection using uvc leds according to the ndom mf using 3 and 8 μm bead solutions it already achieved a 3 4 log reduction thus if uvc led came behind the ndom mf process and used the permeate solution released from the ndom mf process uvc led would have only a slim chance of detecting the inactivation of protozoa by uvc led due to very scarce cysts oocysts for that reason it was almost impossible to experimentally test the feasibility of a serial hybrid system consisting of the ndom mf and uvc led processes to overcome the practical limitation imposed by the high dose challenge of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts in a serial hybrid system we tried to independently conduct a comparison study between the disinfection of surrogate microorganisms by uvc led and germicidal uv lamp also we tried to indirectly weigh up the possibility of using a serial hybrid system to further improve the quality of treated water fig 10 shows the kinetics of e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage inactivation in the aqueous phase by uvc led and mercury uv lamp these experiments were performed at three different light intensities for each light source i e by adjusting the distance between the light source and the sample these data were plotted versus it the product of the light intensity i in mw cm 2 and exposure time t in s and the following pseudo first order kinetics usepa 2006 was used to analyze the data as follows 6 l o g n n 0 k i t where n is the concentration of viable microorganisms at time t cfu ml 1 or pfu ml 1 n 0 is the initial concentration of viable microorganisms cfu ml 1 or pfu ml 1 and k is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj 1 the linear portion of the data i e all the data points for e coli and ms2 phage and data points after it 10 mj cm 2 for b subtilis spores followed the above kinetics with relatively high correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 several features in fig 10 are noteworthy first all three indicator microorganisms were rapidly inactivated using the uvc led for example when 0 14 mw cm 2 of light intensity was applied which corresponds to two led lamps positioned 2 cm from the sample in a reactor 2 log 99 inactivation was achieved by 0 48 2 86 and 4 29 min exposure for e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage respectively second the inactivation kinetics obtained with uvc led was nearly identical to those obtained with mercury uv lamp this phenomenon was expected in the first place since the spectrum of the light emitted by uvc led was very similar to that by mercury uv lamp as shown in fig 11 therefore one could save time and effort to develop independent kinetics using uvc leds by referring to the information regarding inactivation kinetics of various microorganisms by low pressure mercury uv lamps usepa 2006 in particular the it values set forth by the regulations which had been determined using mercury uv lamps were consistent with the it values obtained herein with uvc led for example it values required to achieve 2 log inactivation of e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage by uvc led were 4 24 and 36 mj cm 2 respectively which were within the ranges reported in the literature i e 3 0 to 6 2 23 to 50 and 30 to 60 mj cm 2 for e coli b subtilis spore and ms2 phage respectively determined by mercury uv lamps as such uvc leds were verified to be as effective as a germicidal uv lamp from the perspective of disinfection capability while it does not cause the weaknesses stemming from a conventional mercury uv lamp and chlorine notably since uvc led effectively inactivated the above three types of microorganisms more tolerant to uv than protozoa it is also expected to successfully inactivate giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts as well then if we provide uvc led to further treat the permeate obtained from ndom mf it is technically possible to achieve a 6 7 log reduction i e 3 4 log reduction by ndom mf and another 3 log reduction by uvc led 3 5 implication of a serial hybrid system consisting of ndom mf and uvc led disinfection the results of this study suggest that uvc led is a promising alternative to conventional mercury vapor fluorescent uv lamps as well as other led devices such as uva led while providing the same disinfection rate in the liquid phase the uvc led provides several advantages over conventional mercury uv lamps the uvc led is much more energy efficient as it emits nearly monochromatic light at a germicidal wavelength with minimal energy loss as heat combined with the fact that the lifetime is nearly permanent the uvc led has great potential to be useful as a disinfection device in remote environments such as developing countries where energy supply and continuous maintenance are often challenging since the uvc led is very small and requires direct current that can be easily supplied by batteries or solar cells without additional circuits it might be useful as a portable device lastly considering the design flexibility due to its small size and the fact that it does not employ mercury vapor which may pose a threat its environmentally friendly applications in small or narrow spaces could also be very promising all things considered uvc leds could provide various kinds of strengths if we combine a range of merits of uvc led with ndom mf we could expect the synergistic effect of coupling the ndom mf with uvc led to guarantee the high quality of treated water with high process efficiency 4 conclusion in this study we proposed membrane filtration using an mf membrane with an optimum mean pore size larger than but close to dissolved organic matters doms which is called near dom mf ndom mf to efficiently remove giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts a 0 8 µm membrane was chosen as an optimum candidate for efficient ndom mf and used for the performance comparison with a 0 45 µm mf membrane which is a conventional membrane widely used to remove giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts according to the mf test using polystyrene surrogate beads with diameters of 3 and 8 µm the ndom mf using a 0 8 µm membrane showed 52 to 146 higher water fluxes than a 0 45 µm mf membrane while maintaining the removal rate at 3 4 log which was also the case for a low temperature mf test to further guarantee the high quality of treated water with high process efficiency ndom mf can be coupled with uvc led thanks to various kinds of strengths stemming from uvc led such as the disinfection efficiency as high as a conventional mercury

14976,bioleaching is considered an alternative to traditional rare earth extraction technology however since rare earth elements exist as complexes in bioleaching lixivium they cannot be directly precipitated by normal precipitants which restricts their further development this structurally stable complex is also a common challenge in various types of industrial wastewater treatment in this work a new method called a three step precipitation process is first proposed to efficiently recover rare earth citrate re cit complexes from bio leaching lixivium it consists of coordinate bond activation carboxylation by ph adjustment structure transformation ca2 addition and carbonate precipitation soluble co3 2 addition the optimization conditions are determined to adjust the lixivium ph to around 2 0 then add calcium carbonate until the n ca2 n cit3 is more than 1 4 1 and lastly add sodium carbonate until n co3 2 n re3 is more than 4 1 the results of precipitation experiments using imitated lixivium show that the rare earth yield is more than 96 and the impurity aluminum yield is less than 20 subsequently pilot tests 1000 l using real lixivium were successfully conducted the precipitation mechanism is briefly discussed and proposed by thermogravimetric analysis fourier infrared spectroscopy raman spectroscopy and uv spectroscopy this technology is promising in the industrial application of rare earth bio hydrometallurgy and wastewater treatment due to its advantages of high efficiency low cost environmental friendliness and simple operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract schematic flowchart of the three step precipitation route to recover re cit complex from bio leaching lixivium and pilot test result keywords rare earth recovery coordination compounds precipitation bioleaching data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rare earth elements rees are indispensable for the manufacturing of modern electronics and sustainable energy technologies muller and friedrich 2006 nkinahamira et al 2020 the demand of ree resources is continuously increasing recently schmitz et al 2021 economically exploitable ree resources mainly include monazite bastnaesite xenotime ion adsorption rare earth ore jordens et al 2013 and solid wastes smelting slag electronic waste spent catalyst etc jyothi et al 2020 traditional methods for the extraction of rees involve harsh chemicals high temperature and high pressures thus resulting in environmental damage and high economic cost binnemans et al 2013 jha et al 2016 especially the environmental damage caused by these traditional chemical processes is a huge challenge in the rare earth industry bioleaching biohydrometallurgy has been considered as an alternative to traditional chemical processes mainly due to its environmental and economic advantages jyothi et al 2020 it involves direct bioleaching contact bioleaching and indirect bioleaching noncontact bioleaching vera et al 2013 in the bio leaching process rees are mainly extracted through the complexation of metabolites like organic acids species hopfe et al 2018 citric acid and its salt cit species are typical metabolite that can leach rees effectively from rees containing solid by complexation reactions meng et al 2022 shi et al 2022 wang et al 2017 in our previous works rees were effectively leached from ion adsorption rare earth ore in bioleaching processes by microbial metabolites cit species meng et al 2022 shen et al 2023 shi et al 2022 however rees exist as a rare earth citrate re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium and are not able to be recovered by traditional precipitant ammonium bicarbonate su et al 2019 the reason may be that the physical and chemical properties of the complexes are different from those of free rees obtained by traditional chemical leaching therefore although the rare earth bioleaching method shows advantages and application potential the recovery of rare earths from bioleaching lixivium is a bottleneck and challenge that restricts its further development and industrial application in addition such metal organic complexes are also widespread in wastewater generated from industrial activities such as electroplating tanning dyeing mining and metallurgy wastewater lu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 metal ions can complex with ubiquitous substances such as citrate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta tartrate and natural organic matter to form stable metal organic complexes with varying toxicity adusei gyamfi et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 these metal organic complexes are more threatening because their mobility is usually much higher than that of the corresponding metal ions arshad et al 2020 many technologies have been investigated to treat these metal organic complexes such as electrolysis fenton like oxidation membrane separation adsorption and precipitation gylienė et al 2004 kołodyńska and hubicki 2008 xu et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 although these methods show effective performance they still have various obstacles in practical application mainly due to the disadvantages of high economic cost high energy consumption high requirements of facilities and operating conditions zhu et al 2019 therefore the development of a new method that can precipitate such metal organic complexes from solution directly and inexpensively is of great significance in this work a new route called three step precipitation process was firstly proposed to recover rees from the re cit complexes the parameters of each step were optimized using imitated lixivium in the laboratory then a pilot test 1000 l was conducted using real lixivium the precipitation mechanism was briefly discussed by thermogravimetric analysis tg raman spectroscopy fourier infrared spectroscopy ft ir and uv spectroscopy in this work an effective approach for the recovery of rare earth complexes was investigated in a rare earth bio leaching system and it would also provide new ideas for the treatment of metal organic complexes in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in the laboratory experiment imitated lixivium containing 3 g l re cit complexes was first prepared as the raw material on the one hand the preparation of the imitated lixivium determines the properties of the re cit complexes and on the other hand the concentration of the re cit complexes in the real lixivium is unstable which is not conducive to determining the optimal conditions subsequently the results were verified in the pilot test via real lixivium the contents of the main elements in the imitated and real lixivium are shown in table 1 and table 2 all the reagents used in the laboratory experiments were of analytical grade while the reagents used in the pilot test were of industrial grade 2 2 procedure 2 2 1 preparation of imitated and real lixivium the imitated lixivium was prepared by mixing the rare earth nitrate and ammonium citrate solutions with a certain molar ratio several rees la nd er sm and y with high concentrations in the real leaching solution were selected to prepare the imitated lixivium and the classification of light heavy rare earth elements lree hree was also considered the real lixivium used in the pilot test was generated from heap bio leaching of ion adsorption rare earth ore the ore was mixed evenly and transferred to the heap leaching tank according to the set weight 1 t the leaching agent mainly citrate was prepared via biological fermentation and purification which was reported in our previous work meng et al 2022 shen et al 2023 shi et al 2022 the heap bio leaching was conducted under suitable conditions leaching agent concentration 50 mmol l liquid solid ratio 2 1 ph 5 6 and ambient temperature the prepared leaching agent was injected into the heap tank in batches maintaining that the liquid level completely submerged the ore the lixivium containing rare earth complex was permeated and collected through the reserved pipes at the bottom of the heap 2 2 2 preparation of re cit complexes precipitate the imitated experiments were conducted in a 1 l beaker containing 500 ml lixivium fig 1 shows the new precipitation route including three steps step 1 sulfuric acid h2so4 was used to adjust the lixivium to different ph values 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 step 2 different calcium sources calcium carbonate calcium chloride and calcium oxide and dosages n ca2 n cit3 0 8 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 6 1 were added to the lixivium step 3 different dosages of ammonium bicarbonate sodium carbonate sodium bicarbonate and sodium hydroxide were added to the solution n re3 n co3 2 oh 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 6 1 8 to obtain the re cit complexes precipitate the content of rees in lixivium before and after precipitation was analyzed and the rare earth yield was calculated according to eq 1 1 e v 1 c f v f c b v b 100 where e v is the extent of rare earth yield cb and cf are the concentrations of rare earth in the liquor before and after the precipitation experiment g l respectively the terms v b and vf are volumes of the liquor before and after the precipitation experiment l respectively 2 3 analysis method icp oes icap 7400 thermo fisher scientific co was used to measure the contents of rees in the imitated lixivium real lixivium and residual liquid thermogravimetric analysis of the re cit complexes precipitate and normal rare earth carbonate was performed using a differential thermal analyzer sta8000 perkinelmer with a heating rate of 10 min in flowing air and the samples were washed with alcohol and dried in a vacuum dryer for 24 h at 40 c before this test the solid samples re cit complexes precipitate and normal rare earth carbonate were analyzed and compared by fourier infrared spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific co at room temperature raman spectroscopy renishaw was used to analyze and compare ammonium citrate aq the re cit complexes aq laboratory synthesis the intermediate product aq obtained from step 2 and the final precipitate s meanwhile uv spectroscopy uv 3600i plus shimadzu was used to analyze the first three samples the morphology of the re cit complexes precipitate was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6490lv jeol and the samples were treated by metal spraying to increase their conductivity before this test 3 results and discussion 3 1 the different precipitation behaviors of the re cit complexes and free rees citrate and ammonium sulfate were used to leach ion adsorption rare earth ore to obtain lixivium containing the re cit complexes and free rees respectively fig 2 shows the results of direct precipitation of these two lixiviums using ammonium bicarbonate it was found that ammonium bicarbonate can directly precipitate free rees but aluminum al as an impurity was coprecipitated so an impurity removal step was needed however ammonium bicarbonate did not precipitate the re al cit complexes leached by citrate a possible explanation was the chemical property discrepancy of the free rees and re cit complexes and the chemical properties of the latter were more stable with respect to the re cit complexes the unoccupied orbitals of rare earth ions are occupied by the electrons in citrate and thus become unavailable to directly interact with carbonate 3 2 the properties of the re cit complexes the molar ratio of the soluble re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium was investigated by preparing imitated lixivium it was found that the solubility of the re cit complexes was significantly different when n re3 n cit3 was different as shown in fig 3 it can be clearly observed that the state of the re cit complexes changed from insoluble to soluble when n re3 n cit3 shifted from 1 1 to 1 2 when n re3 n cit3 was 1 1 only 14 of the re cit complexes existed in the solution and 86 of the re cit complexes were present in precipitates however all of the re cit complexes were converted to the soluble state when n re3 n cit3 was 1 2 several investigations have reported that the complex of some organic compounds that are known to react with metal ions are water soluble complex anions chen et al 2012 deng et al 2007 therefore the re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium was a soluble complex that formed with two molecules of cit3 and one molecule of rare earth ions 3 3 carboxylation of the re cit complexes the first step in the precipitation route of the re cit complexes was to adjust the initial ph of the imitated lixivium the principle of introducing h was to competitive coordination with rees which reduced the stability of the re cit complexes and activated the coordination bonds namely carboxylation meanwhile an acidic environment was the prerequisite for the subsequent ca2 addition and the structural transformation of the re cit complexes in this section the influence of the initial ph value on the precipitation process was investigated from fig 4 it can be found that the rare earth yield increased with the decrease in the initial ph value of the imitated lixivium and when the ph value was reduced to 2 0 the yield reached 99 the possible explanation for this phenomenon was that the ph of citric acid was approximately 2 2 and the competitive coordination capacity of hydrogen ions was stronger than that of rees when the initial ph was reduced to below 2 2 the effect of carboxylation was enhanced and the breaking of the coordination bond between rees and carboxyl groups was more thorough this was conducive to the subsequent structural transformation and precipitation step and the yield of rees was higher which refer to the diagram of speculative reaction mechanism however the effect of carboxylation decreased with increasing ph value which caused a drop in rare earths yield sulfuric acid and nitric acid were used to adjust the ph and the effect was similar considering the economy sulfuric acid was more suitable therefore it was considered that the optimal initial ph value of the imitated lixivium was 2 0 in addition the initial ph affected the endpoint ph of the carbonate precipitation the lower the initial ph of the imitated lixivium was the less carbonate precipitant was used 3 4 structural transformation of the re cit complexes the second step of the precipitation route was to introduce calcium ions ca2 which were the core of the route in this section the effects of using different calcium sources calcium carbonate calcium oxide and calcium chloride and their dosages on the rare earth yield were investigated it is worth mentioning that to determine the optimal conditions in this step excessive reagents were used in the next carbonate precipitation stage to exclude the interference of insufficient precipitant as shown in fig 5 the re cit complexes can be recovered by carbonate precipitation after structural transformation by introducing calcium ions the three calcium sources can react with the carboxylated re cit complexes but a difference appeared in the loss of rees caused by this process in addition the amount of calcium ions introduced also affected the final rare earth yield and the loss of rees the curve in fig 5 shows the ph of the imitated lixivium when different amounts of calcium ions were introduced among the three calcium sources when calcium oxide cao and calcium chloride cacl3 were used approximately 15 20 of the rees were lost fig 5 b c in contrast calcium carbonate caco3 was the suitable choice which controlled the loss of rees less than 3 the possible reason was considered that the dissolution of caco3 was related to the lixivium ph which resulted in sustained release fig 5 a shows that the final rare earth yield increased with increasing n ca2 n cit3 when n ca2 n cit3 was more than 1 4 1 the rare earth yield reached 99 at which point the ph value of imitated lixivium was 4 5 fig s1 shows the tendency of loss of a single rare earth element during this step and it can be found that lree were more easily lost than hree organic acids such as citric acid and oxalic acid can react with metals to form bidentate tridentate dinuclear or polymeric species it has been found that fe iii u vi citrate and fe carboxyl ni ternary complexes can be formed in some reaction systems and they have special chemical properties dodge and francis 2003 flynn and catalano 2017 calcium carbonate easily reacts with citric acid to form a calcium citrate complex which is the dominant method to purify and extract citrate from fermentation broth ye et al 2022 the principle of introducing calcium ions was that they reacted with the carboxylated re cit complexes to form a ternary intermediate product resulting in the reconstruction of the coordination bond 3 5 carbonate precipitation based on the optimization parameters determined in the first two steps the final step that recovered the transformed re cit complexes by carbonate precipitation and hydroxide precipitation was investigated in this section sodium bicarbonate na2co3 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 were used in the carbonate precipitation process and sodium hydroxide naoh was used to achieve hydroxide precipitation as shown in fig 6 the rare earth yield could reach 99 by carbonate precipitation but the yield of hydroxide precipitation was unsatisfactory less than 10 even at a higher dosage of precipitant the possible reason was that compared with hydroxide oh carbonate co3 2 more easily reacted with the intermediate product and its product was more stable among the three carbonate precipitants na2co3 performed better than nahco3 and nh4hco3 and the yield reached 96 when n re3 n co3 2 was 1 4 when nahco3 and nh4hco3 were used as precipitants n re3 n co3 2 needed to reach 1 8 to precipitate rare earths completely the possible explanation was that hco3 2 first ionizes to co3 2 in addition the ph of lixivium rose faster when na2co3 was used as a precipitant which was favorable for precipitation fig s2 shows the single rare earth element precipitation behavior using different concentrations and types of precipitants lree precipitated more easily than hree 3 6 pilot tests on the basis of the imitated lixivium results real lixivium was used to carry out pilot tests and the scale was 1 2 t the layout of the pilot test site is shown in fig 7 a it was infeasible to add reagent according to the stoichiometric ratio as in the imitated experiments because the composition of the real lixivium was complex and its concentration was unstable therefore the dosage reagent added in the pilot tests referred to the optimal ph of the three steps in the imitated experimental results as shown in fig 7b when the lixivium ph decreased from 2 5 to 2 0 in step 1 the rare earth yield increased obviously however a further reduction in lixivium ph to 1 5 had a limited effect the possible explanation was that the ph of citric acid was 2 2 and the competition between h and rare earth for coordination became violent when the ph value of lixivium was below this value in step 2 the rare earth yield stabilized when the lixivium ph was adjusted to 4 0 using caco3 the further addition of caco3 did not improve the yield and introduced excess ca2 which was adverse for precipitation in step 3 it can be observed that the rare earth yield increased with increasing lixivium ph the ideal rare earth yield 95 was obtained when na2co3 was added until the ph of the lixivium rose to 8 5 in summary the optimal conditions were that the ph of real lixivium initially decreased to 2 0 followed by adding caco3 into the lixivium to increase the ph to 4 0 finally na2co3 was used to adjust the ph to more than 8 5 under the optimal conditions the yield of rare earth was more than 95 meanwhile the new route expressed selective precipitation while the yield of impurity al was less than 20 in addition another advantage of the new precipitation route was found in the pilot test because of the special properties of the re cit complexes the fine particles in clay ores agglomerated on the complex surface and were carried to the lixivium the real lixivium contained many suspended particles and it was difficult to settle by standing as shown in fig 1 however these suspended particles can be removed in step 2 by standing which may be due to the change in surface properties caused by the structural transformation from the re cit complexes to the intermediate product 3 7 analytical results of re cit complexes precipitation 3 7 1 thermal decomposition behavior fig 8 shows the tg dtg curves of the re cit complexes precipitate fig 8 a and the common rare earth carbonate fig 8 b in the temperature range of 30 900 the two samples were tested by using an atmosphere of air 79 n2 21 o2 and a heating rate of 10 min it can be found that there were some differences in the thermal decomposition behavior between the two samples first in the range of 90 250 the two samples exhibited a mass loss which was related to the evaporation of crystal water yu et al 2020 in this region the mass loss of the re cit complexes precipitate was 8 99 but that of rare earth carbonate was 13 67 indicating that the water content of the former was lower however different thermal decomposition behaviors occurred in the following ranges as shown in fig 8 b a continuous and obvious mass loss 22 6 occurred at 350 700 which was connected with the decarbonation process and then rare earth oxides eventually formed sastry et al 1966 however for the re cit complexes precipitate fig 8 a a mass loss 7 51 appeared at 350 400 which was attributed to the decomposition process of organic matter citrate contained in the precipitate subsequently it decomposed to rare earth oxides at 500 750 and the greatest mass loss occurred in this region which was considered a delay in the decarbonization process through thermogravimetric analysis it can be inferred that the re cit complexes precipitate contained citrate during the whole precipitation process rare earth ions and citrate did not dissociate completely but were transferred to the precipitate together 3 7 2 ft ir spectrum results fig 9 shows the infrared absorption spectrum of the re cit complexes precipitate and common rare earth carbonate the peaks at 3394 86 cm 1 fig 9 1 and 3381 28 cm 1 fig 9 2 were assigned to the stretching vibration of oh the bands centered at 1380 1500 cm 1 840 860 cm 1 and 1063 cm 1 fig 9 were assigned to c o zhu et al 2021 there is a peak at 1072 46 cm 1 in fig 9 2 but it breaks up to 1078 5 and 1134 19 cm 1 in fig 9 1 showing that there may be different types of stretching vibrations in the re cit complexes precipitate in addition it was observed that the c o and oh stretching vibrations increased from 844 8 cm 1 1 to 858 3 cm 1 2 1072 cm 1 1 to 1078 cm 1 2 1387 8 cm 1 1 to 1408 cm 1 2 1476 5 cm 1 1 to 1497 7 cm 1 2 and 3381 2 cm 1 1 to 3394 8 cm 1 2 this indicated that there were interactions between the carboxyl groups and re in the re cit complexes precipitate 3 7 3 raman spectrum results to monitor the reaction stages raman spectroscopy was used to explore the possible precipitation mechanism the spectra of ammonium citrate the re cit complexes the intermediate product obtained from step 2 and the final precipitate were analyzed and compared as shown in fig 10 the samples used in the analysis were synthesized by analytical reagents in the laboratory lanthanum fig 10a and yttrium fig 10b were selected as representatives of lree and hree to form complexes with citrate respectively then the differences in precipitation of lree and hree complexes were investigated the lanthanum citrate la cit and yttrium citrate y cit complexes were prepared by mixing 0 1 mol l ammonium citrate solution with lanthanum nitrate and yttrium nitrate at a certain molar ratio la y cit 1 2 subsequently the intermediate product and the final precipitate used for analysis were prepared under the corresponding optimal conditions evidence for the formation of the re cit complexes and intermediate product can be observed in fig 10 this figure shows the spectra of 1 ammonium citrate aq 2 lanthanum citrate la cit yttrium citrate y cit complex aq 3 intermediate product aq and 4 final precipitate s first some common peaks appeared in all the samples the peak at 3167 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh stretching vibration the peak at 2932 cm 1 was attributed to the nh stretching vibration of ammonium the two peaks at 1629 cm 1 and 1433 cm 1 were the carbonyl vibration peaks of carboxyl bickley et al 1991 next two new peaks at 473 cm 1 and 1046 cm 1 were observed in 2 compared with 1 according to previous reports the peaks of titanium citrate ti cit in the regions of 551 cm 1 and 635 cm 1 are attributed to ti o bonds the peak at 1074 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibration ν co between the central carbon and hydroxyl groups that complex with titanium dakanali et al 2003 zampieri et al 2006 the peak located at 538 cm 1 in the spectrum of nickel citrate ni cit is attributed to ni o stretching mitre et al 2000 therefore it was considered that the peak at 473 cm 1 was assigned to the re o stretching vibration and that the peak at 1046 cm 1 was related to the co stretching between hydroxyl groups coordinated with rare earth and central carbon then compared with spectrum 2 another new peak appeared at 981 cm 1 in spectrum 3 indicating that a new complex bond formed studies have demonstrated that organic acids such as citric acid and oxalic acid can form fe iii u vi citrate and fe carboxyl ni ternary complex dodge and francis 2003 flynn and catalano 2017 therefore it was considered that the intermediate product may be a re cit ca ternary complex in addition the reaction of lree and hree complexes in the precipitation was consistent however the peak attributed to the re o stretching vibration in fig 10 a at 473 cm 1 was more obvious than that in 10 b indicating that the complex formed by lree and citrate was more stable uv spectroscopy was also used to analyze 1 ammonium citrate aq 2 lanthanum citrate la cit complex aq and 3 intermediate product aq as shown in fig s3 an obvious absorption peak appeared at 310 nm in samples 2 and 3 but it was not observed in sample 1 indicating that the rees complexes formed meanwhile the intensity of the absorption peak in sample 3 was higher than that in sample 2 indicating that complexation was enhanced which may be related to the formation of new complexation bonds combined with the results of the tg curve ft ir spectrum raman spectrum and uv spectrum a possible precipitation mechanism for the new route was proposed as shown in fig 11 in bio leaching lixivium rees mainly exist in the form of coordination compounds with complex and stable structures mainly including re cit 2 3 and re hcit 2 the unoccupied orbitals of rees are occupied by electrons in citrate ligands and thus become unavailable to directly interact with normal carbonate precipitants to form precipitates in the new precipitation route the carboxylation step ph adjustment activated or broke the partial coordinate bonds of the re cit complexes the coordination compounds transformed from re cit 2 3 re hcit 2 to re hcit re h2cit 2 then calcium ions were introduced to undergo a coordination reaction with oxygen on the carboxyl group and transform the complex to a ternary complex re cit 2ca3 3 re cit ca 2 in this ternary complex rees and calcium ions have free valence electrons which are in an unsaturated state and can react with the soluble carbonate to form a precipitate re cit 2ca3 2 co3 3 re cit ca co3 the settling performance of the re cit complexes precipitate was excellent fig s4 and solid liquid separation was easy to achieve which is crucial for industrial applications fig s5 shows the sem topography of the re cit complexes precipitate the precipitate particles were clear and uniform and had good crystal formation in addition eds mapping analysis of the re cit complexes precipitate was performed at randomly selected locations the eds maps for the elements la nd sm er and y are given in fig s5 the figure indicates that rees were evenly distributed in the precipitate with no apparent localization 4 conclusion in this work a new precipitation route called the three step precipitation process was first proposed to efficiently recover the re cit complexes from bio leaching lixivium this technology promoted the development of rare earth bio hydrometallurgy and was promising in industrial applications due to its advantages of high efficiency low cost environmental friendliness and simple operation in addition it provided new thoughts for the treatment of metal complex containing wastewater the three step precipitation process was composed of 1st coordinate bond activation carboxylation by ph adjustment 2nd structure transformation and 3rd carbonate precipitation a simulated precipitation experiment was conducted using imitated lixivium in the laboratory to determine the suitable type and dosage of reagent the optimal conditions were determined to adjust the lixivium ph to 2 0 in step 1 then add calcium carbonate until n ca2 n cit3 was more than 1 4 1 in step 2 and last add sodium carbonate until n co3 2 n re3 was more than 4 1 in step 3 the rare earth yield was more than 96 and the impurity aluminum recovery was less than 20 subsequently pilot tests 1000 l using real lixivium were successfully conducted a possible precipitation mechanism was briefly discussed in bio leaching lixivium rees mainly exist in the form of coordination compounds with complex and stable structures mainly including re cit 2 3 and re hcit 2 they cannot be directly precipitated by normal precipitants of carbonate and alkali because no bonding sites exist between rees and precipitants during the three step precipitation process carboxylation ph adjustment activated the partial coordinate bond of the re cit complexes in the 1st step calcium ions were introduced to convert the re cit complexes to a ternary complex in the 2nd step and soluble carbonate was added to bond with the reactive sites of rare earth and or calcium elements in the ternary complex to form precipitates in addition intermolecular reactions and cluster interactions may also be involved in the precipitation process which needs to be further investigated

14976,bioleaching is considered an alternative to traditional rare earth extraction technology however since rare earth elements exist as complexes in bioleaching lixivium they cannot be directly precipitated by normal precipitants which restricts their further development this structurally stable complex is also a common challenge in various types of industrial wastewater treatment in this work a new method called a three step precipitation process is first proposed to efficiently recover rare earth citrate re cit complexes from bio leaching lixivium it consists of coordinate bond activation carboxylation by ph adjustment structure transformation ca2 addition and carbonate precipitation soluble co3 2 addition the optimization conditions are determined to adjust the lixivium ph to around 2 0 then add calcium carbonate until the n ca2 n cit3 is more than 1 4 1 and lastly add sodium carbonate until n co3 2 n re3 is more than 4 1 the results of precipitation experiments using imitated lixivium show that the rare earth yield is more than 96 and the impurity aluminum yield is less than 20 subsequently pilot tests 1000 l using real lixivium were successfully conducted the precipitation mechanism is briefly discussed and proposed by thermogravimetric analysis fourier infrared spectroscopy raman spectroscopy and uv spectroscopy this technology is promising in the industrial application of rare earth bio hydrometallurgy and wastewater treatment due to its advantages of high efficiency low cost environmental friendliness and simple operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract schematic flowchart of the three step precipitation route to recover re cit complex from bio leaching lixivium and pilot test result keywords rare earth recovery coordination compounds precipitation bioleaching data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rare earth elements rees are indispensable for the manufacturing of modern electronics and sustainable energy technologies muller and friedrich 2006 nkinahamira et al 2020 the demand of ree resources is continuously increasing recently schmitz et al 2021 economically exploitable ree resources mainly include monazite bastnaesite xenotime ion adsorption rare earth ore jordens et al 2013 and solid wastes smelting slag electronic waste spent catalyst etc jyothi et al 2020 traditional methods for the extraction of rees involve harsh chemicals high temperature and high pressures thus resulting in environmental damage and high economic cost binnemans et al 2013 jha et al 2016 especially the environmental damage caused by these traditional chemical processes is a huge challenge in the rare earth industry bioleaching biohydrometallurgy has been considered as an alternative to traditional chemical processes mainly due to its environmental and economic advantages jyothi et al 2020 it involves direct bioleaching contact bioleaching and indirect bioleaching noncontact bioleaching vera et al 2013 in the bio leaching process rees are mainly extracted through the complexation of metabolites like organic acids species hopfe et al 2018 citric acid and its salt cit species are typical metabolite that can leach rees effectively from rees containing solid by complexation reactions meng et al 2022 shi et al 2022 wang et al 2017 in our previous works rees were effectively leached from ion adsorption rare earth ore in bioleaching processes by microbial metabolites cit species meng et al 2022 shen et al 2023 shi et al 2022 however rees exist as a rare earth citrate re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium and are not able to be recovered by traditional precipitant ammonium bicarbonate su et al 2019 the reason may be that the physical and chemical properties of the complexes are different from those of free rees obtained by traditional chemical leaching therefore although the rare earth bioleaching method shows advantages and application potential the recovery of rare earths from bioleaching lixivium is a bottleneck and challenge that restricts its further development and industrial application in addition such metal organic complexes are also widespread in wastewater generated from industrial activities such as electroplating tanning dyeing mining and metallurgy wastewater lu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 metal ions can complex with ubiquitous substances such as citrate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta tartrate and natural organic matter to form stable metal organic complexes with varying toxicity adusei gyamfi et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 these metal organic complexes are more threatening because their mobility is usually much higher than that of the corresponding metal ions arshad et al 2020 many technologies have been investigated to treat these metal organic complexes such as electrolysis fenton like oxidation membrane separation adsorption and precipitation gylienė et al 2004 kołodyńska and hubicki 2008 xu et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 although these methods show effective performance they still have various obstacles in practical application mainly due to the disadvantages of high economic cost high energy consumption high requirements of facilities and operating conditions zhu et al 2019 therefore the development of a new method that can precipitate such metal organic complexes from solution directly and inexpensively is of great significance in this work a new route called three step precipitation process was firstly proposed to recover rees from the re cit complexes the parameters of each step were optimized using imitated lixivium in the laboratory then a pilot test 1000 l was conducted using real lixivium the precipitation mechanism was briefly discussed by thermogravimetric analysis tg raman spectroscopy fourier infrared spectroscopy ft ir and uv spectroscopy in this work an effective approach for the recovery of rare earth complexes was investigated in a rare earth bio leaching system and it would also provide new ideas for the treatment of metal organic complexes in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in the laboratory experiment imitated lixivium containing 3 g l re cit complexes was first prepared as the raw material on the one hand the preparation of the imitated lixivium determines the properties of the re cit complexes and on the other hand the concentration of the re cit complexes in the real lixivium is unstable which is not conducive to determining the optimal conditions subsequently the results were verified in the pilot test via real lixivium the contents of the main elements in the imitated and real lixivium are shown in table 1 and table 2 all the reagents used in the laboratory experiments were of analytical grade while the reagents used in the pilot test were of industrial grade 2 2 procedure 2 2 1 preparation of imitated and real lixivium the imitated lixivium was prepared by mixing the rare earth nitrate and ammonium citrate solutions with a certain molar ratio several rees la nd er sm and y with high concentrations in the real leaching solution were selected to prepare the imitated lixivium and the classification of light heavy rare earth elements lree hree was also considered the real lixivium used in the pilot test was generated from heap bio leaching of ion adsorption rare earth ore the ore was mixed evenly and transferred to the heap leaching tank according to the set weight 1 t the leaching agent mainly citrate was prepared via biological fermentation and purification which was reported in our previous work meng et al 2022 shen et al 2023 shi et al 2022 the heap bio leaching was conducted under suitable conditions leaching agent concentration 50 mmol l liquid solid ratio 2 1 ph 5 6 and ambient temperature the prepared leaching agent was injected into the heap tank in batches maintaining that the liquid level completely submerged the ore the lixivium containing rare earth complex was permeated and collected through the reserved pipes at the bottom of the heap 2 2 2 preparation of re cit complexes precipitate the imitated experiments were conducted in a 1 l beaker containing 500 ml lixivium fig 1 shows the new precipitation route including three steps step 1 sulfuric acid h2so4 was used to adjust the lixivium to different ph values 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 step 2 different calcium sources calcium carbonate calcium chloride and calcium oxide and dosages n ca2 n cit3 0 8 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 6 1 were added to the lixivium step 3 different dosages of ammonium bicarbonate sodium carbonate sodium bicarbonate and sodium hydroxide were added to the solution n re3 n co3 2 oh 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 6 1 8 to obtain the re cit complexes precipitate the content of rees in lixivium before and after precipitation was analyzed and the rare earth yield was calculated according to eq 1 1 e v 1 c f v f c b v b 100 where e v is the extent of rare earth yield cb and cf are the concentrations of rare earth in the liquor before and after the precipitation experiment g l respectively the terms v b and vf are volumes of the liquor before and after the precipitation experiment l respectively 2 3 analysis method icp oes icap 7400 thermo fisher scientific co was used to measure the contents of rees in the imitated lixivium real lixivium and residual liquid thermogravimetric analysis of the re cit complexes precipitate and normal rare earth carbonate was performed using a differential thermal analyzer sta8000 perkinelmer with a heating rate of 10 min in flowing air and the samples were washed with alcohol and dried in a vacuum dryer for 24 h at 40 c before this test the solid samples re cit complexes precipitate and normal rare earth carbonate were analyzed and compared by fourier infrared spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific co at room temperature raman spectroscopy renishaw was used to analyze and compare ammonium citrate aq the re cit complexes aq laboratory synthesis the intermediate product aq obtained from step 2 and the final precipitate s meanwhile uv spectroscopy uv 3600i plus shimadzu was used to analyze the first three samples the morphology of the re cit complexes precipitate was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6490lv jeol and the samples were treated by metal spraying to increase their conductivity before this test 3 results and discussion 3 1 the different precipitation behaviors of the re cit complexes and free rees citrate and ammonium sulfate were used to leach ion adsorption rare earth ore to obtain lixivium containing the re cit complexes and free rees respectively fig 2 shows the results of direct precipitation of these two lixiviums using ammonium bicarbonate it was found that ammonium bicarbonate can directly precipitate free rees but aluminum al as an impurity was coprecipitated so an impurity removal step was needed however ammonium bicarbonate did not precipitate the re al cit complexes leached by citrate a possible explanation was the chemical property discrepancy of the free rees and re cit complexes and the chemical properties of the latter were more stable with respect to the re cit complexes the unoccupied orbitals of rare earth ions are occupied by the electrons in citrate and thus become unavailable to directly interact with carbonate 3 2 the properties of the re cit complexes the molar ratio of the soluble re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium was investigated by preparing imitated lixivium it was found that the solubility of the re cit complexes was significantly different when n re3 n cit3 was different as shown in fig 3 it can be clearly observed that the state of the re cit complexes changed from insoluble to soluble when n re3 n cit3 shifted from 1 1 to 1 2 when n re3 n cit3 was 1 1 only 14 of the re cit complexes existed in the solution and 86 of the re cit complexes were present in precipitates however all of the re cit complexes were converted to the soluble state when n re3 n cit3 was 1 2 several investigations have reported that the complex of some organic compounds that are known to react with metal ions are water soluble complex anions chen et al 2012 deng et al 2007 therefore the re cit complexes in bio leaching lixivium was a soluble complex that formed with two molecules of cit3 and one molecule of rare earth ions 3 3 carboxylation of the re cit complexes the first step in the precipitation route of the re cit complexes was to adjust the initial ph of the imitated lixivium the principle of introducing h was to competitive coordination with rees which reduced the stability of the re cit complexes and activated the coordination bonds namely carboxylation meanwhile an acidic environment was the prerequisite for the subsequent ca2 addition and the structural transformation of the re cit complexes in this section the influence of the initial ph value on the precipitation process was investigated from fig 4 it can be found that the rare earth yield increased with the decrease in the initial ph value of the imitated lixivium and when the ph value was reduced to 2 0 the yield reached 99 the possible explanation for this phenomenon was that the ph of citric acid was approximately 2 2 and the competitive coordination capacity of hydrogen ions was stronger than that of rees when the initial ph was reduced to below 2 2 the effect of carboxylation was enhanced and the breaking of the coordination bond between rees and carboxyl groups was more thorough this was conducive to the subsequent structural transformation and precipitation step and the yield of rees was higher which refer to the diagram of speculative reaction mechanism however the effect of carboxylation decreased with increasing ph value which caused a drop in rare earths yield sulfuric acid and nitric acid were used to adjust the ph and the effect was similar considering the economy sulfuric acid was more suitable therefore it was considered that the optimal initial ph value of the imitated lixivium was 2 0 in addition the initial ph affected the endpoint ph of the carbonate precipitation the lower the initial ph of the imitated lixivium was the less carbonate precipitant was used 3 4 structural transformation of the re cit complexes the second step of the precipitation route was to introduce calcium ions ca2 which were the core of the route in this section the effects of using different calcium sources calcium carbonate calcium oxide and calcium chloride and their dosages on the rare earth yield were investigated it is worth mentioning that to determine the optimal conditions in this step excessive reagents were used in the next carbonate precipitation stage to exclude the interference of insufficient precipitant as shown in fig 5 the re cit complexes can be recovered by carbonate precipitation after structural transformation by introducing calcium ions the three calcium sources can react with the carboxylated re cit complexes but a difference appeared in the loss of rees caused by this process in addition the amount of calcium ions introduced also affected the final rare earth yield and the loss of rees the curve in fig 5 shows the ph of the imitated lixivium when different amounts of calcium ions were introduced among the three calcium sources when calcium oxide cao and calcium chloride cacl3 were used approximately 15 20 of the rees were lost fig 5 b c in contrast calcium carbonate caco3 was the suitable choice which controlled the loss of rees less than 3 the possible reason was considered that the dissolution of caco3 was related to the lixivium ph which resulted in sustained release fig 5 a shows that the final rare earth yield increased with increasing n ca2 n cit3 when n ca2 n cit3 was more than 1 4 1 the rare earth yield reached 99 at which point the ph value of imitated lixivium was 4 5 fig s1 shows the tendency of loss of a single rare earth element during this step and it can be found that lree were more easily lost than hree organic acids such as citric acid and oxalic acid can react with metals to form bidentate tridentate dinuclear or polymeric species it has been found that fe iii u vi citrate and fe carboxyl ni ternary complexes can be formed in some reaction systems and they have special chemical properties dodge and francis 2003 flynn and catalano 2017 calcium carbonate easily reacts with citric acid to form a calcium citrate complex which is the dominant method to purify and extract citrate from fermentation broth ye et al 2022 the principle of introducing calcium ions was that they reacted with the carboxylated re cit complexes to form a ternary intermediate product resulting in the reconstruction of the coordination bond 3 5 carbonate precipitation based on the optimization parameters determined in the first two steps the final step that recovered the transformed re cit complexes by carbonate precipitation and hydroxide precipitation was investigated in this section sodium bicarbonate na2co3 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 were used in the carbonate precipitation process and sodium hydroxide naoh was used to achieve hydroxide precipitation as shown in fig 6 the rare earth yield could reach 99 by carbonate precipitation but the yield of hydroxide precipitation was unsatisfactory less than 10 even at a higher dosage of precipitant the possible reason was that compared with hydroxide oh carbonate co3 2 more easily reacted with the intermediate product and its product was more stable among the three carbonate precipitants na2co3 performed better than nahco3 and nh4hco3 and the yield reached 96 when n re3 n co3 2 was 1 4 when nahco3 and nh4hco3 were used as precipitants n re3 n co3 2 needed to reach 1 8 to precipitate rare earths completely the possible explanation was that hco3 2 first ionizes to co3 2 in addition the ph of lixivium rose faster when na2co3 was used as a precipitant which was favorable for precipitation fig s2 shows the single rare earth element precipitation behavior using different concentrations and types of precipitants lree precipitated more easily than hree 3 6 pilot tests on the basis of the imitated lixivium results real lixivium was used to carry out pilot tests and the scale was 1 2 t the layout of the pilot test site is shown in fig 7 a it was infeasible to add reagent according to the stoichiometric ratio as in the imitated experiments because the composition of the real lixivium was complex and its concentration was unstable therefore the dosage reagent added in the pilot tests referred to the optimal ph of the three steps in the imitated experimental results as shown in fig 7b when the lixivium ph decreased from 2 5 to 2 0 in step 1 the rare earth yield increased obviously however a further reduction in lixivium ph to 1 5 had a limited effect the possible explanation was that the ph of citric acid was 2 2 and the competition between h and rare earth for coordination became violent when the ph value of lixivium was below this value in step 2 the rare earth yield stabilized when the lixivium ph was adjusted to 4 0 using caco3 the further addition of caco3 did not improve the yield and introduced excess ca2 which was adverse for precipitation in step 3 it can be observed that the rare earth yield increased with increasing lixivium ph the ideal rare earth yield 95 was obtained when na2co3 was added until the ph of the lixivium rose to 8 5 in summary the optimal conditions were that the ph of real lixivium initially decreased to 2 0 followed by adding caco3 into the lixivium to increase the ph to 4 0 finally na2co3 was used to adjust the ph to more than 8 5 under the optimal conditions the yield of rare earth was more than 95 meanwhile the new route expressed selective precipitation while the yield of impurity al was less than 20 in addition another advantage of the new precipitation route was found in the pilot test because of the special properties of the re cit complexes the fine particles in clay ores agglomerated on the complex surface and were carried to the lixivium the real lixivium contained many suspended particles and it was difficult to settle by standing as shown in fig 1 however these suspended particles can be removed in step 2 by standing which may be due to the change in surface properties caused by the structural transformation from the re cit complexes to the intermediate product 3 7 analytical results of re cit complexes precipitation 3 7 1 thermal decomposition behavior fig 8 shows the tg dtg curves of the re cit complexes precipitate fig 8 a and the common rare earth carbonate fig 8 b in the temperature range of 30 900 the two samples were tested by using an atmosphere of air 79 n2 21 o2 and a heating rate of 10 min it can be found that there were some differences in the thermal decomposition behavior between the two samples first in the range of 90 250 the two samples exhibited a mass loss which was related to the evaporation of crystal water yu et al 2020 in this region the mass loss of the re cit complexes precipitate was 8 99 but that of rare earth carbonate was 13 67 indicating that the water content of the former was lower however different thermal decomposition behaviors occurred in the following ranges as shown in fig 8 b a continuous and obvious mass loss 22 6 occurred at 350 700 which was connected with the decarbonation process and then rare earth oxides eventually formed sastry et al 1966 however for the re cit complexes precipitate fig 8 a a mass loss 7 51 appeared at 350 400 which was attributed to the decomposition process of organic matter citrate contained in the precipitate subsequently it decomposed to rare earth oxides at 500 750 and the greatest mass loss occurred in this region which was considered a delay in the decarbonization process through thermogravimetric analysis it can be inferred that the re cit complexes precipitate contained citrate during the whole precipitation process rare earth ions and citrate did not dissociate completely but were transferred to the precipitate together 3 7 2 ft ir spectrum results fig 9 shows the infrared absorption spectrum of the re cit complexes precipitate and common rare earth carbonate the peaks at 3394 86 cm 1 fig 9 1 and 3381 28 cm 1 fig 9 2 were assigned to the stretching vibration of oh the bands centered at 1380 1500 cm 1 840 860 cm 1 and 1063 cm 1 fig 9 were assigned to c o zhu et al 2021 there is a peak at 1072 46 cm 1 in fig 9 2 but it breaks up to 1078 5 and 1134 19 cm 1 in fig 9 1 showing that there may be different types of stretching vibrations in the re cit complexes precipitate in addition it was observed that the c o and oh stretching vibrations increased from 844 8 cm 1 1 to 858 3 cm 1 2 1072 cm 1 1 to 1078 cm 1 2 1387 8 cm 1 1 to 1408 cm 1 2 1476 5 cm 1 1 to 1497 7 cm 1 2 and 3381 2 cm 1 1 to 3394 8 cm 1 2 this indicated that there were interactions between the carboxyl groups and re in the re cit complexes precipitate 3 7 3 raman spectrum results to monitor the reaction stages raman spectroscopy was used to explore the possible precipitation mechanism the spectra of ammonium citrate the re cit complexes the intermediate product obtained from step 2 and the final precipitate were analyzed and compared as shown in fig 10 the samples used in the analysis were synthesized by analytical reagents in the laboratory lanthanum fig 10a and yttrium fig 10b were selected as representatives of lree and hree to form complexes with citrate respectively then the differences in precipitation of lree and hree complexes were investigated the lanthanum citrate la cit and yttrium citrate y cit complexes were prepared by mixing 0 1 mol l ammonium citrate solution with lanthanum nitrate and yttrium nitrate at a certain molar ratio la y cit 1 2 subsequently the intermediate product and the final precipitate used for analysis were prepared under the corresponding optimal conditions evidence for the formation of the re cit complexes and intermediate product can be observed in fig 10 this figure shows the spectra of 1 ammonium citrate aq 2 lanthanum citrate la cit yttrium citrate y cit complex aq 3 intermediate product aq and 4 final precipitate s first some common peaks appeared in all the samples the peak at 3167 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh stretching vibration the peak at 2932 cm 1 was attributed to the nh stretching vibration of ammonium the two peaks at 1629 cm 1 and 1433 cm 1 were the carbonyl vibration peaks of carboxyl bickley et al 1991 next two new peaks at 473 cm 1 and 1046 cm 1 were observed in 2 compared with 1 according to previous reports the peaks of titanium citrate ti cit in the regions of 551 cm 1 and 635 cm 1 are attributed to ti o bonds the peak at 1074 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibration ν co between the central carbon and hydroxyl groups that complex with titanium dakanali et al 2003 zampieri et al 2006 the peak located at 538 cm 1 in the spectrum of nickel citrate ni cit is attributed to ni o stretching mitre et al 2000 therefore it was considered that the peak at 473 cm 1 was assigned to the re o stretching vibration and that the peak at 1046 cm 1 was related to the co stretching between hydroxyl groups coordinated with rare earth and central carbon then compared with spectrum 2 another new peak appeared at 981 cm 1 in spectrum 3 indicating that a new complex bond formed studies have demonstrated that organic acids such as citric acid and oxalic acid can form fe iii u vi citrate and fe carboxyl ni ternary complex dodge and francis 2003 flynn and catalano 2017 therefore it was considered that the intermediate product may be a re cit ca ternary complex in addition the reaction of lree and hree complexes in the precipitation was consistent however the peak attributed to the re o stretching vibration in fig 10 a at 473 cm 1 was more obvious than that in 10 b indicating that the complex formed by lree and citrate was more stable uv spectroscopy was also used to analyze 1 ammonium citrate aq 2 lanthanum citrate la cit complex aq and 3 intermediate product aq as shown in fig s3 an obvious absorption peak appeared at 310 nm in samples 2 and 3 but it was not observed in sample 1 indicating that the rees complexes formed meanwhile the intensity of the absorption peak in sample 3 was higher than that in sample 2 indicating that complexation was enhanced which may be related to the formation of new complexation bonds combined with the results of the tg curve ft ir spectrum raman spectrum and uv spectrum a possible precipitation mechanism for the new route was proposed as shown in fig 11 in bio leaching lixivium rees mainly exist in the form of coordination compounds with complex and stable structures mainly including re cit 2 3 and re hcit 2 the unoccupied orbitals of rees are occupied by electrons in citrate ligands and thus become unavailable to directly interact with normal carbonate precipitants to form precipitates in the new precipitation route the carboxylation step ph adjustment activated or broke the partial coordinate bonds of the re cit complexes the coordination compounds transformed from re cit 2 3 re hcit 2 to re hcit re h2cit 2 then calcium ions were introduced to undergo a coordination reaction with oxygen on the carboxyl group and transform the complex to a ternary complex re cit 2ca3 3 re cit ca 2 in this ternary complex rees and calcium ions have free valence electrons which are in an unsaturated state and can react with the soluble carbonate to form a precipitate re cit 2ca3 2 co3 3 re cit ca co3 the settling performance of the re cit complexes precipitate was excellent fig s4 and solid liquid separation was easy to achieve which is crucial for industrial applications fig s5 shows the sem topography of the re cit complexes precipitate the precipitate particles were clear and uniform and had good crystal formation in addition eds mapping analysis of the re cit complexes precipitate was performed at randomly selected locations the eds maps for the elements la nd sm er and y are given in fig s5 the figure indicates that rees were evenly distributed in the precipitate with no apparent localization 4 conclusion in this work a new precipitation route called the three step precipitation process was first proposed to efficiently recover the re cit complexes from bio leaching lixivium this technology promoted the development of rare earth bio hydrometallurgy and was promising in industrial applications due to its advantages of high efficiency low cost environmental friendliness and simple operation in addition it provided new thoughts for the treatment of metal complex containing wastewater the three step precipitation process was composed of 1st coordinate bond activation carboxylation by ph adjustment 2nd structure transformation and 3rd carbonate precipitation a simulated precipitation experiment was conducted using imitated lixivium in the laboratory to determine the suitable type and dosage of reagent the optimal conditions were determined to adjust the lixivium ph to 2 0 in step 1 then add calcium carbonate until n ca2 n cit3 was more than 1 4 1 in step 2 and last add sodium carbonate until n co3 2 n re3 was more than 4 1 in step 3 the rare earth yield was more than 96 and the impurity aluminum recovery was less than 20 subsequently pilot tests 1000 l using real lixivium were successfully conducted a possible precipitation mechanism was briefly discussed in bio leaching lixivium rees mainly exist in the form of coordination compounds with complex and stable structures mainly including re cit 2 3 and re hcit 2 they cannot be directly precipitated by normal precipitants of carbonate and alkali because no bonding sites exist between rees and precipitants during the three step precipitation process carboxylation ph adjustment activated the partial coordinate bond of the re cit complexes in the 1st step calcium ions were introduced to convert the re cit complexes to a ternary complex in the 2nd step and soluble carbonate was added to bond with the reactive sites of rare earth and or calcium elements in the ternary complex to form precipitates in addition intermolecular reactions and cluster interactions may also be involved in the precipitation process which needs to be further investigated

capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi served as optimized objectives high medium and low built up regions in wuhan urban development planning district were extracted by topographic factors and landscape patterns which comprised 28 34 and 38 of the case area respectively three corresponding hydrological models were then built to illustrate distinct runoff control cost efficiency in each region pressure distributions on runoff control economic constraints and ecological resource scarcity were quantitatively evaluated and four pressure zones were clustered which occupied 36 29 16 and 19 of the case area respectively then the zonal weighted optimization decision making matrix with 3 hydrological models and 5 wt was established by overlaying the pressure zone and built up zone in high medium and low built up regions optimized solutions reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 and 77 the average runoff investments per square meter of impervious underlying surface in high medium and low built up regions were 34 2 18 7 and 7 9 rmb yuan respectively medium and low built up regions may only need 55 and 23 of the high built up region for the unitary impervious underlying surface to balance runoff control and ecological benefits runoff control and financial utilization efficiency enhance with hydrological differentiation zones thus the

crucial strategy for balancing urban development restrictions with residual water storage and purifying capacity alves et al 2019 balasbaneh et al 2019 both green and gray infrastructure are practical runoff control tools bakhshipour et al 2019 dong et al 2017 gao et al 2022 green infrastructures have been proven to improve air quality reduce the heat island effect choi et al 2021 save energy reduce carbon emissions gao et al 2022 and improve habitat comfort liu et al 2021a gray infrastructure regulates runoff efficiently allows for rapid drainage and has a defined life cycle dong et al 2017 manuel navarrete et al 2019 the combined multi functional green and gray infrastructure system extends runoff control to efficient municipal investment and ecosystem upkeep bakhshipour et al 2019 veerkamp et al 2021 however because green and gray infrastructures have different lifespans structures and functions present effectiveness assessments often target solely green or gray runoff control systems scolaro and ghisi 2022 veerkamp et al 2021 and traditional management s interest in runoff control function and capital investment has prompted extensive research a three dimensional synergistic evaluation of runoff control function capital investment and ecological impacts is challenging to quantify emerging research demonstrates that integrated green and gray infrastructure runoff control systems provide good trade offs between runoff control function cost and ecological advantages alves et al 2020 jia et al 2022 however optimization of scale configuration of green and gray coupled systems is still lacking a multi functional quantitative green gray coupled evaluation system is also not deployed to schematic design site specific maximizes the multifunctional benefits of green and gray infrastructures she et al 2021 xing et al 2016 this notion is illustrated by the need to tailor runoff control strategies to local hydrological conditions bin et al 2018 regional topography features and landscape patterns are the hydrological factors of runoff yield and confluence krimsky et al 2021 maxwell et al 2021 which drive variances in runoff control cost effectiveness to achieve efficacy runoff control solutions must be replicable within zones with homogeneous hydrological features davis and birch 2009 sun et al 2016 previously runoff control replication zones defined by the managers subjective opinions have led to ineffective or wasteful solutions the site specific concept demonstrates that runoff control planning should respond to the city s environmental economic and ecological pressures jia et al 2022 green and gray infrastructures have multiple functions and restrictions the efficient allocation of infrastructures necessitates substituting traditional single sector planning with multi sectoral collaborative planning urban water management is vital because stormwater endangers human settlements and economic progress maragno et al 2018 szeląg et al 2022 while pollution from point and non point sources harms aquatic environments persaud et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however inadequate financial assistance space limits and aging infrastructure all limit the application of runoff management measures increasing the demands on cost effectiveness jia et al 2022 significant spatially heterogeneous ecological pressures result from the spatial mismatch between the availability of ecological resources and the scope of human and economic demand stormwater control requirements economic concerns and ecological resource pressures are all intertwined resulting in divergent geographical demands on green and gray infrastructures ando et al 2020 ureta et al 2021 thus a regionally diversified desire for infrastructure multifunctionality can be used to assess weights for multi objective optimization however present weights setting is either based on managers subjective preferences or use information entropy to assign high weights to indicators with high variability neither of which can adapt the multiple efficiencies of green and gray infrastructure to regional pressure regulation requirements as to the runoff control scheme design existing practices often apply the enumerative scenario method alves et al 2020 dai et al 2021 wang et al 2022 this method cannot handle the green gray coupled infrastructure optimization of many independent variables parameters partitions weights and objectives it is hard to adapt manually established configuration schemes to regional pressures it is also challenged to maximize green and gray infrastructure multi function geographically therefore critical components of multi objective optimization such as quantifying green and gray infrastructure parameters spatially dividing hydrological characteristics and pressure adaptive weight assignment must be thoroughly examined in this study remote sensing inversion of water quality hydrological model simulation using swat and swmm software landscape pattern index calculation life cycle cost lcc and life cycle assessment lca on ecological impact and nsga ii optimization algorithm are applied ① as for quantifying infrastructure performances the revolutionary integration of green and gray infrastructures multi function into a unified evaluation system allows for three dimensional optimization of runoff control function cost and ecological impact ② to maintain stable cost effectiveness of runoff control homogeneous hydrological character areas were recognized by topography and landscape features swmm was established within each hydrological zone as a pilot the optimized runoff control solution could be replicated within the corresponding zone ③ to avoid subjective empirical weighting failures when optimization objectives become numerous this study innovatively quantifies development pressures as weights of infrastructure s multifunctional indexes thereby enabling adaptive optimization ④ a zonal multi objective adaptive green gray coupled optimization framework was developed the framework nests a multi functional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructure it also establishes distinct hydrological models within hydrological subdivisions for optimization and identifies pressure adaptive multi objective weighting assignments thus the optimization solutions under multiple scenarios are zonal adaptive refined comparable replicable and implementable 2 method and data 2 1 study area the case area is wuhan hubei province china fig 1 wuhan has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1269 mm the extent of wuhan urban development planning region covers an area of approximately 2358 km2 water bodies permeable underlying including paddy fields dry land forests grassland and bare ground and impermeable underlying including pavements roads and roofs account for around 11 35 and 54 of the total case area respectively the urbanized population is approximately 9 02 million with an urbanization rate of roughly 80 wuhan is a megacity in china s hinterland and the yangtze river economic belt hub water challenges urban expansion priorities and biological resource richness vary significantly across wuhan s temporal and regional contexts 2 2 framework of the zonal green gray infrastructure coupled multi objective optimization critical components of multi objective optimization show great spatial heterogeneity refined runoff control schemes should be spatially adaptive to avoid functional failure or waste the research employed the methodology indicated in fig 2 it considers green and gray runoff control infrastructure parameters as independent variables the partitioning of runoff hydrological features for zonal optimization adaptive weight identification for multi aspect pressure and multi objective quantitative evaluation in a uniform system data acquisition is listed in table s 1 in the supplementary information the proposed framework included four parts ⅰ optimization variable multifunctional quantitative evaluation a quantitative evaluation system for the synergy multifunctional effectiveness of green and gray infrastructures was developed the runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological impact return on investment eroi were quantified using the hydrological model stormwater management model swmm life cycle cost lcc and life cycle assessment lca on ecological impact methodologies respectively as examples of typical green and gray runoff control infrastructures the study looked at bioretention facilities bf green roofs gr vegetable swales vs permeable pavement pp rainwater pumping stations rp storage tanks st rainwater interception to wastewater treatment facilities ri and rainwater reuse facilities rf ⅱ optimized solutions replicated region identification regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics were segmented for distinct swmm model development the hydrological model served as the foundation for zonal optimization and this ensured that the optimized solution could be replicated reliably throughout the zonal area the sub watersheds were identified as hydrological response unit hru using natural features such as topography after that the landscape pattern indices were calculated on the sub watershed scale then the sub watersheds were clustered according to the natural features and landscape pattern thus the case area was separated into several runoff hydrological character regions ⅲ objectives pressure adaptive weight assignment a regional multi perspective pressure assessment system complementary to the multifunctional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructure was developed the water management economic and ecological pressures on urban development were evaluated on the sub watershed scale the k means clustering algorithm was used to group the sub watersheds into synergistic pressure state areas multiple pressures were compared and normalized as the weight to determine the preference for numerous green and gray infrastructure functions ⅳ zonal weighted optimization decision making a zonal multi objective adaptive green gray coupled optimization framework was developed green and gray infrastructure configuration scenarios were created at first scenarios multiple functional performances were detected by the nested green and gray multifunctional evaluation systems the distinct hydrological models were built within the corresponding runoff hydrology region and multi objectives were weighted and adapted for pressure regulation demand the zoning green and gray infrastructure layout configurations were optimized using a weighted non dominated ranking genetic algorithm nsga ii to achieve the trade offs between the multiple objectives of rcf ci and eroi 2 3 green and gray infrastructure multi functional effectiveness evaluation system the multiple functional effectiveness of green and gray runoff control infrastructures was quantified in terms of runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi table 1 illustrates the related indicator concepts and equations for infrastructure functional quantity evaluation runoff quantity control and quality control are the main sub indices of rcf these sub indices correspond to the goals of relieving pressure on the drainage network in response to flooding and mitigating pollution in receiving waters ci was estimated over the life cycle encompassing investment during site preparation construction operation maintenance and disposal stages the ecological index incorporated the ecological investment and returned owing to infrastructure placement across the life cycle and the eroi index was measured in terms of the ratio of social ecological return on investment green and gray infrastructures deliver ecological impacts throughout their life cycle increased water quality more efficient use of rainwater less pressure on pipe networks fewer floods and energy savings in buildings all contribute to ecological return water eutrophication we water resource consumption wrc pathogenic fine particulate matter fpm global warming impact gw land acidification la and agricultural land occupation alo were among the measured ecological indicators the unitary life cycle capital investment inventory and life cycle material inventory of green and gray infrastructures are shown in table s 2 and table s 3 the unitary life cycle ecological impact and ecological benefit factor are demonstrated in table s 4 and table s 5 2 4 development of regional multi perspective pressure evaluation system to identify the priority for different objectives the urgency for multi perspective pressure regulation was quantified and used to weigh the objectives the multi functional infrastructure evaluation system should accompany the development of a quantitative evaluation system for multi perspective pressures table 2 illustrates the developed hierarchical pressure evaluation system water control and economic and ecological pressures were considered to quantify urban development pressures the multi perspective pressure comparison results were utilized to derive the weighting values for multi objective optimization the disparity between the runoff yield volume and storage capacity defined the regional flood pressure regulation requirement runoff regulation was meant to ensure that the water level in the receiving water body did not exceed the warning level the warning level is a binding standard the local water management authority sets land use contributes to the spatial heterogeneity of point and non point source pollution concentrations due to a spatial mismatch between contaminants and the capacity of receiving water bodies demand for runoff pollution reduction is regionally heterogeneous flooding pressure means pressure from regional runoff exceeding the remaining storage capacity of regional water bodies water pollution pressure means regional point and non point source pollution surpass the remaining water environment capacity the space designated for green and gray infrastructure is proportional to the opportunity cost of land occupation maintenance and disposal of green and gray infrastructure consume labor and disrupt economic activity economic pressures on land occupancy opportunity costs regional fiscal capacity and regional economic dynamism were examined to identify preferences for optimizing economic objectives across the infrastructure life cycle land value means infrastructure site preparation and land occupancy costs regional gdp means regional financing for infrastructure equipment procurement and operation economic activities mean regional economic activities affected by infrastructure maintenance and abandonment the intricacy of the urban landcover results in an unequal spatial distribution of ecological resources while imbalances in the degree of social development also influence ecological resource consumption the spatial heterogeneity of ecological resource pressures should be quantified for green and gray infrastructure compensating for the specific lack of ecosystems in which atmospheric purification pressure express as pm2 5 emissions that exceed the regional atmospheric self purifying capacity climate regulation pressure describes as regional net carbon emissions based on carbon source and sink statistics water purification pressure is expressed as the eutrophication index considers chlorophyll nutrient pollutants and suspended matter water resource supply pressure is expressed as the extent to which water consumption for human production living ecological conservation etc surpasses regional water resources agricultural land shortage represents the reciprocal value of annual production per acre less value means more scarcity shortage land acidification pressure express as soil acidity 2 5 regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics and swmm model development for distinct regions 2 5 1 regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics ① establishment of sub watersheds sub catchments were defined during the swat model s topographic analysis procedure the swat model simulation parameters were validated as shown in fig s 1 within sub catchments drainage processes are relatively independent and soil types land use and slope are similar due to the highly undulating topography of the case area the sub catchment is used as the statistical unit for quantitative identification of the landscape index runoff hydrological characteristic region quantitative pressure assessment and optimization of runoff control schemes ② quantification of the underlying landscape runoff yield and confluence have been demonstrated to be reliably measured by landscape pattern indices table s 6 lists the indices context and the formulas ③ establishment of landscape pattern principal components information redundancy is a prevalent concern in multivariate statistical analysis and the complexity of using regression models grows as factors get more numerous principal component analysis pca method was applied to lower the dimension of data this method can improve regression efficiency increase regression model interpretability and reduce information loss the 16 landscape pattern indices listed in table s 6 were transformed into four low dimensional principal components as illustrated in fig s 2 ④ identification of hydrological subdivisions k means clustering was utilized to group sub catchments based on the primary component features of the landscape pattern hydrological subdivisions were identified considering a synergistic distribution of runoff characteristics factors such as natural topography and landscape pattern the advantages of the k means clustering method are rapid convergence consistent grouping and good interpretability 2 5 2 swmm models for optimization in each hydrological subdivision the subdivision results indicate that flow hydrological characteristics are spatially heterogeneous while zonal similar runoff control within the zonal sub watersheds maintains stable cost effectiveness thus hydrological models for optimizing infrastructure configuration should be established individually within each hydrological subdivision to ensure model reliability we explored the degree of agreement between the swmm model simulation results and monitoring values the swmm model parameters in each hydrological subdivision were validated separately as shown in fig s 3 2 6 development of a zonal adaptive multi objective green gray coupled optimization method 2 6 1 optimized partition identification identifying the optimized partitioning lays the groundwork for runoff control infrastructure layout zonally the hydrological properties and pressure directed weights should be homogeneity within one control zone while diversity between different control zones optimizations were carried out in regions where hydrological partition and pressure oriented weighting partition are overlaid as denoted by eqs 21 to 23 the number of hydrological subdivisions decides the number of optimized hydrological models and the type of weight assignments is determined by the pressure weighting partition the targeted runoff control optimization schemes were executed in the pilot regions 21 d z o n a l d 1 d 2 d m 22 p z o

nested the multi functional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructures developed distinct hydrological models for zonal optimization allocated pressure adaptive weights to various objectives and optimized using the nsga ii algorithm nsga ii is a global search approach inspired by biological evolution the pareto optimum is approximated by continuously updating the solution set while retaining the best individuals from the parent generation the optimized configuration of green and gray infrastructure trade offs multiple functions and objectives the scales of green and gray infrastructures are independent variables in optimization the results of hydrological model simulations and the infrastructure s scale serve as input parameters for the multi functional evaluation system optimizations were taken in the distinct partitions as in section 2 6 1 weights for multiple objectives were assigned based on the pressure control requirement the objectives of optimization are to maximize rcf minimize ci and maximize eroi as denoted by eqs 26 to 28 independent variables bf m2 gr m2 vs m2 pp m2 rp m3 s st m3 ri m3 s rf m3 s objective 26 m a x r c f w v r v w l r l 27 m i

based hydrological zoning and model establishment the landscape pattern indices were downscale constructed as dominance principal component dpc diversity principal components dipc edge roughness principal component erpc and aggregation principal component apc sub watersheds were clustered based on their landscape principal component attributes and fig 3 depicts the extracted high built up medium built up and low built up areas in high built up regions low dpc and high dipc indicated patch dispersion high erpc values showed a consistent patch pattern high apc values indicated a homogenous distribution of patches with identical characteristics human industry and settlement performed in fractured diversified and irregular landscapes medium built up regions exhibited medium dpc and dipc values compared to high and low built up regions high erpc values indicated rough patch edges low apc values indicated uneven patch distribution the large and continuous pattern of green space and impermeable underlying occupied this area sparsely developed areas with high dpc values indicated vast green space erpc and apc values performed with a wide range and fluctuate due to the irregularity of permeability underlying and the loosely distributed impermeable underlying the landscape was specifically species dominated low diversity and rough edged in this zone the clustered landscape pattern attributes identify morphological variations resulting from urbanization results showed that indicative types of land coverer vary across the different developed regions distinguishable developed regions require specialized runoff control strategies according to topographical features and landscape patterns high medium and low built up regions were identified as depicted in fig 3 a representative region within each zone was selected to establish a hydrological model for the optimization of targeted runoff management strategies equal impervious areas were employed as control variables throughout the various built up zones properties were summarized in table 3 3 2 assigning multiple objective weights considering spatial heterogeneity of urban pressures 3 2 1 multi perspective pressure quantification and distribution a spatial mismatch exists between the runoff control pressure and the natural endowment of the receiving water body flood risk and pollution regulatory pressure vary spatially with remaining storage volume and water self purification capability fig 4 illustrates the multi perspective pressure distribution high built up locations west and southeast of the case region with a 50 runoff reduction requirement had the highest flood risk approximately 30 of the remaining storage capacity existed in the case region s southeastern and eastern urban periphery fig 4 a 2 and a 3 depict the spatial distribution of runoff quality regulation pressures on a sub watershed scale 20 to 30 of the excess tn pollution load and 30 of the excess tp pollution load were on the south side of the yangtze river excessive fertilizer usage and strict liangzi lake water quality regulations produced high pollution reduction pressure here traditional solutions have only considered runoff volume and pollution loads ignoring recipient water bodies storage and self purification capability water control may fail or waste resources the residual water storage volume and self purification capacity are better indicators of water regulation pressure it weights water management objectives adaptively economic factors vary spatially in the case area differential optimization preferences for green and gray infrastructure in the life cycle cost lcc site preparation equipment acquisition and operation and maintenance and disposal stages comprise runoff control infrastructure lcc correspondingly local opportunity costs of land occupation financial assistance and economic dynamism limit infrastructure costs as illustrated in fig 4 b 1 to b 3 densely inhabited locations possessed high land rent values indicating the desire for infrastructures with high area efficiency high gdp districts were also centered along the yangtze river in the urban core gdp rich areas receive more infrastructure funding the yangtze river is wuhan s primary route for residential commercial and transportation activities thus the higher values of the economic vitality index here imply a significant chance of being hindered by infrastructure maintenance and disposal here infrastructure with low maintenance and disposal costs was preferred runoff control solutions that solely consider building costs ignore regional land values financial surpluses and activity density multiple viewpoints on economic sensitivity allow for detecting the constraints for infrastructure life cycle investment thus green and gray infrastructure s optimal economic objectives are weighed adaptively to regional pressures ecological pressures are heterogeneous due to a spatial mismatch between ecological resource consumption and natural resource supply ecological pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 4 c 1 to c 6 pm2 5 pressure was 5 5 times higher in the urban core than in the suburban transition zone and some suburban locations had surplus pm2 5 capacity urban core regions emitted 4 1 times more carbon than suburbs pm2 5 and carbon emissions come from industrial point sources residential non point sources road line sources and agricultural non point sources in the study area the high built up region performed approximately 20 times higher water resources carrying pressure than the low built up region in the study area the high built up region performed approximately 20 times higher water resources carrying pressure than the low built up region shorter runoff confluence pathways caused 1 4 2 1 times the eutrophication pressure of upstream sub watersheds higher than the downstream sub watersheds suburbs offered five to six times the agricultural output potential of densely populated urban core regions urea fertilizer acidified suburban farmland lowering the ph of the part region to 5 17 resource availability habitat regulation and ecosystem resilience are spatially heterogeneous due to the synergy between natural endowment and urban development trade offs on multi perspective pressure regulation go beyond the manager s subjective empirical regional pressure adapted differentiated weighted optimization refines runoff control solutions 3 2 2 multi perspective pressure relief urgency revealed by spatial heterogeneity weight the weights of multi perspective pressure indices highlight clustered region cruxes water management economic and ecological problems were hierarchically weighted and contrasted in the clustered region thus priorities for stress relief and objective achievement were quantitatively weighed weight assignments are listed in table s 7 as illustrated in fig 5 the class i pressure zone encompassed 36 of the study region and was dominated by ecological and economic pressures with weights of 0 42 and 0 38 respectively region ii comprised 16 of the case area and included the city center on the south bank this densely populated region struggled with water management and economic needs 0 44 and 0 33 respectively compared to metropolitan suburbs this region was economically vulnerable and has fewer ecological resources the limited self adjusting capacity of the receiving water bodies in region ii caused significant flooding and pollutant reduction pressures 29 of the entire area was comprised of class iii pressure zones with a 0 45 weighting for water management this region was adjacent to the liangzi lake ecological protection zone which is in obedience to stringent water quality standards pressure zone iv comprising 19 of the case area was dominated by ecological and economic pressure indices with weight values of 0 44 and 0 46 respectively the region was densely populated with high economic disruptiveness and scarce ecological resources hanshui river s self purification capacity relieves the regional water regulatory burden the weights assignment of the optimization objective was more practical to be dictated by the relative priority of pressure rather than the absolute value of the imposed negative effects 3 3 optimal configuration of zone adaptive green gray coupled runoff control measures 3 3 1 scenario setting and optimization results two factors necessitate a differentiated regulation strategy idiosyncratic hydrologic mechanism parameters and priority of pressure regulation urgency the spatial range of homogeneous hydrologic mechanism parameters is outlined in chapter 3 1 as illustrated in fig 3 the spatial range of the same pressure relief priority is outlined in chapter 3 2 2 as described in fig 5 these two factors were spatially superimposed thus dividing the spectrum of regulation strategies as shown in fig 6 three typical hydrological models were required to illustrate the variances in control cost effectiveness caused by runoff yield and concentration each hydrological model result should obey four spatial heterogeneity adaptive weights and one equal weight thus the 15 scenario matrix was studied as listed in table 4 changes to the urbanization underlying illustrate hydrological disparities it showed a ring like transition from the urban core to the suburbs in addition to a ring like progression from the urban center to the suburb the geographical distribution of weights showed a split along the south and north sides of the yangtze river the scenario s optimum strategies emerge from a trade off between runoff control functions economic expenses and ecological return on investment coupled green and gray runoff control infrastructures were optimized on scale and configuration runoff control channels consider source oriented naturalistic methods and end oriented engineering means results are partitioned revealing the superposition of regional cost efficiencies and multi objective prioritizing fig 7 illustrates the evolution of scenario performance runoff management is expected to improve rcf reduce ci and increase eroi as illustrated in fig 7 the rcf index ranges between 0 64 and 0 95 in the case region the ci index for each unit of impervious underlying ranges between 3 and 55 rmb yuan and the average eroi for the six aspects ranges between 0 8 and 2 7 pareto tradeoff was realized in the optimum solution set space as shown in fig 7 after weighing the pareto solution s multifunctional performance hierarchically by region adaptive weights the aggregate outcomes were ranked the average value of the top 10 ranked solutions were considered to analyze the zonal adaptive runoff infrastructure layout as listed in table 4 thus the diversity of pareto solutions can be fully preserved 3 3 2 preferential configurations characteristics of green and gray infrastructure by nesting the zonal pressure adaptive objective framework the optimum configuration achieves a balanced and optimal performance in terms of rcf ci and eroi hydrological factors were more influential than weight priorities in determining infrastructure configuration variances optimized runoff regulation met local management needs the optimum configurations reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 77 and reduced pollutant load by 80 76 66 in high medium and low built up regions respectively as illustrated in fig 8 a and b green infrastructure was shown to be positively correlated with heavily built up areas where source control measures are required for densely scattered impermeable underlying in high medium and low built up regions the average contribution of green infrastructure to total runoff volume control was 71 59 and 65 whereas total quality control was 68 81 and 66 respectively runoff pumping stations rps were preferred in the medium built up regions due to their control efficiency and end of pipe orientation due to rps limited capacity to remove pollutants green infrastructures in medium built up regions contributed a higher rate of runoff quality control to satisfy standards low built up areas had the highest ratio of permeable to impermeable land in three clustered built up regions indicating lower stormwater risk and a reduced demand for source focused green infrastructure as illustrated in fig 8 c the optimal financial allocation revealed the cost effectiveness of runoff control measures the average cost of managing runoff per square meter of impervious land ranged from 7 9 to 34 2 rmb yuan for low medium and high built up with a cost ratio of 1 0 55 0 23 low built up areas control runoff more economically high medium and low built up regions invested 26 2 25 9 and 25 3 respectively in gray infrastructure for runoff reduction as illustrated in fig 8 d the highest eroi values were observed in the medium built up regions where the average eroi was 1 4 times that of the highly built up regions and 1 7 times that of lowly built up areas the eroi value was 1 3 times greater in the high built up region than in the low built up region the urgent need to control runoff in high built up region promoted the extensive deployment of ecologically beneficial green infrastructure in different scenarios the optimized solutions achieved a return on ecological investment greater than 1 for atmospheric particulate pollution the greenhouse effect water eutrophication and land acidification this indicated that the ecological return on the system compensates for the ecological impact however the ecological benefits pale compared to the investments in agricultural land and water use as shown runoff control is a process that depletes land and water resources in exchange for numerous ecological benefits green infrastructure contributed an average of 82 65 and 73 of eroi in the high medium and low built up regions respectively in regions with similar hydrological features systems optimized by class i and class ii weight assignments delivered the highest and lowest eroi values respectively in high medium and low built up regions the average eroi for class i scenarios was 1 7 1 3 and 1 6 times that for class ii respectively when class ii weighing was applied gray infrastructures contributions to rcf were more than other weighted optimized scenarios in this weight assignment solutions prioritized rcf and ci gray infrastructure is the most cost effective runoff control technique but it s more ecologically damaging in all three clustered regions class iii weighing assignment yielded the highest cost for one square meter of impervious surface the category iv weighting assignment placed the most focus on economic indicators with a weight of 0 46 hence favoring the cost effective gray runoff control infrastructures rcf attainment took precedence over ci savings in the class iii weighted region thus green infrastructures were prioritized leading to a high investment ratio class i and ii weighing configuration attached great importance to both rcf and ci therefore the optimization solutions strike a balance between rcf and ci resulting in moderate runoff control costs 3 4 discussion and limitation 3 4 1 discussion runoff control economic and ecological multi objectives challenge the evaluation of a coupled green gray infrastructure system existing evaluation schemes solely focus on green or gray infrastructure choi et al 2021 dai et al 2021 or mainly incorporate cost and runoff control functions alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 while omitting coupled system evaluation and quantitative study of ecological benefits for a full assessment a systematic evaluation approach with higher dimensions and more indicators was investigated in this study spatial mismatch between urban growth and natural ecological resources leads to water economic and ecological pressure variability maxwell et al 2021 persaud et al 2016 regional pressures require differentiated runoff control infrastructure function compensation pressures in this study were assessed in a uniform evaluation system to determine priority and optimize target weights this contrasts with traditional equal weighing or subjective stakeholder weighting ando et al 2020 darnthamrongkul and mozingo 2021 di matteo et al 2019 liu et al 2021a pressure mitigation oriented weights are quantitative objective and refined for the optimization of infrastructure multi function effectiveness effective runoff control typically spans numerous scales from source reduction to pipe migration to watershed scale centralized runoff control stormwater management will shift from flat intensively developed underlying to watershed scales with more undulations runoff management effectiveness is usually tested on pilot sites liu et al 2021b she et al 2021 to scale up it relies on specialists subjective expertise which typically ignores geospatial heterogeneity ando et al 2020 di matteo et al 2017 runoff control infrastructure investments vary in efficiency with urban growth bin et al 2018 davis and birch 2009 this paper presents a novel way to replicate and deploy runoff control measure configurations at multiple scales effective runoff control is green gray coupled and optimized for regional runoff control economy and ecology trade offs jia et al 2022 liu et al 2021a numerous objectives and variables make it impossible to manually enumerate infrastructure configurations manuel navarrete et al 2019 szeląg et al 2022 the constructed multi objective quantitative evaluation system supports the green gray coupled infrastructure along with the intelligent optimization algorithm the utilization of multi objective optimization weights in different regions realizes the need for refined intelligent and comprehensive urban runoff control 3 4 2 limitation quantifying and analyzing the cost benefit of green gray runoff reduction is complicated the research process faces many challenges and restrictions especially when water quality control economic ecological and social development restraints are examined data collection and collaborative application are crucial the quantitative examination of multi perspective pressure and multi efficiency infrastructure necessitates management department coordination data capture remote sensing inversion yearbook analysis and field monitoring are effective data collection methods the adaptive multi objective optimization framework developed in this study provides highly targeted system solutions but accordingly because the solutions are highly localized verifying their repeatability elsewhere is a prerequisite the evaluation indicators should be tailored to the case region s concerns and situation local monitoring and data collecting should also be bolstered replicated conclusions should consider scale the case location has complex waterways human existence and economic activity connect closely with water these two causes lead to the usage of sub catchments as a unit for zoning and detecting multi perspective pressures the scale of analysis can affect grouping weighting and repeatable range of results yearbook data scales are coarse and should be downscaled combining topographical and socioeconomic development helps determine the suitable analytical scale unit 4 conclusions refined and targeted runoff control schemes should accommodate spatial heterogeneity of natural endowment and urban growth numerous criteria variables weights and objectives are challenges requiring urgent attention multi objective quantitative evaluation hydrological feature split for cost effective runoff management and pressure adapted multi objective weight assignment were considered in this study consequently a novel partition adapted multi objective green gray coupling optimization framework was created green gray coupled runoff control system optimized trade offs between runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi a quantitative evaluation system can find the discrepancies of optimum infrastructure configurations on structural and functional effectiveness investment shares and ecological impact source runoff control oriented green infrastructures outperformed gray infrastructure in eroi gray infrastructures were preferred when regional weights stressed ci efficacy to investigate cost benefit differences caused by hydrological characteristics high medium and low built up regions were identified in the study area by overlay analysis of topographic factors and landscape patterns runoff control performance can be mechanistically analyzed by establishing hydrological models in the corresponding built up regions the spatial mismatch between resource consumption and remaining resource abundance is a significant indicator of pressure it is more practical to define spatial mismatch as a pressure relief urgency compared to the absolute value of the imposed negative effects thus weighting the multiple optimization objectives urban centers are often under more severe economic and ecological pressures than suburbs the regulation pressure of runoff quantity and water quality depends largely on natural endowments the synergy between natural endowment and urban development makes multi perspective pressure regulation trade offs beyond the manager s subjective empirical multi objective optimization with adaptive regional pressure weighting can assist in refining runoff management in high medium and low built up regions optimized scenarios reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 and 77 and the average runoff investment per square meter of the impervious underlying surface were 34 2 18 7 and 7 9 rmb yuan respectively with a cost ratio of 1 0 55 0 23 the zonal cost indicates differentiated investment efficiency based on the built up state unlike the traditional scheme that implements unified control cost towards the whole region medium and low built up regions may only need to invest 55 and 23 of the high built up region for the unitary impervious underlying surface to balance runoff control and ecological benefits setting hydrological differentiation zones refines runoff control and improves financial use efficiency the average investment ratios of the optimized solution sets for class i ii iii iv and e weight assignment were 0 94 0 93 1 07 0 86 1 00 ecological and economic conservation was emphasized in class i hence easing runoff management class ii focused on runoff control and economic conservation while ecological maintenance is loosened the weight assignment prioritizes one runoff management and ecological objective and relaxed the other one cost medium class ⅲ invested 7 higher for unitary pavement than the equal weight this circumstance strengthened runoff control and ecological preservation while reducing economic strain class iv invested 14 less than the equal weighted scenario since its main goal was economic upkeep and runoff management was less important pressure adaptive weighting assignments can create spatial heterogeneity optimization schemes tailored to regional demands the enhanced optimization solutions can compensate for the ecological impact investment by reducing eutrophication air particle

capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi served as optimized objectives high medium and low built up regions in wuhan urban development planning district were extracted by topographic factors and landscape patterns which comprised 28 34 and 38 of the case area respectively three corresponding hydrological models were then built to illustrate distinct runoff control cost efficiency in each region pressure distributions on runoff control economic constraints and ecological resource scarcity were quantitatively evaluated and four pressure zones were clustered which occupied 36 29 16 and 19 of the case area respectively then the zonal weighted optimization decision making matrix with 3 hydrological models and 5 wt was established by overlaying the pressure zone and built up zone in high medium and low built up regions optimized solutions reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 and 77 the average runoff investments per square meter of impervious underlying surface in high medium and low built up regions were 34 2 18 7 and 7 9 rmb yuan respectively medium and low built up regions may only need 55 and 23 of the high built up region for the unitary impervious underlying surface to balance runoff control and ecological benefits runoff control and financial utilization efficiency enhance with hydrological differentiation zones thus the

transportation and maritime center it is one of china s most significant cities for combining water and urban development a comprehensive assessment of the city s natural endowments development factors and ecological resilience is needed to balance water control economic development and ecological resource conservation alves et al 2019 darnthamrongkul and mozingo 2021 runoff control is a crucial strategy for balancing urban development restrictions with residual water storage and purifying capacity alves et al 2019 balasbaneh et al 2019 both green and gray infrastructure are practical runoff control tools bakhshipour et al 2019 dong et al 2017 gao et al 2022 green infrastructures have been proven to improve air quality reduce the heat island effect choi et al 2021 save energy reduce carbon emissions gao et al 2022 and improve habitat comfort liu et al 2021a gray infrastructure regulates runoff efficiently allows for rapid drainage and has a defined life cycle dong et al 2017 manuel navarrete et al 2019 the combined multi functional green and gray infrastructure system extends runoff control to efficient municipal investment and ecosystem upkeep bakhshipour et al 2019 veerkamp et al 2021 however because green and gray infrastructures have different lifespans structures and functions present effectiveness assessments often target solely green or gray runoff control systems scolaro and ghisi 2022 veerkamp et al 2021 and traditional management s interest in runoff control function and capital investment has prompted extensive research a three dimensional synergistic evaluation of runoff control function capital investment and ecological impacts is challenging to quantify emerging research demonstrates that integrated green and gray infrastructure runoff control systems provide good trade offs between runoff control function cost and ecological advantages alves et al 2020 jia et al 2022 however optimization of scale configuration of green and gray coupled systems is still lacking a multi functional quantitative green gray coupled evaluation system is also not deployed to schematic design site specific maximizes the multifunctional benefits of green and gray infrastructures she et al 2021 xing et al 2016 this notion is illustrated by the need to tailor runoff control strategies to local hydrological conditions bin et al 2018 regional topography features and landscape patterns are the hydrological factors of runoff yield and confluence krimsky et al 2021 maxwell et al 2021 which drive variances in runoff control cost effectiveness to achieve efficacy runoff control solutions must be replicable within zones with homogeneous hydrological features davis and birch 2009 sun et al 2016 previously runoff control replication zones defined by the managers subjective opinions have led to ineffective or wasteful solutions the site specific concept demonstrates that runoff control planning should respond to the city s environmental economic and ecological pressures jia et al 2022 green and gray infrastructures have multiple functions and restrictions the efficient allocation of infrastructures necessitates substituting traditional single sector planning with multi sectoral collaborative planning urban water management is vital because stormwater endangers human settlements and economic progress maragno et al 2018 szeląg et al 2022 while pollution from point and non point sources harms aquatic environments persaud et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however inadequate financial assistance space limits and aging infrastructure all limit the application of runoff management measures increasing the demands on cost effectiveness jia et al 2022 significant spatially heterogeneous ecological pressures result from the spatial mismatch between the availability of ecological resources and the scope of human and economic demand stormwater control requirements economic concerns and ecological resource pressures are all intertwined resulting in divergent geographical demands on green and gray infrastructures ando et al 2020 ureta et al 2021 thus a regionally diversified desire for infrastructure multifunctionality can be used to assess weights for multi objective optimization however present weights setting is either based on managers subjective preferences or use information entropy to assign high weights to indicators with high variability neither of which can adapt the multiple efficiencies of green and gray infrastructure to regional pressure regulation requirements as to the runoff control scheme design existing practices often apply the enumerative scenario method alves et al 2020 dai et al 2021 wang et al 2022 this method cannot handle the green gray coupled infrastructure optimization of many independent variables parameters partitions weights and objectives it is hard to adapt manually established configuration schemes to regional pressures it is also challenged to maximize green and gray infrastructure multi function geographically therefore critical components of multi objective optimization such as quantifying green and gray infrastructure parameters spatially dividing hydrological characteristics and pressure adaptive weight assignment must be thoroughly examined in this study remote sensing inversion of water quality hydrological model simulation using swat and swmm software landscape pattern index calculation life cycle cost lcc and life cycle assessment lca on ecological impact and nsga ii optimization algorithm are applied ① as for quantifying infrastructure performances the revolutionary integration of green and gray infrastructures multi function into a unified evaluation system allows for three dimensional optimization of runoff control function cost and ecological impact ② to maintain stable cost effectiveness of runoff control homogeneous hydrological character areas were recognized by topography and landscape features swmm was established within each hydrological zone as a pilot the optimized runoff control solution could be replicated within the corresponding zone ③ to avoid subjective empirical weighting failures when optimization objectives become numerous this study innovatively quantifies development pressures as weights of infrastructure s multifunctional indexes thereby enabling adaptive optimization ④ a zonal multi objective adaptive green gray coupled optimization framework was developed the framework nests a multi functional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructure it also establishes distinct hydrological models within hydrological subdivisions for optimization and identifies pressure adaptive multi objective weighting assignments thus the optimization solutions under multiple scenarios are zonal adaptive refined comparable replicable and implementable 2 method and data 2 1 study area the case area is wuhan hubei province china fig 1 wuhan has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1269 mm the extent of wuhan urban development planning region covers an area of approximately 2358 km2 water bodies permeable

respectively the urbanized population is approximately 9 02 million with an urbanization rate of roughly 80 wuhan is a megacity in china s hinterland and the yangtze river economic belt hub water challenges urban expansion priorities and biological resource richness vary significantly across wuhan s temporal and regional contexts 2 2 framework of the zonal green gray infrastructure coupled multi objective optimization critical components of multi objective optimization show great spatial heterogeneity refined runoff control schemes should be spatially adaptive to avoid functional failure or waste the research employed the methodology indicated in fig 2 it considers green and gray runoff control infrastructure parameters as independent variables the partitioning of runoff hydrological features for zonal optimization adaptive weight identification for multi aspect pressure and multi objective quantitative evaluation in a uniform system data acquisition is listed in table s 1 in the supplementary information the proposed framework included four parts ⅰ optimization variable multifunctional quantitative evaluation a quantitative evaluation system for the synergy multifunctional effectiveness of green and gray infrastructures was developed the runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological impact return on investment eroi were quantified using the hydrological model stormwater management model swmm life cycle cost lcc and life cycle assessment lca on ecological impact methodologies respectively as examples of typical green and gray

interception to wastewater treatment facilities ri and rainwater reuse facilities rf ⅱ optimized solutions replicated region identification regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics were segmented for distinct swmm model development the hydrological model served as the foundation for zonal optimization and this ensured that the optimized solution could be replicated reliably throughout the zonal area the sub watersheds were identified as hydrological response unit hru using natural features such as topography after that the landscape pattern indices were calculated on the sub watershed scale then the sub watersheds were clustered according to the natural features and landscape pattern thus the case area was separated into several runoff hydrological character regions ⅲ objectives pressure adaptive weight assignment a regional multi perspective pressure assessment system complementary to the multifunctional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructure was developed the water management economic and ecological pressures on urban development were evaluated on the sub watershed scale the k means clustering algorithm was used to group the sub watersheds into synergistic pressure state areas multiple pressures were compared and normalized as the weight to determine the preference for numerous green and gray infrastructure functions ⅳ zonal weighted optimization decision making a zonal multi objective adaptive green gray coupled optimization framework was developed green and gray infrastructure configuration scenarios were created at first scenarios multiple functional performances were detected by the nested green and gray multifunctional evaluation systems the distinct hydrological models were built within the corresponding runoff hydrology region and multi objectives were weighted and adapted for pressure regulation demand the zoning green and gray infrastructure layout configurations were optimized using a weighted non dominated ranking genetic algorithm nsga ii to achieve the trade offs between the multiple objectives of rcf ci and eroi 2 3 green and gray infrastructure multi functional effectiveness evaluation system the multiple functional effectiveness of green and gray runoff control infrastructures was quantified in terms of runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi table 1 illustrates the related indicator concepts and equations for infrastructure functional quantity evaluation runoff quantity control and quality control are the main sub indices of rcf these sub indices correspond to the goals of relieving pressure on the drainage network in response to flooding and mitigating pollution in receiving waters ci was estimated over the life cycle encompassing investment during site preparation construction operation maintenance and disposal stages the ecological index incorporated the ecological investment and returned owing to infrastructure placement across the life cycle and the eroi index was measured in terms of the ratio of social ecological return on investment green and gray infrastructures deliver ecological impacts throughout their life cycle increased water quality more efficient use of rainwater less pressure on pipe networks fewer floods and energy savings in buildings all contribute to ecological return water eutrophication we water resource consumption wrc pathogenic fine particulate matter fpm global warming impact gw land acidification la and agricultural land occupation alo were among the measured ecological indicators the unitary life cycle capital investment inventory and life cycle material inventory of green and gray infrastructures are shown in table s 2 and table s 3 the unitary life cycle ecological impact and ecological benefit factor are demonstrated in table s 4 and table s 5 2 4 development of regional multi perspective pressure evaluation system to identify the priority for different objectives the urgency for multi perspective pressure regulation was quantified and used to weigh the objectives the multi functional infrastructure evaluation system should accompany the development of a quantitative evaluation system for multi perspective pressures table 2 illustrates the developed hierarchical pressure evaluation system water control and economic and ecological pressures were considered to quantify urban development pressures the multi perspective pressure comparison results were utilized to derive the weighting values for multi objective optimization the disparity between the runoff yield volume and storage capacity defined the regional flood pressure regulation requirement runoff regulation was meant to ensure that the water level in the receiving water body did not exceed the warning level the warning level is a binding standard the local water management authority sets land use contributes to the spatial heterogeneity of point and non point source pollution concentrations due to a spatial mismatch between contaminants and the capacity of receiving water bodies demand for runoff pollution reduction is regionally heterogeneous flooding pressure means pressure from regional runoff exceeding the remaining storage capacity of regional water bodies water pollution pressure means regional point and non point source pollution surpass the remaining water environment capacity the space designated for green and gray infrastructure is proportional to the opportunity cost of land occupation maintenance and disposal of green and gray infrastructure consume labor and disrupt economic activity economic pressures on land occupancy opportunity costs regional fiscal capacity and regional economic dynamism were examined to identify preferences for optimizing economic objectives across the infrastructure life cycle land value means infrastructure site preparation and land occupancy costs regional gdp means regional financing for infrastructure equipment procurement and operation economic activities mean regional economic activities affected by infrastructure maintenance and abandonment the intricacy of the urban landcover results in an unequal spatial distribution of ecological resources while imbalances in the degree of social development also influence ecological resource consumption the spatial heterogeneity of ecological resource pressures should be quantified for green and gray infrastructure compensating for the specific lack of ecosystems in which atmospheric purification pressure express as pm2 5 emissions that exceed the regional atmospheric self purifying capacity climate regulation pressure describes as regional net carbon emissions based on carbon source and sink statistics water purification pressure is expressed as the eutrophication index considers chlorophyll nutrient pollutants and suspended matter water resource supply pressure is expressed as the extent to which water consumption for human production living ecological conservation etc surpasses regional water resources agricultural land shortage represents the reciprocal value of annual production per acre less value means more scarcity shortage land acidification pressure express as soil acidity 2 5 regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics and swmm model development for distinct regions 2 5 1 regions with different runoff hydrological characteristics ① establishment of sub watersheds sub catchments were defined during the swat model s topographic analysis procedure the swat model simulation parameters were validated as shown in fig s 1 within sub catchments drainage processes are relatively independent and soil types land use and slope are similar due to the highly undulating topography of the case area the sub catchment is used as the statistical unit for quantitative identification of the landscape index runoff hydrological characteristic region quantitative pressure assessment and optimization of runoff control schemes ② quantification of the underlying landscape runoff yield and confluence have been demonstrated to be reliably measured by landscape pattern indices table s 6 lists the indices context and the formulas ③ establishment of landscape pattern principal components information redundancy is a prevalent concern in multivariate statistical analysis and the complexity of using regression models grows as factors get more numerous principal component analysis pca method was applied to lower the dimension of data this method can improve regression efficiency increase regression model interpretability and reduce information loss the 16 landscape pattern indices listed in table s 6 were transformed into four low dimensional principal components as illustrated in fig s 2 ④ identification of hydrological subdivisions k means clustering was utilized to group sub catchments based on the primary component features of the landscape pattern hydrological subdivisions were identified considering a synergistic distribution of runoff characteristics factors such as natural topography and landscape pattern the advantages of the k means clustering method are rapid convergence consistent grouping and good interpretability 2 5 2 swmm models for optimization in each hydrological subdivision the subdivision results indicate that flow hydrological characteristics are spatially heterogeneous while zonal similar runoff control within the zonal sub watersheds maintains stable cost effectiveness thus hydrological models for optimizing infrastructure configuration should be established individually within each hydrological subdivision to ensure model reliability we explored the degree of agreement between the swmm model simulation results and monitoring values the swmm model parameters in each hydrological subdivision were validated separately as shown in fig s 3 2 6 development of a zonal adaptive multi objective green gray coupled optimization method 2 6 1 optimized partition identification identifying the optimized partitioning lays the groundwork for runoff control infrastructure layout zonally the hydrological properties and pressure directed weights should be homogeneity within one control zone while diversity between different control zones optimizations were carried out in regions where hydrological partition and pressure oriented weighting partition are overlaid as denoted by eqs 21 to 23 the number of hydrological subdivisions decides the number of optimized hydrological models and the type of weight assignments is determined by the pressure weighting partition the targeted runoff control optimization schemes were executed in the pilot regions 21 d z o n a l d 1 d 2 d m 22 p z o

quantification weight indicates the priority for an index which refers to how green and gray infrastructures meet pressure regulation requirements multi perspective pressures were compared and their values were hierarchically normalized to assign multi objective weight values as calculated in eq 24 the quantitative pressure evaluation system contains three primary indicators and eleven sub indicators on water management economy and ecology pressure evaluation indicators match green and gray infrastructure effectiveness evaluation indicators to get the scenario s combined multifunctional evaluation score the product of the weights and the unscaled infrastructure effectiveness is summed aseq 25 a higher score implies that the solution configuration is more adaptable to the optimization

nested the multi functional evaluation system for green and gray infrastructures developed distinct hydrological models for zonal optimization allocated pressure adaptive weights to various objectives and optimized using the nsga ii algorithm nsga ii is a global search approach inspired by biological evolution the pareto optimum is approximated by continuously updating the solution set while retaining the best individuals from the parent generation the optimized configuration of green and gray infrastructure trade offs multiple functions and objectives the scales of green and gray infrastructures are independent variables in optimization the results of hydrological model simulations and the infrastructure s scale serve as input parameters for the multi functional evaluation system optimizations were taken in the distinct partitions as in section 2 6 1 weights for multiple objectives were assigned based on the pressure control requirement the objectives of optimization are to maximize rcf minimize ci and maximize eroi as denoted by eqs 26 to 28 independent variables bf m2 gr m2 vs m2 pp m2 rp m3 s st m3 ri m3 s rf m3 s objective 26 m a x r c f w v r v w l r l 27 m i

based hydrological zoning and model establishment the landscape pattern indices were downscale constructed as dominance principal component dpc diversity principal components dipc edge roughness principal component erpc and aggregation principal component apc sub watersheds were clustered based on their landscape principal component attributes and fig 3 depicts the extracted high built up medium built up and low built up areas in high built up regions low dpc and high dipc indicated patch dispersion high erpc values showed a consistent patch pattern high apc values indicated a homogenous distribution of patches with identical characteristics human industry and settlement performed in fractured diversified and irregular landscapes medium built up regions exhibited medium dpc and dipc values compared to high and low built up regions high erpc values indicated rough patch edges low apc values indicated uneven patch distribution the large and continuous pattern of green space and impermeable underlying occupied this area sparsely developed areas with high dpc values indicated vast green space erpc and apc values performed with a wide range and fluctuate due to the irregularity of permeability underlying and the loosely distributed impermeable underlying the landscape was specifically species dominated low diversity and rough edged in this zone the clustered landscape pattern attributes identify morphological variations resulting from urbanization results showed that indicative types of land coverer vary across the different developed regions distinguishable developed regions require specialized runoff control strategies according to topographical features and landscape patterns high medium and low built up regions were identified as depicted in fig 3 a representative region within each zone was selected to establish a hydrological model for the optimization of targeted runoff management strategies equal impervious areas were employed as control variables throughout the various built up zones properties were summarized in table 3 3 2 assigning multiple objective weights considering spatial heterogeneity of urban pressures 3 2 1 multi perspective pressure quantification and distribution a spatial mismatch exists between the runoff control pressure and the natural endowment of the receiving water body flood risk and pollution regulatory pressure vary spatially with remaining storage volume and water self purification capability fig 4 illustrates the multi perspective pressure distribution high built up locations west and southeast of the case region with a 50 runoff reduction requirement had the highest flood risk approximately 30 of the remaining storage capacity existed in the case region s southeastern and eastern urban periphery fig 4 a 2 and a 3 depict the spatial distribution of runoff quality regulation pressures on a sub watershed scale 20 to 30 of the excess tn pollution load and 30 of the excess tp pollution load were on the south side of the yangtze river excessive fertilizer usage and strict liangzi lake water quality regulations produced high pollution reduction pressure here traditional solutions have only considered runoff volume and pollution loads ignoring recipient water bodies storage and self purification capability water control may fail or waste resources the residual water storage volume and self purification capacity are better indicators of water regulation pressure it weights water management objectives adaptively economic factors vary spatially in the case area differential optimization preferences for green and gray infrastructure in the life cycle cost lcc site preparation equipment acquisition and operation and maintenance and disposal stages comprise runoff control infrastructure lcc correspondingly local opportunity costs of land occupation financial assistance and economic dynamism limit infrastructure costs as illustrated in fig 4 b 1 to b 3 densely inhabited locations possessed high land rent values indicating the desire for infrastructures with high area efficiency high gdp districts were also centered along the yangtze river in the urban core gdp rich areas receive more infrastructure funding the yangtze river is wuhan s primary route for residential commercial and transportation activities thus the higher values of the economic vitality index here imply a significant chance of being hindered by infrastructure maintenance and disposal here infrastructure with low maintenance and disposal costs was preferred runoff control solutions that solely consider building costs ignore regional land values financial surpluses and activity density multiple viewpoints on economic sensitivity allow for detecting the constraints for infrastructure life cycle investment thus green and gray infrastructure s optimal economic objectives are weighed adaptively to regional pressures ecological pressures are heterogeneous due to a spatial mismatch between ecological resource consumption and natural resource supply ecological pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 4 c 1 to c 6 pm2 5 pressure was 5 5 times higher in the urban core than in the suburban transition zone and some suburban locations had surplus pm2 5 capacity urban core regions emitted 4 1 times more carbon than suburbs pm2 5 and carbon emissions come from industrial point sources residential non point sources road line sources and agricultural non point sources in the study area the high built up region performed approximately 20 times higher water resources carrying pressure than the low built up region in the study area the high built up region performed approximately 20 times higher water resources carrying pressure than the low built up region shorter runoff confluence pathways caused 1 4 2 1 times the eutrophication pressure of upstream sub watersheds higher than the downstream sub watersheds suburbs offered five to six times the agricultural output potential of densely populated urban core regions urea fertilizer acidified suburban farmland lowering the ph of the part region to 5 17 resource availability habitat regulation and ecosystem resilience are spatially heterogeneous due to the synergy between natural endowment and urban development trade offs on multi perspective pressure regulation go beyond the manager s subjective empirical regional pressure adapted differentiated weighted optimization refines runoff control solutions 3 2 2 multi perspective pressure relief urgency revealed by spatial heterogeneity weight the weights of multi perspective pressure indices highlight clustered region cruxes water management economic and ecological problems were hierarchically weighted and contrasted in the clustered region thus priorities for stress relief and objective achievement were quantitatively weighed weight assignments are listed in table s 7 as illustrated in fig 5 the class i pressure zone encompassed 36 of the study region and was dominated by ecological and economic pressures with weights of 0 42 and 0 38 respectively region ii comprised 16 of the case area and included the city center on the south bank this densely populated region struggled with water management and economic needs 0 44 and 0 33 respectively compared to metropolitan suburbs this region was economically vulnerable and has fewer ecological resources the limited self adjusting capacity of the receiving water bodies in region ii caused significant flooding and pollutant reduction pressures 29 of the entire area was comprised of class iii pressure zones with a 0 45 weighting for water management this region was adjacent to the liangzi lake ecological protection zone which is in obedience to stringent water quality standards pressure zone iv comprising 19 of the case area was dominated by ecological and economic pressure indices with weight values of 0 44 and 0 46 respectively the region was densely populated with high economic disruptiveness and scarce ecological resources hanshui river s self purification capacity relieves the regional water regulatory burden the weights assignment of the optimization objective was more practical to be dictated by the relative priority of pressure rather than the absolute value of the imposed negative effects 3 3 optimal configuration of zone adaptive green gray coupled runoff control measures 3 3 1 scenario setting and optimization results two factors necessitate a differentiated regulation strategy idiosyncratic hydrologic mechanism parameters and priority of pressure regulation urgency the spatial range of homogeneous hydrologic mechanism parameters is outlined in chapter 3 1 as illustrated in fig 3 the spatial range of the same pressure relief priority is outlined in chapter 3 2 2 as described in fig 5 these two factors were spatially superimposed thus dividing the spectrum of regulation strategies as shown in fig 6 three typical hydrological models were required to illustrate the variances in control cost effectiveness caused by runoff yield and concentration each hydrological model result should obey four spatial heterogeneity adaptive weights and one equal weight thus the 15 scenario matrix was studied as listed in table 4 changes to the urbanization underlying illustrate hydrological disparities it showed a ring like transition from the urban core to the suburbs in addition to a ring like progression from the urban center to the suburb the geographical distribution of weights showed a split along the south and north sides of the yangtze river the scenario s optimum strategies emerge from a trade off between runoff control functions economic expenses and ecological return on investment coupled green and gray runoff control infrastructures were optimized on scale and configuration runoff control channels consider source oriented naturalistic methods and end oriented engineering means results are partitioned revealing the superposition of regional cost efficiencies and multi objective prioritizing fig 7 illustrates the evolution of scenario performance runoff management is expected to improve rcf reduce ci and increase eroi as illustrated in fig 7 the rcf index ranges between 0 64 and 0 95 in the case region the ci index for each unit of impervious underlying ranges between 3 and 55 rmb yuan and the average eroi for the six aspects ranges between 0 8 and 2 7 pareto tradeoff was realized in the optimum solution set space as shown in fig 7 after weighing the pareto solution s multifunctional performance hierarchically by region adaptive weights the aggregate outcomes were ranked the average value of the top 10 ranked solutions were considered to analyze the zonal adaptive runoff infrastructure layout as listed in table 4 thus the diversity of pareto solutions can be fully preserved 3 3 2 preferential configurations characteristics of green and gray infrastructure by nesting the zonal pressure adaptive objective framework the optimum configuration achieves a balanced and optimal performance in terms of rcf ci and eroi hydrological factors were more influential than weight priorities in determining infrastructure configuration variances optimized runoff regulation met local management needs the optimum configurations reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 77 and reduced pollutant load by 80 76 66 in high medium and low built up regions respectively as illustrated in fig 8 a and b green infrastructure was shown to be positively correlated with heavily built up areas where source control measures are required for densely scattered impermeable underlying in high medium and low built up regions the average contribution of green infrastructure to total runoff volume control was 71 59 and 65 whereas total quality control was 68 81 and 66 respectively runoff pumping stations rps were preferred in the medium built up regions due to their control efficiency and end of pipe orientation due to rps limited capacity to remove pollutants green infrastructures in medium built up regions contributed a higher rate of runoff quality control to satisfy standards low built up areas had the highest ratio of permeable to impermeable land in three clustered built up regions indicating lower stormwater risk and a reduced demand for source focused green infrastructure as illustrated in fig 8 c the optimal financial allocation revealed the cost effectiveness of runoff control measures the average cost of managing runoff per square meter of impervious land ranged from 7 9 to 34 2 rmb yuan for low medium and high built up with a cost ratio of 1 0 55 0 23 low built up areas control runoff more economically high medium and low built up regions invested 26 2 25 9 and 25 3 respectively in gray infrastructure for runoff reduction as illustrated in fig 8 d the highest eroi values were observed in the medium built up regions where the average eroi was 1 4 times that of the highly built up regions and 1 7 times that of lowly built up areas the eroi value was 1 3 times greater in the high built up region than in the low built up region the urgent need to control runoff in high built up region promoted the extensive deployment of ecologically beneficial green infrastructure in different scenarios the optimized solutions achieved a return on ecological investment greater than 1 for atmospheric particulate pollution the greenhouse effect water eutrophication and land acidification this indicated that the ecological return on the system compensates for the ecological impact however the ecological benefits pale compared to the investments in agricultural land and water use as shown runoff control is a process that depletes land and water resources in exchange for numerous ecological benefits green infrastructure contributed an average of 82 65 and 73 of eroi in the high medium and low built up regions respectively in regions with similar hydrological features systems optimized by class i and class ii weight assignments delivered the highest and lowest eroi values respectively in high medium and low built up regions the average eroi for class i scenarios was 1 7 1 3 and 1 6 times that for class ii respectively when class ii weighing was applied gray infrastructures contributions to rcf were more than other weighted optimized scenarios in this weight assignment solutions prioritized rcf and ci gray infrastructure is the most cost effective runoff control technique but it s more ecologically damaging in all three clustered regions class iii weighing assignment yielded the highest cost for one square meter of impervious surface the category iv weighting assignment placed the most focus on economic indicators with a weight of 0 46 hence favoring the cost effective gray runoff control infrastructures rcf attainment took precedence over ci savings in the class iii weighted region thus green infrastructures were prioritized leading to a high investment ratio class i and ii weighing configuration attached great importance to both rcf and ci therefore the optimization solutions strike a balance between rcf and ci resulting in moderate runoff control costs 3 4 discussion and limitation 3 4 1 discussion runoff control economic and ecological multi objectives challenge the evaluation of a coupled green gray infrastructure system existing evaluation schemes solely focus on green or gray infrastructure choi et al 2021 dai et al 2021 or mainly incorporate cost and runoff control functions alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 while omitting coupled system evaluation and quantitative study of ecological benefits for a full assessment a systematic evaluation approach with higher dimensions and more indicators was investigated in this study spatial mismatch between urban growth and natural ecological resources leads to water economic and ecological pressure variability maxwell et al 2021 persaud et al 2016 regional pressures require differentiated runoff control infrastructure function compensation pressures in this study were assessed in a uniform evaluation system to determine priority and optimize target weights this contrasts with traditional equal weighing or subjective stakeholder weighting ando et al 2020 darnthamrongkul and mozingo 2021 di matteo et al 2019 liu et al 2021a pressure mitigation oriented weights are quantitative objective and refined for the optimization of infrastructure multi function effectiveness effective runoff control typically spans numerous scales from source reduction to pipe migration to watershed scale centralized runoff control stormwater management will shift from flat intensively developed underlying to watershed scales with more undulations runoff management effectiveness is usually tested on pilot sites liu et al 2021b she et al 2021 to scale up it relies on specialists subjective expertise which typically ignores geospatial heterogeneity ando et al 2020 di matteo et al 2017 runoff control infrastructure investments vary in efficiency with urban growth bin et al 2018 davis and birch 2009 this paper presents a novel way to replicate and deploy runoff control measure configurations at multiple scales effective runoff control is green gray coupled and optimized for regional runoff control economy and ecology trade offs jia et al 2022 liu et al 2021a numerous objectives and variables make it impossible to manually enumerate infrastructure configurations manuel navarrete et al 2019 szeląg et al 2022 the constructed multi objective quantitative evaluation system supports the green gray coupled infrastructure along with the intelligent optimization algorithm the utilization of multi objective optimization weights in different regions realizes the need for refined intelligent and comprehensive urban runoff control 3 4 2 limitation quantifying and analyzing the cost benefit of green gray runoff reduction is complicated the research process faces many challenges and restrictions especially when water quality control economic ecological and social development restraints are examined data collection and collaborative application are crucial the quantitative examination of multi perspective pressure and multi efficiency infrastructure necessitates management department coordination data capture remote sensing inversion yearbook analysis and field monitoring are effective data collection methods the adaptive multi objective optimization framework developed in this study provides highly targeted system solutions but accordingly because the solutions are highly localized verifying their repeatability elsewhere is a prerequisite the evaluation indicators should be tailored to the case region s concerns and situation local monitoring and data collecting should also be bolstered replicated conclusions should consider scale the case location has complex waterways human existence and economic activity connect closely with water these two causes lead to the usage of sub catchments as a unit for zoning and detecting multi perspective pressures the scale of analysis can affect grouping weighting and repeatable range of results yearbook data scales are coarse and should be downscaled combining topographical and socioeconomic development helps determine the suitable analytical scale unit 4 conclusions refined and targeted runoff control schemes should accommodate spatial heterogeneity of natural endowment and urban growth numerous criteria variables weights and objectives are challenges requiring urgent attention multi objective quantitative evaluation hydrological feature split for cost effective runoff management and pressure adapted multi objective weight assignment were considered in this study consequently a novel partition adapted multi objective green gray coupling optimization framework was created green gray coupled runoff control system optimized trade offs between runoff control function rcf capital investment ci and ecological return on investment eroi a quantitative evaluation system can find the discrepancies of optimum infrastructure configurations on structural and functional effectiveness investment shares and ecological impact source runoff control oriented green infrastructures outperformed gray infrastructure in eroi gray infrastructures were preferred when regional weights stressed ci efficacy to investigate cost benefit differences caused by hydrological characteristics high medium and low built up regions were identified in the study area by overlay analysis of topographic factors and landscape patterns runoff control performance can be mechanistically analyzed by establishing hydrological models in the corresponding built up regions the spatial mismatch between resource consumption and remaining resource abundance is a significant indicator of pressure it is more practical to define spatial mismatch as a pressure relief urgency compared to the absolute value of the imposed negative effects thus weighting the multiple optimization objectives urban centers are often under more severe economic and ecological pressures than suburbs the regulation pressure of runoff quantity and water quality depends largely on natural endowments the synergy between natural endowment and urban development makes multi perspective pressure regulation trade offs beyond the manager s subjective empirical multi objective optimization with adaptive regional pressure weighting can assist in refining runoff management in high medium and low built up regions optimized scenarios reduced annual runoff volume by 86 82 and 77 and the average runoff investment per square meter of the impervious underlying surface were 34 2 18 7 and 7 9 rmb yuan respectively with a cost ratio of 1 0 55 0 23 the zonal cost indicates differentiated investment efficiency based on the built up state unlike the traditional scheme that implements unified control cost towards the whole region medium and low built up regions may only need to invest 55 and 23 of the high built up region for the unitary impervious underlying surface to balance runoff control and ecological benefits setting hydrological differentiation zones refines runoff control and improves financial use efficiency the average investment ratios of the optimized solution sets for class i ii iii iv and e weight assignment were 0 94 0 93 1 07 0 86 1 00 ecological and economic conservation was emphasized in class i hence easing runoff management class ii focused on runoff control and economic conservation while ecological maintenance is loosened the weight assignment prioritizes one runoff management and ecological objective and relaxed the other one cost medium class ⅲ invested 7 higher for unitary pavement than the equal weight this circumstance strengthened runoff control and ecological preservation while reducing economic strain class iv invested 14 less than the equal weighted scenario since its main goal was economic upkeep and runoff management was less important pressure adaptive weighting assignments can create spatial heterogeneity optimization schemes tailored to regional demands the enhanced optimization solutions can compensate for the ecological impact investment by reducing eutrophication air particle

14978,accurate estimation of unknown nodal pressures nodal heads is necessary for efficient operation and management of water distribution networks wdns but existing methods such as hydraulic simulation and data interpolation can hardly reconcile estimation accuracy with model construction and maintenance costs recent developments in graph signal processing gsp techniques provide us with new tools to utilize information in wdn hydraulics and available measurements in a pilot study a graph based head reconstruction ghr method was proposed which used gsp to reconstruct the spatially slow varying parts of nodal heads from a limited number of field measurements to approximate original heads ghr has illustrated the effectiveness and ease of implementation of gsp based methods however due to the ill conditioning reconstruction process and inherent uncertainties ghr may show unstable results with large errors if pressure meters are not installed at specific optimized locations which limits its applicability to solve this problem and discover a stable and convenient method that can support a wider range of applications a graph based head reconstruction method with improved stability ghr s is proposed ghr s utilizes a rough estimation of unknown pressures as pseudo measurements which provide additional constraints and avoid the occurrence of unreasonable results during the reconstruction process a middle sized network with synthetic data illustrates the stability convenience and accuracy of ghr s with arbitrary meter locations and uncalibrated model parameters ghr s is also applied to a large real life network with field measurements and successfully estimates the unknown pressures of 83 000 nodes with only 58 measurements showing its effectiveness in practical engineering graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data estimation graph signal processing hydraulic model nodal pressure water distribution network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate knowledge of nodal pressures provides decisive information for the management and scheduling of water distribution networks wdns such as leakage control xu et al 2014 bozkurt et al 2022 optimal scheduling dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 and anomaly detection zhou et al 2019 xu et al 2020 which further helps water companies to reduce costs and save energy and resources due to the immense size of wdns and the high construction cost of pressure meters for most water supply companies meters are installed at only a few key nodes such as important users and end nodes and the density of monitored data is often insufficient for the requirement of intelligent and elaborative management and scheduling in order to obtain more comprehensive information estimating unknown pressures based on hydraulic relationships and available measurements can be a more economically feasible way and various methods have been proposed the most widely used approach is to build a mathematical model to simulate the hydraulic behaviors of a wdn although various methods and toolkits rossman 1999 2010 have been proposed the main challenge lies in the difficulty of accurately determining the vast number of model parameters savic et al 2009 for example the accurate allocation of demands to thousands of nodes in a wdn is costly and laborious and the randomness of customer behaviors adds to the difficulties also the roughness coefficients of pipes with various physical conditions are hard to be accurately determined as they are not directly measurable zhou et al 2018 other uncertainties such as errors caused by model skeletonization demand aggregation and instrumentation errors hutton et al 2014 also aggregate the inaccuracy of a hydraulic model therefore hydraulic simulations could provide uncertain erroneous or misleading results if the parameters are not finely adjusted model calibration also referred to as state estimation methods savic et al 2009 du et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 chu et al 2021 have been proposed to find suitable model parameters according to the difference between model simulation results and field measurements however as summarized by zhou et al 2022 the under determination of calibration problems and the requirement of complex computation and experienced data pre processing result in the absence of an accurate and easy to use calibration method inevitable measurement errors also add to the difficulties of accurate calibration hutton et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore a majority of water utilities still do not have ready to use high precision models especially for wdns with large sizes and complex structures due to the difficulties in building an elaborate hydraulic model some studies have turned to explore easier to use methods to estimate unknown pressures for example data interpolation methods assume that spatially closed nodes will have similar nodal heads i e the summation of nodal pressure and elevation thus unknown heads can be estimated according to their distance to known measurements mounce et al 2003 used a cubic spatial interpolation method to build a pressure drop surface caused by pipe bursts similarly soldevila et al 2019 employed kriging spatial interpolation methods to estimate nodal pressures and compared the estimated pressures with their reference values to localize bursts boatwright et al 2018 used the outputs of a spatially constrained inverse distance weighted interpolation method to determine the optimal location of meters for leak burst localization although the data interpolation methods are convenient and easy to use the irregular topologies and complex hydraulic relationships of a wdn can lead to inconsistencies with the assumption that closer nodes have similar heads also the variations of nodal heads with respect to their distance are not always uniform zhou et al 2022 thus the data interpolation methods will have limited accuracy especially for wdn with irregular branches unconnected intersections and pipes with large head loss machine learning ml is another promising technique that learns the hydraulic relationships to estimate unknown pressures lima et al 2017 developed a multilayer perceptron mlp to learn from numerical simulated data and successfully estimated unknown pressures of two small scale wdns limited by the learning capability of mlp for complex relationships its application to larger wdns could be inefficient hajgató et al 2021 investigated the performance of graph neural network for larger wdns and achieved high accuracy despite the potential of ml methods training an ml model needs to perform a large number of hydraulic simulations with different scenarios and the uncertainties in the hydraulic parameters may still propagate to the trained model besides experienced setting of model parameters hyper parameters and pre processing of training data are often required when developing an effective ml model which also limits its large scale application efficient analysis of interrelated relationships and spatial distribution patterns of nodal heads could be the key to accurate and easy to implement pressure estimation the major challenge lies in the inhomogeneous hydraulic relationship and irregular topology of a wdn romero et al 2021 introduced a graph based nodal head interpolation method which calculated the head of a certain node as a weighted linear contribution of connected neighboring nodes although the topology information is considered this study simply assumed that the relation i e weight of two connected nodes is inversely proportional to the pipe length between the nodes which has limited ability to reveal the hydraulic relationships of a wdn besides the method provides less information to the global variation of pressures thus large estimation errors may occur in nodes far away from known measurements recent developments in graph signal processing gsp lorenzo et al 2018 stanković et al 2019 provide better tools to interpret the hydraulic relationship and topology of a wdn gsp can represent wdn topologies by vertices and links on a graph and treats nodal pressures as signals on the graph vertices the inhomogeneous hydraulic relationship of different nodes can also be considered by setting specific weights to graph links on this basis zhou et al 2022 proposed a new methodology named graph based head reconstruction ghr by bridging wdn hydraulics with gsp ghr divides the spatial distribution of pressures into components with different varying speeds i e frequencies with an assumption that the slow varying components make up the majority of the original heads the low frequency parts can be reconstructed from a limited number of known measurements to approximate the original heads ghr achieved accurate results without the requirements of high precision hydraulic parameters illustrating the effectiveness and ease of implementation of gsp based methods nevertheless the performance of ghr relies on its assumption that the locations of pressure meters are determined according to d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 with arbitrary locations due to the absence of constraints to some unmeasured nodes the reconstruction process could be ill conditioned which may lead to unstable results and very large estimation errors see section 2 2 in practical engineering however pressure meters are generally installed in advance and other measuring purposes also need to be taken into account thus it can be difficult to ensure the designated meter locations therefore the applicability of ghr is still limited to develop an accurate and easy to use pressure estimation method that can support a wider range of applications improving the stability of gsp based methods with arbitrary meter locations can be a feasible and promising technological approach in this paper a graph based head reconstruction method with improved stability ghr s is proposed taking advantage of the slowly varying nature of wdn nodal heads ghr s estimates the very low frequency parts of heads as pseudo measurements which provides additional constraints to unmeasured nodes to avoid the occurrence of unreasonable results and ensure the stability of the reconstruction process ghr s is tested on two wdns of different scales the results show that it can provide accurate pressure estimation results without the requirement of precise hydraulic parameters nor specific locations of pressure meters illustrating the convenience and effectiveness of ghr s in practical engineering 2 method the method presented in this study builds on and improves the work by zhou et al 2022 in the following sections the basic concepts of original ghr will firstly be introduced followed by the framework of ghr s which includes a modified graph signal reconstruction algorithm considering the presence of measurement noise and a two stage reconstruction method to estimate unknown pressures with improved stability 2 1 graph based head reconstruction the topology of a wdn can be represented by a graph g v e where v 1 2 n is a set of n vertices representing nodes tanks and reservoirs in the wdn and e w i j i j v is a set of edges connecting the nodes representing pipes pumps and valves w i j 0 if there is a link between node i and j and w i j 0 otherwise the adjacency matrix is defined as w i j w i j and the laplacian matrix is l d i a g 1 t w w where 1 is a vector of all ones and d i a g converts a vector to a diagonal matrix using the vector as its main diagonal the eigen decomposition of l is l u λ u t where u u 1 u 2 u n is an orthogonal matrix consisting of eigenvectors and λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of eigenvalues the nodal heads of a wdn can be represented by signals defined on the graph vertices i e h h 1 h 2 h n t where h i is the head of node i ghr is based on graph fourier transform gft which transforms the original graph signal into a set of graph signals with different varying speeds i e frequency for h defined on the vertices its varying speed on the graph can be measured by the value difference i e the change of nodal heads between any two connected nodes given by 1 e h i 1 n j 1 n w i j h i h j 2 where e h is the frequency of signal h larger e h denotes faster varying speed of the signal for an eigenvector u i it is proved stanković et al 2019 that 2 e u i 2 λ i where λ i is the eigenvalue corresponding to u i an eigenvector with larger eigenvalue will show higher frequency if the eigenvalues are arranged in ascending order then the former eigenvectors such as u 1 and u 2 will have low frequency while the latter eigenvectors such as u n 1 and u n vary fast as u is orthogonal it spans a graph frequency domain r n of which the eigenvectors are the basis the orthogonal mapping of the original signal to the graph frequency domain is 3 h u 1 h 4 h u h i 1 n u i h i where h h 1 h 2 h n is called laplacian spectrum and eqs 3 and 4 are gft and inverse graph fourier transform igft of the original signal respectively as shown in eq 4 the original signal h can be decomposed into a linear combination of the eigenvectors u i ghr assumes that the spatial distribution of wdn nodal heads is approximately smooth with slow varying speed thus the former values of h such as h 1 and h 2 corresponding to the low frequency components will contain the majority of information while the latter values contain little information and can be neglected with acceptable accuracy loss on this basis the original signal can be approximated by its low frequency parts h l i e 5 h h l u f h f i 1 f u i h i where f is an integer called frequency limit representing the number of retained low frequency components u f r n f contains the first f columns of u and h f contains the first f values of h the choice of f will be further discussed in the following sections as the laplacian matrix l is sparse and symmetric for large wdns we only need to solve the first f eigenvectors to construct u f to speed up the calculation which is achieved by arpack lehoucq et al 1998 in this study the pressure measurements can be regarded as a sample of original signal h i e 6 y s d s h where y s is a vector of measurements d s r m n is a sampling matrix and m is the number of meters if pressure meter i is installed at node j then d s i j 1 and zeros for other elements combining eqs 5 and 6 we will get 7 y s d s u f h f h f can then be estimated by 8 h f u f t d s t d s u f 1 u f t d s t y s combining eqs 5 and 8 the reconstructed low frequency parts of the original signal are 9 h l u f u f t d s t d s u f 1 u f t d s t y s the corresponding elements in h l are the estimated unknown nodal heads given by ghr a simple example of ghr is given in fig 1 the original heads of the 10 nodes of the example wdn are transformed into a combination of laplacian spectrums h and eigenvectors u the former eigenvectors such as u 1 and u 2 show slow varying speeds on the graph while the latter eigenvectors such as u 9 and u 10 vary fast the latter values of h are very small and neglecting them will have limited impacts the retained former values can then be calculated from field measurements to reconstruct the original nodal heads using eqs 8 and 9 the boundary dividing the retained and the neglected parts is determined by f the basic assumption of ghr is that the spatial distribution of nodal heads is smooth with low frequency components containing the majority of information however in most of wdns the pressure changes among nodes are not uniform and the assumption cannot be strictly satisfied which will introduce errors during the reconstruction process ghr solves this problem by assigning specific link weights to enhance the smoothness as defined in eq 1 the varying speed of the original signal h depends on both the nodal signal differences and the weights of the corresponding links for adjacent nodes i and j that may have large signal difference assigning smaller w i j can reduce the overall varying speed of h i e e h and improve its smoothness on the graph four different strategies to determine the weights under different availability of wdn information were proposed by zhou et al 2022 for a link that connects vertex i and j the basic strategy to calculate its weight can be written as 10 w i j w j i 1 h i j h i j ε 1 1 ε 1 h i j ε 1 where h i j is the head loss of pipe i j and ε 1 is a constant used to avoid unreasonable values set as 10 3 in our study the calculated weights will be further normalized with a min max normalization 11 w i j w i j min w max w min w ε 2 where min and max are the minimum and maximum of the given set respectively w is a set containing all the calculated weights ε 2 is a small constant to avoid the occurrence of zero value set as 10 8 in this study for valves and pumps a very small value will be assigned to their corresponding weights indicating the rapid change of nodal heads on the adjacent nodes for simplicity we also use w to represent the normalized link weights in the following discussions the link weights act as a bridge between graph signal processing techniques and wdn hydraulic relationships the calculation of w involves hydraulic simulation to calculate pipe head loss which integrates various hydraulic information of the wdn such as pipe length and diameter pipe roughness nodal demands etc despite the requirement of hydraulic simulation to calculate w the work by zhou et al 2022 and the results in our study will show that ghr and ghr s have good robustness to model parameter uncertainties and accurate results can be achieved without careful parameter calibration even when there is no ready to use hydraulic model with certain assumptions we can still exploit available wdn information as much as possible to roughly estimate link weights for example in the absence of a hydraulic model if basic information such as pipe length diameter and wdn topology is available with an assumption that all the pipe roughness coefficients are the same and the user demands are uniformly distributed along water supplying pipes a rough temporary model can be constructed to calculate the pipe head losses and weights in eq 10 the weights calculated by this strategy are denoted as w u q herein when the available data of a wdn is insufficient to support hydraulic simulations by assuming that the velocity and roughness of all pipes are uniform with an approximation of the hazen williams formula we can also roughly estimate link weights without hydraulic simulation by 12 w i j u v w j i u v k d i j 1 166 l i j where w i j u v is the roughly estimated weight assuming uniform velocities and k is a constant that can be neglected in the normalization process the set of normalized weights can be denoted as w u v in the case that very limited wdn information is available a very low cost way is to set all link weights as uniform denoted as w u 1 1 1 t more detailed explanations and comparisons of the weight calculation strategies can be found in supplementary materials and zhou et al 2022 2 2 improving the stability of ghr solving eq 8 requires the matrix d s u f to be full column rank i e the rank of matrix d s u f should be equal to f horn and johnson 2012 a necessary condition is m f i e the number of meters should be greater than the number of retained low frequency components nevertheless even with sufficient meters d s u f could still be rank deficient or ill conditioned lorenzo et al 2018 depending on the wdn hydraulics and the location of pressure meters which could lead to failure of the reconstruction process or very large estimation errors eqs 8 and 9 can be interpreted as solving h f to minimize the difference between d s h l the reconstructed heads at the metered nodes and y s with large f and non optimized locations of meters the reconstruction process may tend to reduce the error at the measured nodes while ignoring the unconstrained nodes thus an overfitting problem will appear and the estimation error of some unmeasured nodes could lose control besides the problem can be exacerbated by uncertainties arising from the smoothness assumption and measurement errors using more meters and small enough f helps to increase the stability but this will also lead to higher construction costs and lower estimation accuracy as too many frequency components are neglected choosing appropriate locations of meters according to experimental design theory such as d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 is another way to enhance the stability which is adopted by zhou et al 2022 however for a majority of wdns it is difficult to ensure that all the meters are installed in the desired locations the slow varying nature of wdn heads provides us with a new perspective to improve the stability of the signal reconstruction process even with very few low frequency components the results by ghr can still show the general trend and approximate range of the original heads which can be used as a reference to restrict the occurrence of unreasonable results during the reconstruction process on this basis a two stage framework is proposed to enhance the stability of the reconstruction process as shown in fig 2 in the first stage a rough estimation of unknown nodal heads will firstly be reconstructed with a small enough number of low frequency components which can ensure reconstruction stability the rough estimations are regarded as pseudo measurements for all the unknown nodes after that the pseudo measurements and the field measurements will be combined where the values on nodes with installed meters are field measurements while the values on the unknown nodes are pseudo measurements in the second stage the combined measurements are used to reconstruct unknown nodal heads again with a large enough number of low frequency components to fully reveal the spatial variation of original nodal heads the using of pseudo measurements provides additional constraints to avoid unreasonable results on unmeasured nodes thus improving stability pseudo measurements should be assigned with lower confidence i e weights than field measurements to avoid their inherent errors affecting the accuracy of final reconstruction results specifically in the first stage the pseudo measurements h p can be calculated by 13 h p u f p u f p t d s t d s u f p 1 u f p t d s t y s where f p f is a small integer which determines the number of low frequency components used to calculate pseudo measurements f p is set to 6 by default in this study detailed discussions about the choosing of f p are presented in fig 6 before the second stage y s and h p will be integrated as combined measurements h c field measurements are assigned to measured nodes in h c and pseudo measurements are assigned to unmeasured nodes 14 h c d s t y s h p d s t d s h p v where v is a noise vector which is assumed to be zero mean with mutually independent elements the covariance matrix of v is r e v v t where r is a diagonal matrix in this study if a meter is installed at node i then r i i 1 otherwise r i i σ v 2 where larger σ v denotes smaller confidence of pseudo measurements the choosing of σ v will be further discussed in fig 6 in the second stage h c will be regarded as measurements that contain different levels of noise in order to solve h f in the presence of measurement noises this study improves the calculation strategy of ghr using the best linear unbiased estimator blue kay 1993 given by 15 h f u f t d s t d s rd s t 1 d s u f 1 u f t d s t d s rd s t 1 h c the using of blue enables the reconstruction process to take into account the confidence of different measurements besides as the combined measurements have values on all nodes i e h c r n the measurement matrix d s of h c is an identity matrix thus eq 15 can be simplified as 16 h f u f t r 1 u f 1 u f t r 1 h c and the reconstructed heads are 17 h l u f u f t r 1 u f 1 u f t r 1 h c as all the nodes are assumed to be measured in the second stage eq 16 can be solved as long as f n but too large f will introduce unnecessary computational demand and may still lead to unstable results therefore in this study we set f 0 7 m i e 70 of the number of available meters to balance computational demand stability and accuracy the impact of different f on the results is also discussed in fig 7 to sum up ghr s includes the following steps 1 choose suitable f p and calculate the pseudo measurements h p 2 combine h p with field measurements y s to obtain h c and 3 solve the reconstructed nodal heads h l with eq 17 3 case studies and results 3 1 case 1 in this case ghr s is tested on a real life middle sized wdn with synthetic data to illustrate its effectiveness and make comparisons with other pressure estimation methods the wdn consists of 480 nodes 4 reservoirs and 567 pipes and supplies 57 000 m3 of water to a 62 km² area per day as shown in fig 3 a during the tests the following assumptions and default settings are made 1 the parameters in the original hydraulic model fig 3a are assigned with considerable uncertainties to reproduce a real life network gaussian noises n μ σ 2 are assigned to pipe roughness coefficients hazen williams coefficients cw and nodal demands q as these parameters are most difficult to be precisely determined in a hydraulic model zhou et al 2018 both systematic errors and random errors are considered the default noises assigned to cw follow μ c w 5 and σ c w 10 representing the systematic and random error of cw respectively while the noises assigned to q follow μ q 5 and σ c w 20 of the original demands respectively real nodal heads are generated by hydraulic simulation using the epanet2 toolkit rossman 1999 and wntr package klise et al 2018 fig 3b shows the model with assigned parameter uncertainties where the pressures at metered nodes are set as measurements and pressures at other nodes are ground truth to evaluate the performance pressure estimation results 2 other basic information such as pipe length diameters and network topology are assumed to be known and accurate 3 the original model rather than the real life network is used to calculate graph weights w of ghr s thus the calculation of w will be affected by the assigned parameter uncertainties the results of other weight calculation strategies w u q w u v and w u will be discussed in supplementary materials 4 the locations of pressure meters are randomly determined by a roulette algorithm where nodes adjacent to longer pipes will have a larger probability to be chosen 5 unless otherwise specified the default parameters of ghr s are f 0 7 m f p 6 and σ v 10 6 the accuracy of estimation results is measured by mean absolute error mae 18 mae 1 n u i 1 n u h i h i where h i is the estimated head of node i n u is the number of nodes to be estimated the performance of ghr s is firstly tested with pressure measurements collected from 4 reservoirs and 30 randomly chosen meters the locations are shown in fig 3a as triangles to illustrate the calculation process of ghr s fig 3c presents the pseudo measurements h p calculated in the first stage of ghr s and the differences between pseudo measurements and real nodal heads are shown in fig 4 a it can be observed that the general trend of pseudo measurements is consistent with the original heads but differences exist in local variations despite the local errors pseudo measurements still provide an approximate range of unknown nodal heads which avoids the occurrence of unreasonable results in the second stage of ghr s using the default parameter settings ghr s shows good estimation results mae 0 40 m for most of the unknown nodes as shown in fig 4b only 32 nodes which are mainly distributed at branches or ends of the wdn have an estimation error larger than 1 m for comparison purposes head estimation results by ghr kriging interpolation li and heap 2008 and hydraulic model with parameter uncertainties are also given in fig 4c f the performance of ghr is significantly affected by the choosing of f as the locations of meters do not conform with d optimality it achieves the smallest mae when f 12 as shown in fig 4c larger f will lead to unstable results for example when setting f 24 same as ghr s in fig 4b ghr will give unreasonable results with mae 351 m obviously ghr needs to use a small enough f to ensure its stability with the randomly chosen meter locations but this will also lead to insufficient frequency components to reveal detailed changes thus the accuracy is limited a more detailed comparison of ghr s and ghr with respect to f will be given in fig 7 kriging interpolation infers unknown nodal heads according to their spatial distance to measured nodes and the results are shown in fig 4e as it ignores the irregular topologies and complex hydraulic features of a wdn large errors may occur especially for nodes at branches of ends of the wdn therefore kriging interpolation methods show poorer accuracy even compared with ghr using limited number of low frequency components fig 4f uses the original hydraulic model to simulate the real life network which illustrates the error of hydraulic simulation with parameter uncertainties μ c w 5 μ q 5 σ c w 10 and σ q 20 the pressures of fixed head nodes i e reservoirs are set as known with the increasing water supply distance the model simulation error cumulates and the accuracy of nodes at the ends of the wdn significantly decrease comparatively although ghr s uses the model with the same uncertainty to calculate w it integrates information from both hydraulic relationships and field measurements thus it achieves better accuracy and avoids complex and experience intensive model calibration processes as ghr s solves low frequency components according to field measurements the data quality and quantity of measurements will show significant impacts different numbers of meters and different levels of measurement errors are tested and the results are shown in fig 5 the measurement errors are assumed to be zero mean gaussian noises with standard deviations σ h ranging from 0 m to 0 5 m each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with regenerated random meter locations and measurement errors it is obvious that using more meters will improve the performance of ghr s as more information will be given besides as the locations of meters are randomly chosen during the tests with the limited number of meters there will be no meter in some parts of the wdn and large estimation errors will occur in practical applications adding some meters in a few key points can effectively improve accuracy although larger measurement errors will decrease the estimation accuracy as ghr s only retains the low frequency components of the nodal heads it can filter out part of the random errors that lie in the measurements showing a good ability to resist the impact of errors for example increasing σ h from 0 m to 0 1 m has no obvious effect on the accuracy even when σ h is increased to 0 5 m the overall estimation accuracy will decrease no more than 0 2 m f p and σ v are used to calculate pseudo measurements and determine their weights in the first stage in fig 6 the impacts of the two parameters are analyzed using one at a time sensitivity analysis i e the parameter analyzed will be changed to different values in turn and other parameters will remain at their default values each setting of parameters will be repeatedly performed 50 times with random locations of 30 meters from the results we can find that ghr s can maintain good performance over a wide range of parameters such as 3 f p 7 and 10 σ v 50 too large f p will reduce the accuracy because the stability during the calculation of pseudo measurements cannot be guaranteed although larger f p could be tolerated in large size wdns and or when using more meters smaller values such as 3 7 are still suggested as this ensures both stability and accuracy as pseudo measurements are only rough estimations with certain errors overemphasizing them with a small σ v will interfere with the information of field measurements thus the accuracy decreases on the contrary too large σ v will lead to insufficient weights of pseudo measurements thus less constraint can be provided to avoid unstable results in the second stage of ghr s for larger wdns with more nodes due to the higher ratio of pseudo measurements a proper increase of σ v is recommended to balance the information between pseudo measurements and field measurements benefiting from the use of pseudo measurements ghr s can keep high stability over a wide range of f fig 7 presents a comparison of ghr s and ghr with f ranging from 8 to 30 each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with 30 randomly chosen meters the overall results are shown in fig 7a obvious estimation errors appear in the results of ghr as long as f is larger than 10 and the estimation accuracy will become even worse with the increase of f comparatively ghr s can achieve accurate and stable results with f ranging from 13 to 30 and the maes for most of the tests are smaller than 1 m despite the randomness of meter locations which shows better stability with arbitrary choosing of meter locations and f the best results in the 50 tests can represent the performance of the tested methods with relatively better meter locations which are shown in fig 7b for comparison purpose the performance of ghr with optimized meter locations d optimality are also shown although ghr can achieve very good accuracy mae 0 31 m f 29 with optimized meter locations in practical engineering it is often hard to install pressure meters in full accordance with d optimality with random meter locations even for the best results in 50 tests ghr can only achieve mae 0 49 m f 18 and inappropriate choosing of f e g f 23 will still lead to large estimation errors the best accuracy achieved by ghr s in the 50 tests is mae 0 36 m which is very close to the performance of ghr with optimized meter locations therefore ghr s shows a superior convenience in practical engineering as it can achieve high estimation accuracy with less requirement of meter locations and parameter choosing when ghr s is applied to other wdns a larger proportion of f is recommended when the number of meters is small e g we can set f m when m 15 as this will ensure a sufficient number of low frequency components on the contrary the proportion of f should be decreased with a large number of meters e g f 0 3 m 0 6 m when m 100 as too many low frequency components will benefit little to the reconstruction accuracy and may lead to unstable results 3 2 case 2 in this case a large real life wdn with field measurements is used to validate the effectiveness of ghr s in practical engineering the wdn lies in eastern china and supplies 330 000 m3 of water per day to a 611 km2 area with a population of 1 09 million it contains 13 reservoirs 870 km pipes with diameters over 100 mm and more than 83 000 nodes as shown in fig 8 a pressures were collected from 62 meters with pre determined locations as ground truth is not known for unmetered nodes the 58 pressure measurements are selected to reconstruct the nodal heads and the remaining four meters are used to validate the reconstructed results the parameters of ghr s in this case are f p 6 f 0 7 m 41 which are the same as in case 1 the ratio of unknown nodes to measured nodes is about 100 times higher than case 1 so σ v 2 is correspondingly increased set as σ v 100 a hydraulic model is available but the model parameters are not carefully calibrated the pipe roughness coefficients of the model are all set to 120 the nodal demands of some large users are determined according to real time remote water meters and the remaining demands are assumed to be uniform along water supplying pipes the model simulation results are also given as a comparison and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a ghr s successfully reconstructs the unknown nodal heads for more than 83 000 nodes with the 58 measurements the reconstruction errors at the 4 validate nodes are 0 26 m 0 74 m 0 21 m and 0 17 m respectively which shows a better performance compared with the results given by hydraulic model simulation results 0 14 m 1 86 m 1 08 m and 0 73 m respectively as shown in fig 8b the better accuracy of ghr s contributes to its combination of hydraulic relationships and field measurements and the using of pseudo measurements ensures the stability with arbitrary locations of meters besides ghr s represents the complex wdn topologies and hydraulic relationships by graph structure and specific graph weights which enables it to accurately reveal rapid regional pressure changes for example the regions near the three reservoirs in the center left of the wdn marked as district 1 and nodal heads with irregular topological structures for example the nodes lie in the lower left of the wdn that are nearby but not connected with each other marked as district 2 unknown pressures of nodes in these districts can hardly be accurately estimated by traditional interpolation results in this case running ghr s consumes 131 1 s on our testing computer amd ryzen 9 5900hs cpu 3 30 ghz 16gb memory which is applicable for most online models with a 5 min to 1 h update frequency more details about the network and the performance of ghr s with synthetic data can be found in supplementary materials 4 discussions ghr s provides a convenient and low cost way to estimate unknown wdn pressures as it can achieve good accuracy without careful calibration of hydraulic parameters it improves ghr by allowing arbitrary pressure meter locations with better stability compared with simulating nodal pressures by hydraulic models ghr s has much lower requirements in the accuracy of hydraulic parameters such as nodal demands and pipe roughness coefficients and enables engineers to conveniently estimate unknown pressures with reduced investments in model construction and maintenance ghr s also has superiority over traditional spatial interpolation methods as it can better handle the irregular topology and complex hydraulic relationships of wdns to achieve higher accuracy although the application of ghr s does not rely on specific locations of meters it is still recommended that the meters are distributed evenly among the network with an appropriate focus on the end nodes and important users besides if a majority of pressure meters can be installed in designated locations using ghr with optimized meter locations can achieve better accuracy ghr s is especially suitable for wdns with lower flow velocity over the pipes as the pressure change of these wdns is relatively slow and the smoothness assumption will result in less accuracy loss for these wdns using w u v and w u as weights would able to achieve acceptable accuracy with very low cost for wdns with larger pipe flow rates and rapidly changing nodal pressures using more meters will help to ensure accuracy a hydraulic model is still the best choice when there are sufficient investments to carefully calibrate model parameters and maintain model accuracy as hydraulic simulation can provide integrated results including various hydraulic information with high interpretability however for a number of water supply companies ready to use accurate hydraulic models are still absent and investments in model construction and maintenance could be unaffordable under the circumstances ghr s provides a low cost effective and accurate alternative way to estimate pressures besides other weight calculation strategies w u q w u v and w u can also be used as a more low cost way which will decrease the accuracy but still performs better than traditional data interpolation methods detailed discussions about different strategies to determine graph weights can be found in supplementary materials and zhou et al 2022 it should be noted that ghr s estimates unknown pressures of a wdn in a holistic manner thus it can hardly provide reliable information for subtle hydraulic states such as the head loss of a certain pipe it is also difficult for ghr s to simulate an operating status with a hypothetic hydraulic condition as its estimation is based on measurements from existing operating status as an easy to implement way to estimate unknown pressures ghr s can contribute to smarter and more efficient management of wdns in many ways a simple example is the application in supervisory control systems estimated pressures at unknown nodes can help decision makers to obtain more comprehensive and visualized information about wdn operating status tufa and abate 2022 ghr s can also provide key basic data for various intelligent technologies in the research field of wdns for example analyzing the spatial variation of pressures during abnormal events is a commonly used methodology to detect and localize anomalies marzola et al 2022 wang et al 2022 which can be easily combined with ghr s comprehensive knowledge of pressures can also help in formulating pressure management schemes olsson 2020 price et al 2022 which will decrease energy consumption and background leakage of wdns besides the estimated pressures will provide additional information on wdn operation status which may help to solve the under determination of parameter calibration problems chen et al 2022 5 conclusions the proposed ghr s provides a convenient stable and accurate method to estimate unknown pressures in wdns ghr s is based on the ghr method presented by zhou et al 2022 which divides nodal pressures into components with different spatially varying speeds i e frequencies and uses the low frequency parts to reconstruct the original nodal heads with an assumption that the original heads mainly consist of slowly varying components to improve the stability of ghr and enable wider application a two stage nodal head reconstruction framework is employed in ghr s which utilizes pseudo measurements to restrict the occurrence of unreasonable results during the head reconstruction process ghr s is tested on two cases and the key findings are summarized below 1 ghr s can achieve high accuracy without the requirement of precise hydraulic parameters or specific meter locations it contributes a new low cost solution for pressure estimation problems especially for large complex wdns which would require high investments to build accurate hydraulic models 2 ghr s is a significant improvement over ghr the using of pseudo measurements enables the graph based pressure estimation methods to be applied to most wdns with arbitrary locations of meters which significantly extends the applicability of these methods 3 the successful application in a large complex real life network with field measurements illustrates the effectiveness of ghr in practical engineering the pressure estimation results of ghr s can further support various intelligent technologies for wdn management such as pressure management and leakage detection and combinatory studies with these technologies are recommended besides the using of graph signal processing methods in wdns also provides a new perspective for solving similar problems in the field of water resources and environments such as water quality estimation analysis of pollutant transmission and precipitation analysis although pseudo measurements are calculated by reconstructing original heads from a limited number of low frequency components in this study other strategies such as forecasting technologies can be investigated to improve the performance of ghr s

14978,accurate estimation of unknown nodal pressures nodal heads is necessary for efficient operation and management of water distribution networks wdns but existing methods such as hydraulic simulation and data interpolation can hardly reconcile estimation accuracy with model construction and maintenance costs recent developments in graph signal processing gsp techniques provide us with new tools to utilize information in wdn hydraulics and available measurements in a pilot study a graph based head reconstruction ghr method was proposed which used gsp to reconstruct the spatially slow varying parts of nodal heads from a limited number of field measurements to approximate original heads ghr has illustrated the effectiveness and ease of implementation of gsp based methods however due to the ill conditioning reconstruction process and inherent uncertainties ghr may show unstable results with large errors if pressure meters are not installed at specific optimized locations which limits its applicability to solve this problem and discover a stable and convenient method that can support a wider range of applications a graph based head reconstruction method with improved stability ghr s is proposed ghr s utilizes a rough estimation of unknown pressures as pseudo measurements which provide additional constraints and avoid the occurrence of unreasonable results during the reconstruction process a middle sized network with synthetic data illustrates the stability convenience and accuracy of ghr s with arbitrary meter locations and uncalibrated model parameters ghr s is also applied to a large real life network with field measurements and successfully estimates the unknown pressures of 83 000 nodes with only 58 measurements showing its effectiveness in practical engineering graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data estimation graph signal processing hydraulic model nodal pressure water distribution network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate knowledge of nodal pressures provides decisive information for the management and scheduling of water distribution networks wdns such as leakage control xu et al 2014 bozkurt et al 2022 optimal scheduling dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 and anomaly detection zhou et al 2019 xu et al 2020 which further helps water companies to reduce costs and save energy and resources due to the immense size of wdns and the high construction cost of pressure meters for most water supply companies meters are installed at only a few key nodes such as important users and end nodes and the density of monitored data is often insufficient for the requirement of intelligent and elaborative management and scheduling in order to obtain more comprehensive information estimating unknown pressures based on hydraulic relationships and available measurements can be a more economically feasible way and various methods have been proposed the most widely used approach is to build a mathematical model to simulate the hydraulic behaviors of a wdn although various methods and toolkits rossman 1999 2010 have been proposed the main challenge lies in the difficulty of accurately determining the vast number of model parameters savic et al 2009 for example the accurate allocation of demands to thousands of nodes in a wdn is costly and laborious and the randomness of customer behaviors adds to the difficulties also the roughness coefficients of pipes with various physical conditions are hard to be accurately determined as they are not directly measurable zhou et al 2018 other uncertainties such as errors caused by model skeletonization demand aggregation and instrumentation errors hutton et al 2014 also aggregate the inaccuracy of a hydraulic model therefore hydraulic simulations could provide uncertain erroneous or misleading results if the parameters are not finely adjusted model calibration also referred to as state estimation methods savic et al 2009 du et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 chu et al 2021 have been proposed to find suitable model parameters according to the difference between model simulation results and field measurements however as summarized by zhou et al 2022 the under determination of calibration problems and the requirement of complex computation and experienced data pre processing result in the absence of an accurate and easy to use calibration method inevitable measurement errors also add to the difficulties of accurate calibration hutton et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore a majority of water utilities still do not have ready to use high precision models especially for wdns with large sizes and complex structures due to the difficulties in building an elaborate hydraulic model some studies have turned to explore easier to use methods to estimate unknown pressures for example data interpolation methods assume that spatially closed nodes will have similar nodal heads i e the summation of nodal pressure and elevation thus unknown heads can be estimated according to their distance to known measurements mounce et al 2003 used a cubic spatial interpolation method to build a pressure drop surface caused by pipe bursts similarly soldevila et al 2019 employed kriging spatial interpolation methods to estimate nodal pressures and compared the estimated pressures with their reference values to localize bursts boatwright et al 2018 used the outputs of a spatially constrained inverse distance weighted interpolation method to determine the optimal location of meters for leak burst localization although the data interpolation methods are convenient and easy to use the irregular topologies and complex hydraulic relationships of a wdn can lead to inconsistencies with the assumption that closer nodes have similar heads also the variations of nodal heads with respect to their distance are not always uniform zhou et al 2022 thus the data interpolation methods will have limited accuracy especially for wdn with irregular branches unconnected intersections and pipes with large head loss machine learning ml is another promising technique that learns the hydraulic relationships to estimate unknown pressures lima et al 2017 developed a multilayer perceptron mlp to learn from numerical simulated data and successfully estimated unknown pressures of two small scale wdns limited by the learning capability of mlp for complex relationships its application to larger wdns could be inefficient hajgató et al 2021 investigated the performance of graph neural network for larger wdns and achieved high accuracy despite the potential of ml methods training an ml model needs to perform a large number of hydraulic simulations with different scenarios and the uncertainties in the hydraulic parameters may still propagate to the trained model besides experienced setting of model parameters hyper parameters and pre processing of training data are often required when developing an effective ml model which also limits its large scale application efficient analysis of interrelated relationships and spatial distribution patterns of nodal heads could be the key to accurate and easy to implement pressure estimation the major challenge lies in the inhomogeneous hydraulic relationship and irregular topology of a wdn romero et al 2021 introduced a graph based nodal head interpolation method which calculated the head of a certain node as a weighted linear contribution of connected neighboring nodes although the topology information is considered this study simply assumed that the relation i e weight of two connected nodes is inversely proportional to the pipe length between the nodes which has limited ability to reveal the hydraulic relationships of a wdn besides the method provides less information to the global variation of pressures thus large estimation errors may occur in nodes far away from known measurements recent developments in graph signal processing gsp lorenzo et al 2018 stanković et al 2019 provide better tools to interpret the hydraulic relationship and topology of a wdn gsp can represent wdn topologies by vertices and links on a graph and treats nodal pressures as signals on the graph vertices the inhomogeneous hydraulic relationship of different nodes can also be considered by setting specific weights to graph links on this basis zhou et al 2022 proposed a new methodology named graph based head reconstruction ghr by bridging wdn hydraulics with gsp ghr divides the spatial distribution of pressures into components with different varying speeds i e frequencies with an assumption that the slow varying components make up the majority of the original heads the low frequency parts can be reconstructed from a limited number of known measurements to approximate the original heads ghr achieved accurate results without the requirements of high precision hydraulic parameters illustrating the effectiveness and ease of implementation of gsp based methods nevertheless the performance of ghr relies on its assumption that the locations of pressure meters are determined according to d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 with arbitrary locations due to the absence of constraints to some unmeasured nodes the reconstruction process could be ill conditioned which may lead to unstable results and very large estimation errors see section 2 2 in practical engineering however pressure meters are generally installed in advance and other measuring purposes also need to be taken into account thus it can be difficult to ensure the designated meter locations therefore the applicability of ghr is still limited to develop an accurate and easy to use pressure estimation method that can support a wider range of applications improving the stability of gsp based methods with arbitrary meter locations can be a feasible and promising technological approach in this paper a graph based head reconstruction method with improved stability ghr s is proposed taking advantage of the slowly varying nature of wdn nodal heads ghr s estimates the very low frequency parts of heads as pseudo measurements which provides additional constraints to unmeasured nodes to avoid the occurrence of unreasonable results and ensure the stability of the reconstruction process ghr s is tested on two wdns of different scales the results show that it can provide accurate pressure estimation results without the requirement of precise hydraulic parameters nor specific locations of pressure meters illustrating the convenience and effectiveness of ghr s in practical engineering 2 method the method presented in this study builds on and improves the work by zhou et al 2022 in the following sections the basic concepts of original ghr will firstly be introduced followed by the framework of ghr s which includes a modified graph signal reconstruction algorithm considering the presence of measurement noise and a two stage reconstruction method to estimate unknown pressures with improved stability 2 1 graph based head reconstruction the topology of a wdn can be represented by a graph g v e where v 1 2 n is a set of n vertices representing nodes tanks and reservoirs in the wdn and e w i j i j v is a set of edges connecting the nodes representing pipes pumps and valves w i j 0 if there is a link between node i and j and w i j 0 otherwise the adjacency matrix is defined as w i j w i j and the laplacian matrix is l d i a g 1 t w w where 1 is a vector of all ones and d i a g converts a vector to a diagonal matrix using the vector as its main diagonal the eigen decomposition of l is l u λ u t where u u 1 u 2 u n is an orthogonal matrix consisting of eigenvectors and λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of eigenvalues the nodal heads of a wdn can be represented by signals defined on the graph vertices i e h h 1 h 2 h n t where h i is the head of node i ghr is based on graph fourier transform gft which transforms the original graph signal into a set of graph signals with different varying speeds i e frequency for h defined on the vertices its varying speed on the graph can be measured by the value difference i e the change of nodal heads between any two connected nodes given by 1 e h i 1 n j 1 n w i j h i h j 2 where e h is the frequency of signal h larger e h denotes faster varying speed of the signal for an eigenvector u i it is proved stanković et al 2019 that 2 e u i 2 λ i where λ i is the eigenvalue corresponding to u i an eigenvector with larger eigenvalue will show higher frequency if the eigenvalues are arranged in ascending order then the former eigenvectors such as u 1 and u 2 will have low frequency while the latter eigenvectors such as u n 1 and u n vary fast as u is orthogonal it spans a graph frequency domain r n of which the eigenvectors are the basis the orthogonal mapping of the original signal to the graph frequency domain is 3 h u 1 h 4 h u h i 1 n u i h i where h h 1 h 2 h n is called laplacian spectrum and eqs 3 and 4 are gft and inverse graph fourier transform igft of the original signal respectively as shown in eq 4 the original signal h can be decomposed into a linear combination of the eigenvectors u i ghr assumes that the spatial distribution of wdn nodal heads is approximately smooth with slow varying speed thus the former values of h such as h 1 and h 2 corresponding to the low frequency components will contain the majority of information while the latter values contain little information and can be neglected with acceptable accuracy loss on this basis the original signal can be approximated by its low frequency parts h l i e 5 h h l u f h f i 1 f u i h i where f is an integer called frequency limit representing the number of retained low frequency components u f r n f contains the first f columns of u and h f contains the first f values of h the choice of f will be further discussed in the following sections as the laplacian matrix l is sparse and symmetric for large wdns we only need to solve the first f eigenvectors to construct u f to speed up the calculation which is achieved by arpack lehoucq et al 1998 in this study the pressure measurements can be regarded as a sample of original signal h i e 6 y s d s h where y s is a vector of measurements d s r m n is a sampling matrix and m is the number of meters if pressure meter i is installed at node j then d s i j 1 and zeros for other elements combining eqs 5 and 6 we will get 7 y s d s u f h f h f can then be estimated by 8 h f u f t d s t d s u f 1 u f t d s t y s combining eqs 5 and 8 the reconstructed low frequency parts of the original signal are 9 h l u f u f t d s t d s u f 1 u f t d s t y s the corresponding elements in h l are the estimated unknown nodal heads given by ghr a simple example of ghr is given in fig 1 the original heads of the 10 nodes of the example wdn are transformed into a combination of laplacian spectrums h and eigenvectors u the former eigenvectors such as u 1 and u 2 show slow varying speeds on the graph while the latter eigenvectors such as u 9 and u 10 vary fast the latter values of h are very small and neglecting them will have limited impacts the retained former values can then be calculated from field measurements to reconstruct the original nodal heads using eqs 8 and 9 the boundary dividing the retained and the neglected parts is determined by f the basic assumption of ghr is that the spatial distribution of nodal heads is smooth with low frequency components containing the majority of information however in most of wdns the pressure changes among nodes are not uniform and the assumption cannot be strictly satisfied which will introduce errors during the reconstruction process ghr solves this problem by assigning specific link weights to enhance the smoothness as defined in eq 1 the varying speed of the original signal h depends on both the nodal signal differences and the weights of the corresponding links for adjacent nodes i and j that may have large signal difference assigning smaller w i j can reduce the overall varying speed of h i e e h and improve its smoothness on the graph four different strategies to determine the weights under different availability of wdn information were proposed by zhou et al 2022 for a link that connects vertex i and j the basic strategy to calculate its weight can be written as 10 w i j w j i 1 h i j h i j ε 1 1 ε 1 h i j ε 1 where h i j is the head loss of pipe i j and ε 1 is a constant used to avoid unreasonable values set as 10 3 in our study the calculated weights will be further normalized with a min max normalization 11 w i j w i j min w max w min w ε 2 where min and max are the minimum and maximum of the given set respectively w is a set containing all the calculated weights ε 2 is a small constant to avoid the occurrence of zero value set as 10 8 in this study for valves and pumps a very small value will be assigned to their corresponding weights indicating the rapid change of nodal heads on the adjacent nodes for simplicity we also use w to represent the normalized link weights in the following discussions the link weights act as a bridge between graph signal processing techniques and wdn hydraulic relationships the calculation of w involves hydraulic simulation to calculate pipe head loss which integrates various hydraulic information of the wdn such as pipe length and diameter pipe roughness nodal demands etc despite the requirement of hydraulic simulation to calculate w the work by zhou et al 2022 and the results in our study will show that ghr and ghr s have good robustness to model parameter uncertainties and accurate results can be achieved without careful parameter calibration even when there is no ready to use hydraulic model with certain assumptions we can still exploit available wdn information as much as possible to roughly estimate link weights for example in the absence of a hydraulic model if basic information such as pipe length diameter and wdn topology is available with an assumption that all the pipe roughness coefficients are the same and the user demands are uniformly distributed along water supplying pipes a rough temporary model can be constructed to calculate the pipe head losses and weights in eq 10 the weights calculated by this strategy are denoted as w u q herein when the available data of a wdn is insufficient to support hydraulic simulations by assuming that the velocity and roughness of all pipes are uniform with an approximation of the hazen williams formula we can also roughly estimate link weights without hydraulic simulation by 12 w i j u v w j i u v k d i j 1 166 l i j where w i j u v is the roughly estimated weight assuming uniform velocities and k is a constant that can be neglected in the normalization process the set of normalized weights can be denoted as w u v in the case that very limited wdn information is available a very low cost way is to set all link weights as uniform denoted as w u 1 1 1 t more detailed explanations and comparisons of the weight calculation strategies can be found in supplementary materials and zhou et al 2022 2 2 improving the stability of ghr solving eq 8 requires the matrix d s u f to be full column rank i e the rank of matrix d s u f should be equal to f horn and johnson 2012 a necessary condition is m f i e the number of meters should be greater than the number of retained low frequency components nevertheless even with sufficient meters d s u f could still be rank deficient or ill conditioned lorenzo et al 2018 depending on the wdn hydraulics and the location of pressure meters which could lead to failure of the reconstruction process or very large estimation errors eqs 8 and 9 can be interpreted as solving h f to minimize the difference between d s h l the reconstructed heads at the metered nodes and y s with large f and non optimized locations of meters the reconstruction process may tend to reduce the error at the measured nodes while ignoring the unconstrained nodes thus an overfitting problem will appear and the estimation error of some unmeasured nodes could lose control besides the problem can be exacerbated by uncertainties arising from the smoothness assumption and measurement errors using more meters and small enough f helps to increase the stability but this will also lead to higher construction costs and lower estimation accuracy as too many frequency components are neglected choosing appropriate locations of meters according to experimental design theory such as d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 is another way to enhance the stability which is adopted by zhou et al 2022 however for a majority of wdns it is difficult to ensure that all the meters are installed in the desired locations the slow varying nature of wdn heads provides us with a new perspective to improve the stability of the signal reconstruction process even with very few low frequency components the results by ghr can still show the general trend and approximate range of the original heads which can be used as a reference to restrict the occurrence of unreasonable results during the reconstruction process on this basis a two stage framework is proposed to enhance the stability of the reconstruction process as shown in fig 2 in the first stage a rough estimation of unknown nodal heads will firstly be reconstructed with a small enough number of low frequency components which can ensure reconstruction stability the rough estimations are regarded as pseudo measurements for all the unknown nodes after that the pseudo measurements and the field measurements will be combined where the values on nodes with installed meters are field measurements while the values on the unknown nodes are pseudo measurements in the second stage the combined measurements are used to reconstruct unknown nodal heads again with a large enough number of low frequency components to fully reveal the spatial variation of original nodal heads the using of pseudo measurements provides additional constraints to avoid unreasonable results on unmeasured nodes thus improving stability pseudo measurements should be assigned with lower confidence i e weights than field measurements to avoid their inherent errors affecting the accuracy of final reconstruction results specifically in the first stage the pseudo measurements h p can be calculated by 13 h p u f p u f p t d s t d s u f p 1 u f p t d s t y s where f p f is a small integer which determines the number of low frequency components used to calculate pseudo measurements f p is set to 6 by default in this study detailed discussions about the choosing of f p are presented in fig 6 before the second stage y s and h p will be integrated as combined measurements h c field measurements are assigned to measured nodes in h c and pseudo measurements are assigned to unmeasured nodes 14 h c d s t y s h p d s t d s h p v where v is a noise vector which is assumed to be zero mean with mutually independent elements the covariance matrix of v is r e v v t where r is a diagonal matrix in this study if a meter is installed at node i then r i i 1 otherwise r i i σ v 2 where larger σ v denotes smaller confidence of pseudo measurements the choosing of σ v will be further discussed in fig 6 in the second stage h c will be regarded as measurements that contain different levels of noise in order to solve h f in the presence of measurement noises this study improves the calculation strategy of ghr using the best linear unbiased estimator blue kay 1993 given by 15 h f u f t d s t d s rd s t 1 d s u f 1 u f t d s t d s rd s t 1 h c the using of blue enables the reconstruction process to take into account the confidence of different measurements besides as the combined measurements have values on all nodes i e h c r n the measurement matrix d s of h c is an identity matrix thus eq 15 can be simplified as 16 h f u f t r 1 u f 1 u f t r 1 h c and the reconstructed heads are 17 h l u f u f t r 1 u f 1 u f t r 1 h c as all the nodes are assumed to be measured in the second stage eq 16 can be solved as long as f n but too large f will introduce unnecessary computational demand and may still lead to unstable results therefore in this study we set f 0 7 m i e 70 of the number of available meters to balance computational demand stability and accuracy the impact of different f on the results is also discussed in fig 7 to sum up ghr s includes the following steps 1 choose suitable f p and calculate the pseudo measurements h p 2 combine h p with field measurements y s to obtain h c and 3 solve the reconstructed nodal heads h l with eq 17 3 case studies and results 3 1 case 1 in this case ghr s is tested on a real life middle sized wdn with synthetic data to illustrate its effectiveness and make comparisons with other pressure estimation methods the wdn consists of 480 nodes 4 reservoirs and 567 pipes and supplies 57 000 m3 of water to a 62 km² area per day as shown in fig 3 a during the tests the following assumptions and default settings are made 1 the parameters in the original hydraulic model fig 3a are assigned with considerable uncertainties to reproduce a real life network gaussian noises n μ σ 2 are assigned to pipe roughness coefficients hazen williams coefficients cw and nodal demands q as these parameters are most difficult to be precisely determined in a hydraulic model zhou et al 2018 both systematic errors and random errors are considered the default noises assigned to cw follow μ c w 5 and σ c w 10 representing the systematic and random error of cw respectively while the noises assigned to q follow μ q 5 and σ c w 20 of the original demands respectively real nodal heads are generated by hydraulic simulation using the epanet2 toolkit rossman 1999 and wntr package klise et al 2018 fig 3b shows the model with assigned parameter uncertainties where the pressures at metered nodes are set as measurements and pressures at other nodes are ground truth to evaluate the performance pressure estimation results 2 other basic information such as pipe length diameters and network topology are assumed to be known and accurate 3 the original model rather than the real life network is used to calculate graph weights w of ghr s thus the calculation of w will be affected by the assigned parameter uncertainties the results of other weight calculation strategies w u q w u v and w u will be discussed in supplementary materials 4 the locations of pressure meters are randomly determined by a roulette algorithm where nodes adjacent to longer pipes will have a larger probability to be chosen 5 unless otherwise specified the default parameters of ghr s are f 0 7 m f p 6 and σ v 10 6 the accuracy of estimation results is measured by mean absolute error mae 18 mae 1 n u i 1 n u h i h i where h i is the estimated head of node i n u is the number of nodes to be estimated the performance of ghr s is firstly tested with pressure measurements collected from 4 reservoirs and 30 randomly chosen meters the locations are shown in fig 3a as triangles to illustrate the calculation process of ghr s fig 3c presents the pseudo measurements h p calculated in the first stage of ghr s and the differences between pseudo measurements and real nodal heads are shown in fig 4 a it can be observed that the general trend of pseudo measurements is consistent with the original heads but differences exist in local variations despite the local errors pseudo measurements still provide an approximate range of unknown nodal heads which avoids the occurrence of unreasonable results in the second stage of ghr s using the default parameter settings ghr s shows good estimation results mae 0 40 m for most of the unknown nodes as shown in fig 4b only 32 nodes which are mainly distributed at branches or ends of the wdn have an estimation error larger than 1 m for comparison purposes head estimation results by ghr kriging interpolation li and heap 2008 and hydraulic model with parameter uncertainties are also given in fig 4c f the performance of ghr is significantly affected by the choosing of f as the locations of meters do not conform with d optimality it achieves the smallest mae when f 12 as shown in fig 4c larger f will lead to unstable results for example when setting f 24 same as ghr s in fig 4b ghr will give unreasonable results with mae 351 m obviously ghr needs to use a small enough f to ensure its stability with the randomly chosen meter locations but this will also lead to insufficient frequency components to reveal detailed changes thus the accuracy is limited a more detailed comparison of ghr s and ghr with respect to f will be given in fig 7 kriging interpolation infers unknown nodal heads according to their spatial distance to measured nodes and the results are shown in fig 4e as it ignores the irregular topologies and complex hydraulic features of a wdn large errors may occur especially for nodes at branches of ends of the wdn therefore kriging interpolation methods show poorer accuracy even compared with ghr using limited number of low frequency components fig 4f uses the original hydraulic model to simulate the real life network which illustrates the error of hydraulic simulation with parameter uncertainties μ c w 5 μ q 5 σ c w 10 and σ q 20 the pressures of fixed head nodes i e reservoirs are set as known with the increasing water supply distance the model simulation error cumulates and the accuracy of nodes at the ends of the wdn significantly decrease comparatively although ghr s uses the model with the same uncertainty to calculate w it integrates information from both hydraulic relationships and field measurements thus it achieves better accuracy and avoids complex and experience intensive model calibration processes as ghr s solves low frequency components according to field measurements the data quality and quantity of measurements will show significant impacts different numbers of meters and different levels of measurement errors are tested and the results are shown in fig 5 the measurement errors are assumed to be zero mean gaussian noises with standard deviations σ h ranging from 0 m to 0 5 m each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with regenerated random meter locations and measurement errors it is obvious that using more meters will improve the performance of ghr s as more information will be given besides as the locations of meters are randomly chosen during the tests with the limited number of meters there will be no meter in some parts of the wdn and large estimation errors will occur in practical applications adding some meters in a few key points can effectively improve accuracy although larger measurement errors will decrease the estimation accuracy as ghr s only retains the low frequency components of the nodal heads it can filter out part of the random errors that lie in the measurements showing a good ability to resist the impact of errors for example increasing σ h from 0 m to 0 1 m has no obvious effect on the accuracy even when σ h is increased to 0 5 m the overall estimation accuracy will decrease no more than 0 2 m f p and σ v are used to calculate pseudo measurements and determine their weights in the first stage in fig 6 the impacts of the two parameters are analyzed using one at a time sensitivity analysis i e the parameter analyzed will be changed to different values in turn and other parameters will remain at their default values each setting of parameters will be repeatedly performed 50 times with random locations of 30 meters from the results we can find that ghr s can maintain good performance over a wide range of parameters such as 3 f p 7 and 10 σ v 50 too large f p will reduce the accuracy because the stability during the calculation of pseudo measurements cannot be guaranteed although larger f p could be tolerated in large size wdns and or when using more meters smaller values such as 3 7 are still suggested as this ensures both stability and accuracy as pseudo measurements are only rough estimations with certain errors overemphasizing them with a small σ v will interfere with the information of field measurements thus the accuracy decreases on the contrary too large σ v will lead to insufficient weights of pseudo measurements thus less constraint can be provided to avoid unstable results in the second stage of ghr s for larger wdns with more nodes due to the higher ratio of pseudo measurements a proper increase of σ v is recommended to balance the information between pseudo measurements and field measurements benefiting from the use of pseudo measurements ghr s can keep high stability over a wide range of f fig 7 presents a comparison of ghr s and ghr with f ranging from 8 to 30 each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with 30 randomly chosen meters the overall results are shown in fig 7a obvious estimation errors appear in the results of ghr as long as f is larger than 10 and the estimation accuracy will become even worse with the increase of f comparatively ghr s can achieve accurate and stable results with f ranging from 13 to 30 and the maes for most of the tests are smaller than 1 m despite the randomness of meter locations which shows better stability with arbitrary choosing of meter locations and f the best results in the 50 tests can represent the performance of the tested methods with relatively better meter locations which are shown in fig 7b for comparison purpose the performance of ghr with optimized meter locations d optimality are also shown although ghr can achieve very good accuracy mae 0 31 m f 29 with optimized meter locations in practical engineering it is often hard to install pressure meters in full accordance with d optimality with random meter locations even for the best results in 50 tests ghr can only achieve mae 0 49 m f 18 and inappropriate choosing of f e g f 23 will still lead to large estimation errors the best accuracy achieved by ghr s in the 50 tests is mae 0 36 m which is very close to the performance of ghr with optimized meter locations therefore ghr s shows a superior convenience in practical engineering as it can achieve high estimation accuracy with less requirement of meter locations and parameter choosing when ghr s is applied to other wdns a larger proportion of f is recommended when the number of meters is small e g we can set f m when m 15 as this will ensure a sufficient number of low frequency components on the contrary the proportion of f should be decreased with a large number of meters e g f 0 3 m 0 6 m when m 100 as too many low frequency components will benefit little to the reconstruction accuracy and may lead to unstable results 3 2 case 2 in this case a large real life wdn with field measurements is used to validate the effectiveness of ghr s in practical engineering the wdn lies in eastern china and supplies 330 000 m3 of water per day to a 611 km2 area with a population of 1 09 million it contains 13 reservoirs 870 km pipes with diameters over 100 mm and more than 83 000 nodes as shown in fig 8 a pressures were collected from 62 meters with pre determined locations as ground truth is not known for unmetered nodes the 58 pressure measurements are selected to reconstruct the nodal heads and the remaining four meters are used to validate the reconstructed results the parameters of ghr s in this case are f p 6 f 0 7 m 41 which are the same as in case 1 the ratio of unknown nodes to measured nodes is about 100 times higher than case 1 so σ v 2 is correspondingly increased set as σ v 100 a hydraulic model is available but the model parameters are not carefully calibrated the pipe roughness coefficients of the model are all set to 120 the nodal demands of some large users are determined according to real time remote water meters and the remaining demands are assumed to be uniform along water supplying pipes the model simulation results are also given as a comparison and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a ghr s successfully reconstructs the unknown nodal heads for more than 83 000 nodes with the 58 measurements the reconstruction errors at the 4 validate nodes are 0 26 m 0 74 m 0 21 m and 0 17 m respectively which shows a better performance compared with the results given by hydraulic model simulation results 0 14 m 1 86 m 1 08 m and 0 73 m respectively as shown in fig 8b the better accuracy of ghr s contributes to its combination of hydraulic relationships and field measurements and the using of pseudo measurements ensures the stability with arbitrary locations of meters besides ghr s represents the complex wdn topologies and hydraulic relationships by graph structure and specific graph weights which enables it to accurately reveal rapid regional pressure changes for example the regions near the three reservoirs in the center left of the wdn marked as district 1 and nodal heads with irregular topological structures for example the nodes lie in the lower left of the wdn that are nearby but not connected with each other marked as district 2 unknown pressures of nodes in these districts can hardly be accurately estimated by traditional interpolation results in this case running ghr s consumes 131 1 s on our testing computer amd ryzen 9 5900hs cpu 3 30 ghz 16gb memory which is applicable for most online models with a 5 min to 1 h update frequency more details about the network and the performance of ghr s with synthetic data can be found in supplementary materials 4 discussions ghr s provides a convenient and low cost way to estimate unknown wdn pressures as it can achieve good accuracy without careful calibration of hydraulic parameters it improves ghr by allowing arbitrary pressure meter locations with better stability compared with simulating nodal pressures by hydraulic models ghr s has much lower requirements in the accuracy of hydraulic parameters such as nodal demands and pipe roughness coefficients and enables engineers to conveniently estimate unknown pressures with reduced investments in model construction and maintenance ghr s also has superiority over traditional spatial interpolation methods as it can better handle the irregular topology and complex hydraulic relationships of wdns to achieve higher accuracy although the application of ghr s does not rely on specific locations of meters it is still recommended that the meters are distributed evenly among the network with an appropriate focus on the end nodes and important users besides if a majority of pressure meters can be installed in designated locations using ghr with optimized meter locations can achieve better accuracy ghr s is especially suitable for wdns with lower flow velocity over the pipes as the pressure change of these wdns is relatively slow and the smoothness assumption will result in less accuracy loss for these wdns using w u v and w u as weights would able to achieve acceptable accuracy with very low cost for wdns with larger pipe flow rates and rapidly changing nodal pressures using more meters will help to ensure accuracy a hydraulic model is still the best choice when there are sufficient investments to carefully calibrate model parameters and maintain model accuracy as hydraulic simulation can provide integrated results including various hydraulic information with high interpretability however for a number of water supply companies ready to use accurate hydraulic models are still absent and investments in model construction and maintenance could be unaffordable under the circumstances ghr s provides a low cost effective and accurate alternative way to estimate pressures besides other weight calculation strategies w u q w u v and w u can also be used as a more low cost way which will decrease the accuracy but still performs better than traditional data interpolation methods detailed discussions about different strategies to determine graph weights can be found in supplementary materials and zhou et al 2022 it should be noted that ghr s estimates unknown pressures of a wdn in a holistic manner thus it can hardly provide reliable information for subtle hydraulic states such as the head loss of a certain pipe it is also difficult for ghr s to simulate an operating status with a hypothetic hydraulic condition as its estimation is based on measurements from existing operating status as an easy to implement way to estimate unknown pressures ghr s can contribute to smarter and more efficient management of wdns in many ways a simple example is the application in supervisory control systems estimated pressures at unknown nodes can help decision makers to obtain more comprehensive and visualized information about wdn operating status tufa and abate 2022 ghr s can also provide key basic data for various intelligent technologies in the research field of wdns for example analyzing the spatial variation of pressures during abnormal events is a commonly used methodology to detect and localize anomalies marzola et al 2022 wang et al 2022 which can be easily combined with ghr s comprehensive knowledge of pressures can also help in formulating pressure management schemes olsson 2020 price et al 2022 which will decrease energy consumption and background leakage of wdns besides the estimated pressures will provide additional information on wdn operation status which may help to solve the under determination of parameter calibration problems chen et al 2022 5 conclusions the proposed ghr s provides a convenient stable and accurate method to estimate unknown pressures in wdns ghr s is based on the ghr method presented by zhou et al 2022 which divides nodal pressures into components with different spatially varying speeds i e frequencies and uses the low frequency parts to reconstruct the original nodal heads with an assumption that the original heads mainly consist of slowly varying components to improve the stability of ghr and enable wider application a two stage nodal head reconstruction framework is employed in ghr s which utilizes pseudo measurements to restrict the occurrence of unreasonable results during the head reconstruction process ghr s is tested on two cases and the key findings are summarized below 1 ghr s can achieve high accuracy without the requirement of precise hydraulic parameters or specific meter locations it contributes a new low cost solution for pressure estimation problems especially for large complex wdns which would require high investments to build accurate hydraulic models 2 ghr s is a significant improvement over ghr the using of pseudo measurements enables the graph based pressure estimation methods to be applied to most wdns with arbitrary locations of meters which significantly extends the applicability of these methods 3 the successful application in a large complex real life network with field measurements illustrates the effectiveness of ghr in practical engineering the pressure estimation results of ghr s can further support various intelligent technologies for wdn management such as pressure management and leakage detection and combinatory studies with these technologies are recommended besides the using of graph signal processing methods in wdns also provides a new perspective for solving similar problems in the field of water resources and environments such as water quality estimation analysis of pollutant transmission and precipitation analysis although pseudo measurements are calculated by reconstructing original heads from a limited number of low frequency components in this study other strategies such as forecasting technologies can be investigated to improve the performance of ghr s

14979,the dissolved organic nitrogen don pool from algal derived extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom comprises proteins peptides free amino acids and carbohydrates of which proteins can contribute up to 100 of the don previous reports of algal derived don character have focused on bulk properties including concentration molecular weight and hydrophobicity however these can be similar between algal species and between the eom and iom even when the inherent molecular structures vary a focus on bulk character presents challenges to the research on algal derived nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation as n dbp formation is sensitive to the changes in molecular structure hence the main aim of this study was to characterize algal eom and iom derived don specifically proteinaceous don using a combination of bulk and molecular characterization techniques to enable a more detailed exploration of the relationship between the character of algal derived proteins and the n dbp formation potential don from the eom and iom of four commonly found algae and cyanobacteria in natural waters were evaluated namely chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii it was observed that 77 96 of total don in all eom and iom samples was of proteinaceous origin in the proteins don concentrations were highest in the high molecular weight fraction of iom derived bulk proteins 0 13 0 75 mg n l 1 and low to medium molecular weight fraction of eom derived bulk proteins 0 15 0 63 mg n l 1 in all species similar observations were also made via sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry solid state 15n nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy of the eom and iom revealed the existence of common aliphatic and heterocyclic n groups in all samples including a dominant 2 amide peak species dependent variability was also observed in the spectra particularly in the eom e g nitro signals were found only in the cylindrospermopsis raciborskii eom dichloroacetonitrile dcan and n nitrosamine concentrations from the eom of the species evaluated in this study were lower than the guideline limits set by regulatory agencies it is proposed that the dominant 2 amide in all samples decreased n dbp formation upon chlorination for chloramination the presence of nitro groups and aliphatic and heterocyclic n dbp precursors could cause variable n nitrosamine formation compared to non algal impacted waters algae laden waters are characterised by low organic carbon organic nitrogen ratios of 7 14 and elevated don and protein concentrations hence relying only on bulk characterization increases the perceived risk of n dbp formation from algae laden waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria lc ocd mass spectrometry nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface waters impacted by algal and cyanobacterial blooms typically have elevated concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don originating from algal derived extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom li et al 2019 qin et al 2015 shah and mitch 2012 consequently don from the eom and iom has been attributed as a source of precursors for nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2019b li et al 2020 pivokonsky et al 2016 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2011 algal don comprises proteins and carbohydrates the concentration and character can vary depending on the species growth phase and whether the don is sourced from the eom or iom hua et al 2019b pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2020 of the don constituents proteins can contribute up to 100 of the total algal don and are therefore considered important in the context of n dbp formation dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010b hua et al 2019b li et al 2020 2019 pivokonsky et al 2016 2014 sheng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 while there is considerable interest in exploring the link between n dbp formation and proteins in algal don the existing reports are often contradictory for instance li et al 2020 reported that the chlorinated high molecular weight hmw 50 kda eom fraction from four algal species produced higher concentrations of haloacetonitriles hans than low or medium molecular weight fractions lmw 1 kda mmw 1 50 kda attributed to higher protein concentrations in the hmw fraction than the other fractions in another study hua et al 2020 also observed that greater concentrations of n dbps were formed in the hmw fractions of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella sp upon chlorination caused by elevated protein concentrations in contrast wang et al 2021 observed that chlorinated lmw mmw eom and iom from lake taihu algal samples produced at least twice as much hans as the hmw fraction despite lower protein concentrations in the lmw mmw than the hmw fraction furthermore different n dbps have been found to form from the eom of similar algal species with similar protein concentrations for example qi et al 2016 detected several haloacetamides hams at concentrations up to 1 5 µg l 1 after chlorination of eom isolated from microcystis aeruginosa whereas goslan et al 2017 found no hams after chlorination of eom isolated from the same species even though the protein concentrations were similar for the species in both studies these examples suggest that factors beyond the conventional physicochemical bulk parameters that have been used to broadly characterise proteins need to be examined to understand why different algal species have differing n dbp formation potentials proteins have a myriad of n groups including amines amides imines enamines and n classes including aliphatic and heterocyclic n aromatic and non aromatic and these are known to contribute to a suite of n dbps upon disinfection bond et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 for instance amines act as precursors for several haloacetonitriles hans and n nitrosamines mccurry et al 2016 sfynia et al 2020 while aromatic n molecules can form a range of aromatic n dbps such as chlorophenylacetonitriles zhang et al 2019 hence a detailed algal eom and iom derived protein analysis is a prerequisite to understand how different n dbps can be formed from algal eom and iom however to date no study has conducted a detailed characterisation of the algal derived eom and iom proteins in the context of n dbp formation comprehensive algal eom and iom protein analysis has previously been limited by the analytical techniques available chu et al 2010 hua et al 2019b lee et al 2006 pivokonsky et al 2016 shah and mitch 2012 however recent research has demonstrated the potential of several advanced physicochemical and molecular techniques for detailed algal protein analysis examples of these techniques are a size distribution analysis via liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd and the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page method edokpa et al 2018 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 b molecular structures examined via solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy he et al 2015 hua et al 2017 qin et al 2015 and c individual protein profiling conducted using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms rao et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 these techniques have the potential to be used in combination to provide a comprehensive analysis of algal proteins in eom and iom fractions which could then be related to n dbp formation from algal organic matter the main aims of this study were therefore to a conduct a detailed analysis of the don specifically proteinaceous don from the eom and iom extracted from four algae and cyanobacteria chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii using a combination of lc ocnd sds page 15n nmr spectroscopy and lc hrms to understand the extent of the variability in molecular structure and b explore the relationship between the character of algal eom derived proteins and the n dbps formed from the eom of the same species published in our previous work li et al 2020 in so doing this study demonstrates for the first time that advanced molecular characterisation of algal eom and iom derived proteins can provide insight into algal derived n dbp formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cultivation three cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 01 dolichospermum circinale cs 533 02 and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs 508 hereafter referred to as ma dc and cr respectively and one green algae chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 hereafter referred to as cv were obtained from the australian national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and sub cultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised mla media for cyanobacteria and jaworski media for green algae respectively li et al 2019 additionally to enable analysis of algal don using 15n nmr spectroscopy 15n labelled species were grown in media containing 15n labelled nano3 sigma aldrich 98 based on a method previously published by li et al 2020 the 15n content was 82 4 and 98 7 of tn in the 15n labelled jaworski and mla media respectively si table s1 all experiments in this study were conducted during the stationary growth phase for cv ma and dc and late stationary growth phase for cr to ensure comparability with a prior study li et al 2020 2 2 extraction and fractionation of organic matter and the associated proteins eom extraction was conducted based on the methods used previously li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 rao et al 2018 briefly eom bulk from each species was obtained by centrifuging 50 ml of the culture at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia and filtering the supernatant using a 934 ah glass microfiber filter 0 45 μm nominal pore size whatman usa iom extraction was conducted using the freeze thawing method lee et al 2018 liu et al 2017 cells that remained post eom extraction were resuspended in 50 ml of ultrapure water conductivity 0 056 µs cm 1 resistivity 18 2 mω cm frozen at 85 c for at least 24 h before thawing in the dark at 4 c cell lysis was confirmed to be over 95 by determining the change in cell numbers in the thawed suspension using a haemocytometer and a light microscope leica icc 50 germany the removal of cell debris and iom extraction was achieved by repeating one cycle of the procedure for extracting eom the iom bulk was obtained for the three cyanobacterial species but not for the green algae cv as the algal cell walls could not be lysed by the freeze thawing method protein extraction was undertaken for each eom and iom sample using the method previously published by rao et al 2020 briefly the ice cold acetone precipitation method was used upon which the extracted bulk protein pellets were air dried prior to further analysis see si s1 2 1 for the full procedure for bulk protein extraction size fractionation of the bulk eom bulk iom and the eom and iom derived bulk protein samples 0 45 µm into hmw mmw and lmw fractions of similar volumes across the different cultures was achieved using ultrafiltration li et al 2019 the sizes of these fractions were verified using the lc ocnd system model 8 doc labor germany li et al 2019 2 3 characterization methods 2 3 1 physicochemical character of bulk and size fractionated organic matter and proteins the following analyses were conducted on the bulk eom bulk iom and the eom and iom derived bulk proteins doc was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyser japan don was measured via the tn din method where the tn was measured using a tnm 1 analyzer japan and the din was measured using the lc ocnd system li et al 2019 the doc and don of the size fractionated eom iom and the eom and iom derived proteins were determined using lc ocnd huber et al 2011 li et al 2019 additionally the size distributions of the bulk proteins were evaluated via the sds page method rao et al 2020 with further details reported in si s1 2 1 all analyzes were conducted in triplicate using different culture batches to capture both biological and experimental variability the results were expressed as a mean with one standard deviation 2 3 2 protein profiling in eom and iom derived bulk proteins the individual proteins from the eom and iom derived bulk proteins were profiled via lc hrms using an ultimate 3000 hplc dionex amsterdam netherlands coupled to an orbitrap velos hrms thermo electron germany see si s1 2 1 for full protein profiling procedure duplicate analyses were conducted using different culture batches to capture both biological and experimental variability 2 3 3 molecular characterization of eom and iom via solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy solid state 15n 1h cross polarization nmr spectroscopic experiments were carried out on eom and iom samples isolated from the 15n labelled cultures a wide bore bruker biospin avance iii solids 700 mhz spectrometer operating at a frequency of 70 and 700 mhz for the 15n and 1h nuclei respectively was used for the nmr analysis as the method required 100 mg of solid sample lyophilized bulk eom and iom samples were analyzed instead of the extracted bulk proteins the samples were analysed in either d2o or 10 d2o the full procedure is given in si s1 2 2 2 4 eom disinfection experiments in our previous study li et al 2020 we chlorinated and chloraminated the eom of the species evaluated in the current study chlorination and chloramination experiments were undertaken using free chlorine and preformed monochloramine respectively disinfection experiments were conducted at ph 7 and at 21 c in the dark for 72 h the initial mass ratio between free cl2 and algal doc was 4 1 for all the formation potential experiments by dosing 8 mg cl2 l 1 into 2 mg c l 1 doc solutions or 4 mg cl2 l 1 into 1 mg c l 1 doc solutions in order to evaluate the maximum potential for n dbp formation from the eom chlorine was added in excess and longer reaction times than that used in water treatment plants were applied the details of chlorination and chloramination experiments are described in the following sections si section s1 3 provides full details on the eom disinfection experiments in li et al 2020 we examined the formation potentials of three hans two hnms two hams and eight n nitrosamines of these only dcan was detected upon chlorination and dcan and select n nitrosamines were detected upon chloramination from all samples the n dbp measurements are provided in tables 3a and 3b 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of the organic matter and extracted proteins 3 1 1 doc and don concentrations in the bulk and size fractionated organic matter and proteins the doc and don concentrations in the bulk organic matter and bulk protein samples were 21 58 higher in the eom than in the corresponding iom si table s2 for size fractionated organic matter and protein samples the doc and don concentrations in the hmw faction were 1 2 2 6 higher in the iom than the eom for all measured species si table s2 implying that the cells retained more hmw compounds within the iom in contrast the doc and don concentrations in the mmw and lmw fractions were 1 5 9 1 higher in the eom than the iom these results are in agreement with those identified by hua et al 2019b and hua et al 2019a who observed that at least 40 of the iom derived doc and don from chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa comprised hmw compounds 30 to 100 kda the don from the bulk proteins extracted from the eom and iom contributed between 77 and 96 of the total bulk don in both eom and iom si table s2 indicating that proteins are major don contributors in the eom and iom similar results have been observed for m aeruginosa and c vulgaris where upto 90 of the doc and 100 of the don in the eom and iom was found to comprise proteins li et al 2014 pivokonsky et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 hence proteins warrant a detailed analysis in the context of n dbp formation 3 1 2 protein profiling number of proteins and protein molecular weights for all species a visual inspection of the sds page gel revealed that a greater number of individual protein bands were present in the eom than the iom proteins fig 1 similarly more individual proteins were identified by lc hrms in bulk eom than in bulk iom table 1 for eom protein bands were identified throughout the entire size range of 2 250 kda for all species fig 1 lc hrms analysis showed a greater number of proteins in the lmw 1 kda and mmw range 1 50 kda than the hmw range 50 kda table 1 with average mw in the range of 1 53 kda for all the eom samples fig s1 in contrast the protein bands from ma iom and cr iom were prominent at 30 kda only whereas those of dc iom covered the entire range fig 1 the lc hrms data revealed that the average mw for the iom samples was comparable to or marginally greater than those of the eom samples 50 63 kda cr iom 45 85 kda ma iom and 46 66 kda dc iom fig s1 these values were also slightly lower than the observations made for the iom proteins which could be due to some fragmentation during ionisation khan et al 2018 the broad mw distribution of the bulk eom protein measured in this study was similar to previously reported size distributions of 18 115 kda for c vulgaris rao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 15 to 250 kda for m aeruginosa wei et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 and 5 110 kda for c raciborskii neilan et al 2003 plominsky et al 2009 the relatively narrow size distributions for bulk iom proteins measured by sds page in this study contrast with previous studies of bulk iom proteins where broad sds page size distributions of 1 150 kda were reported fang et al 2010b takaara et al 2007 yoshida et al 2014 nonetheless hua et al 2019a reported that the protein rich iom extracted from chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa predominantly comprised proteinaceous molecules that were 30 kda which is similar to the mw distribution of the iom derived proteins reported in this study the observed differences are likely due to the varying character of individual proteins between different strains of the same species rao et al 2020 soni et al 2008 protein band intensities and relative abundance visually the sds page protein band intensities indicative of concentration for bulk eom proteins were more intense in the mmw range than the hmw range the lmw region was not visible whereas the bulk iom proteins except dc iom were more intense in the hmw range than the mmw range fig 1 for example the most intense bands in the bulk ma eom protein were at 37 20 10 kda while the most intense bands in the bulk ma iom protein were at 150 and 50 100 kda fig 1 the sds page protein band intensities for the bulk ma iom protein in this study are consistent with previous reports of strong bands in hmw regions of 50 kda for m aeruginosa nies 298 yoshida et al 2014 and 43 94 kda for m aeruginosa nies 91 takaara et al 2007 the patterns in protein band intensities from sds page also agreed with the previously described distribution of doc and don in different protein size fractions specifically that doc and don concentrations in the hmw faction were always higher for iom than eom si table s2 the aforementioned protein band intensities for different size fractions of eom and iom were supported by the exponentially modified protein abundance index empai values obtained from lc hrms analysis table 1 the empai value is a relative quantification of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins and is calculated based on the peptide matches in the uniprot database search result the empai value of a specific protein is considered to be proportional to the abundance of that protein see si s1 2 1 for further details ishihama et al 2005 for eom derived bulk proteins the average empai for the combined lmw mmw range was at least 4 higher than the hmw range for all species table 1 this demonstrates that the relative abundance of hmw proteins in the bulk eom proteins was low table 1 as supported by the low band intensities in the 50 kda regions of the eom bands in the gel fig 1 in contrast to the eom protein empai the average empai for the iom proteins in the hmw range was 1 1 2 0 higher than the combined lmw mmw range table 1 collectively the empai values and protein band intensities from sds page indicate that the algal species in this study mainly retained proteins 50 kda within cells in the iom 3 2 evaluating individual protein character in the eom and iom size fractions the proteins identified by lc hrms from the size fractionated eom and iom proteins were classified into different functional categories photosynthesis and respiration biosynthesis energy and metabolism transcription cell envelope transport and cell division processes rao et al 2020 overall the distribution of empai or protein abundance between different functional categories in each mw fraction share of each functional category among all functional categories in a particular mw fraction varied depending on the species however certain functional categories were dominant fig s2 for example proteins associated with biosynthesis 4 47 and photosynthesis and respiration 0 63 processes had the highest empai values up to 77 combined out of the total empai in each fraction followed by proteins associated with energy and metabolism 9 61 and other categories 1 19 each fig s2 analysis of the distribution of empai of each functional category between different mw fractions share of each mw fraction out of the total empai of a particular protein category revealed similarities with the protein empai in each mw fraction observed in table 1 higher empai values were in the lmw and mmw fractions for the bulk eom proteins and in the hmw fraction for bulk iom proteins in most functional categories fig s3 altogether the analysis of the functional character of the proteins suggests that the proteins associated with photosynthesis and respiration biosynthesis and energy and metabolism processes were the most abundant proteins in all bulk proteins which was also consistent with a previous study rao et al 2020 and that the concentrations of these proteins were greatest in the lmw mmw fraction of the eom and hmw fraction of the iom in all species 3 3 identification of n classes and n groups in extracellular and intracellular organic matter all solid state 15n nmr spectra had 50 n signals within four distinct chemical shift ranges 180 140 ppm 119 90 ppm 85 41 ppm and 35 0 ppm table 2 and figs 2 3 signals within these four chemical shift ranges were observed in all species across both eom and iom except for cr eom which did not have any signals in the 180 140 ppm range table 2 and figs 2 3 instead a fifth chemical shift range between 450 and 240 ppm was observed for cr eom where additional n signals were found table 2 and fig 2 the n signals in the five chemical shift ranges covered a broad spectrum of n atoms in organic matter including aliphatic n aromatic n non aromatic heterocyclic n and nine unique n functional groups 1 2 and 3 amines imines enamines 1 and 2 amides imides nitro table 2 fang et al 2011 kasaai 2010 mao et al 2017 mao et al 2007 repeta 2015 thorn and cox 2009 common signals at 119 ppm 2 amide 85 75 and between 65 and 41 ppm amines enamines and amino acids were observed in all species table 2 and figs 2 3 of these the predominant signal was observed at 119 ppm indicating that the don in eom and iom from all species was primarily present as 2 amide in the form of peptide bonds that link amino acids in peptides and proteins mao et al 2007 thorn and cox 2009 2016 similar findings of dominant amide linkages have been observed in the eom and iom of chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa via carbon nmr and xps analysis indicating that peptide bonds are prevalent in the algal organic matter hua et al 2017 some studies have suggested that the 2 amide signal could also belong to n acetyl amino sugars which are common constituents of bacterial carbohydrates aluwihare et al 2005 mao et al 2007 however given that a majority of the don was of proteinaceous origin and that amino sugars were only detected in cv eom in trace amounts previously rao et al 2020 it is more likely that the dominant 2 amide signal results from the protein content it is also suggested that the n signals from 110 to 35 ppm which are attributed to 1 amide aliphatic amines enamines anilines piperidines and amino acids belonged to the proteinaceous matter present in the samples this is because the same signals were previously identified as belonging to proteins and polypeptides by mao et al 2007 when analyzing algal material extracted from a natural lake furthermore these signals were confirmed to be of proteinaceous origin by thorn and cox 2009 who also identified distinct signals for anilines 61 ppm amines 34 36 ppm and amino acids 32 ppm when analyzing a range of suwannee river soil and water samples in the current study spectral overlap prevented more specific identification of the signals species dependent variability was largely absent in the solid state 15n nmr spectra from the iom samples table 2 and fig 3 however differences between the solid state 15n nmr spectra from the eom samples were observed for example within the 180 140 ppm chemical shift range in the eom samples dc had a total of four signals table 2 and fig 2 likely comprising proteinaceous pyrroles 147 ppm also indicated by the presence of tryptophan khan et al 2019 the imide n or lactam n of nucleotide bases 178 170 ppm and the side chains of amino acids including tryptophan arginine and histidine 158 147 ppm fang et al 2011 lankes and lüdemann 2007 mao et al 2017 2007 repeta 2015 thorn and cox 2009 the tryptophan arginine and histidine peaks have been also identified via carbon nmr and xps analysis in the iom of chlorella sp and m aeruginosa previously hua et al 2017 in contrast the eom of cv ma and cr all had fewer proteinaceous n signals within the same chemical shift range fig 2 such discrepancies were also observed in the other chemical shift ranges e g nitro signals were found only in cr eom and there was an absence or possible overlap of 110 ppm signals in all samples except cr eom and cv eom table 2 and figs 2 3 the nmr results indicate that the presence of proteinaceous n particularly in the eom can vary widely depending on the species profiled resulting in don variability across species 3 4 linking algal don character to n dbp formation potential upon chlorination and chloramination 3 4 1 formation potential of dcan and n nitrosamines upon chlorination in our previous study li et al 2020 we observed that the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile dcan formed upon chlorination of cr eom and cv eom from the same species evaluated in this study were greater in the 1 kda fraction referred to as hmw in li et al 2020 than in the lmw fraction 1 kda table 3a this could be because 70 of the don in the eom of these species was present in the 1 kda fraction si table s2 by contrast ma eom and dc eom had comparable or marginally greater dcan formation in the lmw 1 kda fraction even though the don concentrations in that fraction were 20 of the total ma and dc eom don si table s2 this implies that bulk don measurements cannot reliably estimate n dbp formation potential thereby suggesting that advanced don characterization is necessary to understand n dbp formation evaluation of dcan formation based on functional protein character analysis of the functional protein character revealed that the proteins i e n groups in proteins involved in the photosynthesis and respiration and the biosynthesis processes likely caused the elevated concentrations of dcan in the 1 kda fraction in cr eom and cv eom because these proteins had up to 70 empai distribution share of each functional category among all functional protein categories in a particular mw fraction in the 1 kda fraction si fig s2 while 60 empai distributions were also observed for the same functional categories in the 1 kda fraction it is to be noted that the percentage empai of these proteins across the different mw fractions share of each mw fraction out of the total empai of a particular functional category was the lowest 22 in the 1 kda fraction in cr eom and cv eom si fig s3 similar observations were also made in ma eom and dc eom si figs s2 and s3 despite the fact that the dcan formation in the 1 kda fraction was comparable to or marginally greater than the dcan formation in the 1 kda fraction in these species table 3a this suggests that unlike cv eom and cr eom the proteins i e n groups involved in the biosynthesis and photosynthesis and respiration processes in the 1 kda and 1 kda fractions of ma and dc eom were equally available and conducive to react with chlorine to form dcan hence understanding the influence of n groups is critical for gaining insight into n dbp formation from algal impacted waters insight into dcan formation from reactivity of amides with chlorine li et al 2020 noted that no n nitrosamines were detected post chlorination of the eom samples characterised in this study and that the dcan concentrations from all eom were below the guideline limits prescribed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 these observations were likely due to the significant presence of amide n relative to other n groups although not quantified the 2⁰ amide linkages are represented by the predominant signal at 119 ppm in the 15n nmr spectra figs 2 and 3 because amides are less reactive with chlorine than other n groups such as amines and typically result in a lower n dbp formation potential for example chlorination of dimethylformamide and diuron formed ndma at 0 3 molar yields compared to trimethylamine which produced a molar yield of 2 5 shah and mitch 2012 similarly other studies have also consistently shown that molar dcan yields from chlorination of amides 0 01 0 5 for at least 24 h at ph 7 were lower than from chlorination of various primary secondary and tertiary amines 0 9 11 bond et al 2014 ding et al 2018 sfynia et al 2020 the low reactivity of amides with chlorine compared to other n groups may be because a 70 200 molar excess of cl2 n is needed for reaction with amides while the molar ratio of cl2 n is typically between 1 and 30 during chlorination mccurry et al 2016 shah and mitch 2012 and b the adjacent electron withdrawing strength from the amide carbonyl group deactivates the amide n towards electrophilic substitution or attack by cl2 mccurry et al 2016 sfynia et al 2020 hence the varying proportions of amides low reactivity and other groups with high reactivity with chlorine e g amines that are present in the proteins could be responsible for the differing formation of dcan upon chlorination of the species evaluated in this study 3 4 2 formation potential of dcan and n nitrosamines during chloramination in our previous study it was observed that the eom from the species evaluated in this study was not a major source of precursors for dcan formed upon chloramination because 73 of the n in dcan was sourced from the monochloramine disinfectant li et al 2020 in the case of n nitrosamines which have two n atoms it is known that one n atom is sourced from the monochloramine and the other from the algal don bond et al 2012 for the species evaluated in this study several types of n nitrosamines were formed in differing proportions data from li et al 2020 presented in table 3b these observations will be explored in the following sections elevated formation of n nitrosamines in cr eom despite cr eom having the lowest don concentration as measured in this study si table s2 li et al 2020 observed that cr eom produced the highest concentration of all n nitrosamines table 3b furthermore cr eom was also found to have the greatest proportion of 15n from 15n labelled eom incorporated into ndma li et al 2020 implying that the n in cr eom was most conducive to n nitrosamine formation upon chloramination this is attributed to the presence of nitro groups in cr eom as identified in the solid state 15n nmr spectra that were absent in other samples fig 2 and table 2 nitro compounds including nitromethane 1 phenyl nitromethane and tetranitromethane have been reported to react with primary secondary and tertiary amines over prolonged exposure 48 h to form ndma n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosomorpholine nmor at yields of 1 5 lópez rodríguez et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 hence it is possible that the nitro groups in cr eom contributed towards the elevated n nitrosamine concentrations reported in li et al 2020 another reason for the elevated concentrations of n nitrosamines in cr eom could be that the moieties adjacent to the n groups in cr eom promoted n nitrosamine formation compared to the moieties adjacent to the n groups in the eom from other species for example while isoleucine and aspartic acid are both aliphatic amino acids with an α primary amine functional group aspartic acid has another carboxylic acid electron withdrawing group on the terminal side resulting in the formation of differing n dbps at varying concentrations upon chloramination shah and mitch 2012 hence further research on the effect of moieties adjacent to n groups on their reactivity for n nitrosamine formation and the reactions of nitro groups in eom with amines to form n nitrosamines is recommended formation of aliphatic and heterocyclic n nitrosamines upon chloramination of eom in all species chloramination resulted in the formation of n nitrosamines with both aliphatic and heterocyclic structures table 3b the detection of several proteins section 3 2 and amines table 2 indicate the presence of long c chain amines r1 nh r2 which are precursor structures for aliphatic n nitrosamines precursor structures for the heterocyclic n nitrosamines including piperidine and aniline were also likely present even though 15n nmr spectral overlap prevented further identification table 2 and fig 2 the variable formation of n nitrosamines observed for each species table 3b indicates a differing concentrations of n groups or b occurrence of ring opening similar to that observed when forming haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles upon chloramination liu et al 2020 or c moieties adjacent to the n groups impacting n dbp formation 3 4 3 formation of n dbps other than hans and n nitrosamines in our previous study li et al 2020 we examined the formation potential of three hans two hnms two hams and eight n nitrosamines of these only dcan was detected upon chlorination and dcan and select n nitrosamines were detected upon chloramination from all samples while hams and hnms were not detected in our study they have been regularly detected in other studies one reason for this could be due to the shorter duration of disinfection used in our study 72 h compared to the longer disinfection times of up to 168 h employed in other studies for instance hua et al 2020 observed elevated formation of tcnm and tcm when chlorinating the eom of chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa for 168 h similar observations were also made by goslan et al 2017 who chlorinated the eom for 168 h and reported the formation of tcnm from five species of cyanobacteria and diatoms previously fang et al 2010a reported that tcm and tcnm formation increased with increasing chlorination times from 0 to 168 h suggesting that the lack of tcm and tcnm formation from the eom of the species evaluated in this study was likely caused by the short disinfection time applied in our previous study despite the presence of amine and amide moieties no hams were detected from the chlorination or chloramination of the eom of any of the species in our previous study this may be because proteinaceous don moieties in algal organic matter are predominantly hydrophobic pivokonsky et al 2016 and thus could be less susceptible to the formation of hams previous research has suggested that hydrophilic aromatic nitrogen favors formation of hams such as dichloroacetamide shah and mitch 2012 secondly hams can also be formed as derivatives of hans e g dichloroacetamide can form from dcan implying that longer disinfection times than those applied in our previous study would be required to form hams from hans chu et al 2016 chu et al 2010 finally the lack of hams formation could be attributed to the depressed reactivity of amides discussed earlier in section 3 4 1 2 overall this is another reminder that n dbp formation is sensitive towards reaction conditions as well as don moieties across species 3 4 4 formation of iom derived n dbps upon chlorination and chloramination in this study the formation of eom derived n dbps was primarily investigated because the ultimate goal of algal treatment is to inactivate the cells without damaging the cell membrane to prevent the release of undesirable metabolites that may be present within the cells while the iom derived n dbps were not analyzed in our previous study the don characterization results from this current study inform n dbp formation from the iom for instance the bulk don concentrations measured in iom were lower than in eom table s2 additionally there were fewer iom derived proteins and they were less abundant compared to eom derived proteins fig 1 and table 1 this would suggest that for the algal species evaluated in this study fewer n dbps would form from iom than from eom and at lower concentrations however this conclusion is in contrast to previous findings for chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa where the iom formed more n dbps than the eom and at higher concentrations because the iom was richer in aromatic and hydrophilic protein like materials than the eom hua et al 2020 2017 the formation of n dbps will be controlled by functional groups present in the don as well as factors such as steric hindrance shielding of the functional groups and the rate at which the disinfectant breaks down long chain versus short chain molecules shah and mitch 2012 further analysis via iom disinfection experiments is necessary to confirm the n dbp formation potential of the iom of the species evaluated in this study 3 5 algal derived vs non algal derived don in surface waters implications for n dbp formation potential upon chlorination and chloramination the bulk eom and iom examined in this study were found to have a c n of 7 14 and don concentrations of 0 5 1 2 mg n l 1 proteinaceous don comprised 77 96 of the total don si table s2 which was in line with prior observations of proteinaceous don comprising up to 100 of total don depressed uv absorbance values and low c n ratios of 4 for similar algal cultures hua et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2016 2014 yao et al 2020 the prevalence of proteinaceous don was further supported by the dominant 15n nmr signal at 119 ppm across species which represents 2⁰ amide linkages in amino acids and peptides section 3 3 similar to algal don the natural organic matter nom derived don from non algal impacted surface waters is dominated by proteins peptides and free amino acids krasner et al 2013 lee et al 2006 however the nom derived don has lower concentrations typically 0 3 mg n l 1 and the c n is usually 18 with a likely elevated uv absorbance despite spatial and temporal variance because the nom derived doc has greater heterogeneity than algal doc in the form of carbonaceous humic and fulvic substances chen et al 2015 dotson and westerhoff 2009 hua et al 2020 mitch et al 2009 the n signals identified in the algal samples via the nmr analysis in this study have also been observed in surface water nom lankes et al 2008 thorn and cox 2012 venel et al 2021 however unlike algal om multiple strong signals representing a range of amines 35 95 ppm primary and secondary amides 110 130 ppm and pyrroles and side chains of histidine and arginine 135 180 ppm have been observed in nom indicating that don from nom has comparable concentrations of a variety of n compounds thorn and cox 2012 venel et al 2021 overall these observations suggest that while proteinaceous n is a dominant constituent of algal and nom derived don low c n ratios and high don concentrations are characteristics of algal impacted waters hence the expectation is that algal impacted water sources would result in greater n dbp formation during disinfection than non impacted waters however this study demonstrates that relying only on don concentrations or even total protein concentrations increases the perceived risk of n dbp formation thereby potentially misleading water utilities into enforcing risk management measures thus an understanding of the molecular structures that make up the don pool is recommended to better infer n dbp formation potential in algal impacted waters 5 conclusions the main aims of this paper were to understand the degree of variability of don specifically proteinaceous don at a molecular level in the eom and iom extracted from four algal and cyanobacterial species and relate them to n dbp formation multiple techniques were employed to profile the don in respect to both physiochemical character and molecular structures the following conclusions were obtained proteinaceous don contributed between 77 and 96 of bulk don in the eom and iom for all species more proteins were observed in algal eom than iom based on sds page and lc hrms analysis bulk eom proteins generally had greater intensities indicating elevated concentrations in the lmw mmw range 0 50 kda compared to the hmw range 50 kda this was in contrast for the corresponding bulk iom proteins in which greater intensities were observed in the hmw range compared to the lmw mmw range solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy signals which could be attributable to 2 amides amines pyrroles enamines and amino acids were observed in the spectra from the eom and iom samples of all species of these the 2 amide signal at 119 ppm was predominant in all samples solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy gave a consistent response for iom but not for eom where the spectrum from cr eom had signals between 450 and 240 ppm attributable to nitro groups which were absent in the spectra from the other samples it is proposed that the strong 2 amide presence in all species as evidenced by solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy resulted in lower concentrations of n dbps upon chlorination relative to guideline limits prescribed by regulatory agencies because amides are less reactive with chlorine compared to other n groups such as amines in the case of chloramination it is suggested that the presence of nitro groups and the availability of aliphatic and heterocyclic n groups in the don could cause differing n nitrosamine formation across species algae laden waters are characterized by low c n ratios and high don and protein concentrations this study demonstrates that relying only on don concentrations or even total protein concentrations might result in an increased perceived risk of n dbp formation for water utilities hence developing an understanding of the molecular structures of the don is required to better evaluate n dbp formation potential further research on the effect of moieties adjacent to n

14979,the dissolved organic nitrogen don pool from algal derived extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom comprises proteins peptides free amino acids and carbohydrates of which proteins can contribute up to 100 of the don previous reports of algal derived don character have focused on bulk properties including concentration molecular weight and hydrophobicity however these can be similar between algal species and between the eom and iom even when the inherent molecular structures vary a focus on bulk character presents challenges to the research on algal derived nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation as n dbp formation is sensitive to the changes in molecular structure hence the main aim of this study was to characterize algal eom and iom derived don specifically proteinaceous don using a combination of bulk and molecular characterization techniques to enable a more detailed exploration of the relationship between the character of algal derived proteins and the n dbp formation potential don from the eom and iom of four commonly found algae and cyanobacteria in natural waters were evaluated namely chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii it was observed that 77 96 of total don in all eom and iom samples was of proteinaceous origin in the proteins don concentrations were highest in the high molecular weight fraction of iom derived bulk proteins 0 13 0 75 mg n l 1 and low to medium molecular weight fraction of eom derived bulk proteins 0 15 0 63 mg n l 1 in all species similar observations were also made via sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry solid state 15n nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy of the eom and iom revealed the existence of common aliphatic and heterocyclic n groups in all samples including a dominant 2 amide peak species dependent variability was also observed in the spectra particularly in the eom e g nitro signals were found only in the cylindrospermopsis raciborskii eom dichloroacetonitrile dcan and n nitrosamine concentrations from the eom of the species evaluated in this study were lower than the guideline limits set by regulatory agencies it is proposed that the dominant 2 amide in all samples decreased n dbp formation upon chlorination for chloramination the presence of nitro groups and aliphatic and heterocyclic n dbp precursors could cause variable n nitrosamine formation compared to non algal impacted waters algae laden waters are characterised by low organic carbon organic nitrogen ratios of 7 14 and elevated don and protein concentrations hence relying only on bulk characterization increases the perceived risk of n dbp formation from algae laden waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria lc ocd mass spectrometry nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface waters impacted by algal and cyanobacterial blooms typically have elevated concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don originating from algal derived extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom li et al 2019 qin et al 2015 shah and mitch 2012 consequently don from the eom and iom has been attributed as a source of precursors for nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation fang et al 2010b goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2019b li et al 2020 pivokonsky et al 2016 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2011 algal don comprises proteins and carbohydrates the concentration and character can vary depending on the species growth phase and whether the don is sourced from the eom or iom hua et al 2019b pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2020 of the don constituents proteins can contribute up to 100 of the total algal don and are therefore considered important in the context of n dbp formation dong et al 2021 fang et al 2010b hua et al 2019b li et al 2020 2019 pivokonsky et al 2016 2014 sheng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 while there is considerable interest in exploring the link between n dbp formation and proteins in algal don the existing reports are often contradictory for instance li et al 2020 reported that the chlorinated high molecular weight hmw 50 kda eom fraction from four algal species produced higher concentrations of haloacetonitriles hans than low or medium molecular weight fractions lmw 1 kda mmw 1 50 kda attributed to higher protein concentrations in the hmw fraction than the other fractions in another study hua et al 2020 also observed that greater concentrations of n dbps were formed in the hmw fractions of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella sp upon chlorination caused by elevated protein concentrations in contrast wang et al 2021 observed that chlorinated lmw mmw eom and iom from lake taihu algal samples produced at least twice as much hans as the hmw fraction despite lower protein concentrations in the lmw mmw than the hmw fraction furthermore different n dbps have been found to form from the eom of similar algal species with similar protein concentrations for example qi et al 2016 detected several haloacetamides hams at concentrations up to 1 5 µg l 1 after chlorination of eom isolated from microcystis aeruginosa whereas goslan et al 2017 found no hams after chlorination of eom isolated from the same species even though the protein concentrations were similar for the species in both studies these examples suggest that factors beyond the conventional physicochemical bulk parameters that have been used to broadly characterise proteins need to be examined to understand why different algal species have differing n dbp formation potentials proteins have a myriad of n groups including amines amides imines enamines and n classes including aliphatic and heterocyclic n aromatic and non aromatic and these are known to contribute to a suite of n dbps upon disinfection bond et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 for instance amines act as precursors for several haloacetonitriles hans and n nitrosamines mccurry et al 2016 sfynia et al 2020 while aromatic n molecules can form a range of aromatic n dbps such as chlorophenylacetonitriles zhang et al 2019 hence a detailed algal eom and iom derived protein analysis is a prerequisite to understand how different n dbps can be formed from algal eom and iom however to date no study has conducted a detailed characterisation of the algal derived eom and iom proteins in the context of n dbp formation comprehensive algal eom and iom protein analysis has previously been limited by the analytical techniques available chu et al 2010 hua et al 2019b lee et al 2006 pivokonsky et al 2016 shah and mitch 2012 however recent research has demonstrated the potential of several advanced physicochemical and molecular techniques for detailed algal protein analysis examples of these techniques are a size distribution analysis via liquid chromatography with organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd and the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page method edokpa et al 2018 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 b molecular structures examined via solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy he et al 2015 hua et al 2017 qin et al 2015 and c individual protein profiling conducted using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms rao et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 these techniques have the potential to be used in combination to provide a comprehensive analysis of algal proteins in eom and iom fractions which could then be related to n dbp formation from algal organic matter the main aims of this study were therefore to a conduct a detailed analysis of the don specifically proteinaceous don from the eom and iom extracted from four algae and cyanobacteria chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii using a combination of lc ocnd sds page 15n nmr spectroscopy and lc hrms to understand the extent of the variability in molecular structure and b explore the relationship between the character of algal eom derived proteins and the n dbps formed from the eom of the same species published in our previous work li et al 2020 in so doing this study demonstrates for the first time that advanced molecular characterisation of algal eom and iom derived proteins can provide insight into algal derived n dbp formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cultivation three cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 01 dolichospermum circinale cs 533 02 and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs 508 hereafter referred to as ma dc and cr respectively and one green algae chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 hereafter referred to as cv were obtained from the australian national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and sub cultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised mla media for cyanobacteria and jaworski media for green algae respectively li et al 2019 additionally to enable analysis of algal don using 15n nmr spectroscopy 15n labelled species were grown in media containing 15n labelled nano3 sigma aldrich 98 based on a method previously published by li et al 2020 the 15n content was 82 4 and 98 7 of tn in the 15n labelled jaworski and mla media respectively si table s1 all experiments in this study were conducted during the stationary growth phase for cv ma and dc and late stationary growth phase for cr to ensure comparability with a prior study li et al 2020 2 2 extraction and fractionation of organic matter and the associated proteins eom extraction was conducted based on the methods used previously li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 rao et al 2018 briefly eom bulk from each species was obtained by centrifuging 50 ml of the culture at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia and filtering the supernatant using a 934 ah glass microfiber filter 0 45 μm nominal pore size whatman usa iom extraction was conducted using the freeze thawing method lee et al 2018 liu et al 2017 cells that remained post eom extraction were resuspended in 50 ml of ultrapure water conductivity 0 056 µs cm 1 resistivity 18 2 mω cm frozen at 85 c for at least 24 h before thawing in the dark at 4 c cell lysis was confirmed to be over 95 by determining the change in cell numbers in the thawed suspension using a haemocytometer and a light microscope leica icc 50 germany the removal of cell debris and iom extraction was achieved by repeating one cycle of the procedure for extracting eom the iom bulk was obtained for the three cyanobacterial species but not for the green algae cv as the algal cell walls could not be lysed by the freeze thawing method protein extraction was undertaken for each eom and iom sample using the method previously published by rao et al 2020 briefly the ice cold acetone precipitation method was used upon which the extracted bulk protein pellets were air dried prior to further analysis see si s1 2 1 for the full procedure for bulk protein extraction size fractionation of the bulk eom bulk iom and the eom and iom derived bulk protein samples 0 45 µm into hmw mmw and lmw fractions of similar volumes across the different cultures was achieved using ultrafiltration li et al 2019 the sizes of these fractions were verified using the lc ocnd system model 8 doc labor germany li et al 2019 2 3 characterization methods 2 3 1 physicochemical character of bulk and size fractionated organic matter and proteins the following analyses were conducted on the bulk eom bulk iom and the eom and iom derived bulk proteins doc was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyser japan don was measured via the tn din method where the tn was measured using a tnm 1 analyzer japan and the din was measured using the lc ocnd system li et al 2019 the doc and don of the size fractionated eom iom and the eom and iom derived proteins were determined using lc ocnd huber et al 2011 li et al 2019 additionally the size distributions of the bulk proteins were evaluated via the sds page method rao et al 2020 with further details reported in si s1 2 1 all analyzes were conducted in triplicate using different culture batches to capture both biological and experimental variability the results were expressed as a mean with one standard deviation 2 3 2 protein profiling in eom and iom derived bulk proteins the individual proteins from the eom and iom derived bulk proteins were profiled via lc hrms using an ultimate 3000 hplc dionex amsterdam netherlands coupled to an orbitrap velos hrms thermo electron germany see si s1 2 1 for full protein profiling procedure duplicate analyses were conducted using different culture batches to capture both biological and experimental variability 2 3 3 molecular characterization of eom and iom via solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy solid state 15n 1h cross polarization nmr spectroscopic experiments were carried out on eom and iom samples isolated from the 15n labelled cultures a wide bore bruker biospin avance iii solids 700 mhz spectrometer operating at a frequency of 70 and 700 mhz for the 15n and 1h nuclei respectively was used for the nmr analysis as the method required 100 mg of solid sample lyophilized bulk eom and iom samples were analyzed instead of the extracted bulk proteins the samples were analysed in either d2o or 10 d2o the full procedure is given in si s1 2 2 2 4 eom disinfection experiments in our previous study li et al 2020 we chlorinated and chloraminated the eom of the species evaluated in the current study chlorination and chloramination experiments were undertaken using free chlorine and preformed monochloramine respectively disinfection experiments were conducted at ph 7 and at 21 c in the dark for 72 h the initial mass ratio between free cl2 and algal doc was 4 1 for all the formation potential experiments by dosing 8 mg cl2 l 1 into 2 mg c l 1 doc solutions or 4 mg cl2 l 1 into 1 mg c l 1 doc solutions in order to evaluate the maximum potential for n dbp formation from the eom chlorine was added in excess and longer reaction times than that used in water treatment plants were applied the details of chlorination and chloramination experiments are described in the following sections si section s1 3 provides full details on the eom disinfection experiments in li et al 2020 we examined the formation potentials of three hans two hnms two hams and eight n nitrosamines of these only dcan was detected upon chlorination and dcan and select n nitrosamines were detected upon chloramination from all samples the n dbp measurements are provided in tables 3a and 3b 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of the organic matter and extracted proteins 3 1 1 doc and don concentrations in the bulk and size fractionated organic matter and proteins the doc and don concentrations in the bulk organic matter and bulk protein samples were 21 58 higher in the eom than in the corresponding iom si table s2 for size fractionated organic matter and protein samples the doc and don concentrations in the hmw faction were 1 2 2 6 higher in the iom than the eom for all measured species si table s2 implying that the cells retained more hmw compounds within the iom in contrast the doc and don concentrations in the mmw and lmw fractions were 1 5 9 1 higher in the eom than the iom these results are in agreement with those identified by hua et al 2019b and hua et al 2019a who observed that at least 40 of the iom derived doc and don from chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa comprised hmw compounds 30 to 100 kda the don from the bulk proteins extracted from the eom and iom contributed between 77 and 96 of the total bulk don in both eom and iom si table s2 indicating that proteins are major don contributors in the eom and iom similar results have been observed for m aeruginosa and c vulgaris where upto 90 of the doc and 100 of the don in the eom and iom was found to comprise proteins li et al 2014 pivokonsky et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 hence proteins warrant a detailed analysis in the context of n dbp formation 3 1 2 protein profiling number of proteins and protein molecular weights for all species a visual inspection of the sds page gel revealed that a greater number of individual protein bands were present in the eom than the iom proteins fig 1 similarly more individual proteins were identified by lc hrms in bulk eom than in bulk iom table 1 for eom protein bands were identified throughout the entire size range of 2 250 kda for all species fig 1 lc hrms analysis showed a greater number of proteins in the lmw 1 kda and mmw range 1 50 kda than the hmw range 50 kda table 1 with average mw in the range of 1 53 kda for all the eom samples fig s1 in contrast the protein bands from ma iom and cr iom were prominent at 30 kda only whereas those of dc iom covered the entire range fig 1 the lc hrms data revealed that the average mw for the iom samples was comparable to or marginally greater than those of the eom samples 50 63 kda cr iom 45 85 kda ma iom and 46 66 kda dc iom fig s1 these values were also slightly lower than the observations made for the iom proteins which could be due to some fragmentation during ionisation khan et al 2018 the broad mw distribution of the bulk eom protein measured in this study was similar to previously reported size distributions of 18 115 kda for c vulgaris rao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 15 to 250 kda for m aeruginosa wei et al 2016 yamada et al 2012 and 5 110 kda for c raciborskii neilan et al 2003 plominsky et al 2009 the relatively narrow size distributions for bulk iom proteins measured by sds page in this study contrast with previous studies of bulk iom proteins where broad sds page size distributions of 1 150 kda were reported fang et al 2010b takaara et al 2007 yoshida et al 2014 nonetheless hua et al 2019a reported that the protein rich iom extracted from chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa predominantly comprised proteinaceous molecules that were 30 kda which is similar to the mw distribution of the iom derived proteins reported in this study the observed differences are likely due to the varying character of individual proteins between different strains of the same species rao et al 2020 soni et al 2008 protein band intensities and relative abundance visually the sds page protein band intensities indicative of concentration for bulk eom proteins were more intense in the mmw range than the hmw range the lmw region was not visible whereas the bulk iom proteins except dc iom were more intense in the hmw range than the mmw range fig 1 for example the most intense bands in the bulk ma eom protein were at 37 20 10 kda while the most intense bands in the bulk ma iom protein were at 150 and 50 100 kda fig 1 the sds page protein band intensities for the bulk ma iom protein in this study are consistent with previous reports of strong bands in hmw regions of 50 kda for m aeruginosa nies 298 yoshida et al 2014 and 43 94 kda for m aeruginosa nies 91 takaara et al 2007 the patterns in protein band intensities from sds page also agreed with the previously described distribution of doc and don in different protein size fractions specifically that doc and don concentrations in the hmw faction were always higher for iom than eom si table s2 the aforementioned protein band intensities for different size fractions of eom and iom were supported by the exponentially modified protein abundance index empai values obtained from lc hrms analysis table 1 the empai value is a relative quantification of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins and is calculated based on the peptide matches in the uniprot database search result the empai value of a specific protein is considered to be proportional to the abundance of that protein see si s1 2 1 for further details ishihama et al 2005 for eom derived bulk proteins the average empai for the combined lmw mmw range was at least 4 higher than the hmw range for all species table 1 this demonstrates that the relative abundance of hmw proteins in the bulk eom proteins was low table 1 as supported by the low band intensities in the 50 kda regions of the eom bands in the gel fig 1 in contrast to the eom protein empai the average empai for the iom proteins in the hmw range was 1 1 2 0 higher than the combined lmw mmw range table 1 collectively the empai values and protein band intensities from sds page indicate that the algal species in this study mainly retained proteins 50 kda within cells in the iom 3 2 evaluating individual protein character in the eom and iom size fractions the proteins identified by lc hrms from the size fractionated eom and iom proteins were classified into different functional categories photosynthesis and respiration biosynthesis energy and metabolism transcription cell envelope transport and cell division processes rao et al 2020 overall the distribution of empai or protein abundance between different functional categories in each mw fraction share of each functional category among all functional categories in a particular mw fraction varied depending on the species however certain functional categories were dominant fig s2 for example proteins associated with biosynthesis 4 47 and photosynthesis and respiration 0 63 processes had the highest empai values up to 77 combined out of the total empai in each fraction followed by proteins associated with energy and metabolism 9 61 and other categories 1 19 each fig s2 analysis of the distribution of empai of each functional category between different mw fractions share of each mw fraction out of the total empai of a particular protein category revealed similarities with the protein empai in each mw fraction observed in table 1 higher empai values were in the lmw and mmw fractions for the bulk eom proteins and in the hmw fraction for bulk iom proteins in most functional categories fig s3 altogether the analysis of the functional character of the proteins suggests that the proteins associated with photosynthesis and respiration biosynthesis and energy and metabolism processes were the most abundant proteins in all bulk proteins which was also consistent with a previous study rao et al 2020 and that the concentrations of these proteins were greatest in the lmw mmw fraction of the eom and hmw fraction of the iom in all species 3 3 identification of n classes and n groups in extracellular and intracellular organic matter all solid state 15n nmr spectra had 50 n signals within four distinct chemical shift ranges 180 140 ppm 119 90 ppm 85 41 ppm and 35 0 ppm table 2 and figs 2 3 signals within these four chemical shift ranges were observed in all species across both eom and iom except for cr eom which did not have any signals in the 180 140 ppm range table 2 and figs 2 3 instead a fifth chemical shift range between 450 and 240 ppm was observed for cr eom where additional n signals were found table 2 and fig 2 the n signals in the five chemical shift ranges covered a broad spectrum of n atoms in organic matter including aliphatic n aromatic n non aromatic heterocyclic n and nine unique n functional groups 1 2 and 3 amines imines enamines 1 and 2 amides imides nitro table 2 fang et al 2011 kasaai 2010 mao et al 2017 mao et al 2007 repeta 2015 thorn and cox 2009 common signals at 119 ppm 2 amide 85 75 and between 65 and 41 ppm amines enamines and amino acids were observed in all species table 2 and figs 2 3 of these the predominant signal was observed at 119 ppm indicating that the don in eom and iom from all species was primarily present as 2 amide in the form of peptide bonds that link amino acids in peptides and proteins mao et al 2007 thorn and cox 2009 2016 similar findings of dominant amide linkages have been observed in the eom and iom of chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa via carbon nmr and xps analysis indicating that peptide bonds are prevalent in the algal organic matter hua et al 2017 some studies have suggested that the 2 amide signal could also belong to n acetyl amino sugars which are common constituents of bacterial carbohydrates aluwihare et al 2005 mao et al 2007 however given that a majority of the don was of proteinaceous origin and that amino sugars were only detected in cv eom in trace amounts previously rao et al 2020 it is more likely that the dominant 2 amide signal results from the protein content it is also suggested that the n signals from 110 to 35 ppm which are attributed to 1 amide aliphatic amines enamines anilines piperidines and amino acids belonged to the proteinaceous matter present in the samples this is because the same signals were previously identified as belonging to proteins and polypeptides by mao et al 2007 when analyzing algal material extracted from a natural lake furthermore these signals were confirmed to be of proteinaceous origin by thorn and cox 2009 who also identified distinct signals for anilines 61 ppm amines 34 36 ppm and amino acids 32 ppm when analyzing a range of suwannee river soil and water samples in the current study spectral overlap prevented more specific identification of the signals species dependent variability was largely absent in the solid state 15n nmr spectra from the iom samples table 2 and fig 3 however differences between the solid state 15n nmr spectra from the eom samples were observed for example within the 180 140 ppm chemical shift range in the eom samples dc had a total of four signals table 2 and fig 2 likely comprising proteinaceous pyrroles 147 ppm also indicated by the presence of tryptophan khan et al 2019 the imide n or lactam n of nucleotide bases 178 170 ppm and the side chains of amino acids including tryptophan arginine and histidine 158 147 ppm fang et al 2011 lankes and lüdemann 2007 mao et al 2017 2007 repeta 2015 thorn and cox 2009 the tryptophan arginine and histidine peaks have been also identified via carbon nmr and xps analysis in the iom of chlorella sp and m aeruginosa previously hua et al 2017 in contrast the eom of cv ma and cr all had fewer proteinaceous n signals within the same chemical shift range fig 2 such discrepancies were also observed in the other chemical shift ranges e g nitro signals were found only in cr eom and there was an absence or possible overlap of 110 ppm signals in all samples except cr eom and cv eom table 2 and figs 2 3 the nmr results indicate that the presence of proteinaceous n particularly in the eom can vary widely depending on the species profiled resulting in don variability across species 3 4 linking algal don character to n dbp formation potential upon chlorination and chloramination 3 4 1 formation potential of dcan and n nitrosamines upon chlorination in our previous study li et al 2020 we observed that the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile dcan formed upon chlorination of cr eom and cv eom from the same species evaluated in this study were greater in the 1 kda fraction referred to as hmw in li et al 2020 than in the lmw fraction 1 kda table 3a this could be because 70 of the don in the eom of these species was present in the 1 kda fraction si table s2 by contrast ma eom and dc eom had comparable or marginally greater dcan formation in the lmw 1 kda fraction even though the don concentrations in that fraction were 20 of the total ma and dc eom don si table s2 this implies that bulk don measurements cannot reliably estimate n dbp formation potential thereby suggesting that advanced don characterization is necessary to understand n dbp formation evaluation of dcan formation based on functional protein character analysis of the functional protein character revealed that the proteins i e n groups in proteins involved in the photosynthesis and respiration and the biosynthesis processes likely caused the elevated concentrations of dcan in the 1 kda fraction in cr eom and cv eom because these proteins had up to 70 empai distribution share of each functional category among all functional protein categories in a particular mw fraction in the 1 kda fraction si fig s2 while 60 empai distributions were also observed for the same functional categories in the 1 kda fraction it is to be noted that the percentage empai of these proteins across the different mw fractions share of each mw fraction out of the total empai of a particular functional category was the lowest 22 in the 1 kda fraction in cr eom and cv eom si fig s3 similar observations were also made in ma eom and dc eom si figs s2 and s3 despite the fact that the dcan formation in the 1 kda fraction was comparable to or marginally greater than the dcan formation in the 1 kda fraction in these species table 3a this suggests that unlike cv eom and cr eom the proteins i e n groups involved in the biosynthesis and photosynthesis and respiration processes in the 1 kda and 1 kda fractions of ma and dc eom were equally available and conducive to react with chlorine to form dcan hence understanding the influence of n groups is critical for gaining insight into n dbp formation from algal impacted waters insight into dcan formation from reactivity of amides with chlorine li et al 2020 noted that no n nitrosamines were detected post chlorination of the eom samples characterised in this study and that the dcan concentrations from all eom were below the guideline limits prescribed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 these observations were likely due to the significant presence of amide n relative to other n groups although not quantified the 2⁰ amide linkages are represented by the predominant signal at 119 ppm in the 15n nmr spectra figs 2 and 3 because amides are less reactive with chlorine than other n groups such as amines and typically result in a lower n dbp formation potential for example chlorination of dimethylformamide and diuron formed ndma at 0 3 molar yields compared to trimethylamine which produced a molar yield of 2 5 shah and mitch 2012 similarly other studies have also consistently shown that molar dcan yields from chlorination of amides 0 01 0 5 for at least 24 h at ph 7 were lower than from chlorination of various primary secondary and tertiary amines 0 9 11 bond et al 2014 ding et al 2018 sfynia et al 2020 the low reactivity of amides with chlorine compared to other n groups may be because a 70 200 molar excess of cl2 n is needed for reaction with amides while the molar ratio of cl2 n is typically between 1 and 30 during chlorination mccurry et al 2016 shah and mitch 2012 and b the adjacent electron withdrawing strength from the amide carbonyl group deactivates the amide n towards electrophilic substitution or attack by cl2 mccurry et al 2016 sfynia et al 2020 hence the varying proportions of amides low reactivity and other groups with high reactivity with chlorine e g amines that are present in the proteins could be responsible for the differing formation of dcan upon chlorination of the species evaluated in this study 3 4 2 formation potential of dcan and n nitrosamines during chloramination in our previous study it was observed that the eom from the species evaluated in this study was not a major source of precursors for dcan formed upon chloramination because 73 of the n in dcan was sourced from the monochloramine disinfectant li et al 2020 in the case of n nitrosamines which have two n atoms it is known that one n atom is sourced from the monochloramine and the other from the algal don bond et al 2012 for the species evaluated in this study several types of n nitrosamines were formed in differing proportions data from li et al 2020 presented in table 3b these observations will be explored in the following sections elevated formation of n nitrosamines in cr eom despite cr eom having the lowest don concentration as measured in this study si table s2 li et al 2020 observed that cr eom produced the highest concentration of all n nitrosamines table 3b furthermore cr eom was also found to have the greatest proportion of 15n from 15n labelled eom incorporated into ndma li et al 2020 implying that the n in cr eom was most conducive to n nitrosamine formation upon chloramination this is attributed to the presence of nitro groups in cr eom as identified in the solid state 15n nmr spectra that were absent in other samples fig 2 and table 2 nitro compounds including nitromethane 1 phenyl nitromethane and tetranitromethane have been reported to react with primary secondary and tertiary amines over prolonged exposure 48 h to form ndma n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosomorpholine nmor at yields of 1 5 lópez rodríguez et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 hence it is possible that the nitro groups in cr eom contributed towards the elevated n nitrosamine concentrations reported in li et al 2020 another reason for the elevated concentrations of n nitrosamines in cr eom could be that the moieties adjacent to the n groups in cr eom promoted n nitrosamine formation compared to the moieties adjacent to the n groups in the eom from other species for example while isoleucine and aspartic acid are both aliphatic amino acids with an α primary amine functional group aspartic acid has another carboxylic acid electron withdrawing group on the terminal side resulting in the formation of differing n dbps at varying concentrations upon chloramination shah and mitch 2012 hence further research on the effect of moieties adjacent to n groups on their reactivity for n nitrosamine formation and the reactions of nitro groups in eom with amines to form n nitrosamines is recommended formation of aliphatic and heterocyclic n nitrosamines upon chloramination of eom in all species chloramination resulted in the formation of n nitrosamines with both aliphatic and heterocyclic structures table 3b the detection of several proteins section 3 2 and amines table 2 indicate the presence of long c chain amines r1 nh r2 which are precursor structures for aliphatic n nitrosamines precursor structures for the heterocyclic n nitrosamines including piperidine and aniline were also likely present even though 15n nmr spectral overlap prevented further identification table 2 and fig 2 the variable formation of n nitrosamines observed for each species table 3b indicates a differing concentrations of n groups or b occurrence of ring opening similar to that observed when forming haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles upon chloramination liu et al 2020 or c moieties adjacent to the n groups impacting n dbp formation 3 4 3 formation of n dbps other than hans and n nitrosamines in our previous study li et al 2020 we examined the formation potential of three hans two hnms two hams and eight n nitrosamines of these only dcan was detected upon chlorination and dcan and select n nitrosamines were detected upon chloramination from all samples while hams and hnms were not detected in our study they have been regularly detected in other studies one reason for this could be due to the shorter duration of disinfection used in our study 72 h compared to the longer disinfection times of up to 168 h employed in other studies for instance hua et al 2020 observed elevated formation of tcnm and tcm when chlorinating the eom of chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa for 168 h similar observations were also made by goslan et al 2017 who chlorinated the eom for 168 h and reported the formation of tcnm from five species of cyanobacteria and diatoms previously fang et al 2010a reported that tcm and tcnm formation increased with increasing chlorination times from 0 to 168 h suggesting that the lack of tcm and tcnm formation from the eom of the species evaluated in this study was likely caused by the short disinfection time applied in our previous study despite the presence of amine and amide moieties no hams were detected from the chlorination or chloramination of the eom of any of the species in our previous study this may be because proteinaceous don moieties in algal organic matter are predominantly hydrophobic pivokonsky et al 2016 and thus could be less susceptible to the formation of hams previous research has suggested that hydrophilic aromatic nitrogen favors formation of hams such as dichloroacetamide shah and mitch 2012 secondly hams can also be formed as derivatives of hans e g dichloroacetamide can form from dcan implying that longer disinfection times than those applied in our previous study would be required to form hams from hans chu et al 2016 chu et al 2010 finally the lack of hams formation could be attributed to the depressed reactivity of amides discussed earlier in section 3 4 1 2 overall this is another reminder that n dbp formation is sensitive towards reaction conditions as well as don moieties across species 3 4 4 formation of iom derived n dbps upon chlorination and chloramination in this study the formation of eom derived n dbps was primarily investigated because the ultimate goal of algal treatment is to inactivate the cells without damaging the cell membrane to prevent the release of undesirable metabolites that may be present within the cells while the iom derived n dbps were not analyzed in our previous study the don characterization results from this current study inform n dbp formation from the iom for instance the bulk don concentrations measured in iom were lower than in eom table s2 additionally there were fewer iom derived proteins and they were less abundant compared to eom derived proteins fig 1 and table 1 this would suggest that for the algal species evaluated in this study fewer n dbps would form from iom than from eom and at lower concentrations however this conclusion is in contrast to previous findings for chlorella sp and microcystis aeruginosa where the iom formed more n dbps than the eom and at higher concentrations because the iom was richer in aromatic and hydrophilic protein like materials than the eom hua et al 2020 2017 the formation of n dbps will be controlled by functional groups present in the don as well as factors such as steric hindrance shielding of the functional groups and the rate at which the disinfectant breaks down long chain versus short chain molecules shah and mitch 2012 further analysis via iom disinfection experiments is necessary to confirm the n dbp formation potential of the iom of the species evaluated in this study 3 5 algal derived vs non algal derived don in surface waters implications for n dbp formation potential upon chlorination and chloramination the bulk eom and iom examined in this study were found to have a c n of 7 14 and don concentrations of 0 5 1 2 mg n l 1 proteinaceous don comprised 77 96 of the total don si table s2 which was in line with prior observations of proteinaceous don comprising up to 100 of total don depressed uv absorbance values and low c n ratios of 4 for similar algal cultures hua et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2016 2014 yao et al 2020 the prevalence of proteinaceous don was further supported by the dominant 15n nmr signal at 119 ppm across species which represents 2⁰ amide linkages in amino acids and peptides section 3 3 similar to algal don the natural organic matter nom derived don from non algal impacted surface waters is dominated by proteins peptides and free amino acids krasner et al 2013 lee et al 2006 however the nom derived don has lower concentrations typically 0 3 mg n l 1 and the c n is usually 18 with a likely elevated uv absorbance despite spatial and temporal variance because the nom derived doc has greater heterogeneity than algal doc in the form of carbonaceous humic and fulvic substances chen et al 2015 dotson and westerhoff 2009 hua et al 2020 mitch et al 2009 the n signals identified in the algal samples via the nmr analysis in this study have also been observed in surface water nom lankes et al 2008 thorn and cox 2012 venel et al 2021 however unlike algal om multiple strong signals representing a range of amines 35 95 ppm primary and secondary amides 110 130 ppm and pyrroles and side chains of histidine and arginine 135 180 ppm have been observed in nom indicating that don from nom has comparable concentrations of a variety of n compounds thorn and cox 2012 venel et al 2021 overall these observations suggest that while proteinaceous n is a dominant constituent of algal and nom derived don low c n ratios and high don concentrations are characteristics of algal impacted waters hence the expectation is that algal impacted water sources would result in greater n dbp formation during disinfection than non impacted waters however this study demonstrates that relying only on don concentrations or even total protein concentrations increases the perceived risk of n dbp formation thereby potentially misleading water utilities into enforcing risk management measures thus an understanding of the molecular structures that make up the don pool is recommended to better infer n dbp formation potential in algal impacted waters 5 conclusions the main aims of this paper were to understand the degree of variability of don specifically proteinaceous don at a molecular level in the eom and iom extracted from four algal and cyanobacterial species and relate them to n dbp formation multiple techniques were employed to profile the don in respect to both physiochemical character and molecular structures the following conclusions were obtained proteinaceous don contributed between 77 and 96 of bulk don in the eom and iom for all species more proteins were observed in algal eom than iom based on sds page and lc hrms analysis bulk eom proteins generally had greater intensities indicating elevated concentrations in the lmw mmw range 0 50 kda compared to the hmw range 50 kda this was in contrast for the corresponding bulk iom proteins in which greater intensities were observed in the hmw range compared to the lmw mmw range solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy signals which could be attributable to 2 amides amines pyrroles enamines and amino acids were observed in the spectra from the eom and iom samples of all species of these the 2 amide signal at 119 ppm was predominant in all samples solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy gave a consistent response for iom but not for eom where the spectrum from cr eom had signals between 450 and 240 ppm attributable to nitro groups which were absent in the spectra from the other samples it is proposed that the strong 2 amide presence in all species as evidenced by solid state 15n nmr spectroscopy resulted in lower concentrations of n dbps upon chlorination relative to guideline limits prescribed by regulatory agencies because amides are less reactive with chlorine compared to other n groups such as amines in the case of chloramination it is suggested that the presence of nitro groups and the availability of aliphatic and heterocyclic n groups in the don could cause differing n nitrosamine formation across species algae laden waters are characterized by low c n ratios and high don and protein concentrations this study demonstrates that relying only on don concentrations or even total protein concentrations might result in an increased perceived risk of n dbp formation for water utilities hence developing an understanding of the molecular structures of the don is required to better evaluate n dbp formation potential further research on the effect of moieties adjacent to n
